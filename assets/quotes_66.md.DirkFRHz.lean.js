A ground was loaned by a local milkman named Mr Soper adjacent to the reservoirs at Lee Valley. Members of the club then built a changing building with two changing rooms, plunge bath and water heating stove. A double Decker bus was acquired for the spectators and the players washed in a local piggery. In 1930 the club was renamed Chingford Rugby Club and in 1945 the club was reformed using an old army hut. The original building had been destroyed during the 2nd World War on VE night. This hut was used until 1947 when the ‚ÄúRendezvous Caf√©‚Äù was used for changing. During the fifties the club moved to its previous site. The clubhouse was extended in 1960, again in 1968, and finally in 2012 by contributors to it present size.

He is also known as El Menea√≠to or El Mene√≠to. He is best known for his 1992 single \\"Menea√≠to\\" which was a major hit record throughout South and Central America. Gaby left the music scene in 1998. However, he made a return in 2016. Gaby currently resides in Atlanta. Early life Gaby was born on October 3, 1965, in R√≠o Abajo, a corregimiento within the city of Panama City, Panama. Gaby also has two other siblings. His parents' occupations had a strong influence over the paths Gaby took in life. His father was a professional baseball player and made it to the Triple A Houston Astros. His mother worked in a music store in Panama called Palacio Musical. Gaby also played baseball, as well as soccer, throughout his teenage years. This culminated in him being the captain of his high school soccer team while attending Instituto T√©cnico Don Bosco. Gaby also spent a lot of time at work with his mother which exposed him to a wide array of new music on a regular basis. He, along with many other Panamanian youth, was exposed to Jamaican reggae and dancehall artists like Buju Banton, Red Dragon , and Yellowman who were chanting and singing over instrumentals called riddims. After high school, Gaby majored in graphic design for three years at the Universidad de Panam√° before leaving school to begin his music career. Career Gaby, as well as many other Panamanian musicians of the day, found inspiration in local artists like Renato who were performing lyrics in espa√±ol over Jamaican riddims. This style of music, birthed in Panama, was called Reggae en Espa√±ol and paved the way for Reggaeton. Gaby, and his partner Orlando Lindsay, teamed up for several music- based hustles. They started out hosting parties with Orlando as the DJ and Gaby as the rapper. They used a similar template as the popular local artists in that Orlando would play the instrumental riddims of popular records by Jamaican artists and Gaby freestyled in espa√±ol over the top. Gaby and Orlando eventually established a mobile disco called SOS (Super Original Sound) and host picnics at parks during the nighttime called \\"paseo nocturnos\\". Gaby and Orlando utilized a unique marketing campaign to generate interest in the picnics. In 1987, Gaby formed a local group called \\"Sweet Edition\\". The group released their self-titled first album with Tamayo Records in 1987. This album contained the original version of \\"El Mene√≠to\\". It was originally recorded over the \\"Duck Riddim\\" by the Jamaican record producer, King Jammy. Sweet Edition released a second album called DURO DE MATAR in 1989, but found their music careers disrupted by the United States invasion of Panama. In 1990, Tamayo Records released \\"El Mene√≠to\\" to other countries through the Colombian label \\"Discos Fuentes\\". The song was placed on a compilation that included Latin music such as salsa, merengue and Colombian cumbia. The song became a massive success all throughout South America and Hispanic communities in North America. It spent 11 months as the number one song in Venezuela without Gaby being aware that his record had become a hit. Gaby was introduced to the Colombian cumbia act, Binomio de Oro de Am√©rica. Gaby met Luis Phillips and he convinced Gaby to join with other Reggae en Espa√±ol artists to do a posse cut called \\"Las 4 Potencias Del Reggae\\". It featured Gaby, Jam & Suppose, Reggae Sam, and Renato. The group found success and became music ambassadors for Panama. They recorded a compilation album together called INDESTRUCTIBLES 100%. The album was recorded, and produced by Gary H Mason aka: Big Daddy G in the United States at Lazur Studios, and Engineered by Patrick Giraudi. The vocals were recorded in Panama but all the original instrumentation was produced and recorded by Big Daddy G. in the United States. It was distributed internationally by BMG. This album included newly created and recorded instrumentation and newly created and recorded lyrics of the song entitled \\"El Menea√≠to\\". This was Gaby's first international hit. The music video ‚ÄúEl Meneaito‚Äù produced and directed by Gary Mason went on to become a major worldwide hit. Gaby, and the rest of the crew, toured extensively throughout South and Central America for years afterwards. weet Edition would win the Premios Ronda award in Venezuela. Comeback In 1995, the relationship between Gaby and his manager, Luis, deteriorated to the point that they were no longer able to work together. Despite his best efforts, Gaby was unable to rebuild the same level of momentum from previous years and was unable to support himself, or his family, as a musician. In 1998, Gaby moved with his family to Germany to make a fresh start. In Germany, he worked as a personal trainer, circling back to the athletic ways of his youth. He remained in Germany for nine years. He moved to Las Vegas in 2007 and worked at the Trump Hotel. Gaby made intermittent attempts to do music again, but did not become serious about performing until 2016. He received a phone call from a friend from Panama named Alberto Smith. Alberto informed Gaby that the Panama Urban Music Awards wanted to present him with a Lifetime Achievement Award. Gaby was dealing with the loss of his father and the end of his marriage. Gaby attended the Panama Urban Music Awards and was pleasantly surprised to find that he was remembered as an icon of Panamanian urban music. He returned to reintroduce himself to the Panamanian audience. Alberto also introduced him to Maesa Mazur. Maesa, an urban artist in Ecuador, brought him to Ecuador where he found a receptive audience. Gaby has recorded and released several new singles, made a number of recent media appearances, and has done a number of live performances since 2016. Confusion between Gaby and El General Because they are both from Rio Abajo, are both a part of the same generation of Reggae en Espa√±ol artists, and El General is considered the international face for Panamanian Reggae music, there has been a bit of confusion as to which of them is the author of \\"El Menea√≠to\\".

The team was founded in 2018, however despite big ambitions the team ceased trading less than two years later, during the 2019‚Äì20 season. History The team was established in July 2018 by businessman Jon Sawyer and London-based basketball promoter Nhamo Shire, founder of the London School of Basketball. Following the withdrawal of Leeds Force earlier in the summer, the Royals became the 12th member of the league and the second London-based franchise along with London Lions, with the Royals being based at Lions' former home venue, the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre. In its inaugural season, the Royals invested heavily in a playing roster that included Great Britain internationals Matthew Bryan- Amaning and Ashley Hamilton. The team, led by former BBL player Jay Williams, secured their first silverware early in the club's fledgling existence, winning the BBL Trophy after defeating city rivals London Lions 90‚Äì82 in the first ever BBL final to be decided after overtime. Overall, the star-studded team's fortunes were mixed, with a 1st Round Cup exit to lowly Worcester and a 4th-place finish and above-500 record in the league, before losing out comfortably in the Playoff final to Leicester. The club announced midway through the 2019‚Äì20 season it would cease to operate with immediate effect, pending liquidation.

History Sources disagree with each other (and sometimes within themselves) over historical details, and are not easy to reconcile. There seems to have been some sort of stronghold on the site from the 10th or 11th century. The date of construction of Cisy Castle is uncertain. So too is its date of first historical mention; for which sources variously say 1240, 1243, 1264, and 1327. According to some accounts, construction was begun under Bolko I the Strict (1252/56 - 1301) of the house of Piast, and was completed under his grandson Bolko II the Small ( ‚Äì 1368). According to another account, in 1355 Bolko II captured the castle from robber knights. According to a yet another account, the castle was built by Bolko I at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, it was captured by robber knights, and it was subsequently recaptured by Bolko II. Its purpose was similar to those of the castles at , Grodno, , and : to guard the western borders of the Piast dukedoms of ≈öwidnica and Jawor. The castle achieved its greatest fame during the late 14th century, when Nikel Bolcze, castellan of Strzegom, lived there, and was often visited by Agnes (1322-1392), widow of Bolko II, who had inherited the castle from him. The castle next passed into Bohemian ownership. As already mentioned, sources are conflicting. (1) According to one account, ownership of the castle passed by prior agreement after the deaths of Nikel and of Agnes to new but unidentified owners, who enlarged it. In 1428, the castle was occupied by the Hussites during their unsuccessful struggle for religious freedom (1419-1434). It was subsequently occupied by robber knights. In 1484, they were expelled and the castle was destroyed. In the 16th century, ownership passed to the wealthy . During the Thirty Years War (1618-1648), the castle was burnt by Swedish troops during their intervention in that conflict. (2) According to another account, ownership passed by unspecified means. The castle was successively occupied by various families; namely, Zeispercek, A. von Grunau and Czettritz, and was further enlarged. (3) According to yet another account, in 1408 the castle was bought by Alexander von Grunau, and in 1429 by Ulrich . In 1466, the castle was severely damaged by Hussite troops.A questionable statement. The Hussites had been suppressed in 1434. It is conjectured that it was later repaired and improved. The castle was damaged again by Swedish troops during the Thirty Years War. It was subsequently (i.e. not earlier than the 17th century) taken over by the Czettritz family. (4) According to another account still, after Agnes' death the castle became the property of the king of Bohemia, who passed it in succession to two knightly families, von Grunau and von Czettritz. The castle was damaged during the Hussite Wars. It was subsequently repaired and strengthened. In 1643, Swedish troops destroyed it. After the end of the Thirty Years War, the Czettritz family reclaimed the castle, but did not repair it. Stones were removed and used in other buildings. Later accounts also are not easy to reconcile. (1) According to one account, in 1794-1797 Jan Henryk VI von Hochberg commissioned architect Christian Tischbein to rebuild the ruins in an antique style appropriate to his castle of Nowy Dw√≥r. (2) According to another account, the castle was abandoned around 1800. (3) According to still another account, authorities at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries ordered that the castle be destroyed. (4) According to yet another account, the castle fell into ruin over the years as stones were taken away and used elsewhere. In 1830, what was left of the castle passed to the von Zieten family. Some preservation and reconstruction work was carried out during the 19th century and between the World Wars. Those efforts were destroyed during fighting in 1945 towards the end of World War II. There have been more recent attempts to preserve the site, and to promote it as a tourist attraction. Description The castle was built of local sandstone. Its walls were irregular, and were adapted to the hillside terrain. The original design seems to have included a fortified western entrance and a more-or-less square surrounding wall, with a circular Bergfried about in diameter in the southeastern corner; as well as a residential building at least two storeys in height in the opposite corner. Further military elements were added later. It was protected by a dry moat. The best preserved parts are the tower, fragments of the wall, remains of the gate, and a part of one of the residential buildings.

Life Hacheza was a member of the House of Ascania. Her parents are sometimes said to have been Adalbert of Ballenstedt and Hidda, daughter of Margrave Odo I of the Saxon Eastern March, although there is no direct evidence for this.Feicker 2012, p.16 If so, Hacheza had at least two siblings: Esico of Ballenstedt, Uta von Ballenstedt, who married Margrave Eckhard II of Meissen.Feicker 2012, p.15 She may have also had two other brothers, Ludolf, who became a monk at Corvey, and Dietrich, provost of Ballenstedt.Schlenker, Kloster Ballenstedt, pp. 29-30. Esico‚Äôs great-grandson, Albert the Bear, is the first documented advocate of the abbey of Gernrode. From this point onwards, until the dissolution of the abbey, members of the Askanier dynasty held the advocacy of Gernrode. Hacheza was the successor of Abbess Adelaide I. Under her rule, the abbey increased its possessions through many donations. According to the 'Annals of Gernrode' (Annales Gernrodensis), written by the chronicler Andreas Popperodt in the sixteenth century, Hacheza was abbess of Gernrode for nineteen years. She is, however, only attested as abbess in two imperial diplomas from February 1044Bresslau and Kehr, Urkunden Heinrichs III., no. 121 (21 Feb 1044). and February 1046.Bresslau and Kehr, Urkunden Heinrichs III., no. 150 (19 Feb 1046). Hacheza‚Äôs brother-in-law, Eckhard II of Meissen, also made a large donation to Gernrode before his death, because his marriage to Hacheza‚Äôs sister, Uta, had remained childless. Eckhard‚Äôs donation was confirmed by Henry III in February 1046. The donation included property in Gundersleve, in Westerhausen, where Gernrode already had possessions, and in Wendhusen, now in the district of Thale, as well as abandoned villages near Wegeleben, in Mordorf and Richbrechtigerode, both near Blankenburg, and Egihardingerode and Dorbonrod, whose modern locations are unknown.Hartung, Zur Vergangenheit von Gernrode, p. 46.

It stars Rob Lowe and Kristin Davis. The film was released on November 1, 2019, by Netflix. Plot After their son Luke leaves for college, Kate Conrad surprises her husband Drew with a second honeymoon to Zambia. Drew confesses that he is no longer in love with her and was waiting for their son to go to college before ending the marriage. Kate decides to go on the trip alone. At dinner that evening, a man at the bar, Derek, notices her and strikes up a conversation with her. Kate irritably confesses her situation and then leaves in a huff. The next day, Kate arrives for a chartered flight to her next resort, only to find Derek is the pilot. During the flight, Derek unexpectedly lands the plane in the wild. They discover a traumatized baby elephant whose mother has been killed by poachers. Kate is intrigued by the elephant and when the rescue team arrives, Kate offers her services. At the sanctuary, Kate meets Derek's South African girlfriend, Leslie, who is part of the foundation that funds the sanctuary. She forms a special bond with the elephant she and Derek found, and Derek's friend Jonathan suggests the name ‚ÄúManu‚Äù, which means ‚Äúsecond son‚Äù. Kate extends her stay, even celebrating the Christmas season at the sanctuary. Her relationship with Derek deepens as they talk about their previous lives. But Kate is upset when she receives divorce papers from Drew at the Sanctuary. Luke comes to the sanctuary for Christmas and confesses he is unhappy in his business course; he wants to be a musician. Kate discourages him from this. Leslie is angered when she discovers a portrait of Kate that Derek drew. Leslie asks Derek to go away with her, but he refuses and breaks up with her. She retorts that the board will cut funding for the sanctuary. Kate finally returns to New York, where she takes a job as a vet. She convinces her son to continue in college, but to study music. On New Year's Eve, Kate calls Jonathan, and he relays that the sanctuary cannot continue operating much longer due to the cut in funding. Kate begins a fundraising campaign by asking for help from her friends and ex-husband, and also sells her jewelry and other things. The fundraising is successful and the sanctuary stays afloat. After visits from pampered pets, Kate realizes her job as a vet in New York is not fulfilling her, so she sells her apartment then buys a one- way ticket back to Zambia to be with Derek and the elephants. Kate and Derek get married. When the day comes to release Manu back to the wild with other elephants, Derek and Kate tearfully say goodbye.

It stars Rob Lowe and Kristin Davis. Filming was to take place in Hoedspruit and Drakensberg, and on sets in and around Cape Town. Principal photography began in June 2018. The elephant scenes were filmed at a sanctuary in South Africa, and at Game Rangers International Elephant Orphanage in Lusaka, Zambia. Huge efforts and systems were in place to safeguard the elephants, including a focused behaviour study, personnel and distance restrictions, and international animal welfare inspectors. Due to GRI's strict elephant management protocols and minimal impact policies, and in alignment with Netflix's high animal welfare standards, it became apparent that a ‚Äòbody double‚Äô would be required for the majority of filming, and Netflix invested hugely in ensuring that the puppets required were the spitting image of the real-life orphaned elephant Mkaliva!‚Å£‚Å£ Mkaliva was rescued by GRI and the Department of National Parks & Wildlife in Zambia in August 2017. Her story closely aligns with that portrayed in the film, as both elephants experienced the same physical and emotional traumas when losing their mothers and herd.

It is also known as the CML Building. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  It was designed by Hennessy, Hennessy & Co. and built by Concrete Constructions Ltd. The design was for a two-storey building, built in brick and reinforced concrete, featuring a large shop on the corner of Auburn and Clifford Streets with access to the banking chamber and professional offices on the remainder of the ground floor, with further offices and a dental suite on the first floor and a clock tower at the corner of the building. In addition to the Colonial Mutual Life offices, it also included a branch of the Bank of New South Wales. The work was described as a \\"reconstruction\\" of the former Australian Bank of Commerce premises which had previously occupied the site. The Colonial Mutual Life office operated out of the building until it closed in 1979. In 2017, the building received $35,000 in heritage funding for patching and repainting of the building's exterior and a disability access upgrade.

Thirty-five people were injured, most of whom were British tourists. Attack The bomb was planted in a rubbish bin in the passenger terminal of Reus Airport. The ETA gave telephone warnings just five minutes before detonation, meaning police did not have enough time to evacuate the terminal. Most of the wounded were British holidaymakers waiting for their flights home. Despite the high casualty rate, the bombs caused only minor structural damage to the airport. A Spanish cleaner, Isabel Montiel Lorenzo, was the most injured as she was right next to the bin. Bombs were also planted at two hotels nearby, in Cambrils and Salou. These were also busy with British tourists. The hotels were evacuated and the bombs safely defused in controlled explosions. The attack came amid a stepped-up campaign against tourist targets from the ETA in its insurgency against the Spanish government. Aftermath The attack raised fears for the safety of Spain's tourist economy. The Spanish state tightened security as a result of the bombing. Extra security personnel were added to airports and additional police patrols to the country's popular touristic beaches.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades Range. The Needles is situated on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Tower Mountain, to the southwest. Climate The Needles is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. The Needles seen from Wallaby Peak As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The Needles seen from Slate Peak The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. The Needles is carved mostly from granite of the Golden Horn batholith. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

He is signed to Broken Bow Records imprint Stoney Creek, for which he has released the two singles \\"Best Shot\\" and \\"Make Me Want To\\" and the 2018 album Mercury Lane. Biography Allen was born in Milton, Delaware, United States, but moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 2007. During most of his first few years in Nashville, he experienced poverty and often lived out of his car. Allen auditioned for America's Got Talent, but did not make it past the preliminary auditions. He also auditioned for the tenth season of American Idol, but was cut before the live voting rounds. While on American Idol, he performed with Colton Dixon during one of the group rounds and befriended Scotty McCreery, who eventually won the competition that year. Allen and McCreery later reconnected and toured together after the release of Allen's debut album. Allen signed a publishing deal with Wide Open Music, a songwriting imprint formed by singer-songwriter Ash Bowers, in 2016. After doing a talent showcase for representatives of Broken Bow Records in early 2017, he was signed to that label's Stoney Creek imprint and released his self-titled debut EP, which Bowers produced. The label's executive vice president said that the decision to sign Allen was \\"one of the fastest they ever made at the label.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic compared the EP's sound to the \\"slick, assured style\\" of Thomas Rhett and Sam Hunt. Similarly, Rolling Stone Country writer Brittney McKenna compared Allen's contemporary R&B; influences to those artists and Maren Morris. A track from the EP, \\"Blue Jean Baby\\", was added to Spotify's \\"United States Viral 50 chart\\". His first official single, \\"Best Shot\\", was released in early 2018. The week of its release, it was the second most-added song to country music radio playlists. The song has made the Hot Country Songs, Country Airplay, and Billboard Hot 100 charts and was made into a music video. Allen said that the song's title and central theme were inspired by his grandmother and his son, who was 4 at the time of the song's release. His debut album, Mercury Lane, was issued in October 2018. Also produced by Bowers, the album takes its name from the street on which Allen lived as a child. \\"Best Shot\\" was a Number One hit on the Billboard Country Airplay chart in November 2018, making him the first black artist to send his debut single to the top of that chart. The album's second single, \\"Make Me Want To\\" released to country radio on February 1, 2019, and it also became a Number One hit on the Billboard Country Airplay chart. Allen also recorded a cover of Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's \\"Shallow\\" with Abby Anderson in May 2019. The recording was made into a video as well. In 2020, Allen released \\"This Is Us\\", a duet with Noah Cyrus. It will be included on his new EP, Bettie James, which will be released on July 10, 2020. Personal life Allen has a son from a previous relationship. Allen got engaged to Alexis Gale, 23, his girlfriend, at Disney World on Monday, July 15, 2019. The couple met through Allen‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs wife, and actually share the same hometown of Milton, Delaware, and began dating the spring of 2019.

The entrance is about from the main road. The ancient tunnel with its carved stone inscription is the only direct evidence of underground mining in Central Europe from Roman times. However, it is not the oldest underground mine in Central Europe. In the 5th millennium BC There was already underground mining of flint and copper ores. Guided tours of the mine are available. Inscription Emilianus-Stollen inscription The stone-carved Emilianus inscription = . at the entrance to the tunnel reads: INCEPTA OFFI- CINA (A)EMILIANI NONIS MART(IIS) (\\"The [mining] operation of Aemilianus began work on March 7.\\") The inscription documents the mining rights under Roman mining law (lex metallis dicta), according to which operation had to be started within 25 days and was allowed to stand idle for no longer than half a year without the mining rights being forfeited. The law, which dates back to Emperor Hadrian and was partly recorded on tablets found at of Vipasca (Aljustrel) in Portugal, provided uniform regulation of mining in the provinces. The right to mine was to be documented by Occupatio, the posting of a tablet with the name of the owner and the date mining began. Usually wooden tablets were erected, which later fell into decay. The inscription does not include a year; however, it is assumed that the mining occurred in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. An impression of the inscription can be seen in the Wallerfangen Historical Museum. The mining was probably less for copper than for the production of Wallerfanger Blue (:de:Wallerfanger Blau) from azurite and malachite. Excavations 1) Upper Emilianusstollen 2) Lower Emilianusstollen About to the west is the Bruss tunnel, excavated in 1964, also of Roman origin. The medieval azurite mines on the Blaufels and the Limberg is attested by bills from 1492. The azurite mine was therefore continued around St. Barbara in post-Roman times. In 1964 the first systematic excavations were carried out by the former Saarland Conservatory bureau. In the course of these investigations the Saarlouis district acquired the area and put the tunnels under monument protection. An excavation campaign carried out by the Bochum Mining Museum (:de:Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum) was completed in 1976 with the installation of a visitor mine, with the support of the Ensdorf Mine. In 1993, the lower Emilianus tunnel was uncovered and found in a condition untouched by subsequent mining. The Merchweiler mining company (:de:Bergwerksgesellschaft Merchweiler) secured the tunnel from landslides with modern upgrades. Access is for research purposes only. The investigations carried out by the Bochum Museum in 2008 revealed a much larger extension of the Bruss tunnel than was previously known. A shovel with a wooden handle and a broken blade was found and another shaft was discovered before the end of the tunnel.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The building was originally built by the Municipality of Goulburn as the Goulburn Public Baths or Corporation Baths in 1892. It was designed by E. C. Manfred after the council elected not to proceed with the plans of original architects McKinnon and Weitzell. It was built in brick by contractors Wilkie Brothers, who had submitted a tender of ¬£1,497 for the work. It featured a 12 sq ft tower at the corner of Sloane and Goldsmith Streets, giving access from Goldsmith Street to the 102ft by 45ft baths building and containing a smoking room. The baths basin was 80 ft by 25ft and ranged from 2 to 7 ft deep. It also contained 43 dressing boxes, shower-baths, a narrow elevated public gallery and a shop facing to Sloane Street. It was leased to Messrs. Shurmer and Day to manage and formally opened in November 1892. However, it met criticism at opening with claims that the basin was too small and not deep enough for diving. The mayor, E. Howard, acknowledged concerns about divers hitting their heads but stated that he \\"thought a person would have to be very drunk before he would do such a thing\\". The baths were open from 5am to 10pm, with two days to be set aside for ladies. The baths continually ran at a loss for the council at an average of ¬£160 each year, and in 1906 they were approached by William Connolly Ltd., owner of the Argyle Flour Mills, who wished to use the site as a mill. In October 1906, the council voted by a one-vote majority to sell the site for ¬£1,000 and build cheaper premises elsewhere, leading one councillor to resign in protest. The Argyle Flour Mills had previously operated out of a site in Clifton Street. The converted flour mill opened in 1908, the renovations having been designed by Sydney architect John Dunkley. It consisted of offices along the Sloane Street frontage with a 102 ft by 45ft store where the baths had been, a platform above the store for packing operations and a verandah with a loading dock, connected with a new 11,200 sq ft warehouse shed capable of holding 40,000 sacks of wheat. The shed had its own railway platform as part of a private siding, the old baths building having fronted on to the railway line. The new mill building, adjoining the shed, was a brick and cement building four storeys high, 73ft by 31ft, alongside a 28ft by 20ft engine room separated from the mill by a passage. The mill closed in the early 1970s. It subsequently operated as a leisure centre and as various retail businesses. It most recently operated as the Goulburn Furniture Warehouse. It has been raised as a potential location for a Goulburn Museum, but this has not occurred. The former swimming baths still remain in place under the floorboards of the former mill store.

Life  Born in Driedorf, Westerwald, as the son of a Protestant minister, Bender began his vocal training while studying medicine in Berlin. His music instructors were Luise Ress and Baptist Hoffmann. Already by 1900, Bender made his stage debut at the Breslau Opera. In 1903 he moved to the M√ºnchner Hofoper, where he remained for the rest of his life, in September 1943 celebrating his 40-year anniversary as a member of the ensemble. Altogether he trod the stage more than 2000 times. In Munich, Bender sang practically all the important bass roles and also performed as a Heldenbariton. His repertory altogether included not fewer than 118 roles. He took part in many premieres, among them Le donne curiose in 1903 and I quatro rusteghi in 1906, both by Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari. He shone as Pope Pius V in the first performances of Hans Pfitzner's Palestrina in 1917 at the Prinzregententheater. Other premieres were Die Gespenstersonate by Julius Weismann (1930), Das Herz by Hans Pfitzner (1931) and Der Mond by Carl Orff (1939). From 1902 Bender was a regular guest of the Richard-Wagner-Festspiele in Bayreuth. His reputation sealed by guest appearances at Th√©√†tre de la Monnaie Brussels (1910), Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es Paris (1914), the Vienna State Opera or Hofoper (1916‚Äì17), Covent Garden Opera London (1910‚Äì1914), and Stadttheater Z√ºrich (1915), from 1922 to 1927 he was invited to the Metropolitan Opera in New York. In 1926 Bender was a guest at the Salzburger Festspiele, and in 1938 and 1939 performed in Der Ring des Nibelungen at La Scala. Lieder and concert singing was also a great passion of Bender's, even before being named Royal Bavarian Kammers√§nger in 1907.Erich H. M√ºller (Hg.): Deutsches Musiker-Lexikon, Wilhelm Limpert-Verlag, Dresden 1929 As a singer of narrative ballads he was lauded as a successor to Eugen Gura. In neither opera nor concert singing did Bender rely on his impressive voice alone; for him the dramatic element was always important. The extent of his mimetic gift can be judged from his playing of a principal role in one of the most significant expressionistic silent films, 1919's Nerven by Robert Reinert. (This film dramatized the misery of the postwar era so powerfully that audiences became hysterical and the work was banned.) The singer appeared on the stage till shortly before his death. In the 1930s and 40s he was primarily busy as a professor at the M√ºnchner Akademie der Tonkunst (now part of the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater). Among his pupils belong Josef Greindl and Hans Hopf. Bender married the soprano Paula Brand, who thereafter gave up her career.

The original land patent was first issued to Henry Stoupe and John Gibson in 1656. According to the local tax assessment, the property had increased to by 1798 with the initial reference to the building structure. The manor was enlarged in the mid-19th century, with secondary restorations and expansions in the 20th and 21st centuries. Of particular note is the original header bond brick on the south fa√ßade, common in period Annapolis and Chestertown homes and two-story north-facing veranda reminiscent of Mount Vernon. Significant local history includes fugitive slave, Henry Massey, who escaped from the home in 1854, and the multi-generation family cemetery that was lost to shoreline erosion. Henry Stoupe and John Gibson (1656‚Äì1730) The extant property of the Stoopley Gibson manor was part of a land grant made on November 12, 1656, to two \\"partners and mates\\", Henry Stoupe and John Gibson. They expanded the lot with the purchase of an additional from John Winchester in 1657. Half of the property was then sold to Andrew Helena (Elinor) by the end of 1658, who died in 1660, passing the land to his wife who remarried multiple times. By 1694, the land had passed to Elinor's two daughters, being jointly held by their husbands William Joyner and Lawrence Arnold. There are no known records of the property from 1694 until it was re- surveyed in 1730. The Bright Family (1730‚Äì1868) While ownership of the property remains unclear through the early 18th century, the property of 200 acres was surveyed and patented for Francis Bright in 1730. The first written evidence of the manor home was on the 1798 Federal Direct Tax which described \\"a dwelling valued at $600, a barn, and a corn house.\\" The home and plantation passed through successive generations of Bright farmers in the years between the American Revolution and the American Civil War and remained a prototypical example of an 18th- and 19th-century mid-Atlantic farm. Census records document numerous slaves who lived on the property, including Henry Massey, who escaped from the property and was apprehended in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and returned to Franklin Bright in September 1854. Franklin represented the last generation of Bright family owners when, at the age of 41, he died in 1865 intestate and without any evidence of offspring. There is some speculation given his ownership of slaves and dependency on the local agricultural economy, he may have joined the Confederate Army and was killed during the Civil War, but no contemporary records have validated this account. White's Heritage (1868‚Äì1933) Postcard photograph postmarked in 1907 After the Civil War and Bright's death, the manor was purchased by Marmaduke White, a local farmer who owned property to the northwest of the Stoopley Gibson property. In 1880, a local Chancery Court disposition described the property improved by \\"a two story brick house with attic, with a frame back building and all the necessary outbuildings.\\" The property remained in the White family as a farming plantation into the second quarter of the 20th century. Benjamin F. and Gertrude McGuckin (1933‚Äì1950) Stoopley Gibson was purchased by B. F. McGuckin, a prominent partner at the New York firm of De Coppet and Doremus and former General Motors board member, and his wife Gertrude in November 1933. The transaction involved several heirs to the White family, including T. Walter White, the tenant farmer for the property. The purchase was delayed by disputes among the White heirs that were resolved by the Circuit Court for Queen Anne's County by March 14, 1934, when the property settled for $15,000. Within the first few months of ownership, the McGuckins initiated an extensive restoration of the manor house and property, which was described at the time as \\"one of the fine waterfront properties of the county.\\" Renovations included the addition of a wing to the west of the manor home with a new kitchen, laundry room, mud room, and maids' dining room, the construction of a detached garage, greenhouse, and swimming pool. The McGuckins were able to take possession of the home and relocate from New York by June 20, 1935. Elm Street Development and Gibson's Grant (2000‚Äìpresent) The property was sold to White's Heritage Partners in 2000 and was subdivided under the name Gibson's Grant. The last living owner prior to the development of the neighborhood, Luther Gregory, passed away in 2006. The home was featured on the 2019 Maryland Home and Garden Pilgrimage.

He is currently a visiting researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and was previously Senior Research Associate in the Department of Applied Health Research, University College London (UCL).  Early life and education  Galsworthy was born in London. He studied Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge. He gained his PhD in Behaviour Genetics from the King's College London in 2003. His doctoral supervisor was Robert Plomin.  Career  Academia Galsworthy completed ten years of postdoctoral work in Switzerland and Slovenia, returning to London in June 2012 to take a position as Senior Research Associate at University College London. He is affiliated with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as a visiting researcher. His research interests include health services research, research mapping, and science policy of the EU. Politics Since 2012, Galsworthy has been involved in initiatives in science policy and grassroots pro-European Union activism. He works full-time for Scientists for EU. Scientists for EU On 8 May 2015, the day after the UK general election 2015, Galsworthy co-founded the pro-EU research advocacy group Scientists for EU with fellow scientist Rob Davidson. Galsworthy articulated two concerns that Scientists for EU aimed to address: \\"first, a lack of clarity and cohesion within the community on EU benefits and Brexit risks; and, secondly, a lack of public understanding on the UK/EU relationship in science.\\" His decision to found the organization was driven by his reaction to the tone and content of the Brexit debate, which he described as a \\"colossal, nationwide rejection of expert opinion\\" fostered by \\"media... focused on the political soap opera, not the facts\\". Prior to the referendum, Scientists for EU became a high-profile organisation presenting the case for EU membership. In March 2016, Galsworthy presented evidence on the impact of EU membership on UK science to the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee. Video. Galsworthy answered questions about the balance between structural and competitive EU funding for science, the effectiveness of EU science collaborations, and the potential loss of influence over EU scientific regulations after Brexit. Commenting on the committee's report in April 2016, Galsworthy stated that the EU science programme offered \\"huge added value\\" to the UK and \\"the overwhelming balance of opinion is for remaining in.\\" Following the referendum, Galsworthy's immediate priority was to document its impact on the UK science community. Around 350 scientists contacted Galsworthy in relation to the future of British science after Brexit, most of whom expressed concerns about the future of research in the UK. For some, xenophobia was a significant concern. Galsworthy concluded, \\"It is clear that the UK has overnight become less attractive as a place to do science.\\" Galsworthy has continued to lobby and inform politicians and others about the negative consequences of a hard Brexit for science, including the loss of freedom of movement and the loss of influence over EU policies. Despite the referendum result, in Galsworthy's view Scientists for EU has been successful in raising the profile of science in UK politics. In the 2017 United Kingdom general election both the Labour Party and Conservative Party election manifestos committed to raising the budget for research and development to 3 percent of gross domestic product. In Galsworthy's view, \\"This is a big step up from the general election of 2015 where science didn't feature. I think the referendum really helped push that onto the agenda.\\" In August 2018, Scientists for EU highlighted to the media that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK would lose its eligibility for three of the EU's major funding programmes. According to Galsworthy, this would mean \\"losing over half a billion [euros] a year in high value grants\\". In a profile in Nature in September 2018, Galsworthy said that Scientists for EU had changed its focus: Instead of representing the interests of British science in the Brexit negotiations, it was partnering with People's Vote to prevent Brexit altogether. The change was motivated by the diminishing window of time for negotiations and the increasing likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. Healthier IN the EU Together with Rob Davidson and Martin McKee, Galsworthy co-founded Healthier IN the EU, a grassroots organization making the health case for continued EU membership. Galsworthy and McKee co-authored an analysis of the effects of Brexit on the NHS, published in The Lancet, that predicted negative consequences for healthcare in Britain under every scenario. Media Galsworthy appears in the anti-Brexit documentary film Postcards from the 48% (2018). Political views Galsworthy is affiliated with the Labour Party. According to a profile in Der Standard, Galsworthy \\"persistently seeks clarification and sees it as a central science mission in the era of fake news.\\" Galsworthy opposes what he sees as the debasement of knowledge in populist politics. He has described President of the United States Donald Trump as \\"a dictator in American caricature form\\".

The Wabash Railroad opened it in 1929 as part of grade separation project which raised Delmar Boulevard over its tracks. Delmar Boulevard was one of several Wabash branch stations in St. Louis, but had special importance as a transfer station for intercity passengers. The Norfolk and Western Railway, successor to the Wabash, closed the station in 1970. The MetroLink's Red Line was built over the former Wabash right-of-way and passes underneath the station. Metrolink built a new station, Delmar Loop, below the old building but does not use the structure.  History   Construction  The city of St. Louis and the Wabash Railroad had been at loggerheads for years over the city's desire to eliminate grade crossings within the city and the railroad's disinclination to pay for such work. One such crossing was at Delmar Boulevard, in the West End, on the Wabash's route to Kansas City, Missouri. A station there, Delmar Avenue, provided passengers with a local alternative to Union Station, down the tracks. In 1927 the city and the railroad came to an agreement over the reconstruction of the Delmar Boulevard area. The railroad tracks would be depressed, allowing a maximum clearance of beneath Delmar Boulevard. The city would construct a new concrete viaduct to carry the boulevard, including streetcars, over the railroad tracks. Finally, the Wabash would construct a new station on Delmar Boulevard, sitting above the tracks. Construction of the station, which cost $300,000, began after the new viaduct opened in June, 1928. The station was built from granite, limestone, and brick. The exterior style was Ionic, with multiple columns gracing the front. The interior of the station was finished in \\"marble, ornamental plaster, and bronze.\\" The walls and floor were also marble, the latter from Tennessee. The station's waiting room could hold 72 passengers. Stairs and elevator carried passengers to the platforms below. The platforms, made of concrete, were long. Contemporary Wabash advertisements emphasized the \\"comfort\\" of the new station, and claimed that \\"no effort had been spared.\\"  Operation  City of St. Louis passing through Forest Park, approaching Delmar. The new station opened to the public on August 1, 1929, and for many years was an important part of St. Louis' transportation infrastructure and a catalyst for growth in the West End. At one time it handled 40% of all Wabash boardings in the city. Passengers changing trains, such as between the Wabash Cannon Ball and the City of St. Louis, would transfer at Delmar Boulevard instead of Union Station. The Wabash installed an escalator in 1947. Historian H. Roger Grant called it the \\"crown jewel\\" of the Wabash's station construction and renewal in the 1920s. All Wabash long distance passenger service to and from St. Louis Union Station made a last in/first out stop at the Delmar Boulevard station. Some suburban passenger service used an alternate route to the St. Louis riverfront but did not serve St. Louis Union Station. Passenger train patronage declined in the United States after the Second World War. By 1966 Delmar Boulevard, now owned by the Norfolk and Western Railway, was the only remaining outlying or \\"branch\\" passenger station in St. Louis. At that time it still saw twelve trains daily and handled 200 passengers. Patronage continued to decline, and the Norfolk and Western closed the station on February 15, 1970.  Aftermath  When the station closed in 1970 the expectation was that it would be torn down. The station lay vacant until 1983 when the Norfolk and Western announced plans to demolish it, claiming that it was \\"structurally unsafe.\\" Instead, it was sold to Mewhinney Corporation, a lighting supply firm, for $10,000. The corporation announced plans to renovate the interior and restore the 1929 appearance. As plans for the Red Line of the Metrolink light rail system went forward in 1989, using the former Wabash right-of-way, there were calls to incorporate the building into the planned station at Delmar Boulevard. Mehwinney attempted to sell the building to the Bi-State Development Agency, which was overseeing Metrolink, for $427,500. Bi-State rejected the offer as there was no budget for acquiring the building. Local businessman Joe Edwards bought the station in 2002; Washington University in St. Louis became a part-owner in 2016.

History  The club was founded in 1885 as a founding member of the Great Southern Football Association in 1923, along with Encounter Bay, Goolwa, Hindmarsh Valley and Port Elliot. The club has won 24 senior premierships, the first of which being the inaugural Great Southern Football Association of 1923, a 9.11(65) to 2.4(16) victory over Port Elliot. The club then went on to win another three grand finals during the 1920s until Port Elliot beat them in the 1929 grand final. Victor Harbour won two more grand finals in 1930 and 1934 but lost the grand finals of 1931, 1935, 1936 and 1937. The club's two premiership successes of 1930 and 1934 saw the victories over Strathalbyn and Port Elliot. The Great Southern Football League then went into recess in 1941 to 1945 due to World War II and the post-war season of 1946 saw Victor Harbour embark on a premiership streak, winning each flag from 1946 to 1952, beating Encounter Bay in each decider from 1946-1950, Goolwa in 1951 and Yankalilla in 1952. 1953 and 1954 saw some unfortunate grand final losses to Goolwa and Mount Compass but another two premierships were won in 1955, a 22-point victory over Yankalilla and a 7-point win over Encounter Bay in 1957. The 1940s/1950s premiership successes saw the club's longest premiership drought, not winning another flag until 1972, 15 years since their last grand final victory. During that time the Kangaroos made the decider on five occasions but ultimately lost every time, one of those including the 1975 premiership, in which Goolwa comfortably took the flag. That drought was broken when another drought came that lasted for 18 years when the Roos' next premiership was 1990. After the 1990 grand final, the Kangaroos went on to win each grand final from 1991 to 1995, gaining another winning streak. They won the 1997 grand final also and their most recent premiership was in 1999, beating Langhorne Creek 10.5(65) to 6.11(47). The reserves side also won the 1999 premiership flag with a win over Yankalilla. Since the 2000s, the Kangaroos have performed quite strongly, making the finals in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 but 2014 saw a rather large downfall, finishing second-last and winning 5 games over the winless Yankalilla. The Victor Harbor FC still continues to field teams in Seniors and Juniors in the Great Southern Football League.

Casper Brindle creates artwork that combines influences from both movements, light and space finish fetish, as well as elements from Minimalism and Color Field painting. His work has been exhibited in the United States and internationally.  Early life and education  Casper Brindle was born in Toronto, Canada in 1968 shortly after his parents emigrated there from England. The family relocated to Los Angeles in 1974. Brindle began painting at a young age, and described the work of Mark Rothko as an influence in his youth. In the late 1980s, he apprenticed with visual artist, Eric Orr, one of the founding members of the Light and Space and Finish Fetish movements.  Career   Early work  Brindle's early works were abstract color field paintings to which the artist introduced elements of photography, poetry and light.  Dislocated Stratum series  The Dislocated Stratum series are expansive paintings made with layers of fine airbrushed sprays which are applied by hand and sealed with a high-gloss resin surface. Brindle creates gradations of color that shift in appearance depending on the viewer's location. Brindle uses industrial materials such as metal flake automotive paint, airbrush and resin, which were popularized by the Finish Fetish artists of the 1960s and 70s. The early Dislocated Stratum works had sections of wood inlay and sometimes LED light elements, that would cause the paintings to glow.  Aura series  The Aura series are monochromatic pieces that are said to function both as painting and relief wall sculpture. Brindle has applied gradations in the pearlescent paint that appear only from certain vantage points. These paintings sit over two inches off of the wall with beveled edges that are painted in neon colors, creating a halo of colorful light. At the center of each painting is a bar of metallic leaf.  Portal series  The Portal Series evolved from the Aura paintings that he debuted in late 2016. Sharing the central form of an bar of metallic leaf, the Portals diverge from Brindle's earlier monochromatic Aura paintings with their colors with gradients that radiate from light to dark.  Sculpture  In 2017, Brindle began producing large-scale kinetic sculptures that continue his experimentation with sensory perception. Lighting plays a dramatic role in the color-shifting quality of the sculptures, and these pieces are intended to function outdoors as well as indoors.  Special projects   Superdesk  In 2014, Brindle collaborated with Los Angeles based Clive Wilkinson Architects on an office project for the Barbarian Group in Boston called the Superdesk. The 4,400 square foot serpentine shaped desk was able to accommodate up to 170 people. Brindle was brought in to cover the desktop with a surfboard-inspired resin topcoat that was poured continuously for 24 hours to maintain the desktop's continuity. The American Institute of Architects recognized the Barbarian Group's office and superdesk and seven other projects with the Institute Honor Awards for Interior Architecture in 2015.  Exhibitions  Brindle's works have been exhibited solo or as part of a group. His works were exhibited in: * Museum of Art and History Lancaster, Lancaster CA, Spirit of Summer ‚Äì The Artists of Mana, June 21 ‚Äì August 31, 2014, curated by Andi Campognone * Art 1307 Villa Di Donato, Naples, Italy - Mana in Naples.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades Range. Hinkhouse Peak is situated on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Liberty Bell Mountain, to the south. Hinkhouse Peak is situated north of Washington Pass, at the east end of a high ridge which connects to Cutthroat Peak. A high ridge extending southeast connects it to Constitution Crags. Most precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Early Winters Creek which is a tributary of the Methow River, but the south slope drains into a tributary of the Chelan River. History The peak's name honors Jimmy D. Hinkhouse (1943-1995), a Washington State mountaineer, economist with the Boeing Corporation in Seattle, and founder of One Step at a Time, a local mountaineering club/12-step substance abuse recovery program. He died of hypothermia at age 52 while climbing Mount McKinley. The USGS officially recognized the name in 2001. Prior to that the peak had several variant names such as State Crag, Towers of the Throat Gripper, Fickle Peak, and Washington Pass Peak. Hinkhouse Peak seen from Highway 20 Climate Hinkhouse Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The North Cascades Highway east of Washington Pass has the distinction of being among the top areas in the United States for most avalanche paths per mile of highway.Avalanche Control. wsdot.wa.gov Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Hinkhouse Peak seen from the Cutthroat Lake Trailhead The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. Hinkhouse Peak is carved mostly from granite of the Golden Horn batholith. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

One segment begins at Highway 1 Business (AR 1B) in Forrest City and runs southeast to Tuni. A second route begins at US Highway 79 (US 79) at Bledsoe and runs east. Both routes were created in the mid-1960s, and have remained along the same alignment since. Both routes are maintained by the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ArDOT). Route description Forrest City to Tuni Highway 334 begins at Highway 1B (Washington Street) in Forrest City, a city of regional importance in the Arkansas Delta region. The highway winds southeast toward the Lee County line through Crowley's Ridge. The loess hill terrain makes the route wind and curve more than the surrounding highways in St. Francis County covering the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Highway 334 intersects St. Francis County Road 735 (CR 735) at Tuni, with CR 734 and CR 736 continuing west and east, respectively. As of 2016, the route had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 1,500 vehicles per day (VPD) within Forrest City, but 270 VPD east of the city, earning a classification as a very low volume local road by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), meaning fewer than 400 vehicles per day. Bledsoe to Frenchman Bayou Highway 334 begins at US 79 on the St. Francis-Lee County line in the Arkansas Delta. The route runs southeast across Millseed Lake. It turns south along a section line road to Lee County Road 621 (CR 621), where it terminates near a levee. The eastern terminus is less than one mile (1.6 km) from the Mississippi River and the Mississippi state line. Near the eastern terminus, the AADT was measured as 120 VPD in 2016, dropping to 70 further east. Major intersections History Both highways were created during a period of expansion in the state highway system in the 1960s. Highway 334 was first created in St. Francis County on June 23, 1965.. The Lee County segment was created on November 23, 1966.. Neither alignment has changed since creation.

The series was part of the \\"New Age of DC Heroes\\" initiative, which launched following the conclusion of the Dark Nights: Metal crossover event, and began publication on June 6, 2018. It focuses on the titular team‚Äîconsisting of Firebrand, Neon the Unknown, Viking Judge, and Ascendant‚Äîand follows their adventures, which relate to the events of Dark Nights: Metal and the Dark Multiverse. DC announced plans to debut new titles following the conclusion of Dark Nights: Metal in April 2017, under the \\"Dark Matter\\" initiative, with the titles connecting to the events of the crossover. The Unexpected was first announced in October 2017 as part of the initiative, which had been renamed to \\"New Age of DC Heroes\\". According to Orlando, the titles core theme is discovery, describing it as a cross between \\"The Dark Tower and Seven Samurai\\", and deals with numerous aspects of DC's multiverse. The series ended with its eighth issue. Plot Former paramedic Janet Fals/Firebrand was killed during the invasion of the Dark Multiverse. After her body was released to Civil Solutions, they resurrected her by installing the Conflict Engine into her heart, which requires her to fight every 24 hours or she'll die. While working her shift at a VA hospital, she is attacked by Alden Quench/Bad Samaritan, who wishes to extract the Conflict Engine from her. During the attack, the Unexpected‚ÄîNeon the Unknown, Viking Judge, and Ascendant‚Äîshow up to help Firebrand. In the ensuing battle, Bad Samaritan manages to injure and draw blood from Neon, Ascendant, and Viking Judge, using the latter's ax, which he uses to hit Firebrand in the chest, causing an explosion that results in the deaths of himself, Ascendant, and Viking Judge. The explosion also creates a new isotope of metal. Development and publication history Background and announcement From June 2017 up to March 2018, DC Comics published Dark Nights: Metal, consisting of a six- issue limited series and various tie-ins. The story focused on Batman discovering the existence of the Dark Multiverse and fighting evil versions of himself led by the dark god Barbatos. Following the conclusion of Dark Nights: Metal, DC launched the \\"Dark Matter\\" initiative and debuted numerous new titles spinning off the event. In October, during the New York Comic Con the \\"Dark Matter\\" initiative had been rebranded to \\"The New Age of DC Heroes\\", with The Unexpected being one of the titles to debut. The series was written by Steve Orlando, with art by Ryan Sook. Writing and characters Orlando described the series as \\"The Dark Tower meets Seven Samurai\\" and focuses on new characters Janet Fals/Firebrand, Colin Nomi/Neon the Unknown, Turid Goldenaxe/Viking Judge, and Elligh/Ascendant. According to him, the titular team consists of people who are trying to atone for mistakes they made in the past, which they consider to be unforgivable. Orlando stated that Firebrand is The Unexpecteds main connection to the events of Dark Nights: Metal, as she was a paramedic that got injured during the events of the crossover. Besides the series' connection to the events of Dark Nights: Metal and the Dark Multiverse, Orlando said that The Unexpected also deals with the post- Flashpoint' Multiverse, Crisis on Infinite Earths, Infinite Crisis, and Final Crisis, showing how many of these stories are connected to each other. Additionally, one of the book's core themes is discovery. Regarding the characters, Ryan Sook said that he designed them based on the descriptions he'd received from Orlando and sent them to DC. While Firebrand's design remained the same throughout development, his original designs for Neon, Viking Judge, and Ascendant were all scrapped and went through various incarnations. Reception Critical response The Unexpected has received positive reviews from comics critics. At the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 10 to reviews from comics critics, the series has received an average score of 7.5 based on 51 reviews. Commercial performance The Unexpected #1 debuted at 69th place on Diamond Comic Distributors' best-selling comics ranking for June 2018, with 28,028 copies distributed, being the 29th-best-selling DC comic book series published as well as the fourth-best-selling title by DC to debut in that month.

PaLCuV causes severe disease in papaya (Carica papaya), but can sometimes infect other crops such as tobacco or tomato. It can be found in tropical and subtropical regions primarily in India, but closely related species have also been detected in countries such as China, Malaysia, Nigeria and South Korea. This virus is transmitted by an insect vector from the family Aleyrodidae and order Hemiptera, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. PaLCuV has been responsible for several epidemics and causes severe economic losses. Because of the broad diversity of these viruses, their characterization and control remains difficult.  Genome  This virus typically consists of a bipartite circular single-stranded (ss) DNA molecule (2400‚Äì2800 nt in size), and betasatellite (1350-1400 nt in size). Several beta satellites are associated with PaLCuV, and they likely play a role in symptom development. Some alpha satellites have also been associated with PaLCuV. This virus has similar coat protein structure and genome organization to that of other begomoviruses such as TYLCV.  Transmission  PaLCuV is transmitted by the insect vector Bemisia tabaci in a persistent-circulative nonpropagative manner. The wide range of host species, including several weeds plays a role in its broad transmission.  Agricultural importance  The main symptoms are severe curling and thickening of veins on leaves. The plants are also reduced in size. Severely affected plants produce fewer, smaller, and deformed fruits. This virus can cause significant yield losses in orchards. Losses may be as severe as 90‚Äì100%, especially when other virus species such as Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) are present. Treatments that are commonly used for this disease include insecticides and removing infected plants. There are no known varieties with genetic resistance at this time, but there are on-going efforts to discover and breed papaya with natural resistance.  Epidemiology  PaLCuV is found in tropical and subtropical regions, and it significantly affects papaya production in India's major papaya growing regions. The disease was first described in 1939, while the causal virus was first detected in India in 1998. There are closely related virus species including: * Papaya leaf crumple virus * Papaya leaf curl China virus * Papaya leaf curl Guandong virus PaLCuV is related to Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV), in some cases sharing 97% sequence identity.  Management  Currently, the most widespread treatments used to control the spread of PaLCuV are a wide range of insecticides as well as crop rotation. Rouging infected plants and destroying infected fields is also used when necessary. The usage of large quantities of insecticides to control vector populations is not ideal, and other cultural methods to control vector populations are of increasing importance to a complete integrated pest management strategy. Other strategies include trying to engineer resistance through RNAi much like with the 'Rainbow' cultivar of papaya and PRSV.

After a relatively tame second period of extra time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Hansen scored the first penalty for Norway, shooting low to Williams left after she dove the wrong way. Kerr went first for Australia but sent her shot high and wide of the goal. After Guro Reiten copied Hansen's method, Emily Gielnik saw her low effort saved by Hjelmseth, who dove to her right to make the stop.

England doubled their lead in first half stoppage time, when Ellen White received a pass from Lucy Bronze just inside the penalty area, and sent a low left-footed shot past Ngo Ndom. Early in the second half, Ajara Nchout appeared to get a goal back for Cameroon after shooting a Gabrielle Ongu√©n√© cutback into the top corner, but the goal was disallowed when a VAR check showed Ongu√©n√© was offside in the build up to the goal. Alexandra Takounda missed a great chance just after being substituted into the game, when she collected Alex Greenwood's weak back pass in front of goal, but her effort was saved by Karen Bardsley. England added another goal in the 58th minute when Greenwood hit Toni Duggan's low driven corner into the net at the far post. The fixture attracted considerable controversy. The actions of the Cameroonian players, including delaying the restart after England's second and third goals, as well as what was perceived to be deliberately rough play, prompted a FIFA investigation into their actions. Match referee Qin Liang also received significant criticism for failing to punish several Cameroonian infractions, and was seen to have lost control of the game. { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"40%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Karen Bardsley - RB 2 Lucy Bronze - CB 5 Steph Houghton (c) - CB 6 Millie Bright - LB 3 Alex Greenwood - CM 4 Keira Walsh - CM 10Fran Kirby - CM 8 Jill Scott   - RF 7 Nikita Parris   - CF 18Ellen White   - LF 11Toni Duggan - colspan=3Substitutions: - FW 9 Jodie Taylor   - MF 23Lucy Staniforth   - DF 14Leah Williamson   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3Phil Neville } valign=\\"top\\"300px valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%;

In the first match, captaining Barbados, he went to the crease at 101 for 1 and scored 275 in eight hours, putting on 152 with Cammie Smith for the second wicket, 111 with Conrad Hunte for the third, 198 with Gordon Proverbs for the fourth, and 60 with Cecil Williams for the fifth before he was out with the score at 621 for five. Barbados were all out for 753 at the end of the second day, and went on to win the match by an innings. In the second match, which began two days after the first one ended, he made 107, the only century in the match, and Barbados won by 223 runs. He later served as Deputy Commissioner of Police in Barbados, and also served in senior positions in the police forces of Trinidad and Tobago and St Lucia.Tony Cozier, \\"W. A. Farmer\\", The Cricketer, May 1976, p. 29. He was awarded the Queen's Police Medal in 1963. His friendship and persuasion led the young Gary Sobers to join the Police Boys' Club and its cricket team in the early 1950s, where Sobers soon excelled and forced his way into the Barbados team. His son Stephen played for Barbados in the 1970s and became a QC.

Two arrangements are possible: a linear form with double bonds and charge transfer, and a cyclic form. Both forms are highly unstable. More-stable derivatives exist, such as when it acts as a ligand, and it may participate in azido nitration, which is a reaction between sodium azide and ammonium cerium nitrate. The linear form of N3 was discovered in 1956 by B. A. Thrush by photolysis of hydrogen azide. As a linear and symmetric molecule, it has D‚àûh symmetry, with a nitrogen‚Äìnitrogen bond length averaging 1.8115 √Ö. The first excited electronic state, A2Œ£u, is 4.56 eV above the ground state. The cyclic form was identified in 2003 by N. Hansen and A. M. Wodtke using ultraviolet photolysis of chlorine azide.

It has a current circulation of about 1,000 as of 2018.  History  Founded in 1890 as the Daphne Times the paper was relaunched five years later as the Baldwin Times after local lawyer Abner Smith bought the publication for seventy-five dollars at a foreclosure auction in 1894. Initial subscriptions numbered only around 250. The paper moved from Daphne to Bay Minette in 1901 where, suffering from illness, Smith sold it in 1905 to Ira Jones, but later bought back the paper, running it from 1911 to his death in 1922. It was sold to R.B. Vail, a former manager at the Western Newspaper Union in July 1922. The following year Vail would go on to buy the Atmore Record. In 1927, he was elected president of the Alabama Press Association. The Times was acquired in 1936 by James H. Faulkner, a recent college graduate who later ran for Governor, and served both in the Alabama Senate and as mayor of Baldwin. Faulkner expanded his holdings in 1947 when he bought the Monroe Journal from A.C. Lee (Harper Lee's father) for fifteen thousand dollars. Jimmy Faulkner was later given a \\"Lifetime Achievement Award\\" by the Alabama Press Association and both Faulkner University and Faulkner Community College System are named in his honor. The Faulkner family owned the Baldwin Times until 1974, when they sold it to Frank Helderman and his son. Helderman Jr. sold the Baldwin Times, which was then part of the Baldwin Publishing Company, to Terry Everett in 1981. In 1983, Everett established Gulf Coast Media, which included the Baldwin Times, along with five other papers he purchased. Everett went on to sell all of his papers in 1988 and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992, where he served until 2009.

It is part of the North Cascades Range, and is situated in the Lake Chelan- Sawtooth Wilderness. The northwestern extreme of the Gilbert massif connects to the southern end of Kangaroo Ridge. Precipitation that falls on Gilbert drains into the Twisp River. Climate Gilbert Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Background Currently there are 13 different networks of toll highways in the United States. Transponders used with each network are not interoperable with the other networks requiring trucking companies and individual drivers who travel between those networks to maintain multiple transponders. In 2012, Congress passed the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, and among its provisions are requirements to ease the burden of tolled interstate travel by providing motorists the convenience of a single interoperable toll tag and account. NationalPass was designed to meet the 2016 federal deadline without requiring toll agencies to install new equipment or retrofit old toll stations. Implementation NationalPass tags include transponders for IAG/TDM (e.g. E-ZPass), SeGo (e.g. TxTag), Title-21 (e.g. FasTrak), and ATA (e.g. EZ TAG). TransCore establishes fleet accounts with each of the interoperable states and bills NationalPass customers directly. No changes or special accommodations are requires by the participating states.

History   Bridgewater Football Club  The Bridgewater Football Club was founded in 1956 although football was played in the town back in 1895 when there was a local team that existed right up until the 1940s. The club was known as the Raiders and had the colours of light blue, royal blue and white and played in three different hills leagues. Its first seasons were spent in the Hills Football Association (HFA) from 1956 until 1961 when the league disbanded. The club started slowly in its first few years of existence in the HFA but managed to win a senior premiership in 1959. After the league folded in 1961, Bridgewater spent five years with the Torrens Valley Football Association where it won another senior grade premiership over Eden Valley Rovers in 1953. In 1967, Bridgewater moved back to the Hills Football League, playing in its Central Zone (now Division 1). = A-Grade Premierships = * 1959 Hills Football Association vs Bremer 12.13.85 to 1.13.19 * 1963 Torrens Valley Football Association vs Eden Valley 11.7.73 to 8.11.59 * 1966 Hills Central Association vs Mylor 11.8.74 to 10.6.66 * 1981 Hills Football League Division 2 * 1987 Hills Football League Courier Cup * 2016 Hills Football League Division 2 = B-Grade Premierships = * 1992 Hills Football League Division 1 * 2020 Hills Football League Division 2  Callington United Football Club  The Callington United Football Club was founded in 1995 with the colours of navy blue and gold, and going by the nickname 'the Eagles'. It filled the void of the original Bremer- Callington club which was formed around 1903 as the Bremer Football Club from the 1950s, but merged with and relocated to Nairne in 1978 to form the Nairne Bremer United Football Club. Callington United played in the Hills Football League Country Division from 2003.  Post-Merger  Both Bridgewater and Callington United finished at the bottom of the Central and Country divisions of the Hills Football League in 2012 and merged in the following off-season to commence the 2013 season as a single entity. As part of the merger, the club wore the Bridgewater home guernsey (navy blue with white and light blue chevrons), retained the Bridgewater nickname - 'the Raiders' - and split games and training between Bridgewater and Callington ovals. The club which finished ninth in 2013 and eighth in 2014, before joining the Hills Division 2 for the 2015 season. Here, the club enjoyed its strong run of sustained success. In 2015 it reached the grand final (losing to Kersbrook) before defeating Nairne Bremer in a three-point thriller to win the 2016 premiership - ending a 35-year premiership drought. Bridgewater-Callington's B-Grade won the 2017 reserves grand final over Nairne Bremer.  Women's football  Like many clubs, Bridgewater-Callington operates a women's program. The fledgling program commenced in 2018 playing in the sixth division of the Adelaide Footy League women's competition. It finished sixth on the ladder with one win over Murraylands Swans. From 2020 the club will play in the new 'HFLW' competition.  Location  Bridgewater-Callington retains its main clubrooms and training base at Bridgewater Oval in the main Bridgewater township, with training and games taking place at Callington Oval as well. While the Hills Football League historically features a number of clubs that are the result of mergers such as Mt Lofty, Torrens Valley and Uraidla Districts, Bridgewater-Callington remains the only club to split its games between two home grounds.  Notable Players  Tim Weatherald was a former player of the Bridgewater Football Club who continued his football journey to play for the Sturt Football Club in the South Australian National Football League and won the 2002 Magarey Medal and the club's Best and Fairest award and played in Sturt's 2002 grand final triumph over Central District, coming out 47-point winners.

Plot Confederate Lieutenant Yancey is asked by Mary de Lane to meet her orphan Northern niece, Elinor. Yancey later takes time off from his duties to show Elinor where a \\"Confederate Ironclad\\" is being constructed. She promptly writes a letter to the \\"Commanding Officer, U.S. Gunboats\\", revealing the location and the fact the fort guarding it is \\"defenseless for want of powder\\". A Union force storms Yancey's artillery battery and drives off the defenders. Yancey, away chatting with Elinor, hears the shooting and rides off to warn the detachment at the fort. Upon hearing that they have no powder, he remounts his horse and races to a powder train. However, the Union soldiers are not far behind. While a firefight rages, Yancey and Rose, his girlfriend, board the train and start it up. He is shot in the arm, leaving Rose to manage things. Meanwhile, Elinor attempts to stop the train by setting fire to a railroad bridge. The rear carriage, with some barrels of powder, catches fire, so Rose detaches it before it explodes. They deliver the rest of the powder to the Confederate soldiers. A fierce battle rages between the \\"Confederate Ironclad\\" and Union gunboats. The Confederates emerge victorious; one gunboat is set afire, forcing the crew to abandon ship. Elinor offers a Union officer her horse, but he insists she come with him. However, Yancey captures the officer at gunpoint. Elinor pleads with Yancey, to no avail, until Rose persuades him to let them go.

It was built in 1884 by Nathan Cohen & Co. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Settlement in the Ben Lomond area began in the 1840s and intensified in the 1860s and 1870s but it wasn't until the 1880s that a school opened (1881) and the railway arrived (1884). Construction of the railways in NSW commenced in the 1850s and by 1878 the Great Northern line had reached West Tamworth. The line continued north to the Queensland border via Uralla, Armidale, Glen Innes and Tenterfield. The Great Northern line reached Tamworth in 1880, Uralla (1881), Armidale (1883), Glen Innes (1884), Tenterfield (1886) and the border town of Wallangarra (originally 'Jennings') in 1888.Ellsmore, 2001; Ellsmore, 2002; SRA, 1993 By 1881 construction of the Great Northern line had reached the Ben Lomond area and by 1883 construction reached its peak with hundreds of people employed on the project. The station building at Ben Lomond opened on 19 August 1884 and in the same year a twenty thousand gallon tank was installed. By 1885 a \\"receiving office\\" opened at the railway station and it was upgraded to a post office in 1886. During the late 19th century Ben Lomond station also provided additional community services including a telegraph service and banking facilities. During the mid-1880s the station is said to have been used for Anglican Church services before the erection of a chapel in 1897. The goods shed was used as a community hall until 1905. Other additions to the railway yard included a dam and an additional water tank installed between 1903 and 1905. The mid 1920s were probably the heyday of railway activities at Ben Lomond when passenger journeys, freight tonnage and revenues all peaked. During both world wars, stations along the Great Northern line, including Ben Lomond, were closely associated with the movement of troops. Like many other locations, Ben Lomond and other stations on the northern line experienced a decline in the second half of the 20th century due primarily to the growth of road transportation (for both passengers and goods) but also as a result of competition from the coastal railway line between Sydney and Brisbane which had been in existence since the 1930s. In 1983 the goods shed was sold and removed and in December 1985, 101 years after its official opening, the station closed. Rail operations ceased along the Great Northern line in 1989 and in 1991 the Station Master's residence at Ben Lomond was sold.  Description  The 2002 Conservation Management Plan for Ben Lomond Railway Station describes the arrangement of the station building as follows: :The passenger station comprises a central brick pavilion enclosing two waiting rooms and a ticket office for the Station Master, flanked by freestanding brick pavilions for the lamp room at the north end and toilets at the south end. The small yards between the pavilions were enclosed with corrugated iron screen walls and roofs. Each of the rooms was accessible from the 264 feet (88 m) long platform on the eastern side. A platform awning over the central portion across the width of the central pavilion provided shelter for passengers and platform equipment.Ellsmore, 2002 Other extant items within the railway precinct include the platform, weighbridge, fences and station signs. The station building remains mostly intact but many items in the yard were removed in the late 20th century.  Heritage listing  The railway station at Ben Lomond is significant as one of the smallest of the brick passenger stations constructed during a period of major expansion of the NSW railways in the 1880s. The railway station is also significant as the highest railway station in NSW (1,363m) and for its important historical role in the economic development and community life of Ben Lomond and surrounding districts (for many years it was the town's post office and was a place where the local community did their banking). Ben Lomond Railway Station is a significant location on the former Great Northern railway line which, although now closed to rail traffic, was the only rail link between Queensland and the southern states in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and which was directly or indirectly associated with major historical events and themes, including for example the transportation of troops during wartime and the transportation of rural produce and livestock. Ben Lomond railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The impact of the Great Northern Railway on the New England region of NSW was substantial. It influenced the growth of towns and villages and it facilitated the establishment of new industries. The construction of Ben Lomond Railway Station and the Great Northern Railway had an impact on the local community in many ways, including the loss of life in the construction of the railway and the opening of economic and social opportunities. For the local community the station was for some time an important centre for commercial activities including banking and postal services. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Ben Lomond railway station is a good intact example of a modest late-Victorian passenger station at a minor country location on the former Great Northern line. The station building demonstrates some minor architectural pretensions and while similar in design to other comparable railway stations it also demonstrates subtle variations in design and construction. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Ben Lomond railway station was the principal meeting place and an important site for business transactions during the early development of the local community at Ben Lomond. Although railway services have ceased and the town has declined, the station building still remains a significant landmark in the local community. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The station does provide the potential to yield information about the early development of the local area, the operation of a small regional railway station and the decline of railway services in the New England region. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The earth toilets and open urinals may be the only remaining examples of their type at a railway station in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Ben Lomond railway precinct includes a good representative example of a late nineteenth-century station building.

Seen here flying in formation over Albert Park Lake.The development of aerial firefighting and forestry in southern Australia ran in parallel with the rapid improvements in aircraft technology over the last century. As more advanced and capable aircraft became available firefighters and foresters quickly sought opportunities to utilise and adapt them. Aircraft have three main advantages over ground resources: speed, access, and observation. Aircraft have been used for a wide range of tasks including reconnaissance, firebombing, crew transport, aerial ignition, back burning, gathering infrared imagery as well as operational forestry tasks like aerial photography, surveys, spraying, fertilising and seeding. Much of the early pioneering work in Australia was led by the Forests Commission Victoria in collaboration with other State forestry and fire authorities including the Western Australia Forests Department, Forestry Commission of NSW, Woods and Forest Department of South Australia and Forestry Tasmania. Federal agencies including the CSIRO also contributed significantly. Overseas forest and fire agencies, particularly the US Forest Service, the US Bureau of Land Management and State agencies such as the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) as well as the Canadian Forest Service faced similar challenges and proved strong and willing partners in sharing knowledge, equipment and expertise over many decades.  Major bushfires  Internationally, southern Australia and particularly the State of Victoria combined with the adjacent States of New South Wales (NSW), South Australia together with the island State of Tasmania, is commonly regarded one of the three landscapes on Earth most prone to damaging bushfires. The other two are southern California and the Mediterranean coast. Moreover, much of eastern Victoria and alpine parts of NSW are remote, mountainous and inaccessible and bushfires are often caused by multiple lightning strikes which can grow quickly in size. Even with the aid of modern firebombing aircraft to slow the spread of a bushfire, the control of these fires usually remains reliant on ground crews getting to the fire edge to extinguish it completely. Although, heavy rain is sometimes sufficient. Major Victorian bushfires occurred on Black Thursday in 1851, where an estimated 5 million hectares were burnt, followed by another blaze on Red Tuesday in February 1891 in South Gippsland when about 260,000 hectares were burnt, 12 people died, and more than 2,000 buildings were destroyed. This deadly pattern continued with more major fires on Black Sunday on 14 February 1926 which saw the tally rise to sixty lives being lost and widespread damage to farms, homes and forests. On 7 February 1967, the Black Tuesday bushfires in Tasmania were the worst the State had ever experienced, leaving 62 people dead, 900 injured and over seven thousand homeless. Major bushfires in Victoria between 2002 - 2009. However, when considered in terms of both loss of property and loss of life, the Black Friday bushfires on 13 January 1939 were one of the worst natural disasters to have occurred in Australia and certainly the worst bushfire up to that time. The 1939 Black Friday fires in Victoria burnt 2 million hectares, 69 mills were destroyed, 71 people died, and several towns were entirely obliterated. Only the Ash Wednesday bushfires in Victoria and South Australia in the summer of 1983 and the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009 have resulted in more fatalities. Bushfires have undoubtedly always been a feature of Australian summers. In an average year, more than 600 bushfires occur in Victoria's National Parks and State Forests which burn about 110,000 hectares and retardant is used on about 10% of these. However, the impacts of bushfires are expected to rise as a result of population pressures and housing growth along the interface between forests and rural communities. Also, while the impacts of global warming are not fully known, Victoria is very likely to experience an increased number of days with extreme fire danger. Putting aside large conflagrations of cities like the Great Fire of Meireki or the Great Fire of London, perhaps the world's worst bushfire was at Peshtigo in Wisconsin in 1871, which burnt nearly 1.2 million acres, destroyed twelve communities and killed between 1500-2500 people. Now largely forgotten, Peshtigo was overshadowed by the Great Fire of Chicago that occurred on the same day.  Bushfire reconnaissance  Experience has consistently shown that early detection and aggressive first attack is the key to keeping bushfires small and gives the best chance for control.Forests Commission, Victoria (1970). Air Operations for Forest Fire Control. In the early part of last century, there was limited road access to the extensive mountain forests, particularly in the remote and uninhabited eastern ranges of Victoria so there was a strong level of enthusiasm for aerial bushfire reconnaissance. While there are differing accounts, it's generally acknowledged that the world's first aerial forest patrol was flown as a demonstration for the US Forest Service on 29 June 1915 at Trout Lake, Wisconsin in a Curtiss Flying Boat by aviation pioneer and wealthy Chicago sportsman Logan ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Vilas. The idea took hold and US Forest Service later joined with the Army Air Service in 1919 to operate regular aerial fire patrols over national forests. According to rumor, each plane was equipped with a telescope and machine gun as a deterrent against arson and the number of fires on the Cleveland National Forest decreased for a while. However, lack of wireless radios for communication between the pilot and the ground was a major problem and the program paused in 1925.Roly Parke, Forests Commission Victoria, District Forester - 1945. New office radios and heavy RC-16 portable radios enabled firefighters to communicate directly with RAAF reconnaissance aircraft.Discussion took place between the Forests Commission Victoria (FCV) and the Air Board over a period of years prior to 1929-30 with the view to commencing regular fire patrols using RAAF aircraft but a lack of safe landing areas proved the main obstacle. Eventually, the first fire spotting aircraft in Victoria was deployed on 18 February 1930Mervin Ellis Bill (1939). Forests Commission Chief Draughtsman; in evidence to the 1939 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission - near the end of Day 30 (Evidence Transcript - page number 2280). when a RAAF Westland Wapiti from No.1 Squadron operating out of Point Cook near Melbourne flew over the nearby Dandenong Ranges. This is also believed to be an Australian first. The need to improve communications for firefighting in flat terrain like the deserts of north western Victoria prompted use of balloons to suspend radio relay sets - 1976. Communications from the aircraft radio were sent in Morse code to the Air Board at RAAF Laverton who then passed the information on to Forests Commission fire controllers. It was claimed that the delay was only a matter of minutes. Over the years effort was focused on more accurately locating fire outbreaks but it was not until the summer of 1939-40 that an aircraft was able to directly communicate by radio with the FCV District Office at Powelltown. The Royal Commission into the 1939 bushfires conducted by Judge Leonard Edward Bishop Stretton has been described as one of the most significant inquiries in the history of Victorian public administration. Its recommendations led to sweeping changes including stringent regulation of burning and fire safety measures for sawmills, grazing licensees and the general public, the compulsory construction of dugouts at forest sawmills, increasing the forest roads network and firebreaks, construction of forest dams, fire towers and supported further RAAF aerial patrols linked by the Commissions radio network VL3AA to ground observers. The Forests Commission's communication systems were regarded at the time to be more technicality advanced than the police and the military. These pioneering efforts were directed by Geoff Weste and by 1943-44 direct communication was possible between firefighting crews on the ground using portable, but heavy, RC-16 Radiophones and RAAF aircraft. Although the technology of the portable radios remained primitive and the reception poor unless the user was on a high point somewhere. The HF radio signal was ‚Äúline- of-sight‚Äù and bounced between fire towers and relay transmitters across the mountains back to the district offices.Vintage Radio, By Rodney Champness, siliconchip.com.au, January 2011 In flat mallee desert country of north western Victoria balloons were used in the 1970s to increase radio coverage. Later the introduction of VHF radios, aeronautical radios operating within the airband and then digital mobile phones revolutionised bushfire communications. By the summer of 1945-46, 114 flights were made with up to eight RAAF aircraft in the air on bad fire days. They operated from RAAF bases at Point Cook, Ballarat, East Sale and Bairnsdale and reported 438 outbreaks. The following year, RAAF Consolidated B-24 Liberators and Avro Lincoln Bombers were made available, supplemented by Avro Anson's and DC3 Dakotas. However, by 1959-60 the use of chartered cheaper flights from private operators in light aircraft became more common and the last RAAF patrol took place in 1963-64. Aerial patrols became common throughout the summer by all forest and fire agencies to supplement the fixed fire tower network. The Western Australian Forests Department went as far as purchasing four Piper PA18 light aircraft in 1978-79 and employed their own pilots to operate reconnaissance flights in conjunction with private planes. A major risk to all air fire operations is reduced visibility due to dust, smoke, fog and even low cloud. It was reported as early as 22 March 1945 that visibility was reduced to zero and all RAAF reconnaissance aircraft were grounded with the result that a fire near Toolangi reached a considerable size before being detected.

Aerial photography can be traced back to 1858 but matured during WW1 with the discovery that vertical photos taken with 60% overlap could be used to create a three-dimensional effect when viewed in a stereoscope. Aerial photography was used extensively to map the trenches of the Western Front and in January 1918, General Allenby deployed five Australian pilots from No.1 Squadron AFC on a dangerous mission to photograph 624 square miles in Palestine to update maps of the Turkish positions after the success of the Australian Light Horse at Beersheba and the retaking of the city of Jerusalem. This pioneering use of aerial reconnaissance proved a major aid for the rapidly advancing science of cartography and photogrammetry. Owen Jones, the young Welsh Chairman of the newly formed Forests Commission Victoria had enlisted as one of Britain's original \\"Warbirds\\" in the Royal Flying Corps during WW1 and had long championed the idea of forest surveying, mapping and assessment from aerial photographs so in 1928 the Commission undertook its first major aerial photography project over 15,000 acres of forest. Later, the Tasmanian Forestry Commission undertook Australia's first large scale aerial forest survey in April 1930 when an area of nearly 900 square km (222,000 acres) was photographed in the north-western region by the Air Board. As a result of this initial work, the Commonwealth Government offered in 1933 to conduct an aerial survey of forests in Tasmania at a rate of ¬£10 per square mile or 8 cents/ha including the production of topographic and forest maps. But it wasn't taken up. Needless to say the challenges were formidable for both fledgling forestry organisations including responsibility for vast areas of the rugged, remote country about which little was known. The composite aerial photomosaics were used to produce topographic maps and forest stand mapping. During the war years, large areas of Victoria were photographed by RAAF aircrews and later used by various state government authorities to produce orthophoto maps. During the war there were a number of military aircraft crashes on State forests. By 1945 aerial photography of 13,000 square miles (3.4 M ha) of the forest was completed, including much of the inaccessible forest in the eastern ranges. The photographs proved invaluable for the design of new road alignments and to map new stands of timber. Accordingly, aircraft were managed within the Forests Commission by the Chief Draftsman, Mervyn Bill. An interactive map using the 1945 RAAF photography reveals the extent of Melbourne's suburban post-war growth. As aerial photographic cameras developed and got cheaper in the 1960s and ‚Äò70s all forest services began purchasing their own 70 mm medium format camera equipment and modifying small civilian aircraft to undertake regular surveys collecting information on things like vegetation, logging areas, new road works and bushfire history. Photos were interpreted using steroplotting equipment such as a Zeiss Aero Sketchmaster. Large sheets of A0 parchment, transparent overlay film, a light table, a set of Derwent coloured pencils, Rotering ink pens and a steady hand were needed for mapmaking.  Infra-red mapping ‚Äì FLIR & Linescan  Monitoring fire activity through thick smoke has always been a problem for firefighters. Research over many years had been directed at Infra-Red imagery which can see through smoke (but not cloud or water vapour). Early IR Systems produced images on film in both the 3-5 micron band and 8-14 micron band. A thermographic camera on a gimbal mount. Several approaches were developed in the 1960s by the CSIRO and the Weapons Research Laboratory in conjunction with notable bushfire researcher Alan McArthur from the Commonwealth Forestry and Timber Bureau. In May 1971 the Forests Commission Victoria tested a Bendix mapper in Gippsland to delineate between burnt and unburnt forest after fuel reduction burning. The Mapper was suspended under a Cessna 182 with all the clumsy electronic equipment mounted in the back seat of the aircraft, but the results were disappointing because overnight rain had deadened the temperature difference. The Forests Commission also trialled an infra-red Pyro-vidicon tube system in a Bell Jetranger and Piper Seneca in early 1981 and then borrowed an Inframetrics Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) from the US Forest Service in late 1981 for operations from a light helicopter. In 1982-83, there was an opportunity to test a FLIR unit owned by the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA) during the Cann River fires. The unit was mounted on a Bell Longranger helicopter which proved very useful at identifying smouldering hot spots through thick smoke and to direct ground crews during the mop-up phase. The camera was mounted on a gimbal under the front of the helicopter flying at 6000‚Äì8000 feet (but as low as 300 feet) and operated from the front seat by a navigator. FLIR operates in the 8-14 micron band with a narrow field of view and these trials were a success which prompted the Forests Commission to purchase their own Inframetrics FLIR unit in 1983 which was first used during a bushfire near Lorne shortly after. The use of infra-red linescan technology was first trialled after the Ash Wednesday fires when the Forests Commission used the CSIRO F27 research aircraft to conduct an IR scan of the Warburton/Powelltown fire. The output was essentially IR photography and delays were experienced as the product output was developed. Further use of IR linescan technology occurred during the Cann River fire in 1983 with the NSCA Queenair aircraft conducting IR linescan operations. However, the operational ‚Äúcoming of age‚Äù of this technology occurred a year later during the 1984-85 bushfire season when an infrared linescanner was mounted in a NSCA Kingair 200C and a GAF Nomad aircraft were used to monitor the spread of major fires and the progress of back burning across North Eastern Victoria. Scanning was predominantly conducted during the night and the imagery made available to the fire controller by 5 am. This enabled firefighting tactics to be developed well before the day shift crews were due to leave base camps. Black and white photographs were produced of the line scan imagery by the local chemist in Bright and were provided to ground crews departing to the fireline. Victorian forest firefighters have rarely ever had such accurate and detailed information available to them at that time of the day. A number of remotely controlled Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), also known as drones, were hired by Emergency Management Victoria and the Department of Environment Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) in 2016 to test their effectiveness as a low cost means to gather intelligence at bushfires, planned burns and floods. Melbourne and Metropolitan Fire Brigade drones fitted with infrared cameras were used successfully at a burning peat fire at Cobden ‚Äì Camperdown in April 2018 and again at a bushfire at Rosedale in January 2019 to detect hot spots during the mopping-up operation.  Digital fire mapping and GPS navigation  The geospatial revolution in bushfire mapping and navigation came of age when powerful computers and the internet converged with a number of new digital technologies including: Snowy River bushfire in Eastern Victoria at night in February 2014. The bushfire which lasted for 70 days grew to 165 800 ha and was roughly the same size as Melbourne. Also visible are the fires at the Hazelwood coalmine and Kilmore.

Firebombing  The Forests Commission Victoria developed a strong relationship with the RAAF from the 1930s through to the early 1960s.

Firebombing in a military sense was developed during WW2 and designed to damage a target using incendiary devices, rather than from the blast effect of large bombs. However, the term ‚Äúfirebombing‚Äù, although commonly used, is not an accurate description when applied to aerial firefighting although some of the early experiments included dropping ‚Äúbomb like‚Äù containers from military aircraft. The effectiveness of aerial firebombing is complex and depends on many factors including: aircraft turn- around time, distance from fire, aircraft type (fixed wing vs rotary), aircraft performance, load size, terrain, drop characteristics, drop door system, ambient weather conditions, wind, availability of ground support, fire intensity, fire size, fuel type, pilot skill and suppressant used. Firebombing improves the chances of a first attack on a bushfire being successful by up to 50 per cent when the Fire Danger FFDI ranges from moderate to high (<24). However, the chances of success fall rapidly as the fire danger index rises, fuel loads increase and delays in reaching the fire extend. For example, the probability of success drops to less than 20% if the FFDI is severe (>50) and the delay is more 30 minutes. These figures are significantly affected by the presence or absence of ground crews. Limitations of firebombing are often determined by: # the rate, at which aircraft can deliver retardant, water or foam on the fire, and # a threshold fire intensity above which a fire will spot across or burn through a control line. Firebombing is not generally effective against high intensity, fast moving bushfires. The upper limit of fire intensity is estimated to be about 2,000 kW/m in eucalypt forest fuel which roughly equates to the limits which can be handled by either ground crews alone or ground crews supported by fire tankers, graders, bulldozers, etc. Severe bushfires, such as on Black Saturday, generated intensities in excess of 100,000 kW/m, whereas prescribed burns are usually less than 500 kW/m. For comparison, a large household radiator emits about 1 kW. Firebombing fails on its own as a containment strategy if the fire behaviour includes medium or long distant spotting. Aircraft can be very effective at slowing a fires rate of spread burning in remote locations giving more time for the arrival of ground crews. In a few cases firebombing has been sufficient to extinguish small fires such as a single trees or very small spots. Firebombing aircraft play an important role but there is no substitute for \\"boots-on-the- ground\\". However, firebombing with foam can very effective at extinguishing grass fires in open farmland, protecting houses by knocking down flames or working in conjunction with ground crews. In March 2010, an evaluation trial for the operational use of Night Vision Goggle (NVG) for aerial incendiary operations was conducted in Victoria, the first known operation of this type in the world. The use of NVGs was extended to night firebombing using a Sikorsky S-61 in 2018 and implemented operationally for the first time at a large uncontrolled bushfire near Rosedale on 5 January 2019. Fire bombing when weather conditions are milder has significant advantages. One unique aspect of this operation was hover-filling helicopters at night rather landing them to refill which greatly reduced the turn-around times.  Early trials  Anglesea - Melbourne Herald Newspaper, Dec 1946.alt=435x435px The first trials of using aircraft to attack fires in Australia were conducted in Victoria in 1937-38 when the Forests Commission carried out tests in conjunction with Australian Paper Manufactures (APM) dropping brine solution (bitterns) in cartons. The chemical which is a by-product of salt manufacture was found to have a greater deadening effect on fire than water alone but was difficult to use.

Further trials were conducted by the Forests Commission just after the end of WW2 at Anglesea in Victoria beginning in November 1946 to compare the performance of RAAF P51 Mustangs, Consolidated B-24 Liberators and Avro Lincoln Bombers dropping ammonium sulphate compounds in 500 lb bombs from about 100 feet which were designed to burst on impact. Several containers were tested on small fires for their accuracy, falling and bursting characteristics. The results were encouraging but inconclusive. Almost a year later in 1947 American firefighters also began experimenting with water-filled bombs dropped from B-29 Superfortess and P-47 Thunderbolts. The US Forest Service had experimented before the War by kicking 5-gallon cans of water out the doors of aircraft.\\"Water Bombs for Forest Fires\\" Popular Mechanics, October 1947 In 1958, NSW fire authorities trialled a Tiger Moth crop duster to drop water on grass fires as well as sodium calcium borate on grass fires burning beneath low open scrub. The aircraft was fitted with a fiberglass hopper with a 255-litre capacity. The results were not encouraging although the NSW Fire Control Officer at the time, Harry R. Luke, commented that the technique could not be completely discounted. After a lull, the Forests Commission Victoria resumed testing of retardants in 1961-62 and experimented with dropping water thickened with bentonite clay from a Ceres CA-28 aircraft. Also, on 6 April 1962 the Country Fire Authority (CFA) conducted an exercise at Wonga Park near Melbourne to test the efficiency of fire retardants from the air compared to application from a ground fire tanker. The bentonite clay was shown to hold water together into larger droplets and reduce drift improving fire retardant effects compared to water. This trial was followed in 1965 using a Piper Pawnee to drop the new chemical retardant Phoschek provided by Monsanto. The work included lighting experimental fires and established that chemical retardant concentrations of 0.25 to 1.5 litres per square metre could be applied to ground fuel through a forest canopy and that it stopped a fire burning with an intensity of approximately 600 KW/m. Concurrent testing of Phoschek continued over the next few years using a Snow Commander, Cessna Ag Wagon and De Haviland Beaver at Keotong in north east Victoria. The results were encouraging enough for the FCV to report in 1965-66 that ‚Äúon the basis of the trials held over the last three years, a technique has been developed for firebombing with chemicals.‚ÄùForest Commission Annual Reports  Airfields and firebombing bases  The results of the preceding firebombing trials were encouraging enough for the Forests Commission Victoria to establish fully operational firebombing bases at Benambra and to construct a bush airstrip on the remote Snowy Plains in 1965-66. Snowy Plains at 5300 feet is the highest airfield in Australia and provided unique access to the eastern ranges as a firebombing base. Later, in 1967-68, the Victoria Valley airstrip in the centre of Grampians was also established.  1967 Benambra - an Australian milestone  Piper Pawnees that flew Australia's first operational firebombing mission from Benambra in February 1967. Source: National Aerial Firefighting Centre (NAFC). On 6 February 1967 two Piper Pawnees from Benambra near Omeo, flown by Ben Buckley and Bob Lansbury, made Australia's first operational drop of fire retardant slurry on a small lightning-strike. The 15 drops were able to contain the remote fire to less than one hectare long enough to enable ground crews to walk many hours across rugged terrain to reach it and make it safe. Up to that time, there had been a remarkable range of experiments with different aircraft such as heavy military four engine bombers, single seat fighters and small agricultural aircraft with differing drop materials, techniques and equipment. But this was the first real firebombing job, and the beginning of modern aerial firefighting operations in Australia. The \\"proof of concept\\" that resulted from the firebombing at Benambra combined with new and more powerful aircraft into the late 1960s led to improved techniques for handling, mixing, storing and loading equipment for Phoschek. By the early 1970s, the NSW Forestry Commission experimented with a new product Firetrol 931 dropped from Beaver aircraft with the principal advantage that it could be mixed virtually \\"in situ\\" inside the aircraft. The Forest Department in WA undertook trails in 1976 which among other things compared the canopy penetration and coverage of both Phoschek and Firetrol 931. Innovations continued and on 3 March 1970, a Canadian de Haviland Twin Otter was trialled at Snowy Plains fitted with two 1100 litre membrane tanks which were slashed by a guillotine to discharged the load and control the drop pattern. Later more efficient and reliable mechanical ‚Äúdump doors‚Äù were developed.

Modern firebombing operations generally conducted with a mixture of both fixed and rotary wing helicopters. The tactics and systems evolved rapidly and largely ran in parallel with improvement in aircraft. All forest and fire services were early adopters of new developments. Fixed-wing aircraft must make a pass over the fire to make a drop of retardant like a bomber. Small agricultural aircraft like the Air Tractor has many advantages when the terrain and distances to the fire became critical. They can usually carry larger loads but are sometimes limited by landing grounds and mountainous terrain. The advent of high performance turboprop engines over radial piston engines increased performance and load- carrying capacity particularly when operating in mountainous terrain in hot and high conditions when the air density begins to thin. Air Tractor AT-802 water bomber Helicopters have a major advantage of being able to hover over the fire and accurately drop water, foam or retardant. They can also pick up water from shallow dams or rivers using snorkels to fill their belly tanks or dipping a collapsible bucket suspended on a line. The first water bucket was probably developed in Nelson, British Columbia in the mid-1950s and became operational in about 1962. The bucket design was a converted 200 litre drum with a trap door in the bottom that was actuated by the pilot.Corley-Smith, Peter and David N. Parker: Helicopters in the High Country ‚Äì 40 Years of Mountain Flying, page 50. Sono Nis Press, Victoria BC, 1995. Helicopters have proved effective firebombers using water, foam, and retardants. The operating cost of medium helicopters proved higher than fixed-wing aircraft carrying similar loads but their accuracy and ability to pick up retardant close to the fire can make them more cost effective. Medium helicopters such as the Bell 205 and Bell 212 were fitted with Canadian built belly tanks in about 1983-84 which, although had a limited water bombing capacity of about 1,400 litres, were still very effective in tight mountainous terrain providing close support for ground crews working near the fire edge. These NSCA machines were used extensively at the Mt Buffalo fires in January 1985 along with a smaller A√©rospatiale SA 315B Lama with a bucket. The Helitack machines, as they were known, proved their ability to pick up from small dams, tanks or streams, and make accurate drops, particularly with short turn-around-times.  Water/ Foam/ Retardant  Class A Foam and Retardant are some of the various chemicals mixed with water to improve their fire suppression efficacy. Water is efficient at extinguishing fire, and usually has the advantage of being available at little cost, but when dropped from an aircraft has big disadvantages because it breaks up in the air-stream and a significant proportion erodes into mist and either evaporates before it hits the target or falls in concentrations too light to be effective against a fire, so its extinguishing properties do not last very long. Water is only effective if dropped directly on flames.phoschek retardant (shaded red) to control a fire started by lightning on the summit of Mt Buggery in the Victorian Alpine National Park. A firebombing base was established at nearby Mt Buller. Dec 2013. Source: Peter McHugh. Trials showed that only about one-third of a 420-litre load of water dropped from a Piper Pawnee reached the target in concentrations high enough to be effective. The percentage lost from bigger loads appeared to be less, probably because erosion occurs at the surface of the load and the surface area/volume ratio of the mass dropped is less for bigger loads. Early trials also demonstrated that the poor drop characteristics of water could be improved significantly by additives which increase the viscosity and hold it together as it falls from the aircraft. Most firefighting aircraft can drop either salt or fresh water. However, for helicopters equipped with bellytanks and use hover-fill pumps, or those with buckets on ‚Äòshort‚Äô lines, pilots prefer to use fresh water to avoid ingesting salt into the turbine engines which are susceptible to corrosion. Class A Foam is akin to detergent. It is added or injected into the load of water in a helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft and when its dropped the shearing action as it falls through the air causes bubbles to form which improves the smothering or ‚Äúknock down‚Äù effect on the flames, allowing it to be more effective and to remain on the ground for a longer period. Class A Foam is often applied directly to the fire in close support of ground crews. Retardants are generally a slurry that contains a mixture of water and ammonium phosphate or ammonium sulphate. Sodium calcium borate was one of the earlier chemicals used in North America and then trialled in Australia. Since the mid 1950s most of the chemical retardants used for firebombing throughout the world rely on either of these chemicals to provide the fire-retardant ingredient. They also contain a thickening agent to increase viscosity and other agents to inhibit corrosion and provide colour. Unlike foam or water, retardant is laid ahead of the fire and coats the fuel and as the fire burns into the line of retardant a chemical reaction occurs that effectively slows the fire. The main advantage of retardant is that it remains effective for some time after it has been dropped. Firebreaks can be constructed using lines of retardant.  Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System (MAFFS)  Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System (MAFFS) - 1982. Source: Bryan Rees. FCRPA* collection.alt=left By the early 1980s, a dedicated core of aviation staff had accumulated considerable expertise at using and managing Victoria's expanding fleet of firefighting aircraft and once again led the innovation of new aerial firefighting techniques in Australia. During the summer of 1981-82 equipment was borrowed from the United States Forest Service for evaluation under operational conditions in Victoria. The equipment known as Modular Airborne Firefighting System (MAFFS) was trialled bombing bushfires with a slurry of an Australian made chemical fire retardant (Amgard-A11) in quantities up to 11,000 litres per drop. A C-130 Hercules was obtained from the Royal Australian Air Force for the trials. The roll on/roll off system was installed and operated by 36 Squadron from RAAF Richmond in NSW but operated from Hamilton, Mangalore and RAAF East Sale for the trial. MAFFS could deliver a much greater volume than was possible with the smaller agricultural aircraft contracted to the Forests Commission at the time and was used effectively in the suppression of bushfires at Broadford, Bright and Orbost. Due to its low usage in 1981-82 MAFFS was again trialled in 1982-83 where it made 175 drops. Some of the conclusion from the MAFFS trial was that while it was generally successful at integrating into FCV fire suppression organisation it did not significantly expand its aerial attack capability. Larger loads were offset by the lengthy turnaround times, canopy penetration and sometimes difficult terrain. The system was also judged expensive to operate. For many years there had been both strong advocates and critics of using large firebombing aircraft in Australia so to settle the controversy the Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Fraser, in September 1980, offered to fund and sponsor further evaluation under controlled conditions in ‚ÄúProject Aquarius‚Äù under the direction of the CSIRO's Division of Forest Research. This time a DC6 hired from the Canadian company Conair, two medium helicopters (Bell 212, Bell 206B) and a small agricultural aircraft (Thrush Commander) were tested on deliberately lit experimental fires at Nowa Nowa in 1983-84. Aircraft performance was pitted against ground crews.  Large Air Tankers (LAT) and heavy lift helicopters  A McDonnell Douglas DC-10 drops retardant in California - Aug 2013.

Project Aquarius in conjunction with more powerful and capable aircraft with improved retardant delivery systems paved the way for modern Large Air Tankers (LAT's) such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 which can carry nearly 45,000 litres of retardant and are now commonly engaged in Australia each summer. The National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA) conducted its first firebombing operations using Canadian designed helicopter bellytanks on behalf of Victorian fire agencies in 1983-84. In 1986-87, the NSCA based at Sale in Victoria twinned with Conair Aviation to streamline the international movement of aircraft between the southern and northern hemispheres. Conair deployed a Fokker friendship F27 which could carry 6,000 litres of retardant and cruise at 230 knots. The drop pattern could be adjusted by controlling the dump doors and varied from 100 to 900 m in length. However, it wasn't until 1996 that the Australasian Fire Authorities Council (AFAC) funded trials of the Bombardier CL-415 water scooping aircraft in Victorian Otway Ranges. Although effective, the limited number of suitable water bodies in Australia somewhat restricts their operational use.Erickson S-64 Air Crane Helicopter could carry 9500 litres and consumed nearly 2,000 litres of fuel per hour. But the technology of firebombing continued to improve and by 1997-98 Victoria contracted the largest contingent of aircraft for aerial firefighting to date in anticipation of a severe summer. It included 6 light helicopters, 4 medium helicopters, 10 fixed wing firebombers, 1 infra-red line scanning fixed wing aircraft and 1 light reconnaissance twin engine fixed wing aircraft. The introduction of heavy firebombing helicopters like the Erickson S-64 Air Crane (Elvis) that could lift and carry 9500 litres of water and had a 45-second hover fill time didn't occur until 1997-98. And later in 2003-04, the National Aerial Firefighting Centre supported funding of two large firebombing helicopters, a Mil 8 and Bell 214B to support Victoria's firebombing operations. By 2010-11, Victoria contracted two Convair 580 Multi Engine Air Tankers (MEATs) for operational trials in Victoria with each aircraft capable of carrying a load of 8,000 litres. The greater use of Large Air Tankers and heavy-lift helicopters forced major changes to fuel and retardant handling logistics. Medium helicopters like the Bell 214 require about 600 litres of fuel per hour, or three standard 200 litre drums, whereas heavy-lift helicopters like the Erickson Air Crane were fitted with massive 4,900 litre fuel tanks and consumed about 2,000 litres per hour. This led to the development of purpose- built 30,000 litre pressurised refuelling tankers and mobile hot refueling crews rather than manually handling heavy 200 litre drums. Similarly, Large Air Tankers such as the DC-10 required about 9,000 litres of fuel per hour but landed at commercial airfields with bulk refuelling facilities, but the DC-10 could carry up to 45,000 litres of retardant which led to changes in Phoschek transport, mixing, handling and storage. Evaluations continue as the next generation of Very Large Air Tankers (VLATS) and heavy-lift helicopters become available. The largest is the 747 Supertanker with a carrying capacity of 74,000 litres.  Aerial ignition  Experience and research have shown that reducing available fuel influences the rate of spread and intensity of bushfires. Other factors such as the weather, wind speed, relative humidity and temperature cannot be controlled. Cessna 337. Source Australian National Archives - 1968. From the early 1960s pioneering work by foresters in Western Australia in conjunction with Bob Vines and David Packham from the CSIRO Division of Physical Chemistry developed aerial ignition techniques to reduce fuels under mild conditions over vast areas of the relatively flat terrain of Western Australia's state forest. A machine was designed to drop small plastic capsules of potassium permanganate crystals which were injected with ethylene glycol just before being ejected from the aircraft. A delayed chemical reaction resulting in a small fire on the ground lasted for some 30 seconds. The first trial was at Manjimup in December 1965 and later improvements followed. The spacing of the ignitions was about 200 m and could be controlled by the adjusting the speed of the aircraft to about 100 knots and adjusting the dwell between drops to one every four seconds. Great emphasis was placed on maintaining an even grid pattern but this proved a demanding task flying 400 feet above the ground and various techniques were tried.

While the development of an aerial incendiary machine by the CSIRO was progressing the Forests Commission Victoria was developing a system for use with helicopters. The DIAD (Delayed Action Incendiary Devices) was a large double-ended match with a length of safety fuse between. Forestry Tasmania started using DIADs around the same time. They were stored in a metal box outside the helicopter along with a disposable striker patch attached to a special half-door. A navigator sat in the middle beside the pilot and the bombardier's role was to strike and then drop the lighted DIADs. After about 17 seconds the large section of the DIAD would ignite and burn for a further 40 seconds, enough to start a small spot fire on the ground. The first test was with a Bell 47G on 4 October 1967. Helicopters gave several advantages over fixed wing aircraft including flexibility and greater accuracy of placing incendiaries from a slow-moving aircraft. For larger operations in the remote mountains or desert, a helicopter would fly along ridgetops and ignite hundreds of hectares by dropping DAIDs. The fire would be allowed to trickle slowly down the north facing slopes in the evening until it went out overnight with the dew the following morning or ran into a wet gully. But the 1970s were a relatively wet decade so the gullies were damp and full of soggy tree ferns which would stop most burns. Also, there weren't many people in the bush other than loggers and cattlemen, so it was possible to do this with minimal risk. The first use, anywhere in the world, of DAIDs to backburn a large 49 800 acre fire in north eastern Victoria was undertaken by the Commission in February 1968. The Aerial Drip Torch (ADT) was used for slash burns after logging.

However, the crash of a helicopter conducting aerial ignition on 19 April 1978 with the death of two forest officers and the pilot profoundly shook the small \\"Fraternity of Foresters\\". But it led to better accident insurance for staff involved in air operations, the end of DAIDs and the wider adoption of the safer ping-pong ball aerial incendiary machine. High intensity slash burning is usually needed to achieve satisfactory regeneration after logging and the ping-pong ball machine was not suitable for aerial ignition because a large amount of fire needs to be introduced onto the logging coupe quickly. These areas are also often in steep terrain making ground ignition by crews difficult and dangerous. An idea was conceived in Canada in the 1970s by John Muraro and the New Zealand Forest Service developed an Aerial Drip Torch (ADT) that could be slung under a helicopter in 1982. Forestry Tasmania acquired one of the machines and modified it in February 1987. Also known as a helitorch or ‚Äúdragon‚Äù it consisted of a large 135 litre tank containing jellied petrol, a displacement pump, ignition system of a propane torch and burner nozzle and a fire extinguisher system. It was trialled at Swifts Creek in 1991. Earlier in 1975, Forestry Tasmania and the Physics Department at the University of Tasmania began experiments using a weapons grade laser mounted on a Royal Australian Navy Bofors gun to ignite logging slash but had varied success at igniting canvas targets at distances between 200 m and 500 m.

Aircraft have long been used for reconnaissance and to transport crews and equipment to fires. In 1939, the US Forest Service took delivery of a Stinson Reliant which was for used fire patrols and staff transport and helped explore using paratroopers for fire suppression. While light helicopters like the early Bell 47G and later Bell 206 Jet Ranger were used for reconnaissance, medium helicopters such as the Bell 204 (the civilian version of the military huey) were routinely used for crew and equipment transport. Fixed-wing charter aircraft are often used to shift fire crews and equipment longer distances within states, across the country and even from overseas giving resource flexibility for fire planners and controllers. On many occasions Incident Management Teams (IMT) have been deployed to Australia from America, Canada and New Zealand.  Supply drop  The cardboard helibox with fold-out wings was designed in 1964 to drop supplies to ground crews. FCRPA* collection. The successful dropping of supplies to remote fire crews involved a great deal of experimentation. There were obvious limitations on size, weight and ‚Äúbreakability‚Äù of the items to be dropped. The packaging needed to be designed to sufficiently cushion the fall to minimise damage to its contents but not too bulky or awkward to handle inside the aircraft. The first recorded aerial drops of food supplies to an isolated firefighting crew in Victoria were in 1949 from the RAAF Sikorsky S-51 Dragonfly helicopter. This technique was considerably improved by the development of specially designed free fall containers which provide aerodynamic lift to cushion impact with the ground. Demonstrations by the Air Dispatch Wing of the Royal Australian Army Service Corps at Puckapunyal in 1960 using small parachutes was influential and Forests Commission trials later followed in August at Tallangatta dropping foodstuffs and stores to fire crews from the air. Risks to crews on the ground was a paramount consideration and the tests were suspended but the idea was not altogether forgotten and trials resumed in 1961 and 1963. The result was a large heavy-duty cardboard container being developed in 1964 which employed fold-out wings and was called the ‚Äúhelibox‚Äù. It was suitable for supplies weighing less than 9 kg and best dropped from about 300 feet and became a standard technique. The Search and Rescue Department of the Civil Aviation Authority sought the assistance of the Forests Commission in February 1972 to carry out tests at Managalore airport north of Melbourne with a Fokker Friendship F27 which led to NSW Emergency Services dropping over 3,000 heliboxes during the 1974 floods. However, greater availability of powerful and manoeuvrable helicopters in the late 1970s to transport crews and equipment soon made the cardboard helibox redundant. Special containers and weighted canvas envelopes were developed by the Forests Commission to drop maps and line scanning imagery from fixed wing aircraft before live streaming of data became available. Sling loads lifting small bulldozers with an NSCA Bell 205 was also trialled in about 1982.  Rappelling  The Forests Commission pioneered the use of aircraft for firefighting and crew transport - RAAF Sikorsky S-51 Dragonfly at Erica 1949. Source: State Library of Victoria. Getting firefighters into difficult and inaccessible terrain quickly was a perennial problem. Rappelling or lowering of firefighters from a hovering helicopter was first trialled by the Forests Commission Victoria at Erica not long after WW2 in 1949 using a RAAF Sikorsky S-51 Dragonfly which was normally based at East Sale. The Sikorsky was later used to test reconnaissance and mapping techniques and deploying of men and equipment to remote locations. A Bell 47G helicopter was engaged on a year- round contract by the Forests Commission Victoria in 1965, in what was seen as an Australian first. This machine was stationed at Heyfield and used for rappelling operations. Here seen in front of a group of admiring school children from Swifts Creek. Source: National Archives of Australia. The Forests Commission Victoria then contracted its own Bell 47G in 1964 and after some initial trials at Snowy Plains and Tallangatta established rappel operations based at Heyfield with a two-man crew.DSE (2010). History of helicopter rappel operations in Victoria. Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment. 28 pp. (Page 7). This proved an Australian first and remained in place for the following two fire seasons but lapsed after safety concerns from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) about the use of the small and under powered machine. In 1982, after nearly 18 years absence, rappelling operations recommenced in Victoria using specially equipped and trained crews, usually in multiples of 4 or 6 rappelling lowered from larger and more powerful NSCA Bell 212 and Bell 412 helicopters to attack small fires in remote locations. Rappel crews were also used to construct helipads at larger fires where there were no vehicle tracks access so other additional fire crews and supplies could be ferried in and out by helicopter. In 1985, the newly formed Department of Conservation Forests and Lands (a sequel to the Forests Commission Victoria) commenced its own autonomous rappel program which continues today. Since 1993 an exchange program of rappellers from British Columbia has been conducted and in 2007, nine rappellers from the BC \\"Rapattack\\" program came to Victoria on deployment to assist with the Great Divide fires.  Smoke jumpers  Smoke jumping experiments with parachute drops of firefighters into remote areas were first conducted in the 1930s in America and the Soviet Union. On July 12, 1940, two US Forest Service employees claim to have made history with the first-ever parachute jump into a wildfire on the Nez Perce National Forest in Idaho. In 1952, the Australian Army began training an airborne platoon of about 20 soldiers from the Royal Australian Regiment for deployment to bushfires and flood relief, but the idea never took hold like it did in overseas. The main reason was because of the unique shape of eucalypt trees, with their predominantly upward-facing branches and dry spikes, which are very different to softer pines, made it too dangerous. The technique was superseded by the use of helicopters.  Hover exit  Bell 47J helicopter in September 1958 at Lolo National Forest, Montana. Photo courtesy of the Forest History Society, Durham, N.C.alt=left A variation for rapidly deploying fire crews was to \\"hover exit\\" or jump from a helicopter which was a technique originally developed by the US Forest Service and also in British Columbia, Canada. This technique was initially trialled at Tallangatta with the Forest Commission Victoria's contract Bell 47G in 1964. It was revisited again in 1991 to enable specialist crews to deploy from a maximum height of 1.3 m and is ideally suited where vegetation or terrain prevented a helicopter from conducting a full skid landing such as rocky areas in the Grampians and the desert scrub country in Western Victoria. Keeping the helicopter level with sudden changes in the centre of gravity was a major challenge for pilots and crews.  Aerial seeding  Until about 1964 the standard silvicultural technique for achieving regeneration of harvested eucalypt forest in the mountains of Victoria largely relied on retaining seed trees on the logging coupe as the primary seed source. Seedbeds were prepared either by mechanical disturbance or a hot slash burn in autumn. This method, although satisfactory, lacked reliability and an alternative was to collect and sow seeds by hand, but in steep mountain areas, this was often slow, difficult and expensive. In 1964 the first aerial seeding was carried out in logged areas of Alpine Ash using a small Cessna 180 fitted with two wing pods which each carried about 100 kg of seed. Because the seed was so fine it needed to be bulked up into a small seed ball about 2 mm across by coating with kaolin clay and using mucilage as adhesive. Sometimes small amounts of insecticide and fungicide were added to improve seed survival. This larger size pellet aided the even spreading at a rate of about 1 kg of seed per hectare. The same aircraft was used a year later in 1965 to sow river redgum. Also, in 1965 a larger Piper Pawnee with a larger capacity of 456 kg was used to sow logging coupes on mountainous areas. Based on earlier success an area near Bruthen was sown with the contract Bell 47G helicopter in 1967. The helicopter was considered useful for small areas in awkward locations that the cheaper fixed-wing aircraft could not easily or safely access. Aerial Seeding of logged areas - Powelltown 1967. Flight lines were marked by crews on the ground waving flags at each side of the coupe. Experiments with different aircraft, seed bulking and spreading equipment continued over the next decade and aerial seeding of harvested eucalypts has now become the normal operational practice.  Aerial application of fertiliser, herbicides, and insecticides  As with agricultural crops many forests respond to the application of fertiliser. Australian soils are noted for their lack of phosphorus although many trees also respond to the application of nitrogen and trace elements. Most research was focused on the establishment of exotic plantations forest rather than native forest. As Victoria's Plantation Establishment program (PX) ramped up in the early 1960s it made sound economic sense to maximise productivity by the aerial application of fertiliser. The techniques for the aerial application of fertilizer for other agricultural crops were well established so needed little modification for softwood plantations. Most of the work was pioneered by South Australian Woods and Forest Department in the late 1950s using aircraft of the era such as tiger moths. While in Victoria, following the spreading of superphosphate in forests near Mt Gambier in 1964 it was apparent that the distribution had been uneven. The problem was taken up by the CSIRO and the Aeronautical Research Laboratories in Melbourne with a view to developing improved spreading equipment for agricultural aircraft. Trials began in 1965 at Moorabbin airport and the results were encouraging. The Forests Commission remained concerned about the uneven spread of fertiliser and its research branch continued studies in 1970-71 to examine granulated superphosphate fertiliser. The first was at Melton and the second at the Scarsdale plantations near Ballarat using a Pawnee aircraft spreading at a rate of 627 kg/ha and a speed of 90 knots over young stands pinus radiata. Based on the success of this work, spreading of fertiliser in softwood across Victoria became routine. Other States such as Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia also experimented with aerial applications of fertiliser. The main use of aerial applied herbicides has been for removal of woody weeds such as eucalypts and wattles or grasses in newly established plantations or reforestation areas. The growth of seedlings can be severely restricted by competition from weeds for moisture and nutrients. Prior to the use of herbicides, weeds were controlled by hand and often required several costly repeat operations. Aerial spraying was used to control vegetation along new firebreaks in 1946. Experiments with the use of the herbicide 2-4-5-T began in 1966 by the Forests Commission in Britannia range near Powelltown to control wattle in eucalypt reforestation areas. The Queensland Forest service had begun earlier trials in 1957 using a Tiger moth. Trials of a spray boom were undertaken slung under a Hughes 500 helicopter in 1975 at Myrtleford in North East Victoria. However, because of growing fears about the use of 2,4,5-T herbicide all uses was suspended in June 1978 and alternatives chemicals were examined. Many forests and plantations are subject to attack by insect pests which can sometimes reach plague proportions and may require control measures insecticide. In rough or mountainous areas aerial application was seen as the most effective technique. In August 1930 brown foliage began to appear in pinus radiata stands in the Yarrowee plantation south of Ballarat caused by leaf-eating case moth larvae. Calcium arsenate dust was applied using a RAAF Tiger Moth from No. 1 Squadron. In 1962 aircraft dropped baits to control of vermin damage in pine plantations. The phasmatid Didymuria violescens or stick insect is commonly found in the forests of south east Australia but when it reaches high numbers it can be very destructive of mountain ash and alpine ash. The insect reached plague proportions during 1952 in stands of alpine ash in the Bago State Forest in NSW and became a serious threat to valuable timber stands. A Dakota DC3 aircraft was used to spray the insect pest but was found to be unsuitable because of the long runway required and difficulty flying cumbersome aircraft in mountainous terrain. The Forestry Commission of NSW undertook more research into insecticide applications and the De Haviland corporation provided a DHC2 Beaver aircraft for more trials in 1957. The CSIRO and the NSW Forestry Commission then evaluated the effectiveness of the application and later in 1960 began using a Bristol 171 Sycamore helicopter borrowed from Ansett-ANA. In Victoria, the State Electricity Commission also became concerned in about 1960 about phasmatid populations in the Kiewa Hydro-electric catchments in north east Victoria and began a major spraying program of maldison insecticide mixed with diesel based on the experience gained in NSW, while the Forests Commission Victoria carried out fixed-wing applications in Pinnabar. Major infestations of 1939 regrowth mountain ash were also observed in 1960 near Powelltown and an annual spraying program commenced that continued for more than a decade.  Rain making  alt=Battery of Stiger Vortex rain-making guns at Charleville, Queensland, 1902 Australia is well known for being one of the driest continents on earth, which is often beset with prolonged droughts, so any opportunity to increase rainfall was seen of great national significance and many innovative and sometimes bizarre ideas were put forward. However, the results from early cloud seeding trials of dropping dry ice from a RAAF Consolidated B24 Liberator on 5 February 1947 in NSW near Sydney were spectacular. It rained for about 3 hours producing over 12 mm uniformly distributed over an area of about 80 square km while surrounding clouds produced no rain. This is believed to be the first documented case anywhere in the world of appreciable man-made rainfall reaching the ground and the first time that dynamic cloud growth had followed seeding.McKay A, 1976, ‚ÄòThe rain-makers‚Äô, In: Surprise and Enterprise, Fifty Years of Science for Australia, White F, Kimpton D (eds), CSIRO Publishing, p.33. Over the next 18 years, the RAAF and CSIRO Division of Cloud Physics collaborated with state forest, fire and agricultural agencies testing different aircraft, chemicals, techniques, and delivery systems. Overall the results were mixed and most cloud seeding programs were wound up by the late 1970s. Although the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works and the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission continued with the aim of increasing overall rainfall across large water catchment areas through to the 1990s.http://www.ecosmagazine.com/?act=view_file&file;_id=EC69p26.pdf  Escalation in the use of aircraft and lessons learned  From humble beginnings when, for example, the Forests Commission Victoria began aerial photography in 1928, fire reconnaissance in RAAF Westland Wapitis in February 1930, contracted a Bell 47G in 1964, and then successfully proved fire bombing at Benambra in 1967, Australia now has a large fleet of firefighting and forestry aircraft with support staff available each summer. The many trials, collaboration and research, together with technological advances in fixed and rotary-wing aircraft, led to widespread adoption of aircraft by foresters and firefighters particularly when it was demonstrated that firebombing could improve the chances of a first attack on a bushfire being successful by up to 50 per cent, when the Fire Danger FFDI is low to moderate. Aerial ignition, crew transport and rappelling also proved successful. The summer of 1977-78 was characterised by a build-up of extreme fire danger in most areas of southern Australia. There were 606 outbreaks of fire in Victoria, of which 77 occurred over a period of three days from 15‚Äì17 January. Lightning caused most of these in the alpine areas of the State. Many were controlled quickly but eight developed into major fires and stage 2 of the State Disaster Plan was enacted. Then the Army and Airforce were called to assist 850 Forests Commission staff and employees. A notable feature was the very important part played by military helicopters such as the Bell 204 Huey in moving crews and supplies. This was probably the first time large military helicopters had been used to support Australian firefighters on such a scale. Five small firebombers also dropped over 100,000 litres of retardant, 8 smaller helicopters and a number of light fixed wing aircraft were deployed. The cost of fire suppression for the year 1977-78 was an unprecedented $3.3 million. Iroquois helicopters were deployed to Victorian bushfires in January 1978. This was probably the first time large military helicopters had been used to support Australian firefighters on such a scale. They were invaluable at moving fire crews and equipment into the remote mountains. The Ash Wednesday bushfires occurred in south-eastern Australia on 16 February 1983. Over its twelve-hour rampage, more than 180 fires fanned by winds of up to 110 km/h caused widespread destruction across Victoria and South Australia. Years of severe drought and extreme weather combined to create one of Australia's worst fire days since Black Friday in 1939. In Victoria, 47 people died, while in South Australia there were a further 28 deaths. Over 16,000 firefighters combatted the blazes and a variety of equipment was used, including 400 vehicles (fire-trucks, water tankers and dozers) and 40 aircraft including 11 RAAF Iroquois and commercial helicopters. The Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser then directed the RAAF to supply a CH47 Chinook to support remote firefighting operations on Mount Buffalo transporting large quantities of personnel and cargo onto the plateau. Forests Commission annual expenditure on fire suppression for 1982-83 rose to $16.8 million. The pattern was repeated in the summer of 1984-85 with the largest single aerial firefighting operation in Australia up to that time. Lightning strikes started fires in north eastern Victoria which were in remote, inaccessible mountain country where firefighting was difficult, hazardous and slow. One hundred and eleven fires started on the afternoon on 14 January 1985 and burnt more than 150,000 ha with a perimeter in excess of 1,000 km before they were brought under control after about two weeks. About one-third of the perimeter had to be established and held in steep mountain country where there was no conventional vehicle access.Hodgson A, Summary of Significant Events ‚Äì 1984/85 Fire Season. Presented to the Australian Association of Rural Fire Authorities. Perth 6-9 May 1985 At the peak of the campaign more than 3,000 people were directly deployed on fire fronts or in close support, including 2,000 from the Department of Conservation Forests and Lands (CFL), 500 CFA volunteers, 449 Armed Services personnel, 120 sawmill employees and 50 State Electricity Commission employees. Major equipment used included 75 bulldozers, 400 tankers, 20 helicopters and 16 fixed-wing aircraft. Navy Wessex and Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopters were used to lift crews and equipment while smaller Bell Kiowa reconnaissance helicopters were also effectively deployed. NSCA helicopter bellytanks more than proved their worth. Expenditure for the year was $10.5 million. The tempo, size and severity of bushfire incidents in southern Australia intensified throughout the 1990s and into 2002-03, 2006-07, Black Saturday in 2009 and 2013-14, each which involved ever-larger numbers of aircraft. For example, the 2006-07 Great Divide Complex Fires in Victoria was referred to by some commentators as a \\"mega fire\\" with the campaign lasting for nearly 3 months burning over one million hectares. A total of 8200 hours were flown with between 55-65 aircraft engaged at any one time and an additional 200 were on call. The highest ever number of individual aircraft sorties were recorded. The Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser made a RAAF CH-47 Chinook helicopter available to firefighters at Mt Buffalo in the wake of the Ash Wednesday bushfires in Victoria in 1983.All States of Australia now rely heavily on expensive firefighting aircraft. After Black Saturday in 2009 it was reported to the Royal Commission that the Sikorsky S-64 (Elvis) air crane cost A$20,000 a day to keep on standby plus an additional $11,000 a day to operate. Fuel was a further significant cost with the aircraft consuming about 2,000 litres per hour. Whereas, smaller reconnaissance helicopters such as Eurocopter AS350 √âcureuil proved cheaper, costing about $1,500 per day on standby and $1,000 more to operate. The overall cost of having a fleet on stand-by for the 2008-09 financial year in Victoria was $18 million, plus an additional $16 million in operating charges. In NSW, an additional A$38 million was set aside in 2017 by the Rural Fire Service for two new Large Air Tankers (LAT), DC-10 and Lockheed L100, to supplement their existing aircraft fleet including two ex-Army Blackhawks. A similar situation existed in America in 2003 where the US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management reported to a senate committee that together they own, lease, or contract over 1,000 aircraft each fire season and spend in excess of US$250 million. This prompted the US Forest Service to review its aging large firebombing fleet. However, with increasing use of LATs and heavy-lift helicopters such as the Sikorsky Air Crane fire authorities expected to see these figures rise. For example, in 2012, the US Forest Service contracted a DC-10 with daily standing charge of about US$50,000 plus an hourly flight rate of about US$22,000. Costs for retardant (about US$1/litre), fuel, ground support staff are generally additional. There is ample evidence and general consensus amongst firefighters about the effectiveness of deploying aircraft for aggressive initial attack to keep fires small or to provide tactical air support for fire crews on the ground. In California, the US Forest Service has an annual expenditure of about US$200 million to suppress 98% of wildfires and up to US$1 billion to suppress the other 2% of fires where initial attack fails and they become large. However, rising costs of large firebombing aircraft have led some critics to question the strategy of relying on them for prolonged attack operations on relatively stationary fire fronts or for building lengthy retardant control lines. water scooping aircraft like the Bombardier CL-415. The Australasian Fire Authorities Council (AFAC) funded trials in the Otways in 1996. It was found that the aircraft requires over 1.3 km of open water, at least 2m deep, with clear entry and exits and unlike Canada, there are a limited number of suitable water bodies in Australia. Although a smaller AT-802F with amphibious floats capable of carrying 3000 litres became available in 2016. Whereas, in response to global warming and the threat of increased bushfires, the Australian Greens have outlined a policy for the Australian Defence Force to establish a \\"wilderness firefighting unit\\" by purchasing three Bombardier 415 water bombers for about A$150 million to be flown and serviced by Air Force and Army personnel. Some are even calling for military aircraft to drop sonic bombs to \\"snuff out\\" bushfires in the way you blow out birthday candles.  Air Attack Supervision (AAS)  Aircraft provide the ideal platform for many tasks including reconnaissance, mapping, air observing, rappelling and some highly specialised roles developed as aircraft became more common in bushfires. Thankfully, serious accidents and incidents reported to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority have been few. Valuable lessons about using aircraft, particularly after the 1985 alpine bushfires at Mt Buffalo, led to new training programs and safety manuals for air observers, incendiary operators, hot refueling crews, rappellers, retardant mixers as well as specialist Air Attack Supervisors (AAS) to more efficiently manage and utilise aircraft resources. The AAS has responsibility for directing complex aerial firebombing, setting priorities and communicating with all aircraft and with fire crews on the ground. It requires judgement to ensure the firebombing remains safe and effective. They operate in separate aircraft and orbit the fire at a higher altitude. High wing aircraft such as the Cessna 182 or light helicopters such as the Eurocopter AS350 √âcureuil are common AAS platforms.  National Aerial Firefighting Centre (NAFC)  While the responsibility for bushfire suppression, and therefore aircraft use, rests with the Governments of each of the Australian States and Territories, the National Aerial Firefighting Centre (NAFC) was formed in July 2003 to coordinate national arrangements for contacting and sharing valuable firefighting aircraft. The national fleet comprises approximately 130 contracted fixed-wing, helicopters and Large Air Tankers (LAT) which supplements many state-owned, and state-contracted aircraft to meet peak demand across Australia making up more than 500 aircraft, provided by over 150 operators. In 2015-16, aircraft from the national fleet were activated 5,000 times and made nearly 30,000 firebombing drops. Reciprocal arrangements are in place between all Australian States and many overseas countries to share aircraft and specialist expertise like Air Attack Supervisors so some common international aviation guidelines with standard terminology are being developed to facilitate global deployments. Many large aircraft and aircrews rotate between the northern and southern hemispheres.

The park is located in the Oktyabrsky district of the city.  History  Earlier the Novoposelensky garden was in the place of the park of Builders. It was founded in 1903 during the construction of the building of the People's Theater. Earlier in this place was the estate of the petty bourgeois Garbuz and near the estate was Garbuz Garden, named after the owner of the estate. On the territory of the garden were planted whole sites with fruit trees. It was possible to get to Novopoliselensky garden from several sides because there were several entrances. The first entrance was from Budyonnovsky Prospekt, and it was considered the main entrance. The second was located from Pochtovy Lane opposite to 5th Street. From the street of the 6th was located 2 avenues, one went from a main entrance to the entrance from Pochtovy Lane and came to 5th Street. Other avenue went perpendicular to the first, began from a northern entrance with 6th Street, and reached the place where the closed platform was constructed later. Over time a dance floor appeared in the south-western part of the park. Along the Postal Lane a summer restaurant was built on the territory from the entrance to the 6th street. The territory of the park was divided into squares it was crossed by tracks that were covered with tyrsa. Over time lime trees, acacias, ornamental shrubs and flower beds were planted here. The metal lattice was the first fencing of a garden, the brick fence appeared over time. On northeast side of the park was located the summer theater: a wooden design which contained the sliding blinds used for airing of the room. As of 1909 the Novoposelensky garden was one of two existing gardens of Rostov-on-Don for city use - the second object of such a plan was called the City Garden. The territory of both gardens was occupied by plantings of trees, the total area of which occupied 13 acres of land. On the preserved plan of the city according to the edition of 1911, the territory of green plantations carried the name of Novoposelensky garden. The territory of the Novoposelensky Garden in Rostov-on-Don was located between the Pochtovy Lane and Taganrog Avenue passed along Sixth Street- The documents preserved the mention of the garden created before 1917. Then Novoposelensky garden was renamed and began to be called the park of V. Mayakovsky. It happened during the 1940s - 1950s. The District House of Officers of the North Caucasus Military District became its owner. During this period the park was well- planned and restored, flowerbeds were put in order, new green plantings appeared. The main alley of the park was asphalted and the lawns were cleaned. On the territory of the park there were new benches, volleyball and tennis courts were equipped. In the period from spring to autumn on the equipped film platform there took place viewing chronicle and documentary films. In the 1960s the military left this place for a decade no one was engaged in the improvement of the park everything fell into decay. Under the mayor of the city G. Ye. Konovalov the fences around the park were broken. The park began to visit the citizens, as a result of which many flower beds and lawns were trampled, and benches and other objects were broken. The park was renamed the Park of Cultures of Builders and was inaugurated on November 7, 1976. It again began to be visited by people and be considered a place of rest. In 1987 a monument to the victims of Stalin's repressions appeared on the northern part of the park. At the end of XX - at the beginning of the XXI century the park is in unsatisfactory condition. From the old paths, beds and layout in general, little is left. The decorative shrub and many other plantings and objects were destroyed.

Accounts of a life In 1957, the war memoir of a Jewish woman, Stella Krentsbach, circulated in a collection edited by Ukrainian writer Petro Mirchuk. The text began with the words, \\"The reason that I'm alive today and can devote all of my energy to the state of Israel is thanks only to God and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.\\" The memoir author writes that she was born in Bolekhiv, near Lvov, the daughter of a rabbi, and she was a childhood friend of Olya, the daughter of a Greek Catholic priest. In 1939, according to the memoir, Stella Krentsbakh graduated from the Philosophy department of the University of Lviv. When the war broke out, she joined the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, where she served as a nurse and an intelligence officer. In the spring of 1945, with the Soviet forces having recaptured the whole of the Ukraine, the NKVD arrested Stella Krentsbach during a meeting she had with a contact in Rozhniativ. She was jailed and sentenced to death, but UPA fighters managed to free her. In the summer of 1945, she crossed the Carpathians with other Ukrainian insurgents and, on 1 October, she reached the English zone of occupation in Austria, from where she traveled to Israel. In her new country, according to the memoir, she worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Resonance The story of Stella Krentsbakh received significant attention in the Ukrainian diaspora press. Journalists attempted to locate her in Israel, but she could not be found. Stories and rumors started circulating in √©migr√© circles that the woman had been murdered in Israel, supposedly for telling the truth about the UPA's attitude to the Jews. Historian Philip Friedman, a survivor of the Holocaust from Western Ukraine, remarked that \\"the only data about her was published in an Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists paper.\\" He searched through the Washington Post of that period and could not find the memoirs, as he wrote. After making an inquiry to Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he received the reply, as he reported, that they never had an employee there by that name and also that a case of a homicide in Israel with a victim by that name was \\"entirely unknown.\\" Friedman stated he undertook a \\"careful analysis of the text\\" of the memoir and the examination led him to the conclusion that \\"the entire story is a hoax.\\" As American-Canadian historian John-Paul Himka wrote, Bohdan Kordiuk, one-time leader of the Home Executive of UPA, repudiatedin the newspaper Suchasna Ukraina (\\"Contemporary Ukraine\\"), issue no. 15/194, 20 July 1958 the memoirs as fake, soon after their original publication. Kordiuk wrote that \\"none of the UPA men known to the author of these lines knows the legendary Stella Krenzbach or have heard of her. The Jews do not know her either. It is unlikely that anyone of the tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees after the war met Stella Krenzbach\\" and concluded: ‚ÄúIt seems to us that until there are proper proofs, the story of Dr. Stella Krenzbach has to be regarded as a mystification.‚Äù Accusations of propaganda Both supporters and deniers of the veracity of the Stella Krenzbach life story have accused the other side of propaganda. Jewish-Ukrainian poet Moysey Fishbein attributed the disputes of the Krenzbach memoir to \\"Russia's special services\\" that \\"are seeking to destabilize the situation in Ukraine, undermine its sovereignty and independence, create a negative image of this country, block its integration into European and Euro-Atlantic structures, and turn Ukraine into a dependent and manipulated satellite.\\" Fishbein claimed that the Russians \\"attribute exceptional importance\\" to the so-called \\"Jewish card,\\" by seeking to \\"set Ukrainians and Jews against each other.\\" Fishbein's viewpoint was supported by American political analyst Paul A. Goble. Ukrainian historian Volodymyr Viatrovych has repeatedly proclaimed the veracity and accuracy of the Krenzbach life story, as related in the published text, attributing the denials to those who \\"accuse the OUN\\" of having been \\"anti-Semitic.\\" Historian and researcher Grzegorz Rossoli≈Ñski-Liebe denoted the 1957 memoir as \\"fake,\\" and as being part of the \\"memory narrative in which Ukrainians appeared as heroes and victims, but not as perpetrators,\\" a narrative that, as he stated, was \\"from a political perspective, advantageous to the nationalist factions of the Ukrainian diaspora during the Cold War.\\" John-Paul Himka stated that the \\"Stella Krentsbakh/Kreutzbach forged biography\\" shows that the OUN, the UPA, and their \\"promoters\\" have to \\"resort to falsifications to defend their innocence vis-√†-vis the Holocaust,\\" which \\"indicates that they lack real evidence [in] their possession [about the alleged Jewish element among the nationalist organizations],\\" and concluded that \\"no one grabs for fig leaves when they are wearing clothes.\\" See also *Leiba Dobrovskii *Jewish‚ÄìUkrainian relations in Eastern Galicia *Nachtigall Battalion Notes References External links * Category:Eastern Front (World War II) Category:Jewish resistance members during the Holocaust Category:People whose existence is disputed Category:Resistance movements Category:Ukrainian Jews ","title":"Stella Krenzbach"},{"id":"57882428","text":"Black Tartarian (originally Ronald's Large Black Heart) is an heirloom cultivar of cherry.

Ziaur Rahman's widow, Khaleda Zia, led the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which allied with the Bangladesh Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's daughter Sheikh Hasina. Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh and other Islamic parties and alliances joined the opposition ranks. They called for strikes and protests that paralysed the state and its economy. Although the parliament was dissolved, fresh elections were boycotted by the opposition, including Awami League and Jamaat. Students launched an intensifying opposition campaign, which ultimately forced Ershad to step down. On 6 December 1990, Ershad offered his resignation. On 27 February 1991, after two months of widespread civil unrest, an interim government headed by Acting President Chief Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed oversaw what most observers believed to be the nation's most free and fair elections to that date. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. First Khaleda administration, 1991‚Äì96 Prime minister Zia with United States President Bill Clinton. The centre-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party won a plurality of seats and formed a government with support from the Islamic party Jamaat-I-Islami, with Khaleda Zia, widow of Ziaur Rahman, obtaining the post of prime minister. Only four parties had more than 10 members elected to the 1991 Parliament: The BNP, led by Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia; the AL, led by Sheikh Hasina; the Jamaat-I-Islami (JI), led by Ghulam Azam; and the Jatiya Party (JP), led by acting chairman Mizanur Rahman Choudhury while its founder, former President Ershad, served out a prison sentence on corruption charges. The electorate approved still more changes to the constitution, formally re-creating a parliamentary system and returning governing power to the office of the prime minister, as in Bangladesh's original 1972 constitution. In October 1991, members of Parliament elected a new head of state, President Abdur Rahman Biswas. In March 1994, controversy over a parliamentary by-election, which the opposition claimed the government had rigged, led to an indefinite boycott of Parliament by the entire opposition. The opposition also began a program of repeated general strikes to press its demand that Khaleda Zia's government resign and a caretaker government supervise a general election. Efforts to mediate the dispute, under the auspices of the Commonwealth Secretariat, failed. After another attempt at a negotiated settlement failed narrowly in late December 1994, the opposition resigned en masse from Parliament. The opposition then continued a campaign of marches, demonstrations, and strikes in an effort to force the government to resign. The opposition, including the Bangladesh Awami League, led by Sheikh Hasina, pledged to boycott national elections scheduled for 15 February 1996. In February, Khaleda Zia was re-elected by a landslide in voting boycotted and denounced as unfair by the three main opposition parties. In March 1996, following escalating political turmoil, the sitting Parliament enacted a constitutional amendment to allow a neutral caretaker government to assume power and conduct new parliamentary elections; former Chief Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman was named Chief Adviser (a position equivalent to Prime Minister) in the interim government. New parliamentary elections were held in June 1996 and the Awami League won plurality and formed the government with support from the Jatiya Party led by deposed president Hussain Muhammad Ershad; party leader Sheikh Hasina became Prime Minister of Bangladesh. First Hasina administration, 1996‚Äì2001 Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inspects the ceremonial honour guard during a full honour arrival ceremony at the Pentagon on 17 October 2000. Sheikh Hasina formed what she called a \\"Government of National Consensus\\" in June 1996, which included one minister from the Jatiya Party and another from the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal. The Jatiya Party never entered into a formal coalition arrangement, and party president Hussain Muhammad Ershad withdrew his support from the government in September 1997. Only three parties had more than 10 members elected to the 1996 Parliament: the Awami League, BNP, and Jatiya Party. Jatiya Party president, Ershad, was released from prison on bail in January 1997. International and domestic election observers found the June 1996 election free and fair, and ultimately, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party decided to join the new Parliament. The BNP soon charged that police and Bangladesh Awami League activists were engaged in large-scale harassment and jailing of opposition activists. At the end of 1996, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party staged a parliamentary walkout over this and other grievances but returned in January 1997 under a four-point agreement with the ruling party. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party asserted that this agreement was never implemented and later staged another walkout in August 1997. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party returned to Parliament under another agreement in March 1998. In June 1999, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and other opposition parties again began to abstain from attending Parliament. Opposition parties staged an increasing number of nationwide general strikes, rising from six days of general strikes in 1997 to 27 days in 1999. A four-party opposition alliance formed at the beginning of 1999 announced that it would boycott parliamentary by-elections and local government elections unless the government took steps demanded by the opposition to ensure electoral fairness. The government did not take these steps, and the opposition subsequently boycotted all elections, including municipal council elections in February 1999, several parliamentary by-elections, and the Chittagong city corporation elections in January 2000. Administrative Division thumb In 1990, Bangladesh was administratively divided into 4 divisions, namely Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi which were further subdivided into a total of 64 districts (See List of districts of Bangladesh). The government of under Begum Khaleda Zia chose to change the upazila system and set up instead democratically designed decentralised structures at the appropriate levels. In 1993, Barisal Division was split off from Khulna Division and in 1995, Sylhet Division was split off from Chittagong Division. By the end of the decade, the number of divisions stood at 6. Demographics Based on World Development Indicators published by the World Bank the population of Bangladesh grew from 104 million at the beginning of the decade to 129 million by the end. This signifies an annual population growth rate of 2.2%. Population density increased from 796 to 991 per sq. km. The urban population was 19.8% of the total at the beginning, which ended up at 23.2%. Dhaka, the largest city, with a population of 6.6 million, accounted for 31.5% of the total urban population by 1999. United Nations World Population Prospects show that the population growth rate was in decreasing trend (from 2.5% per annum to 2.0%), primarily due to reduction in fertility rate (births per woman) from 4.5 to 3.3. Life expectancy at birth increased from 58.4 years to 64.7 years with Child (0-5) mortality reducing from 144 per 1,000 births to 92. Age dependency ratio (% of working-age population) changed from 83.3% to 70.7% by the end of the decade. Climate Temperature and Precipitation Compared to prior decade the average December temperature decreased by about 0.6 degree but moderate increases in other months offset the overall annual impact. Average rainfall decreased for April, May and July leading to overall average annual rainfall decrease by about 70mm. Natural disasters A damaged village in Bangladesh, surrounded by flooded fields, three weeks after the storm had struck The severe cyclone of 1991 and the devastating floods of 1998 marks this decade as one of the worst hit by natural disasters after independence. The 1991 Bangladesh cyclone was among the deadliest tropical cyclones on record. On the night of 29 April 1991, it struck the Chittagong district of southeastern Bangladesh with winds of around 250 km/h (155 mph). The storm forced a 6-metre (20 ft) storm surge inland over a wide area, killing at least 138,866 people and leaving as many as 10 million homeless. Later in the decade, in 1994, another cyclone with a velocity of per hour struck the coastal area of Cox's Bazar causing extensive damage to the districts of Cox's Bazaar and Bandarban. As a result of the early warning and subsequent evacuation of about 450,000 people, the loss of life was minimal. According to official estimates 133 (including 84 refugees) died and 3,559 were injured. From July to September 1998, Bangladesh suffered extensive flooding. Over 75% of the total area of the country was flooded, including half of Dhaka. It was similar to the catastrophic flood of 1988, in terms of the extent of the flooding. 30 million people were made homeless and the death toll reached over a thousand. The flooding caused contamination of crops and animals and unclean water resulted in cholera and typhoid outbreaks. About 700,000 hectares of crops were destroyed, Economy National Income and Balance of Payment Bangladesh GDP was USD 42.4 billion in 1990, which grew to USD 63.6 billion in 1999 (in 2010 constant dollar) signifying a 4.1% annual growth. Agricultural Sector contributed to 32.8% of GDP in the beginning of the decade, which decreased to 23.8% by the end. During the same period contribution from the industrial sector increased from 20.7% to 23.5% and that of the service sector increased from 46.6% to 52.7%. Per capita GDP increased from USD 399 to USD 493 (in 2010 constant dollar). According to World Development Indicators published by the World Bank, on 2010 constant dollar basis, Bangladesh used to export USD 1.3 billion (5.9% of GDP) worth of goods and services as of 1990, which grew at annual average rate of 10.2% to USD 3.5 billion (11.8% of GDP) in 1999. During the same time import of goods and services grew from USD 3.1 billion (13.1% of GDP) to USD 5.8 billion (16.6% of GDP). Over the decade, Foreign Direct Investment and Personal Remittances Receipt averaged 0.12% and 3.02% of GDP; while, total Reserve averaged at 13.3% of external debt and 3.8 month's coverage of import. Gross National Income (at 2010 constant dollar) grew from USD 43.3 billion to USD 65.7 billion over the decade. At the beginning of this period External Debt stock (of which concessional debt was 90.6%) comprised of 38.1% of Gross National Income (GNI) and External Debt Service burden was 2.3% of GNI. By the end of the decade, External Debt stock (of which concessional debt now was 95.1%) stood at 31.1% of GNI and External Debt Service burden was 1.3% of the same. During the same period Military expenditure increased from 1.2% to 1.5% of GNI. Agriculture Aggregate value addition from agricultural sector was USD 9.7 billion in 1990 (in 2010 constant USD), which grew at average annual rate of 2.2% to USD 12.1 billion by 1999 (in the same constant USD). During this decade, crop production grew at an annual average rate of 2.5% driven by cereal production increase from 27.7 million metric tons to 36.4 million (implying annual growth of 2.8%) - enabled by improvement in cereal yield from 2490.6 kg per hectare to 3116.4 kg. At the same time livestock production grew at 3.5% per annum and fisheries production increased at annual rate of 6.3%. Altogether these contributed to overall food production increase by annualized rate of 2.7%. Industrial and Service Sectors Net value addition from industrial sector, which stood at USD 7.1 billion in 1990 (in 2010 constant USD), grew at average annual rate of 6.4% to USD 13.2 billion by 1999 (in the same constant USD basis). Manufacturing sector contributed 64.9% of industrial value added in the beginning of this period and it gradually changed to 65.3% by the end. There were 4,094 recorded industrial design applications by Bangladeshi residents in this decade, more than three times that from earlier decade. In 1989-90 there were 24,283 industrial establishments in the country employing 1.08 million staffs. By 1999-2000 the number of establishments grew to 24,752 and employment in the sector grew to 2.26 million. On the other hand, net value addition from the service sector amounting USD 23.6 billion in 1990, also grew at average annual rate of 3.7% and stood at USD 34.0 billion by 1999 (in 2010 constant USD). Major Businesses / enterprises that started journey in this decade in Bangladesh include Eskayef and Nassa Group in 1990, Confidence Group in 1991, Renata in 1993, Banglalink and Kazi Farms in 1996, Grameenphone and Robi in 1997 and Incepta in 1999. Infrastructure Transportation and Communication Bangabandhu Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge was opened for public use in 1998. The road transport sector experienced rapid changes in the 1990s. Town services as well as inter-city bus transport and private taxicab services significantly improved through introduction of many large bodied modern buses. There were only 133,253 motor vehicles in Bangladesh in 1985 and the number rose to 405,919 in 1999. The construction of Bangabandhu Jamuna Bridge was completed in the second half of the 1990s and the bridge was opened to traffic in 1998. Other important bridges constructed in the 1990s included the Dhalla bridge, the 4th Bangladesh-China Friendship bridge, the Langalbanda bridge and the second Buriganga bridge that linked the national highways and contributed to substantial increase in road traffic. Although the railway network benefited from the increased connectivity from Jamuna Bridge, the sector continued to lose share. The share of the railway sector in passenger traffic declined from 50% in the 1960s to 12% in 1990s and in freight traffic over the same period from 40% to 7%. Due to small volume of traffic and resulting low profitability Faridpur-Pukuria, Bheramara-Raita, Feni-Belonia, and Rupsa- Bagerhat sections of the railway line were closed between 1994 and 1997. Air Transport sector also did not grow much in this decade. As of 1989, there were 14,600 registered carrier departures worldwide which came down to 5,900 by 1999. During the same period number of passenger carried slightly increased from 1.00 million to about 1.22 million per annum. In the beginning of the decade there were 218,000 fixed telephone line subscription in the country - which increased to 432,968 by the end signifying 0.34 lines per 100 people. By 1999 there were also 149,000 mobile cellular subscriptions signifying 0.12 lines per 100 people. Energy In 1990 per capital electric power consumption was 48.4 kWh, which increased to 94.3 kWh by 1999. During the same period per capita energy usage increased from 120.0 kg of oil equivalent to 136.8 kg and fossil fuel energy consumption increased from 45.5% to 57.3% of total. In 1990 the electricity produced in the country was coming from: hydroelectric sources: 11.4%, natural gas sources: 84.3% and oil sources: 4.3%. By 1999 the distribution changed to - hydroelectric sources: 5.8%, natural gas sources: 85.0% and oil sources: 9.3%. Financial Services After addressing the loan recovery issue in the banking sector in the 1980s (see here), from 1990, the Government pursued broader Financial Sector Reform Programs. These reforms include flexible interest rate, convertibility of ‚ÄúTaka‚Äù, introduction of 91 days bill, recapitalization of banks, new procedure for loan classification, and strengthening the money and capital market. This helped improve capital adequacy, governance, regulation, supervision and payment system in the economy. New banks starting operations in this decade were: Eastern Bank in 1992, National Credit and Commerce Bank in 1993, Prime Bank, South-east Bank, Dhaka Bank, Al-Arafah Islami Bank and Social Investment Bank in 1995, Premier Bank and Dutch-Bangla Bank in 1996, Mercantile Bank, Standard Bank, One Bank, ExIm Bank, Bangladesh Commerce Bank, Mutual Trust Bank, Trust Bank, Bank Asia and First Security Bank in 1999. The insurance sector underwent reforms as well. The Insurance Corporations (Amendment) Act 1990 allowed private sector insurance companies to underwrite 50% of the insurance business emanating from the public sector and to place up to 50% of their reinsurance with any reinsurer of their choice, at home or abroad, keeping the remaining for placement with the Sadharan Bima Corporation. Meanwhile, a new Stock Exchange was established in Chittagong in 1995 to facilitate Capital market in the port city. The regulatory environment was inadequate and market regulations were outdated and not systematically enforced. In this milieu of weak institutional structure and inadequate governance, the capital market experienced its first speculative bubble and burst in 1996-1997. Investors who were affected due to the bubble and burst stayed away from the market for the next several years.

The inscription technique is generally poor compared for example to the later Major Pillar Edicts, however they are often associated with some of the artistically most sophisticated pillar capitals of Ashoka. This fact led some authors to think that the most sophisticated capitals were actually the earliest in the sequence of Ashokan pillars and that style degraded over a short period of time.The True Chronology of A≈õokan Pillars, John Irwin, Artibus Asiae, Vol. 44, No. 4 (1983), pp. 247-265 These were made probably made at the beginning of the reign of Ashoka (reigned 262-233 BCE), from the year 12 of his reign, that is, from 250 BCE. History Ashoka was the third monarch of the Maurya Empire in India, reigning from around 269 BCE. Ashoka famously converted to Buddhism and renounced violence soon after being victorious in a gruesome Kalinga War, yet filled with deep remorse for the bloodshed of the war. Although he was a major historical figure, little definitive information was known as there were few records of his reign until the 19th century when a large number of his edicts, inscribed on rocks and pillars, were found in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan. These many edicts were concerned with practical instructions in running a kingdom such as the design of irrigation systems and descriptions of Ashoka's beliefs in peaceful moral behavior. They contain little personal detail about his life. List of the Minor Pillar Edicts  Asoka‚Äôs Minor Pillar Edicts are exclusively inscribed on several of the Pillars of Ashoka, at Sarnath, Sanchi, Allahabad (a pillar initially located in Kosambi), Rummindei and Nigali Sagar. They are all in the Prakrit language and the Brahmi script. These pillar edicts are: ;The Schism Edicts Asoka‚Äôs injunction against shism in the Samgha. Found on the Sarnath, Sanchi and Allahabad pillars. These are among the earliest inscriptions of Ashoka, at a time when inscription techniques in India where not yet mature. In contrast, the lion capitals crowning these edicts (Sarnath and Sanchi) are the most refined of those produced during the time of Ashoka. All the Schism edits are rather fragmentary, but the similarity of their messages permit a clear reconstruction: File:Allahabad Kausambi Edict.jpgKosambi-Allahabad Schism Edict.

File:Sarnath_pillar_inscription.jpgSarnath Schism Edit. ;The Queen's Edict Allahabad, Kosambi pillar, Queen's Edict Ashoka announces that the Queen should be credited for her gifts. Found on the Allahabad pillar. Commemorative inscriptions Although generally catalogued among the \\"Minor Pillar Edicts\\", the two inscriptions found in Lumbini and at Nigali Sagar are in the past tense and in the ordinary third person (not the royal third person), suggesting that are not pronouncements of Ashoka himself, but rather later commemorations of his visits in the area. Being commemorative, these two inscriptions may have been written significantly later than the other Ashokan inscriptions. ;The Lumbini pillar inscription Records the visit of Ashoka to Lumbini, location of the birth of the Buddha, in today's Nepal. { class=\\" centre\\" + Rummindei pillar, inscription of Ashoka - ! scope=\\"col\\" align=left Translation (English)!!Transliteration (original Brahmi script)!!Inscription (Prakrit in the Brahmi script) - align=center width=\\"30%\\"  align=left  align=center width=\\"10%\\" Lumbini Rummindei pillar at time of discovery in 1896, with location of the inscription, which was hidden about 1 meter under ground level.British Library Online\\"Dr. Fuhrer went from Nigliva to Rummindei where another Priyadasin lat has been discovered... and an inscription about 3 feet below surface, had been opened by the Nepalese\\" in } ;The Nigali Sagar pillar inscription At Nigali Sagar, Ashoka mentions his dedication for the enlargement of the Stupa dedicated to the Kanakamuni Buddha. { class=\\" centre\\" + Nigali Sagar Edict - ! scope=\\"col\\" align=left Translation (English)!!Transliteration (original Brahmi script)!!Inscription (Prakrit in the Brahmi script) - align=center width=\\"30%\\"  align=left  align=center width=\\"10%\\" Rubbing of the inscription. } Inscription techniques The Kosambi-Allahabad Schism Edict, as the Sarnath or Sanchi Schism Edicts, display low inscriptional skills. They were made by inexperienced Indian engravers at a time when stone engraving was still new in India. The inscription technique of the early Edicts, particularly the Schism Edcits at Sarnath, Sanchi and Kosambi-Allahabad, is very poor compared for example to the later Major Pillar Edicts, however the Minor Pillar Edicts are often associated with some of the artistically most sophisticated pillar capitals of Ashoka, such as the renowned Lion Capital of Ashoka which crowned the Sarnath Minor Pillar Edict, or the very similar, but less well preserved Sanchi lion capital which crowned the very clumsily inscribed Schism Edict of Sanchi. These edicts were probably made at the beginning of the reign of Ashoka (reigned 262-233 BCE), from the year 12 of his reign, that is, from 256 BCE. According to Irwin, the Brahmi inscriptions on the Sarnath and Sanchi pillars were made by inexperienced Indian engravers at a time when stone engraving was still new in India, whereas the very refined Sarnath capital itself was made under the tutelage of craftsmen from the former Achaemenid Empire, trained in Perso-Hellenistic statuary and employed by Ashoka. This suggests that the most sophisticated capitals were actually the earliest in the sequence of Ashokan pillars and that style degraded over a short period of time.The True Chronology of A≈õokan Pillars, John Irwin, Artibus Asiae, Vol. 44, No. 4 (1983), pp. 264 The Rummindei and Nigali Sagar edicts, inscribed on pillars erected by Ashoka later in his reign (19th and 20th year) display a high level of inscriptional technique with a good regularity in the lettering.

Trofimenko () is a mansion built in the beginning of the 20th century in Oktyabrsky district of Rostov-on-Don executed in eclecticism style. It is located at 73 Prosveshcheniya Street. The building is an object of cultural heritage of local value. Originally in the building, the profitable house, then paper-mill with printing house was placed. Nowadays I. M. Trofimenko's house occupies Lyceum ‚Ññ 33 of a name of the Rostov regiment of a national militia.  History  At the beginning of the 20th century, the two-story household located on Prosveshcheniya Street at that time belonged to retired lieutenant Samuel Kipman, the representative of Georges Blok association. The association was engaged in Rostov-on-Don in the sale of bicycles, knitting and sewing machines, weights, arithmometers, cash registers, caskets, etc. In 1909 because of financial difficulties, the company left the market and the house was taken over by sculptor, artist, and schedule Ivan Mikhaylovich Trofimenko. He was the owner of a printing house established on Dmitriyevskaya Street (nowadays Shaumyana). Having got the new building, Trofimenko moved the printing house to his first floor, and placed a paper mill of the Kolorit association on the second. About 30 people worked at the enterprise. In March 1913, there was the strong fire in the building. The blaze destroyed the entire second floor and roof. All equipment and material of the paper mill became useless: the press, cars, typographical fonts, printing products, and the inventory burned down. The stone walls resisted. All lost property was insured in the Russia and Salamander insurance companies that allowed Trofimenko to not only quickly anew build the building, but also to build on the third floor. After reconstruction revenues of the house, owner increased from 910 to 2580 rubles a year. Meanwhile, the quickly developing industry of Rostov-on-Don demanded experts in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. In City Council, the issue of opening of the second school in the city was discussed. In February 1914, Duma members considered petitions of 13 house owners suggesting to place this school in Trofimenko's building. The majority of vowels of a thought preferred the new house of Trofimenko, having agreed to pay from the city budget of 7000 rubles a year for rent. A portion of the deputies criticized the place chosen for an educational institution because of its remoteness from the downtown, its proximity to the gvozdilny plant, and because dropouts and workers lived on the premises. Kozlov , a member of the town council, noted that the educational commission of municipal duma, having carefully examined the building, found these arguments unconvincing. After hearing objections concerning the suburban position of the building, Kozlov pointed to the abundance of educational institutions on the nearby Sennaya Street, and that a tram passes closeby. A petition signed by more than 50 inhabitants of Skobelevskaya (nowadays Red Army) and a number of the neighboring streets, protested against the statement of Lizhdvoya, stating \\"that their area is dangerous to the pupils passing here due to attack of hooligans on them; working people are not hooligans, and it is more about any hooligans on Aged and New markets and everywhere. These inhabitants also say that near their area there are no doss houses, and Maximov's plant on Skobelevskaya Street publishes, in any case, less noise than the noise of droshkies, trams, and the squeal of the cars which are continuously rushing on Big Garden and other streets of the center\\".

Summary  tamaki niime specializes in apparel produced using Banshu-ori fabric. Banshu-ori is a traditional brand of fabric manufactured in the North Harima area of Hyogo. The methods used to weave and dye the fabric are based on a technology brought to Hyogo by ‚ÄùMiyadaiku‚Äù Yasubei Hida from Kyoto around 1800. Weaving and dyeing Banshu-ori was a popular off-season side job of farmers in the Nishiwaki-shi around Kyoto. Traditional Banshu-ori must conform to certain methods and quality standards to be considered authentic.Nishiwaki- shi Official Site - About Banshu-Ori - retrieved 29 June 2018.Kitaharima Industrial Development Organization Official Site - retrieved 29 June 2018. In 2004 fashion designer Niime Tamaki (originally a from Katsuyama-shi, Fukui) began working with Banshu-ori after a chance meeting with a Banshu-ori craftsman in Tokyo. Tamaki launched her own brand \\"tamaki niime\\" in 2004, which produced Banshu-or using both new manufacturing methods and traditional ones. For three years she designed and sold apparel in Osaka, using fabric woven by craftsman in Nishiwaki. In 2006 she decided to expand and established the company \\"tamaki niime\\".Kobe Shimbun(Á•ûÊà∏Êñ∞ËÅû) 30 June 2017 - retrieved 29 June 2018. The company moved to a store in Nishiwaki-shi, where they continued to weave and dye Banshu-ori. Tamaki started to do weaving in addition to her design activities and learned how to operate the loom. She experimented with the fabric, and developed a soft cloth that was difficult to sew and had the consistency of cotton candy. She wrapped it around her neck and noticed it was very comfortable to wear. This fabric became the ‚ÄúOnly One‚Äù shawl, which was the main product of the company at the time. It was marketed as ‚Äúan original shawl loved by everyone regardless of gender, age, or nationality‚Äù. The ‚ÄúOnly One‚Äù shawl is woven using a belt-type power loom made in 1965, which creates a unique pattern and feeling that cannot be replicated using more modern machines.Hesomachi Bunka Shimbun(„Å∏„Åù„Åæ„Å°ÊñáÂåñÊñ∞ËÅû) Vol. 1 Commemorative Issue 25 December 2016 - retrieved 29 June 2018.COEUR Vol.41 Issued 1 March 2017 - retrieved 29 June 2018. The company continues to weave this fabric and apparel from it. The factory uses a variety of equipment to support the designing, dyeing, weaving, and sewing processes including a belt-type power loom, a rapier loom, yarn dyeing machine, warper, and CAD/CAM. They also use an arrange winder to create a rainbow-like gradation of multi-colored threads, as well as a state-of-the-art whole garment made by SHIMI SEIKI MFG LTD with the ability to knit without sewing. tamaki niime make and produce shawls, shirts, pants, children‚Äôs clothes, bags and denims.

The vision of tamaki niime is to turn the town of Hie- cho, where they are located, into a cotton town. In 2014 they began cultivating organic cotton on borrowed, abandoned farmland. They also are attempting to boost net domestic production of cotton by purchasing cotton seeds from growers at harvest and distributing them to people so they can also grow cotton. As they look to expand their business, Tamaki does consider issues of mass production, mass consumption, and global environmental impacts. In addition to cultivating cotton they grow vegetables which are used in their caf√© annexed to their factory.

It is located west of Mount Larrabee and within the Mount Baker Wilderness, which is part of the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. This mountain's name was officially adopted in 1913 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The nearest higher peak is Canadian Border Peak, to the northeast. Precipitation runoff on the east side of the mountain drains into Tomyhoi Lake and Tomyhoi Creek, whereas the west side of the mountain drains into Damfino Creek. The unofficially named Tomyhoi Glacier lies on its north flank. The summit offers views of Mount Larrabee, American Border Peak, Canadian Border Peak, Mount Shuksan, and Mount Baker. Access The Keep Kool Trail (#699) is accessed by the Twin Lakes Road (Forest Service #3065 in the North Fork Nooksack area) off of the Mount Baker Highway. The first to the Keep Kool trailhead is well maintained. Climate Tomyhoi Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains.Tomyhoi Peak and Canadian Border Peak As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. Mt. McGuire in Canada The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Carmon was representing the United States in its Israeli civil litigation (1985-2016) and also acted as outside legal counsel to the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, and the U.S Consulate General in Jerusalem. For twenty years (1985-2005) he has been engaged by U.S federal agencies to conduct intelligence gathering, a task he performed under cover in more than 30 countries. Early life Carmon grew up in Tel Aviv. His father was a bank CEO, and wrote books about poetry and Eastern philosophy. Carmon graduated Tel Aviv University Law School in 1981 cum laude and went into the international business. During this period, he became a close adviser to Labor Party leader Shimon Peres. When he left Israel to pursue a master's degree in International Law, Government and Politics from St. John's University in New York, Peres asked him to be the Labor Party's chief delegate to the US. He was named as a special envoy to the Philippines in 1986. In 1985 he became an outside contractor to the Department of Justice, combining investigations with litigation. Career Carmon heads Carmon & Carmon, an international law firm where his team specializes in asset recovery, fraud investigation and litigation, and cross border disputes. Carmon has done work exposing the fraudulent activities of binary options firms that have laundered money, and helped recover $3 million for victims who lost money. He is quoted as comparing the method that binary options companies use to layer their corporate structure to ‚Äústructures seen only in espionage organizations or among world-class money launderers or terrorist organizations.‚Äù Carmon spent 20 years working as an undercover investigator/litigator, traveling to over 30 countries to collect intelligence for the U.S. Government. About the experience, he has said, ‚Äúduring my twenty years of undercover work for the U.S Department of Justice and other federal agencies, I have experienced adventure, fear, and most of the time, a great sense of achievement.‚Äù He has also said, ‚Äúobviously, in my years working for the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies, I could not share the hair-raising aspects of my work with anyone but my supervisors, and some adventures not even with them. Sadly, many of these events, which are sometimes more fascinating and breathtaking than the best fiction I have ever read, will never see the light of day.\\" In 2014 Carmon was appointed Honorary Consul of Estonia in Israel. Books Carmon has written five spy thrillers, telling the stories of the character Dan Gordon, a former Mossad agent having adventures around the world to gather intelligence on behalf of the U.S. government. His novels are based on his experiences helping the United States track down fugitives traveling worldwide. He began his writing career with the book Triple Identity, which he started during an assignment collecting intelligence on an organized crime group in Northern Europe. He was encouraged by his supervisor David Epstein, who was positively critical of the writing in his reports, saying ‚Äúbecause of the way you present the facts, they read like a thriller.‚Äù He has credited fiction authors Robert Ludlum and John La Carr√© as inspirations for his writing. Carmon has authored Foreign Judgments in Israel, Recognition and Enforcement, an international law textbook, published by the Israel Bar Association with an introduction by the Deputy Chief Justice the Hon. Eliezer Rivlin. The book became an authority and was cited in 24 Israeli court cases, including 8 by the Supreme Court. The book was translated into English and was published by SPRINGER. Carmon has published articles on espionage, Iran and Middle Eastern affairs. Amazon has acquired the reprint rights of all Carmon's thrillers and published them in a new format.

The diocese originally covered the entire state of South Carolina, but the western part of the state became the Episcopal Diocese of Upper South Carolina in 1922. In 2012, the diocese split into two rival dioceses, the Anglican Diocese of South Carolina and the Episcopal Church in South Carolina, each claiming to be the legitimate successor of the original diocese. Colonial origins (1660‚Äì1775) On April 19, 1660, a group from Virginia attempted to establish an English settlement at or near present-day Beaufort. Morgan Jones of the Church of England was chaplain and presided over the first Anglican services in South Carolina. The colony was unsuccessful and later abandoned.Philip G. Clarke, Jr., Anglicanism in South Carolina, 1660-1976: A Chronological History of Dates and Events in the Church of England and the Episcopal Church in South Carolina (Easley, SC: Southern Historical Press and the Rev. Emmett Lucas, Jr., 1976), p. 1. In 1663, Charles II granted the Lords Proprietors the Province of Carolina and gave them \\"Power to build and found Churches, Chapels, and Oratories\\" for use according to the \\"Ecclesiastical Laws\\" of England.George C. Rogers, Jr., Church and State In Eighteenth-Century South Carolina (Charleston, South Carolina: Dalcho Historical Society, 1959), 10. The first permanent settlement in South Carolina was at Charleston, founded in 1670. The city received its first cleric in 1680 with the arrival of Atkin Williamson, and South Carolina's first church, St. Philip's, was built in 1681. In 1702, the newly incorporated Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts sent Samuel Thomas as its first missionary to South Carolina.Clarke, Jr., Anglicanism in South Carolina, pp. 2-4. Religious toleration fostered by the Lords Proprietors made Carolina attractive to nonconformists. While the colony was dominated by immigrant planters from Barbados who tended to be Anglican, there were significant numbers of Presbyterians, Baptists, Quakers, and French Huguenots. At the start of the 18th century, religious harmony in Carolina began to break down as political factions began to coalesce along religious lines. The Barbadian planters disputed with the Proprietors over debts, land policies, and the Indian Trade. The Huguenots sided with the Anglicans, while the newly arrived dissenters gave their support to the Proprietors who had given them toleration.S. Charles Bolton, Southern Anglicanism: The Church of England in Colonial South Carolina (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1982), pp. 18-23. On May 6, 1704, Anglican governor Nathaniel Johnson called an emergency session of the General Assembly where a bill was introduced to require all members of that body to subscribe to the Test Act, effectively excluding non-Anglicans from the legislature. The Exclusion Act passed by one vote.Clarke, Jr., Anglicanism in South Carolina, p. 5. In November, the General Assembly passed the Establishment Act, making the Church of England the state religion of the Province. Minister salaries and church construction were to be financed by an export and import tax, while local vestries were empowered to raise revenue by assessing the real and personal property of Anglicans and dissenters alike. The act gave the laity control over the church. Taxpaying parishioners were to select the rector and the vestry, which would manage the parish. A lay commission would exercise oversight over the church at large, with the power to remove clergy.Bolton, Southern Anglicanism, pp. 24-26. The 1704 acts were highly controversial, and dissenters lobbied the English government and public for their repeal. Daniel Defoe wrote a pamphlet, \\"Case of the Protestant Dissenters\\", that set out the argument of the nonconformists. They argued that the Exclusion Act was contrary to colonial precedent and the Carolina charter. On the Establishment Act, they argued that it violated the Church of England's episcopal polity by giving lay commissioners powers to discipline clergy.Bolton, Southern Anglicanism, pp. 26-27. The House of Lords agreed, and Queen Anne declared the acts null and void. On November 30, 1706, the General Assembly repealed both acts.Clarke, Jr., Anglicanism in South Carolina, p. 6. They were replaced by a new Establishment Act that eliminated the commission's ability to discipline clergy. However, parishioners still elected their clergy and the lay commission still administered elections and supervised the Church of England in Carolina.Bolton, Southern Anglicanism, p. 28. A 1710 amendment to the act abolished parish levies and instead provided that vestries could draw up to ¬£40 annually from public funds to cover parish expenses. In this way, dissenters would not directly fund the Church of England.Bolton, Southern Anglicanism, p. 32. In 1708, Gideon Johnston was sent by Henry Compton, Bishop of London, as the colony's first commissary. The commissary was the personal representative of the Bishop of London, who had nominal jurisdiction over the church in the colonies. His role was to supervise the clergy and the affairs of the church, and Johnston was a strong advocate of episcopal and clerical authority and adhering to official Anglican doctrine and form.Bolton, Southern Anglicanism, p. 29. The commissary's influence was limited, however, by lay power and loopholes in the Church Acts.Rogers, Jr. 1959, pp. 13-14. The 1706 Act had taken from the lay commission the power to remove ministers without providing other means of removal. As a result, once a minister had been elected to a parish, a minister could not be removed for behavior. Theoretically, the commissary could revoke a problematic minister's license but not the minister's benefice or salary. Parishes ultimately resorted to paying troublesome ministers to resign.Bolton, Southern Anglicanism, p. 30. Johnston also attempted to conform the colonial church in all respects to the church in England. He found opposition not only from dissenters but from Anglicans who disliked episcopacy and embraced many of the religious outlooks of the nonconformists.Bolton, Southern Anglicanism, p. 31 Concentrated in the lowcountry, with its center at Charleston, the colonial church's membership included the plantation gentry, the professional class, urban merchants, and skilled craftsmen. Most of the Huguenots who immigrated to the colony also converted to Anglicanism. This influence caused the clergy in South Carolina to be more Calvinist than the surrounding colonies. Outside of the lowcountry, however, the Church of England's presence was very weak, the interior being predominantly Presbyterian and Baptist.Rogers, Jr. 1959, pp. 18-19. Creation and division (1775‚Äì1922) During the American Revolution, dissenters successfully advocated for the disestablishment of the Church of England and ensured that all Protestant religions were treated equally with the adoption of a state constitution in 1778 (equality was extended to Catholics and Jews in 1790).Rogers, Jr. 1959, pp. 22-23. The first state convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in South Carolina was held on May 12, 1785.Rogers, Jr. 1959, pp. 26. In October 1790, South Carolina's state convention unanimously accepted the constitution and canons for the national church adopted by the General Convention at Philadelphia earlier in July 1789.Rogers, Jr. 1959, p. 28. Robert Smith was elected South Carolina's first bishop on February 10, 1795, at the 12th convention.Rogers, Jr. 1959, p. 29. The Episcopal Church in South Carolina remained disorganized and stagnant during the immediate years after the Revolutionary War. The strong congregationalist tendencies held by the churches contributed to a lack of interest beyond local affairs. After 1798, no convention would meet until 1804. Bishop Smith had died in 1801 and there was no standing committee to examine candidates for holy orders. At the 1804 convention, a standing committee was appointed, and Edward Jenkins was elected bishop. Jenkins, however, declined the office.Rogers, Jr. 1959, p. 30. A lingering fear of tyrannical bishops would leave South Carolina without a bishop until 1812 when Theodore Dehon was elected. In 1810, the Protestant Episcopal Society for the Advancement of Christianity in South Carolina was created on the model of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. During the American Civil War, the Diocese of South Carolina was briefly separated from the Episcopal Church in the United States and was part of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America. In 1922, the Episcopal Diocese of Upper South Carolina was created from territory formerly part of the original diocese. Tensions with the Episcopal Church (2008‚Äì2012) From the 2000s until 2012 a large number of clergy and laypeople in the diocese became more and more dissatisfied with decisions made by the Episcopal Church, and increasingly supported Anglican realignment. Similar controversies occurred in four other Episcopal Church dioceses: San Joaquin, Fort Worth, Quincy, and Pittsburgh. Although some clergy and parishioners in the diocese supported national developments, they were in the minority, which was generally not the case with most other Episcopal dioceses in the country. Since 2008, a number of developments heightened tensions between the diocese and the national Episcopal Church. Mark J. Lawrence was consecrated and installed as bishop on January 26, 2008, after being elected twice.\\"South Carolina re-elects Mark Lawrence as bishop\\" Episcopal News Service, 4 August 2007 The polity of the Episcopal Church requires that a majority of standing committees and diocesan bishops give consent to the election of any diocesan bishop. Because of \\"canonical deficiencies\\" in several dioceses' responses, the first election was declared void, requiring a second election.\\"South Carolina election voided due to canonical deficiencies in responses\\" Episcopal News Service, 15 March 2007 The diocese opposed actions of the national Episcopal Church that it viewed as contrary to scripture (see Homosexuality and Anglicanism). After the 76th General Convention of the Episcopal Church passed resolutions DO25 (opening \\"any ordained ministry\\" to individuals in same-sex relationships) and CO56 (concerning the blessing of same-sex relationships), the diocese responded by holding a special convention on October 24, 2009.General Convention Resolutions C056 and D025 , General Convention 2009 Legislation , accessed 29 April 2011. The convention passed a resolution authorizing \\"the Bishop and Standing Committee to begin withdrawing from all bodies of the Episcopal Church that have assented to actions contrary to Holy Scripture, the doctrine, discipline and worship of Christ as this Church has received them ... until such bodies show a willingness to repent of such actions.\\" It also declared \\"Resolutions DO25 and CO56, to be null and void, having no effect in this Diocese, and in violation of our diocesan canon.\\"\\"Four of Five Resolutions Overwhelmingly Passed at Special Convention\\" , Diocese of South Carolina, accessed April 28, 2011. [Resolutions Offered at Special October 24, 2009 Covention\\", Diocese of South Carolina, accessed April 28, 2011. The diocese attempted to distance itself further from the actions of General Convention in October 2010 and February 2011. At these consecutive diocesan conventions, accession clauses to the canons of the Episcopal Church were removed from the diocese's constitution. This was in response to revisions of Title IV, the canons of the Episcopal Church governing the ecclesiastical discipline of priests and bishops. The diocese claimed the revisions gave the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church too much authority in internal diocesan affairs.Adam Parker, \\"Episcopal Diocese of S.C. looks to future\\", The Post and Courier, 27 February 2011, accessed 29 April 2011. While Lawrence stated that he did not intend to lead the diocese out of the Episcopal Church, 12 allegations made by an anonymous party charged that the bishop had \\"abandon[ed] the doctrine, discipline and worship of the Episcopal Church.\\" Following an investigation in the fall of 2011, the Disciplinary Board for Bishops announced on November 28 that Lawrence's actions did not constitute abandonment.Mary Frances Schjonberg (28 November 2011), \\"Disciplinary Board dismisses abandonment complaint against South Carolina bishop\\", Episcopal News Service, accessed May 1, 2011. In November 2011, the diocese generated more controversy when it issued quitclaim deeds to all parishes in the diocese, thereby surrendering any claim that it might have over parish property. Under the canons of the Episcopal Church, parish property is held in trust for the diocese and the national church; however, South Carolina's diocesan chancellor defended the quitclaim deeds by citing a recent state Supreme Court ruling that the Episcopal Church's property canon was not binding on All Saints Parish in Pawleys Island. He also cited the fact that before 1979, the Episcopal Church never claimed ownership of parish property. In the aftermath of the 2012 General Convention, which voted to allow the blessing of same-sex unions, there was speculation that the diocese was heading for secession. Bishop Lawrence was reported to have said that he personally \\"no longer sees a place for the diocese in the General Convention.\\"South Carolina mulls secession: The Church of England Newspaper, August 12, 2012 In the fall of 2012, the historic diocese split into two rival factions: today's Anglican Diocese of South Carolina and Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina.

It was built in 1903. It is also known as the Gundagai Rail Bridge over Murrumbidgee River and the Murrumbidgee River Railway Bridge. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  During the era of John Whitton as Engineer-in-Chief of the New South Wales Government Railways, there was a government edict for railway construction to use as much local materials as possible instead of expensive imported iron bridges. Whitton used stone arches and some brick arches but mostly timber in the form of laminated arches, timber beam bridges and timber trusses. His successor was his Deputy, Henry Deane who, following a visit to the United States of America instigated a policy of cheaper railway construction known as Pioneer Lines beginning in the late 1890s. Most inland rivers were crossed by a new series of timber trusses based on the American Howe truss. Only under special circumstances were steel trusses used. There were two types of timber trusses, the large span 62 feet through trusses and the shorter 35 ‚Äì 40 feet deck trusses. Upgrading replacements have reduced the survivors to 3 sites with through trusses and 5 sites with deck trusses. All but one are on lines that have suspended traffic. At Gundagai there is a mix of both bridge policies. The main channel of the Murrumbidgee River had to be crossed by a high level major steel truss bridge but, in order to contain railway construction costs, the long, high level viaduct across the flood plain was built from timber in the form of 77 deck trusses on timber trestles. It is timber bridge construction on a grand scale. The total crossing had to be built first so as to provide access to South Gundagai and the railway construction beyond to Tumut. The line across the bridge and on to Tumut opened on 12 October 1903, with the first train travelling across on 3 December 1903. The last train travelled across the bridge on 26 November 1983 and the line was formally closed in March 1985 following flood damage to the line on two occasions. In 2017, a local community group, Gundagai Historic Bridge Incorporated, expressed concern about the future of the decaying bridge and launched a campaign to save the bridge and have it converted into a rail trail. A spokesperson for John Holland Rail told The Daily Advertiser at that time: \\"No decision has been made, however we are considering a number of options which may include modifications or the removal of spans over public roadways.\\" A report in May 2018 commissioned by the Cootamundra-Gundagai Regional Council estimated that the cost of rehabilitating the timber viaducts would be $13,660,000, with a cost of a further $5,955,000 to install a shared path decking system to facilitate pedestrian use.  Description  The Gundagai Rail Bridge over Murrumbidgee River is a 77-span timber deck truss, spans, on tall timber trestles. As at February 2018, the bridge was unsafe to cross due to decayed, loose and/or unstable timbers. There are safety barriers at both ends of the bridge to prevent pedestrian access. It was assumed to have not had any maintenance since 1984. A report at that time described the condition of the timber viaducts as varying from poor to fair condition, and the steel spans in fair to good condition. The structure retains its original fabric.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Gundagai is a major crossing of the Murrumbidgee River by the Hume Highway to Victoria, and the Tumut branch railway. The railway reached the town in 1886. Gundagai is a highly significant site with an excellent group of buildings and structures from the late 1880s. In particular the relationship of the station, yard and early timber road and rail viaducts adds to the particular significance of the area. The timber viaducts are of very high significance because of their size, their pairing and their construction as examples of an early engineering solution to crossing a major flood plain. Their national significance is recognised by listing by the National Estate. This viaduct is an example of timber bridge construction on a grand scale. A multi-span, high level viaduct of timber deck trusses and timber trestles, it is one of the most impressive structures in Australia. It dominates the crossing of the Murrumbidgee flood plain more so than the adjacent low level timber beam road viaduct. Its combination with the steel truss over the river makes for a unique technical juxtaposition of bridge types. Gundagai rail bridge over Murrumbidgee River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Gundagai-Tumut Railway was one of the early branch lines built cheaply as a developmental railway. It was not sufficiently profitable to justify upgrading despite the heavy cost of crossing the Murrumbidgee River. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. A high level structure on timber trestles, it one of the most imposing bridge structures in Australia. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Murrumbidgee railway crossing was essential to the social and commercial development of the district south of the river. Since the closing of rail services, the historic features of the railway have been successfully promoted such that the railway crossing is now a prominent tourist attraction. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Murrumbidgee flood plain crossing at Gundagai was the largest application of the new type of timber deck truss bridge spans. It is an impressive example of the bridge carpenters' skills. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. There are only five sites with timber Howe deck trusses. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. It is a spectacular representative example of a timber Howe deck truss.  Engineering heritage award  The bridge received a Historic Engineering Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

The buildings comprise a chapel, of 13th century origins, now a separate house, the medieval, stone hall, and a 16th century wing. The buildings were originally constructed for the Denefords, and extended by their descendants, the Moores. In the 17th century, Nicholas Moore, High Sheriff of Monmouthshire entertained Charles I at the manor. The grouping has been \\"badly compromised\\" in later centuries. The house, privately owned and accommodating an archery centre, is Grade II* listed. History The earliest part of the grouping is the chapel of St Nyvern, constructed by Sir William Deneford or his son in the late 13th century. This was still in use as a chapel in the 16th century, when it was the site of Nicholas Moore's marriage on 13 January 1616. The chapel was subsequently converted to a barn and is now a private house. In the late medieval period the Moores, descendants of the Denefords, constructed the hall house that stands to the right of the chapel. At the end of the First English Civil War, in July 1645, Nicholas twice entertained Charles I at the house. In the 18th century, the manor was remodelled and extended. In the early 20th century, when owned by Monmouthshire County Council, further reconstruction was undertaken. Returned to private ownership in the late 20th century, the building now houses a commercial archery centre. Architecture and description The manor is constructed of rubble with modern rendering. The building comprises the main range, largely 18th century in origin, with the medieval hall behind it. The roofs are modern, but the undercroft on which the hall stands is extant. The complex is listed Grade II* with the chapel having a separate Grade II listing. The hall is also a scheduled monument. The architectural historian John Newman describes the whole grouping as \\"badly compromised\\".

It was manufactured from 1954 until the mid-1970s. History The receiver was developed in the design bureau of the Aleksandrovsky radio factory in 1949 under the direction of V. M. Khakharev and M. E. Movshovich using the R-253 \\"Alfa\\" (–†-253 ¬´–ê–ª—å—Ñ–∞¬ª) receiver as a basis for the design. Serial production began in 1954, and it was adopted by the Soviet military in 1956. Deployment When used by Ground Forces, the R-311 was used in conjunction with mobile radio complexes (R-102, R-118, R-140, R-820M, and command-staff vehicles BMP-1KSh and BTR-60PU, etc.). In the Air Force they were equipped with mobile ground stations R-839 and R-843. The Navy also used the set on board ships. The receiver was supplied to other Warsaw Pact countries, and was exported to Vietnam, China, Cuba and others. At least 60,000 sets were produced. The R-311 receivers were transferred from front line service to DOSAAF organizations and were later used by radio amateurs. Technical Specifications The receiver is a superheterodyne design with one frequency conversion. Circuitry consists of eight identical 2–ñ27–õ pentodes. The set is intended for reception of telegraphic and telephone (AM) signals. It has a quartz IF filter with a smooth adjustment of the bandwidth and an integrated quartz calibrator. It is also a \\"telegraph\\" heterodyne. The antenna socket is adapted to attach the Kulikov's type antenna. The output of the receiver is designed for simultaneous connection of two pairs of low-resistance headphones and a wire line with an impedance of 1500 ohms. The receiver is assembled in a cabinet with two compartments. To the right is placed the receiver itself, and to the left are installed power sources and stored accessories - a portable lamp, headphones and a whip antenna. The casing is plywood, with a duralumin sheet on the outside. The casing and controls are provided with seals to protect them from moisture.

History A church of St Simon was established in Castle Hill very early in the history of the Colony of New South Wales. However it closed by the middle of the 19th century. As the district population increased, a new parish was established in Castle Hill named for St Paul. The new church building was constructed of brick and was located at 221 Old Northern Road, south of the township, on the corner of Church Street. A sandstone parsonage was constructed opposite the church from materials of the old St Simon's Church. Both buildings remain today and are subject to state and local preservation orders. This church building served the parish until the end of the latter half of the 20th century. The current larger St Paul's Anglican Church was constructed at Rogans Hill on land owned by the church, adjacent to Oak Hill College.

Pustovoytov (Russian: –¢–æ—Ä–≥–æ–≤—ã–π –¥–æ–º –ì. –ì. –ü—É—Å—Ç–æ–≤–æ–π—Ç–æ–≤–∞ ) is a building in Rostov-on-Don at the intersection of Bolshaya Sadovaya and Budennovskiy avenue (address: 46, Bolshaya Sadovaya). The house was built in 1910 by a major patron and ship owner Grigory Gavrilovich Pustovoytov, the architect of the project was E.M. Gulin. The profitable house of G.G. Pustovoytov is an object of cultural heritage of regional significance.  History  At the beginning of the 20th century, G.G. Pustovoytov's trading house was considered as one of the highest buildings in the city. As in most profitable houses of that time, the rooms of the house of G.G. Pustovoytov were rented out. After the completion of the building, the Rostov branch of the Association of Russian-French rubber, gutta-percha and telegraph production plants was located in the building under the company \\"Provodnik\\". Also there was the jewelry and watch store of A. Girshtein, the \\"Central\\" and \\"London\\" hotels.  Building Trade House after the bombing  In 1920, the building was nationalized, it housed the Southeast State Woolen Association. In 1930, the 4th floor of the building was occupied by the scientific library of the RSU named after V.M. Molotov and the board of the university. The collection of the scientific library was made up of Russian magazines of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, among them one of the first Russian satirical magazines ‚ÄùThe Painter‚Äù (satirical magazine), ‚ÄúMoscow Journal‚Äù, one of the first Russian literary and political magazines ‚ÄúVestnik of Europe‚Äù(1802-1830) ), \\"Moscow Telegraph\\", the magazine \\"Contemporary\\", founded by A. S. Pushkin. Valuable copies of the library were old printed foreign publications of the mid-16th century. The full list of the book collection of the scientific library is indicated in ‚ÄúThe reference book- guidebook on library\\" of 1941 under edition of the director of library D.S. Fatilevich. In 1942, during the second occupation of Rostov-on-Don by German fascist troops, the city was exposed to bombing. One of the bombs hit the house of G.G. Pustovoytov which destroyed the roof of the building and the rotunda. As a result of the bombing the upper floors of G.G. Pustovoytov's house were completely burnt down, the fire destroyed all book fund of scientific library. In 1965 the building was reconstructed. According to the project of the architect E.P. Likhobabin, the building was completed with a southern wing along Budennovskiy Avenue. Before the Great Patriotic War, in place of the new wing was another house of Grigory Pustovoytov and Karapet Chernov which could not be restored after the bombing of 1942. Today Rostov Central Department Store is located in the building.  Architecture  The project of G.G. Pustovoytov's house was occupied by the architect of Rostov-Nakhichevan city governorate E. M. Gulin who has finished at that time construction of trading house of merchants Yablokov. The main role in the architecture of G.G. Pustovoytov's house is played by the principles of one of the formal trends of rational modernity - the \\"department store style\\" or the \\"industrial- commercial style\\" which arose in 1897 in Germany. During the construction of the building, a new frame-walled structural system was use, which is displayed in the plasticity of the facades united in a single rhythmic composition with the predominance of vertical divisions. In the architectural community the trading house of G.G. Pustovoytov is often compared with the Kuznetsovs' trading house in Moscow and the Mertens trading house in St. Petersburg, which gives reason to speak not only of the strong influence of the capital examples, but also of creative loan. The architecture of the end of the XIX beginning of the 20th century was a criterion of Rostov \\"capital character\\" and variety.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History The Christman Building was built as the \\"Mutual Building\\" for Michigan Millers Mutual Fire Insurance Company in 1928. Millers Mutual was founded in 1881 to provide fire insurance protection for mills. Their offices were located in the nearby Michigan Millers Mutual Fire Insurance Company Building from 1890 until 1928. In that year, Millers Mutual hired the Chicago architectural firm of Pond & Pond, Martin & Lloyd to design a new, larger building. The company used the building until 1957. The building remained vacant until 1962, when the Michigan Historical Museum moved in, occupying the first three floors. In the early 1990s, the museum relocated. By 2007, the building was vacant, and The Christman Company redeveloped and completely renovated the building for use as an office building, and rededicated it as the Christman Building. In 2010, the Christman Building became the world‚Äôs first \\"triple-Platinum\\" LEED project after earning certifications in their core & shell, commercial interiors, and operations & maintenance programs. Description The Mutual Building is a five-story, red brick office building trimmed with limestone. The facade is a stylized version of Elizabethan architecture. It is five bays wide with the end bays projecting slightly forward. The windows in the front are double-hung, wooden- sash units placed in three-window units in the center section and two-window units in the end bays. A recessed, segmental-arch-headed entrance is located at the right-hand end of the facade. At the time of construction, grindstones from seven Michigan mills were embedded in the sidewalk, symbolizing the origin of the company. After rehabilitation, the grindstones were replaced in front of the building. These grindstones and mills are identified in a bronze plaque set into the wall near entrance. A non-historic, two-story garage and former printing plant was located at the rear of the building.

The Man who Loved Dogs is a novel by Leonardo Padura and involves the complex political narratives that surround the assassination of Leon Trotsky by Ramon Mercader. The novel was a finalist for the Book of the Year Award in Spain. It was originally published in 2009 by Tusquets Editors, Spain. It has been translated into English by Anna Kushner. The english translation was published in the U.S. in 2014 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Padura‚Äôs novel traces the saga of Trotsky‚Äôs 11-year flight from Stalin; the recruitment and creation of an assassin in the form of Catalan communist Ram√≥n Mercader; and the marginalization of Iv√°n C√°rdenas Maturell, a Cuban novelist who learns early in his career the hazards of writing in his homeland. Stalin wanted a savage, ‚Äúspectacular‚Äù killing, not just a simple poisoning like the one he ordered for Trotsky‚Äôs son. Trotsky had miraculously survived the attack in 1940 led by the mad muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros, but, on August 20, 1940, Mercader plunged an ice ax into the back of Trotsky‚Äôs head. In Cuba Trotsky is officially vilified to this day for betraying the revolution. Genesis of the novel Leonardo Padura, speaking in 2017; ‚ÄúI first visited Mexico as a journalist in the 1980s. I knew nothing at all about Trotsky but I visited the museum and saw the room where he was assassinated. It made a profound impression on me. I asked myself how was it possible for someone who played such a role in the Revolution and Civil War simply to cease to exist. \\"I went to the library in Havana and found two books about Trotsky. One was called Trotsky the Renegade and the other was Trotsky the Traitor. These were the only official sources available in Cuba at that time. But then something extraordinary occurred. The Berlin Wall fell and after that a mass of material that had been hidden in the archives suddenly became available.\\" Leonardo then started to study the life of Trotsky and gradually the idea took shape in his mind of writing a novel. He went to Russia to investigate the archives, but was astonished to find that there was nothing at all about the assassination of Trotsky. It seems that Stalin followed the plans to assassinate his enemy in great detail and was given daily reports by his agents, but once he had read them, he burned them. Reception 'The Cuban writer Leonardo Padura has made his entrance to the Latin American Modernist canon by writing a Russian novel. The three alternating stories resonate with one another, acquiring deeper meaning as they paint the complete fresco of a political paradigm‚Äôs downfall.' Alvaro Enrigue, The New York Times. 'Padura has written a historical novel of Tolstoyan sweep. [It] is an exhaustively reported work, chockablock with history - from the Russian Revolution, the rise of Fascism and Stalin's show trials to the steely suffocation of post-Castro Cuba.'

Construction began in 1920 and was completed in 1921. The theatre originally seated 1750 people, and Butterfield promoted it as a vaudeville and stage venue. Acts appearing at the Strand included Al Jolson, Harry Houdini, Will Rogers, Marian Anderson, and Bing Crosby. However, by mid-1922, movies substantially replaced the live acts. In 1941, the building was extensively remodeled, adding Art Deco elements to the theatre facade, and renamed the Michigan Theatre. It closed as a movie house in the 1970s, and remained vacant for a number of years. In 1984, the building was redeveloped and converted into a mixed-use office and retail complex known as the Atrium Office Center. The exterior Art Deco elements were removed, and the facade returned to its original look. The rehabilitation focused on the atrium and the theatre lobby, and the auditorium portion was razed. Description The Strand Theatre and Arcade is a large commercial red brick structure containing both a theatre and a two-story arcade. It is decorated with terra cotta, with Art Deco elements from the 1941 remodel. The facade is 109 feet wide, and two stories high, with a three-story gabled block over the center entrance.

Trek-80 combines features of the seminal Star Trek game by Mike Mayfield with the unrelated Trek73. In contrast to the originals, which were designed to run on teletypes, Trek-80 used the VDM-1 video card to produce a character-based real-time display. Compatible 3rd party versions of the VDM-1 became the de facto display for most early S-100 bus machines, as well as the TRS-80. A version known as Invasion Force was sold by Tandy for the TRS-80. An unrelated Trek-80 for the TRS-80 was sold by Judges Guild, but this was a port of the original Mayfield game with few changes. Gameplay Dompier's Trek-80 was mostly based on Mike Mayfield's original version, with only minor changes in the underlying gameplay concepts. The game took place in a section of the galaxy divided into \\"quadrants\\", each of which held a particular number of stars, enemy ships and starbases where the player could repair and refuel. The main difference in layout was that Trek-80's quadrants had 10 by 10 sectors within them, compared to the original 8 by 8 layout. In the original Star Trek, the display was linear and turn-based. Players would normally start the game by issuing the \`LRS\` (long range scan) command to scan the immediate surrounding quadrants and then fly to a selected one using the \`WAR\`p drive. On arrival, they would use the \`SRS\` (short range scan) to display the sectors in the quadrant and begin moving and firing at any targets. \`SRS\` was normally used multiple times in combat as the ships maneuvered. The basic action is the same in Trek-80, but the display is no longer linear and takes place in real- time. The LRS and SRS displays are always visible and update as the game proceeds. Other displays, like the status of the ship and various help texts, were displayed around the screen, eliminating the need to constantly issue commands related to inquiring about basic status. Instead of, for instance, warping to another quadrant by specifying a range, in Trek-80 one simply starts warping in a selected direction, watches the display until they arrive, and then presses \`ESC\`cape to end movement. Likewise, when one fired a torpedo, the other ships continued to move while it flew, and it could be detonated early by the player pressing ESC. Other changes to the original game included two types of Klingon ships. One was the traditional ship which the player would shoot at, while the Battle Cruiser could only be destroyed by dropping an antimatter pod in the quadrant and then manually detonating it when it approached the Cruiser. It also added space mines that destroy everything in a quadrant if hit, and \\"unknown\\" objects that could be explored. Dompier also added basic sound effects which could be heard by placing an AM radio near the computer, a technique he had pioneered during demonstrations for the Homebrew Computer Club. Invasion Force is changed in only minor ways from the original; the player is in command of the USS Hephaestus and battles the \\"Jovian\\"s, but the game is otherwise similar. Development Dompier began development of Trek-80 while the first commercial versions of VDM-1 were being developed at the newly-created Processor Technology, which had formed to sell add-in cards for the recently released Altair 8800 computer. Dompier was familiar with Trek73, and had purchased a teleprinter so he could play a copy running on the DECISION computer at the Lawrence Hall of Science from home. Reception Steve North reviewed Trek-80 and an S-100 version of Spacewar! in the August 1977 issue of Creative Computing. He noted that Trek-80 was far less demanding in terms of system requirements, needing only a VDM-1, while Spacewar! required a Cromemco Dazzler and two joysticks and an I/O card to run them. On the other hand he found the graphics of Spacewar more striking. He mentions that David Ahl was playing Trek-80 and \\"seemed bent on blowing up as many objects as possible without regard for what they were.\\" The game sold for $9.50 on cassette, or $14.50 on punched tape. Glenn Mai reviewed Invasion Force in The Space Gamer No. 36. Mai commented that \\"If you don't have a Star Trek game and want one, get Invasion Force.\\" References Bibliography * * Further reading * Category:1976 video games Category:Judges Guild publications Category:TRS-80 games Category:Video games based on Star Trek Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Trek-80"},{"id":"57884037","text":"Vladim√≠r Padrta (7 October 1952 - 15 September 2009) was a Slovak basketball player.

The match was contested between minor premiers the Sydney Roosters and defending premiers the Melbourne Storm. In front of a crowd of 82,688, Sydney won the match 21‚Äì6 to claim their 14th premiership title and their first since 2013. Roosters five-eighth Luke Keary was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as the game's official man of the match. The match was preceded by the inaugural NRL Women's Premiership Grand Final and the 2018 NRL State Championship. Pre-match entertainment was headlined Sydney alternative rock band Gang of Youths. Australian singer Samantha Jade performed the Australian National anthem. The match was broadcast live throughout Australia by the Nine Network. Background It was the first time the Melbourne Storm and the Sydney Roosters contested for an NRL premiership, with both teams having made the most grand final appearances since the beginning of the NRL era in 1998. Only on six occasions since 1998 has there been a grand final that did not feature either club. Both sides have also claimed every minor premiership since 2013, with the Roosters finishing first in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2018, and the Storm doing the same in 2016 and 2017. The Roosters qualified for their first grand final since they won the premiership in 2013. The club had reached the preliminary finals in 2014, 2015, and 2017, yet were denied a grand final berth on each occasion when they were defeated by the South Sydney Rabbitohs, Brisbane Broncos and North Queensland Cowboys, respectively. The Storm qualified for their third-straight grand final, replicating the milestone they achieved in 2006, 2007 and 2008. They are the first NRL side to make three consecutive grand finals on more than one occasion. It was Trent Robinson's second grand final in his sixth year coaching the Roosters, while Craig Bellamy equalled Wayne Bennett in reaching eight grand finals as a first grade coach. Sydney and Melbourne finished first and second on the premiership ladder respectively, making up a top four in which all teams (together with the South Sydney and Cronulla- Sutherland) finished on 34 points. The sides faced each other only once during the regular season, with the Storm edging out a 9‚Äì8 victory over the Roosters at Adelaide Oval courtesy of a Cameron Smith field goal. Having a double home game advantage, both teams defeated the third-placed Rabbitohs and fourth- placed Sharks to earn a week off from the semi finals and a place into the grand final. Sydney, playing at Allianz Stadium, defeated the Sharks 21‚Äì12 in the second qualifying final. In the preliminary final, they defeated the Rabbitohs 12‚Äì4 in front of a record crowd of 44,380 in the last ever NRL game held at Allianz Stadium before its scheduled knock-down and rebuild. Melbourne, playing at AAMI Park, narrowly defeated the Souths 29‚Äì28 in the first qualifying final, before beating their 2016 grand final opponents Cronulla-Sutherland 22‚Äì6 to join the Roosters in the premiership decider. Sydney and Melbourne last played each other in the finals in 2015, where the fourth-placed Storm defeated the minor-premiership winning Roosters 20‚Äì18 in the first week of the finals.

However, many felt Slater was extremely lucky to be playing in the game after being charged for a shoulder charge against Cronulla player Sosaia Feki in the preliminary final the week before. The judiciary cleared Slater of any wrongdoing, presenting him with the opportunity to win a grand final in the final game of his illustrious career. Melbourne captain Cameron Smith surpassed Darren Lockyer in becoming the most capped finals player in the NRL, with 36 appearances. Brodie Croft, Joe Stimson, Christian Welch, and Brandon Smith were the only new additions to the Storm's grand final winning squad from the previous year. Roosters halfback Cooper Cronk played in his eighth grand final, after playing all seven previous grand finals for the Storm; he equalled Steve Menzies in becoming the fourth most-capped NRL player in history; he also became the first player to win back-to-back premierships with different clubs since Johnny Mayes accomplished the feat in 1973 with Manly- Warringah then 1974 with Eastern Suburbs. Daniel Tupou, Jared Waerea- Hargreaves, Jake Friend, Boyd Cordner, and Mitchell Aubusson were the last remaining members from their 2013 premiership winning squad, while Frank-Paul Nu'uausala wasn't selected to play. Luke Keary was the only other Roosters player to have experienced premiership success, having played for the South Sydney Rabbitohs in their victorious 2014 Grand Final.

Identifying moments of humour and pathos, Greene claimed that a Fordian poetic sense (i.e. not melodic arrangement, but moral composition) had thoroughly \\"impregnated\\" the film \\"from the first shot to the last\\", and that the writing resonated with Chekhov's definition of the novelist's purpose, \\"life as it is: life as it ought to be\\". (reprinted in: ) Greene would return several months later to re-review the film for Night and Day where he again claimed that it was \\"the best film to be seen in London\\". Describing the film as somewhat propagandistic, Greene noted that \\"what makes the film immeasurably superior to its rivals is the strain of adult poetry, the sense of human beings longing for peace\\".

It was property of various noble Prussians and occasionally owned by Prussian Kings \\"The History of Friedrichsfelde Palace\\", Schloss Friedrichsfelde. Retrieved on 12 July 2018.. Currently, the palace offers exhibitions about its history and is a place for musical concerts. History of the palace Formerly constructed around 1695 by architect Johann Arnold Nering as Rosenfelde Palace, the building received its current name in 1699 since Frederick I of Prussia came into possession of the palace. In 1719, architect Martin Heinrich B√∂hme expanded the dimensions of the building on behalf of its new owner, Margrave Albert Frederick of Brandenburg-Schwedt. Thus, Friedrichsfelde Palace was equipped with new baroque stairs and the size of the facade was extended. 1762, the building became property of Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia, brother of Frederick the Great. He aspired to rebuild the palace completely. However, he discarded his plans for Friedrichsfelde Palace and instead used them for the construction of Bellevue Palace in Berlin-Mitte. Sold several times in the course of the following decades, Friedrichsfelde Palace received its neoclassical appearance in 1800. In summer 1816, Carl of Treskow acquired the building and hired the Prussian landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenn√© to transform the park of the palace into an English landscape garden. The palace remained in possession of family Tresckow until May 1945, when the Red Army conquered the palace. The building itself overcame World War II with only a few damages. The restorations of Friedrichsfelde Palace started in 1967. Since 1981, the building is used for musical concerts and as a museum.

Guerillas belonging to the National Liberation Army (ELN) dynamited an oil pipeline which caused a spreading fire to the village. Seventy people lost their lives, many of them children. Details On October 18, 1998, members of the Cimarrones sub-group of the ELN bombed a section of the Ocensa pipeline in Antioquia Department. The blast caused a fireball of crude oil that engulfed the village of Machuca. At first, at least forty were believed to be killed. The death rate eventually hit 70. It was one of the deadliest incidents to civilians in the three decade long Colombian conflict. Aftermath The ELN took responsibility for the bombing, but not the deaths. It said that the Colombian army were the ones who ignited the spilled oil. The head of the Colombian armed forces condemned the ELN. On November 12, Nicolas Rodriguez, head of the ELN, said that the attack was a \\"grave mistake\\" and that they would investigate those responsible. State defence chiefs denied the allegations. The bombing hurt the credibility of the ELN, especially as it entered peace negotiations with the government just a week prior to the attack. The pipeline was operated by British Petroleum (BP). The Guardian reported that BP provided arms equipment to the Colombian army brigade guarding the pipeline, a claim it denied.

Exhibition  On 3 June 1728, the painting was first shown at the , a free open air exhibition held for a few hours at the corner of the Place Dauphine and the Pont Neuf each year on the day of Corpus Christi (but postponed in the event of rain to Sunday after the end of the octave, Little Corpus Christi or Petite F√™te- Dieu). On 25 September 1728, Simeon Chardin exhibited the painting and The Buffet as his reception pieces to the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture. Both works remained with the Academy until the French Revolution, when they were moved to the new Mus√©um Central des Arts, now the Louvre.  Analysis  Chardin depicts the bloody underside of a skate, gutted and hanging from a hook on the stone wall. The fish lies above a shelf on which there are various domestic items to the right on a white cloth: two metal pans, a ceramic jug and a bottle, and a knife. Below the skate are two other fish, and further to the left are some opened oysters and a cat with an arched back and raised fur, as if frightened by the sight. The composition can be analysed as a series of pyramids, with the pointed skate in the centre, the jug and other inanimate objects to the right, and the cat and oysters to the left. The handle of the knife hanging off the ledge and the corner of the stone wall leading past the cat away from the viewer, add depth to the scene. Chardin was influenced by the Dutch still life paintings of the 17th century: the scene has been compared to Rembrandt's painting of the Slaughtered Ox. Although described by Diderot as \\"'disgusting\\", the peculiar but realistic composition was admired by other artists, including Matisse. Marcel Proust likened the image of the eponymous ray to the \\"nave of a polychromatic cathedral.\\" References External links *An Unforgettable Fish From Honest Chardin, article in The New York Observer Category:Paintings by Jean- Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin category:Still life paintings category:1720s paintings category:Cats in art category:Fish in art category:Paintings of the Louvre by French artists ","title":"The Ray (Chardin)"},{"id":"57884260","text":"300px The Buffet is a 1728 still life painting by Jean Sim√©on Chardin.

She was a lady-in-waiting to the queen of Denmark, Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel, and known as a favorite and confidante of the queen. Danske dronniger; fortaellinger og karakteristikker af Ellen Jorgensen og Johanne Skovgaard, Kobenhavn H. Hagerup, 1910 She was the daughter of Henri Charles de La Tr√©moille, prince de Talmont and Tarente (1620‚Äì1672), and Emilie of Hesse-Kassel (1626‚Äì1693). Charlotte Am√©lie de La Tr√©moille was raised in France as a Huguenot Calvinist by her grandmother Marie de la Tour d'Auvergne. After the death of her grandmother in 1665, she emigrated to the Netherlands to avoid being converted by her uncle, but returned in 1668. Her father converted in 1670 and demanded that his family do the same, which they refused. In 1672, her maternal aunt heard of her religious difficulties and offered her to come to Denmark as her lady-in- waiting, and she and her mother left for Copenhagen after having been permitted to depart by Louis XIV of France, where she was appointed hofdame (maid-of-honour) to her aunt the queen. Initially, she had difficulty adjusting to Danish court life, where the language was German, but she soon became the queen's favorite lady-in-waiting. She is described as pious but also bold and forward. In 29 May 1680, she married Anton I, Count von Aldenburg (1633‚Äì1680). The match gave her spouse an alliance with Louis XIV.Dansk biografisk Lexikon / XV. Bind. Scalabrini - Skanke The marriage was liked by the king as well as by her mother, but extremely disliked by the queen because Aldenburg belonged to a party at the royal court which was hostile to the queen, and she reportedly told Charlotte Am√©lie that she hoped that she would soon become a widow. After the wedding, she left for Oldenburg. She had a son during the marriage. She did become a widow after only five months, and for the rest of her life, she was forced to engage in a long, ongoing inheritance dispute with the relatives of her late spouse to protect the rights of her son. During the process, she made several visits to the royal Danish court to unsuccessfully ask for assistance, but the king supported the opposite party. Queen Charlotte Amalie, however, is known to have given her support, often invited her as guest, and visited her. Her stepdaughter Dorothea Justina Haxthausen also became a favorite of the queen. She lived the rest of her life in the Netherlands; from 1706 onward in Utrecht. Charlotte Am√©lie de La Tr√©moille wrote her own memoirs, intended to her son, which described her life from 1652 to 1719 and put focus on descriptions of famous people she met and the inheritance dispute which she fought for her son. They were given a great deal of interest from the late 19th century.  References  * Umar Sayyed, Tr√©mo√Ølle, Charlotte Am√©lie de la, in: Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland.

She is most known for the sculpture she designed for the Fountain of Science at the Century of Progress 1933-1934 World's Fair in Chicago, located in front of the main entrance to the Hall of Science. The sculpture, known as Science Advancing Mankind, depicted an abstract robot form nudging a male and female figure forward, which exemplified the fair's themes of scientific and technological progress. After the fair, in 1935, she donated the sculpture to Joliet Township High School, now Joliet Central High School, where students dubbed it the \\"Steelman\\" and it served as the school team name and mascot.Murals : the Great Walls of Joliet, By Jeff Huebner.

Grenades were thrown in two bars in the wealthy Zona Rosa neighborhood, killing one person, injuring 73 and badly damaging the premises. The authorities blamed Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerillas for the attack. The fatal victim was a young woman. Three Americans and a German were among the injured. It was believed the FARC targeted Americans in the attack. The U.S. government provided $2.5 billion to the Colombian government in its fight against rebels and drug traffickers. The attack was the sixth in Bogot√° that year, and prompted security concerns to residents amid the rebels' increasing attacks in urban areas. The national police managed to capture one of the men who threw the grenades.

It was built in 1937 by the Continental Oil Company (Conoco) and is notable as a well-preserved example of the automobile-oriented development that shaped the city during the mid-20th century. with The building was listed on the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties and the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. The service station is built in the form of a cottage, a popular design at the time, with a steeply pitched compound gable roof and a chimney. The walls are white glazed brick with green trim. The building has a side- gabled office section on the west side adjoining two front-gabled garage bays with wooden roll-up doors. The easternmost garage bay was an addition built onto the original station around 1939. The property also includes concrete gas pump islands, a c. 1960s light pole and a steel sign post, though the pumps, tanks, and signage have been removed. The station was operated by Conoco until 1961, then by Horn Oil Company until around 1983. In 1992, the vacant station was leased by the Albuquerque Conservation Association (TACA), which uses the building as headquarters for its preservation workshops and other activities.

Danske dronniger; fortaellinger og karakteristikker af Ellen Jorgensen og Johanne Skovgaard, Kobenhavn H. Hagerup, 1910 She was the daughter of Anton of Oldenburg and stepdaughter to Charlotte Am√©lie de la Tr√©moille. She married Anton Wolf Haxthausen in 1689. She was appointed overhofmesterinde to the queen of Denmark in 1695, and like her stepmother, became one of two ladies- in-waiting known as the favorite of the queen, who referred to her as \\"liebstes D√∂rtgen\\" and \\"Madame la Comtesse\\". The intimacy of their relationship is illustrated in a letter from the queen in reply to Hauxthausen, who had expressed concern that she would be unable to perform in her office because of her illnesses: \\"Do not fear that I shall be offended. No matter how ill you are, you shall always be as dear to me, and if God should wish to deprive me of a part of the help, which I would wish to have of your service, so let us both submit to his mighty hand.\\" She is described as an accomplished and loveable personality. She retired from her office for health reasons in 1705.

The unit was produced by Akai in 1995. It is housed in a 1U half- rack chassis and can be controlled through General MIDI messages. The SG01v has 32 voice polyphony and 16 part multi-timbrality. Considering the technology of the day, the SG01v reproduces with surprising fidelity the sounds of even older analogue synthesizers, as well as two drum kits. The \\"V\\" designation in the model name denotes \\"vintage\\" sounds. The model line also includes an SG01k (\\"K\\" for \\"keys\\"), which was strictly a General MIDI module, and an SG01p (\\"P\\" for \\"piano\\"). Front panel The front panel contains a three digit, seven-segment LED display and a volume control button. Basic editing can be done via the seven control buttons on the front of the unit. Back panel * MIDI interface * Main out * Headphones * Power supply Hardware The main processor in the SG01V is an NEC D-70236, and the digital-to-audio converter (DAC) is an NEC UPD63210GT.

It stars Sarah Hyland, Steven Krueger, Justin Chon, Clara Mamet, Sophie Dalah and Anthony Carrigan. The film was released in a limited release and through video on demand on July 1, 2016, by Magnet Releasing.  Plot  The film begins with a scared female making her way through a dark labyrinth of pentagram covered walls, hearing voices, trembling with fear. A figure runs past her. A group of Teenagers arrive in Los Angeles, planning to spend two days conducting a 'dark tour' of several occult sites, Seth and Elise are goths and Chloe and David their friends. They pass an abandoned building, seeing and taking pictures of a mysterious figure inside panicking. The group then heads to the Flower Hotel, where Elise requested Room 204 where Laney Gore committed suicide in 1972, a Laveyan satanic priestess, the Room's wall the same as the crime photo on Seth's phone. Chloe is unsure, the next morning Elise, using an Ouija board claims she 'felt something'. The group begin their dark tour visiting the Los Angeles Chapter of the Church of Satan. Two people leave the building, and spit at the group when they try asking them questions. They next visit the Tate Residence in the Hollywood Hills where Charles Manson had several people murdered in 1969. At the Black Door Shop, which sells occult and satanic goods. The owner has them leave when Seth sees a satanic altar in the backroom. The group heads to Venice for the rest of the day. The group brood about the shop owner kicking them out, and decide to see where he goes. They follow him to a house where the owner and multiple people are conducting a satanic ritual. A girl (Alice) undresses and the group have a knife at her throat. As Chloe screams out, she spits at them and runs off. The group escapes back to the hotel. Chloe gets a call the next morning from Seth's phone which was left at the house the previous night and found by Alice. The group meet Alice later that day and take her back to the hotel where she recognizes room 204. That night, all of them engage in a ritual. Alice draws a pentagram on the wall with a strike mark at each point. She then throws up and takes off her clothes to reveal several branding marks and cut marks on her body, alerting the group. She then cuts her own throat. After leaving the police station later on, Chloe and her friends go to a friend of Davids' until the police get back to them. Elise uses the Ouija board wanting to know why Alice killed herself, 'where she went'. David alarms when out of the shower he discovers a pentagram drawn on the fogged up bathroom window. The group find the kitchen dirty and cutlery sticking out of the ceiling, and numerous birds dead in the pool outside. The group return to the Black Door Shop and David violently interrogates the owner, who says that they weren't going to sacrifice Alice, they were expelling her for being 'too hardcore'. Having enough, the group decide to leave Los Angeles. On their way out, they pull over, Elise not felling well. Chloe discovers two large strike marks on Elise's belly. Elise goes into a toilet, screams and has vanished when Chloe opens the door, scratch marks and torn clothes remaining. Chloe's phone loses signal and she and David go looking for Seth, crying for Elise in an abandoned building. Chloe and David look for their friends, Elise screaming for Chloe somewhere in the building. They hear Seth yelling 'I'M BURNING!' and screaming. On another floor, they find three bloody strike marks on a pillar, then four marks carved on David's face. Then David vanishes as Chloe tries to flee the building. Tearfully she looks for Elise in a maze of sheets covered with pentagrams, crying and frightened. She makes her way through the maze to a window and tries to get the attention of a car on the ground, which she recognizes as her friends. She warns them, screaming, but the Chloe in the car just takes photos and David drives off. Chloe scrambles down the stairs to the exit but the door slams shut before she can get to it. For the next 15 minutes of the movie, there is nothing but the sound of Chloe constantly screaming. She finds herself in a small dark room with claw and strike marks on the walls. In the darkness, her mouth has been stitched shut and arms cut off. The Devil picks up her phone and walks with it towards her, and touches her cheek with a thin pale hand as Chloe tries to scream through the stitches.

Their nobility was derived from their settlement in Sz√©kely Land as terra nullius (not yet belonging to anyone, including to the Hungarian king).dr. vit√©z √°kosfalvi Szil√°gyi L√°szl√≥, \\"Sz√©kely Primor Csal√°dok\\", Budapest, 1938. http://mtdaportal.extra.hu/books/szilagyi_laszlo_szekely_primor_csaladok.pdf Being nobles, all members of Sz√©kely society were personally bound to take up arms in defence of their country (Sz√©kely Land at the time forming the Eastern border of Hungary, and in part of Christian Europe). According to their ability to do so, they were divided into three categories. The pixidarii (commoners) were those who had a small plot of land, but did not have a horse, and as such were enlisted as infantrymen. The wealthier primipilus, also called l√≥f≈ë (\\"chief horsemen\\") or equites, comparable to knights, and bound to take part in battle as cavalry soldiers. The primores, finally, were nobles with considerable land and wealth, and as such, were expected to provide an armed force. Later, the primores began to expand their power over the other two groups, attaining a status comparable to the higher aristocracy of medieval Hungary.dr. vit√©z √°kosfalvi Szil√°gyi L√°szl√≥, \\"Sz√©kely Primor Csal√°dok\\", Budapest, 1938. http://mtdaportal.extra.hu/books/szilagyi_laszlo_szekely_primor_csaladok.pdf Under King Matthias, during the 15th century, the primores' status was codified in law.dr. vit√©z √°kosfalvi Szil√°gyi L√°szl√≥, \\"Sz√©kely Primor Csal√°dok\\", Budapest, 1938. http://mtdaportal.extra.hu/books/szilagyi_laszlo_szekely_primor_csaladok.pdf Conversely time, the pixidarii (commoners) were gradually reduced to de facto peasants. Under Stephen Bathory, in the 16th century, pixidarii were no longer exempt from paying taxes, barred from becoming elected officials and could be forced to work as serfs, de jure completing this process. After Hungary came under Habsburg rule, Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I in his 1691 Diploma Leopoldinum confirmed the validity of Transsylvanian noble titles, including the primores.dr. vit√©z √°kosfalvi Szil√°gyi L√°szl√≥, \\"Sz√©kely Primor Csal√°dok\\", Budapest, 1938. http://mtdaportal.extra.hu/books/szilagyi_laszlo_szekely_primor_csaladok.pdf  Etymology  The word 'primor' is postulated to have come from Latin primus, or 'first', possibly as 'the first in line of battle'.  Legal status  The still valid 1947 Statute IV regarding the abolition of certain titles and ranks abolished all titles of Hungarian aristocracy, specifically including primor. It is currently prohibited in the Republic of Hungary to use the title. Before the Communist era, the royal minister of internal affairs regulated the use of the title of primor. One was legally considered a primor, if one could prove to be a direct descendant of a family that was considered part of the high Sz√©kely aristocracy in 1713 or before, or could provide a princely diploma granting status into high Sz√©kely aristocracy to one of his proven direct ancestors.

Fran√ßois Le Noir, sieur de La Thorilli√®re (c. 1626 ‚Äì 27 July 1680) was a French comic actor, who was born and died in Paris.Mongr√©dien 1972, p. 107. Life La Thorilli√®re was the son of Charles Le Noir, founder of the Th√©√¢tre du Marais in 1634, and his wife, Isabelle Mestivier.Deierkauf- Holsboer 1970, p. 150; Gaines 2002, p. 257. After serving as a captain in the Lorraine Regiment, he married the 21-year-old Marie Petitjean on 30 April 1658. She was the niece of La Rocque, an actor at the Marais, and Fran√ßois joined the Marais company in 1659. In June 1662, he and Br√©court moved to Moli√®re's company, where La Thorilli√®re acted in several of Moli√®re's plays, most notably as a sad marquis in L'Impromptu de Versailles (1663) and as Hali in Le Sicilien (1667).Mongr√©dien 1972, p. 107; Gaines 2002, p. 257. He was also for a time in charge of the accounts for Moli√®re's company. His first register (1663‚Äì1664) was published by George Monval in 1890;La Thorilli√®re 1890. the second (1664‚Äì1665) is preserved in the Archives of the Com√©die- Fran√ßaise. He wrote the play Cl√©op√¢tre, premiered at the Palais-Royal in December 1667 and put on eleven times.Gaines 2002, p. 258. On 17 January 1671 he played the King in the premiere of the com√©die-ballet Psych√©, with text and lyrics by Moli√®re, Philippe Quinault and Pierre Corneille and music by Jean- Baptiste Lully.Gaines 2002, pp. 395‚Äì396; Deierkauf-Holsboer 1970, p. 151 (role). After Moli√®re's death in 1673, La Thorilli√®re (along with Michel Baron and Beauval and his wife) left that troupe and joined the Com√©diens du Roi at the H√¥tel de Bourgogne.Clarke 1998, p. 4. It was La Thorilli√®re's death in 1680 that, among other reasons, precipitated the merger of the players from the Bourgogne with those at the Gu√©n√©gaud Theatre, leading to the creation of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. Some scholars have suggested he had been opposed to any merger since 1673, possibly due to animosity or rivalry between La Thorilli√®re and La Grange, the orator of that troupe.Rivalry was favored by Deierkauf- Hoelsboer in her second volume on the Marais Theatre, although according to Clarke, there is no direct evidence to support it (Deierkauf-Hoelsboer 1958, p. 185; Clarke 1998, p. 5). Hartnoll states La Thorilli√®re had opposed the merger since moving to the Bourgogne (Hartnoll 1983, p. 474). Howarth states it was \\"no doubt\\" due to animosity between the two resulting from La Thorilli√®re's desertion in 1673 (Howarth 1997, p. 286). His son Pierre (1659‚Äì1731), also known as La Thorilli√®re, became a soci√©taire of the Com√©die- Fran√ßaise. His daughter Charlotte (born 1661) married Michel Baron in 1675, whilst his daughter Marie-Th√©r√®se (born 1663) married the playwright Dancourt in 1680.Mongr√©dien 1972, p. 107; Gaines 2002, p. 258.

The house is located at 14 Vokzalnaya Street () It was a main station building between 1878 and 1914. The building was designed in the Russian Revival style. It is recognized as a historical landmark, has official status as an object of Russian cultural heritage, and contains the museum of History & Engineering science of the Sverdlovsk Railway.  History  Yekaterinburg station in the 1910s Yekaterinburg railway station was built in 1878 with the construction of the Ural mining railway from Perm to Yekaterinburg with the length of 372 km. It was designed by architect Pyotr Shreyber. Construction began in 1874. A twin train station, currently known as the Perm I railway station, was built to Shreyber's design at the other end of the railway. Opening of the railway triggered the economic growth, improving the quality of life. After extension railways to Tyumen in 1886 and Chelyabinsk in 1896 station becomes a railway junction. The small station building could not cope with the increased passenger traffic by the beginning of the 20th century. For this reason Ministry of Transportation decided to build a new building a hundred meters away in 1910, which services the passengers of the Yekaterinburg railway station today. For a very long time the old building served as a railway station for the military. And in 2003, the railway was reconstructed and now serves as a museum open to the public. The Museum of History & Engineering Science of the Sverdlovsk Railway was opened in the old station building in 2003. Rolling stock is exposed at the Yekaterinburg-Sortirivichny station, but the historical part is located here. In the front section of the building are sculptures of what appears to be hurrying passengers, and a station master changing a bell, and some stack man. They were designed by Yuri Krylov and Alexander Kokoteyev. The first thing seen inside the old rail station, is the first steam machine designed by Cherepanov brothers in Nizhny Tagil.

(1906). Dictionnaire d'histoire et de g√©ographie du Japon; Papinot, (2003). It was based at Katsuyama Castle in eastern Echizen Province in what is now the city of Katsuyama in Fukui Prefecture. It was ruled during most if its history by a cadet branch of the Ogasawara clan. History After the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu awarded Echizen Province to his second son, Y≈´ki Hideyasu as a 690,000 koku domain. Hideyasu assigned the area to Hayashi Sadatada as a 9800 koku fief; however, Hayashi was dispossessed in 1612 by Hideyasu's son, Matsudaira Tadanao. Tadanao was in turn dispossessed by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1623, and Fukui Domain was divided, with Y≈´ki Hideyasu's 5th son, Matsudaira Naomoto receiving a 30,000 koku domain centered at Katsuyama. This marked the start of Katsuyama Domain, although initially it was somewhat ambiguous as to whether or not Katsuyama was independent, or a subsidiary of Fukui Domain. In 1635, Matsudaira Naomoto was transferred to neighbouring ≈åno Domain, and his younger brother, Matsudaira Naoyoshi became daimy≈ç. In 1644, he was also transferred to ≈åno Domain, and Katsuyama Domain became extinct. In 1686, its territories were transferred from Fukui Domain to the shogunate, and it became tenry≈ç territory. In 1691, Katsuyama Domain was restored as a 22,000 koku holding for Ogasawara Sadanobu, formerly of Takasu Domain in Mino Province. The Ogasawara clan continued to rule Katsuyama until the end of the Edo period, suffering from more than ten peasant uprisings brought about by famine, natural disasters and crop failure. During the Boshin War of the Meiji restoration, Katsuyama Domain quickly sided with the new government, and was assigned to the policing of Kyoto in 1868. In 1869, the 8th (and final) Ogasawara daimy≈ç, Ogasawara Nagamori became imperial governor until the abolition of the han system in July 1871. Holdings at the end of the Edo period Like most domains in the han system, Katsuyama consisted of several discontinuous territories calculated to provide the assigned kokudaka, based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields,Mass, Jeffrey P. and William B.

He was the son of Takagi Sadakatsu, a k≈çtai yoriai official within the shogunate administration and was born in Mino Province. As his mother was a daughter of Ogasawara Nobuyuki, he was adopted as heir to Sekiyado Domain, becoming daimy≈ç in 1640. However, as he was only 10 years old at the time, the shogunate decided that he was too young for such an important post, and transferred him to Takasu Domain two months later. In 1691, he was transferred to the newly revived Echizen-Katsuyama Domain. He served as Osaka Kaban from 1692-1693. The posting proved to be expensive, and he attempted to raise taxes in the domain to compensate. This resulted in a peasant's revolt and rioting for several years, with a delegation from the domain even appearing in Edo in 1697 to take their complaint to higher authorities. Sadanobu was forced to relent. he retired in 1702 to the clan residence in Honj≈ç, but continued to meddle in clan government and affair, creating great confusion and disturbance to his death in 1702. HIs wife was the daughter of Ogasawara Masanobu. His graves are at the temple of Kaizen-ji in Tait≈ç, Tokyo and the temple of Kaizen-ji in Katsuyama. Ogasawara Nobutoki was the 2nd daimy≈ç of Echizen-Katsuyama Domain. He was born as the eldest son of Ogasawara Nobuyuki, the youngest son of Ogasawara Sadanobu, and became daimy≈ç in 1702 on the retirement of his grandfather. However, his grandfather continued to meddle in domain affairs even after retirement, resulting in conflicting instructions and orders, and dividing the domain's retainers into factions which were at continual conflict. He served as Osaka Kaban in 1703, 1706, 1711 and 1715, and also faced the addition expense of rebuilding the domain's Edo residence after a fire. He fell ill in 1719 and was unable to handle domain affairs, and in 1721 retired in favor of his son, taking the tonsure and the name of Kawachi Ny≈´d≈ç (Ê≤≥ÂÜÖÂÖ•ÈÅì), He retired to Shiroyama onsen, and died in 1736. His wife was the daughter of Mizuno Tadanao of Matsumoto Domain. His grave is at the temple of Kaizen-ji in Katsuyama. Ogasawara Nobunari  was the 3rd daimy≈ç of Echizen-Katsuyama Domain. He was born in Edo as the hatamoto grandson of Sakai Tadatsugu and was adopted by Ogasawara Nobutoki as heir in 1720. He became daimy≈ç in 1721. He served as Osaka Kaban in 1724 and 1727; in 1726 a volcanic eruption caused crop failure and massive damage in the Katsuyama area, and while struggling with recovery, he was appointed Osaka Kaban again in 1730. Unable to cope with these pressures, he fell ill and died in 1730 without heir. Ogasawara Nobutane was the 4th daimy≈ç of Echizen- Katsuyama Domain. he was the second son of Honda Tadamune of Ise-Kanbe Domain, and was posthumously adopted as heir to the childless Ogasawara Nobunari, becoming daimy≈ç in 1730. He underwent his genpuku ceremony in 1731. However, due to his youth, internal political factions within the domain, and the severe financial situation, he proved unable to handle the responsibilities of his office, and died of illness in 1745. His wife was the granddaughter of Nagai Naonobu of Iwatsuki Domain, but he died without heir. Ogasawara Nobufusa  was the 5th daimy≈ç of Echizen-Katsuyama Domain. He was eldest son of Ogasawara Nobutoki, but had been bypassed in the succession and was adopted as posthumous heir to Ogasawara Nobutake, becoming daimy≈ç in 1745. However, he was only 13-years-old and had poor health, and left domain affairs largely in the hands of senior retainers, who were forced to reduce taxation in 1771 due to peasant revolts. He fell ill in 1775, and resigned in 1780, retiring to Shiroyama Onsen where he died in 1762. Ogasawara Nobumichi  was the 6th daimy≈ç of Echizen-Katsuyama Domain. He was eldest son of Ogasawara Nobufusa and became daimy≈ç in 1780 on the retirement of his father due to illness. He codified the laws of the domain and attempted economic reforms by implementing a fiscal austerity program. However, these efforts were thwarted when the Katsuyama j≈çkamachi burned down in 1781 and the Great Tenmei famine hit the domain in 1783. Further, the domain's shimoyashiki in Edo burned down in 1786, and severe storms caused crop failure in 1791. A massive uprising occurred in 1797. He died in Edo in 1799 at the age of 40. HIs wife was a daughter of Nakagawa Hisasada of Oka Domain. Ogasawara Nagataka  was the 7th daimy≈ç of Echizen-Katsuyama Domain. He was the eldest son of Ogasawara Nobumichi, and became daimy≈ç on this father's death in 1799. Disaster continue to stalk the domain, with the Katsuyama j≈çkamachi (which had recently been rebuilt after a major fire in 1781) burning down again in 1799, and the domain's Edo residence burning down in 1803. In 1811, there was widespread famine in the domain due to crop failure, followed by a peasant's revolt in 1814. This was followed by the Tenp≈ç famine of 1833-1837. Despite this background, he served as s≈çshaban in the shogunal administration in 1816, and from 1829 to 1840 as a wakadoshiyori under Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieharu. His wife was a daughter of Sakai Tadahiro of Himeji Domain. Ogasawara Nagamori  Ogasawara Nagamori was the 8th (and final) daimy≈ç of Echizen-Katsuyama Domain. He was the sixth son of Ogasawara Nagataka and became daimy≈ç on his father's death in 1840. he was received in formal audience by Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieyoshi in 1848. As he was underage at the time of his accession, the domain was run by senior retainers, who actively attempted to reform the domain governance and finances, encouraging new industries. A han school was founded in 1843, and the domain attempted to modernize its weaponry from 1848. These efforts were hindered by an order from the shogunate to contribute to flood control projects on rivers in the Kant≈ç region and by damage caused by the Ansei great earthquakes of 1854-1855. In 1864, he was appointed as an Osaka Kaban and from 1865 the domain's military was called upon to assist with the policing of Kyoto. In the Boshin War of 1868, the domain quickly sided with the Meiji government, and he served as imperial governor of Katsuyama from 1869-1871. He retired in 1873. and spent his retirement in painting until his death in 1891.

He was only briefly a Captain, and is best known for sailing under a number of more prominent pirate captains. History Williams was a crewman aboard the East India Company ship Mary in the 1690s. At Madagascar Williams swam ashore to help the Mary replenish its water supplies. High waves and rough surf prevented them from retrieving Williams from ashore so they departed without him. He was taken in by a friendly Malagasy tribe and fought alongside them in various tribal wars. He served several different local Kings who had him command their troops after seeing his bravery and skill in battle. Around 1698 he made his way to a settlement headed by ex-pirate Abraham Samuel and began his own period of piracy. He first joined Evan Jones aboard the Beckford Galley. Jones‚Äô ship was wrecked while careening so Williams joined the Pelican, captained by Joseph Wheeler (or possibly Robert Colley). He also sailed with Robert Culliford on the Mocha, with George Booth aboard the Speaker, and with Thomas Howard on the Prosperous. Howard‚Äôs men went ashore to visit former pirate Aert Van Tuyl (‚ÄúOrt Van Tyle‚Äù); when they heard Van Tuyl had earlier attacked another group of pirates, they fought and in the ensuing battle Williams was captured. Van Tuyl kept Williams as a slave, though he escaped several months later. He lived for a year with a Malagasy Prince before joining a pirate settlement led by Dutchman John Pro. Williams, Pro, and others were captured by a Royal Navy frigate; escaping again, Williams joined pirate Thomas White for a time. By 1706 he was sailing with John Halsey aboard the Charles. When Halsey returned to Madagascar in 1707, Williams departed and assisted a local King in tribal conflicts. Halsey then seized the Scottish slave ship Neptune. He died soon after and Williams was elected Captain, with Samuel Burgess as quartermaster, but the Neptune was almost immediately wrecked in a storm. Burgess and Williams then engaged in slave trading until Burgess was killed after arguing with a local chieftain. Williams fitted out a small ship to go pirating but poor navigation and contrary winds kept his ship confined close to shore. Finally he sailed to the Arab settlement of Boyn to trade. Williams had only five men with him at the time; troops sent by the Governor of Boyn ambushed him and his men, killing all of them and looting his sloop. A Malagasy King whom Williams had once aided was furious at the treatment Williams received at Boyn. In revenge he had the Governor of Boyn abducted and killed and said, ‚ÄúHe was sorry the Villain had but one Life to make Atonement for the Barbarity he had been guilty of.‚Äù See also *James Plaintain and Adam Baldridge ‚Äì Two other ex- pirates who, like Abraham Samuel and John Pro, ran pirate trading settlements on or near Madagascar.

It is constructed in the 1890s on the central square of the city of Nakhchivan-on-Don (nowadays as a part of Proletarsky district of Rostov-on- Don). The building has the status of an object of cultural heritage of regional value.  History and description  Development of the project of the building is attributed to the city architect of Nakhchivan-on-Don to N. N. Durbakh. In the mansion there lived a hlebopromyshlennik A. S. Sagirov. In 1906 the building was got by A. Shelgunova. At the beginning of the 1910th years, the mansion was rented by the businessman B. A. Kamerstein who opened in it a cinematography of Eldorado ‚Äì one of the first in the city. In 1921 the movie theater was renamed into honor of the 3rd International. In three years it began to be called \\"Casino\\". By the end of the 1920th years, the movie theater received the name Spartak. After the war, the mansion lost a canopy over an entrance and a part of a modeled decor. During a change of the equipment at the movie theater planning was changed, the new entrance appeared. In 1999 to the anniversary of the city repairs under the leadership of the architect Mr. Shevchenko was made. The architect and the restorer Lyubov Voloshinova noted the bad quality of this repair: the socle was revetted with a melkorazmerny cement tile, the initial color scale was changed, modern metal canopies are built. The Polutoraetazhny mansion is turned by the main facade on Liberty Square. In the east, the house is adjoined by Kechekyan's mansion. In the registration of the house of Sagirov elements of classicism and baroque are combined. The side raskrepovka finished by triangular pediments are allocated. In the central part of a facade five rectangular windows issued by decorative platbands. The facade comes to the end with eaves on which decorative modeled vases settled down earlier. Initially in the southern part of the mansion the lobby and the ceremonial hall, and in northern ‚Äì a drawing room and bedrooms settled down. The first floor was occupied by utility rooms. The ceremonial hall was visually divided by poles, one couple of which was decorated with caryatids, and another ‚Äì Atlases.

As a two-year-old he failed to win a race but showed considerable promise when finishing second in the Dewhurst Plate. He was still a maiden when he won the Guineas which proved to be his only victory over Donovan in eight meetings. He went on to win the Sussex Stakes as well as finishing third in the Prince of Wales's Stakes and fourth in the St Leger. After his retirement from racing he had some success as a breeding stallion. Background Enthusiast was a \\"very handsome\\" chestnut horse bred at the Yardley stud near Birmingham by the Graham brothers. As a yearling he was offered for sale and bought for 2,000 guineas by Douglas Baird. He was trained at Newmarket, Suffolk by James Ryan. His sire, Sterling, was a successful racehorse who became an excellent sire whose other offspring included Isonomy, Paradox, Enterprise and Harvester. Enthusiast's dam Cherry Duchess produced several other good winners including the July Cup winner Energy and was the female-line ancestor of Alsab. Racing career 1888: two-year-old season On 10 October Enthusiast made his debut in the Middle Park Plate over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse and finished eighth of the fourteen runners behind Donovan. At the next Newmarket meeting two weeks later the colt finished second to Royal Star in the Criterion Stakes and then started at odds of 8/1 for the Dewhurst Plate over seven furlongs. Ridden by Tom Cannon he led for most of the way before being overtaken a furlong out and beaten half a length by Donovan. 1889: three- year-old season Tom Cannon, who rode Enthusiast to victory in the 2000 Guineas On his three-year-old debut, Enthusiast finished fourth behind Donovan, Mr Abingdon's Pioneer and Minthe in the ¬£12,000 Prince of Wales's Stakes at Leicester on 6 April. On 1 May 1889, with Tom Cannon in the saddle, Enthusiast was one of nine colts to contest the 81st running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket and started the 25/1 fourth choice in the betting. Donovan appeared to be a near certainty for the race and started at odds of 20/85 (1/4.25) whilst Pioneer and Prince Solykoff's Gold were the only other horses to start at less than 100/1. Enthusiast started slowly and then settled behind the leaders before producing a strong run down the centre of the track approaching the last quarter mile. By this point Donovan had gone to the front from Pioneer but Enthusiast maintained his progress and headed the favourite inside the final furlong. Donovan rallied in the final strides but Enthusiast held on to win by a head with Pioneer three quarters of a length back in third. The closing stages of the contest provoked the \\"wildest excitement\\" which was followed by an \\"awful moment of breathless silence\\" before the judge announced the result. Enthusiast was moved up in distance for the Newmarket Stakes over ten furlongs on 21 May in which started the 100/30 second favourite in a seventeen-runner field. He reportedly \\"cracked\\" two furlongs out and finished unplaced behind Donovan who won \\"very easily\\". In the Epsom Derby on 5 June Cannon opted to partner Baird's more- fancied runner El Dorado leaving Calder to take the mount on Enthusiast. Starting a 33/1 outsider he ran well early on and turned into the straight in second place but then dropped from contention and came home eighth of the thirteen runners behind Donovan. At Royal Ascot he faced Donovan yet again in the Prince of Wales's Stakes over thirteen furlongs and finished third to his old rival, with second place going to Royal Star. He returned to winning form at Goodwood Racecourse when he won the Sussex Stakes at odds of 6/4, ridden by Billy Warne. On 11 September Enthusiast, with Cannon in the saddle, started 100/6 thirdchoice in the betting behind Donovan and the highly regarded Northern colt Chittabob for the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. The Derby winner completely dominated the race and although Cannon \\"did all he could\\", Enthusiast came home fourth behind Donovan, Miguel and Davenport. Ten days later the colt was dropped back in distance for the ¬£12,000 Lancashire Plate over seven furlongs at Manchester Racecourse and finished outside the first five as Donovan won again. On the last of his races that year he came home last of the four runners behind Gold, Antipas and Ayrshire in the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket in October. 1890: four-year-old season Enthusiast remained in training as a four-year-old in 1890. In the Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles on 19 June he briefly took the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished fourth of the five runners behind Gold. Stud record At the end of his racing career Enthusiast was retired to become a breeding stallion. He was not a great success at stud bud did produce several good winners including Eager (July Cup, Wokingham Stakes, Portland Handicap), Energetic (Sussex Stakes) and Lord Edward (National Breeders' Produce Stakes). Enthusiast died on 23 October 1909. Pedigree *Enthusiast was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Sir Hercules, meaning that this stallion appear twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

The mansion was built at the beginning of the 20th century and belonged to the Rostov grain-grower and a stud to Ivan Aleksandrovich Suprunov. The building has the status of an object of cultural heritage of regional value.  History  I. A. Suprunov's mansion was built at the beginning of the 20th century. The city legend is connected with the construction of this house. Allegedly Suprunov during the trip to Italy decided to walk on the streets of Naples (according to another version ‚Äî Genoa). The merchant was so struck by one refined mansion that he decided to buy by all means it and to bring to Rostov. The merchant addressed the host with this offer. The owner of the mansion refused in the beginning, but Suprunov offered it such large sum that he agreed. The mansion was sorted, shipped on the barge and transported to Rostov-on-Don. There the mansion was restored, Suprunov watched its assembly personally. However, there is an opinion that rumors about the Italian origin of the mansion were spread by Suprunov to draw attention to the business. According to another version which is written down according to Supernova's daughter, the house was built of local materials on the project brought by the merchant from the World Fair of 1910 in Brussels. The mansion was revetted with marble and a majolica. Window openings had the semi-circular end, the central entrance was issued by the marble portal. In front of the house the front garden was located, and behind the mansion, a garden with the pool, revetted with a blue majolica was laid out. Along Pushkinskaya Street the fencing on a high socle with a shod lattice was established. In tax deeds, the house was estimated at 17 thousand rubles. Ivan Suprunov lived in the mansion with the family. After the arrival of the Soviet power the mansion was nationalized, and Suprunov was arrested and was missing. In the former house of Suprunov day, nursery and the children's receiver were placed. During the Great Patriotic War, the mansion underwent serious destructions: marble facing, a roof, and parapets were lost. In the first half of the 1950th years, the house was reconstructed in pseudoclassical style and transferred under housing. From an initial decor facing the first floor, dark marble remained.

Registration Statement for The Immune Response Corporation. 10.28.96. Pg 3029-31. Nature Medicine later reported on an independent group of scientists at Stanford University who published results of a Phase I clinical trial using this technology to treat patients suffering from B-cell lymphoma. After incubation and pre-clinical validation by IRC, the dendritic cell product was licensed to a startup in exchange for founders stock, $500,000 in cash and royalties. Recognizing the potential for antigen-presenting dendritic cells, that startup changed its name to Dendreon and Its major investor was Paul Allen (Vulcan Ventures owned 22% of the company by the time it went public). Allen had been diagnosed with non- Hodgkin's disease, often a precursor to B-cell lymphoma, the subject of the IRC/Urbaininvention. Based on positive clinical results, this product, Sipuleucel-T, more commonly known as Provenge, became the first immunotherapeutic cancer vaccine. Scientific American and CNN were among the first to identify this as a landmark vaccine and a milestone. Sipuleucel-Ti, initially approved for treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy, was then recommended in 2015 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.National Comprehensive Cancer Network . 2016. NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guideline¬Æ): Prostate Cancer: Version 1. 2015 November 10. www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/prostate.pdf. According to its manufacturer, the Sanpower Group, more than 30,000 men had been prescribed Sipuleucel-T as of 2017. After its U.S. market introduction, the process and facility that produced this immunotherapeutic became the key to the approval of Kymriah, the first CAR-T immunotherapy (chimeric antibody receptor T-Cell). Its developer, Novartis, required a complex manufacturing infrastructure capable of delivering an immunotherapeutic of consistent quality in order to produce the clinical and commercial quantities needed to obtain FDA approval.Ibid. ‚ÄúLuckily, one biotech, Dendreon, solved this problem with its prostate cancer treatment,‚Äù as stated in Forbes Magazine.Ibid. Since the team running the manufacturing facility were experts at producing and distributing the only commercially available cancer immunotherapy, Novartis purchased the process and the FDA-approved facility and hired 100 people who were making the prostate cancer immunotherapy. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on August 13, 2017, Kymriahwas the world‚Äôs first gene therapy to reach the market,Mukherjee, Sy. ‚ÄúThe Way We Treat Cancer Will Be Revolutionized As Gene Therapy Comes to the U.S‚Äù.

Other companies at the time were testing HIV therapies but none ‚Äúmoved more aggressively toward large-scale human trials‚Äù according to an article in The New York Times. For example, IRC applied for trial approval, and within 35 days, in November, 1987, sponsored the first HIV vaccine trial on humans ‚Äúunder a 1987 law that allows California researchers to test new AIDS therapies without seeking federal approval.‚Äù The subsequent Phase III trial, Study 806, was the first-ever large-scale trial to study an immune-based therapy. Enrolling 2,527 patients, it was a random, placebo-controlled trial to assess the HIV immune therapy in combination with antiviral drugs. The end point was slowing the progression to AIDS or death for patients having CD4 T-cells between 300 and 549 cells/mm. Bruce Walker commented on the outcome of Study 806. Walker was the director of the Harvard Medical School division of AIDS at Massachusetts General Hospital, the largest teaching hospital for Harvard Medical School. He wrote, ‚ÄúThe study was stopped prematurely due to the decrease in AIDS-related illness resulting from the introduction of more effective antiviral drug combinations. In addition, the study was not well controlled. Participants differed in terms of the antiviral medications during the course of that study, making interpretation of the findings problematic.‚Äù The problematic outcome adversely impacted funding, and so, after raising $350 million, the Company abandoned the project and liquidated its assets in 2008. Nonetheless, Walker recognized this as ‚Äúthe first clear demonstration of the potential reconstitution of the immune response in chronic HIV infection‚Ä¶This is the first proof of the principle that therapeutic vaccination can help people with chronic HIV infection mount a strong CD4 helper cell response.‚ÄùWalker, Bruce, AIDS Vaccine Induces HIV- specific Immune Response In Chronic Infection, Massachusetts General Hospital, published in Science News, May 26, 2003, https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/05/030526104653.htm  References  Category:Biotechnology companies of the United States Category:Immunotherapy ","title":"The Immune Response Corporation"},{"id":"57885683","text":"The Bishari dwarf gecko (Tropiocolotes bisharicus) is a species of gecko of the genus Tropiocolotes.

History The shrine under construction on 6 March 2016 The project to build a modern shrine for Baltic paganism was initiated and financed by Dagnis ƒåƒÅkurs, owner of the Liepkalni bakery chain. ƒåƒÅkurs explained that as he had grown older, he had become more interested in questions about the soul and mortality. As the Latvian people had supported his business over the years, he wanted to give something in return, and hoped to do so with a house for the national gods and Latvian folk culture. He attributed his interest in Latvian paganism to Valdis Celms, an artist, author and leading member of the Baltic neopagan organization Latvijas Dievturu sadraudze (LDS). The Lokstene Shrine was constructed on an island owned by ƒåƒÅkurs and is named after the nearby Lokstene castle mound. It is leased by LDS, which began to use the building in the autumn of 2016, before the entire complex was finished. The official opening took place on 6 May 2017. Since then, it has hosted regular devotional ceremonies and celebrations, such as family celebrations, celebrations of moral and spiritual values, and celebration of the Latvian national day. Anita Liepi≈Üa of the literary magazine JaunƒÅ Gaita argued in 2017 that the building deserves to receive state support just like Christian churches receive support for maintenance. Architecture and design The Lokstene Shrine is located on a small island in the Daugava river, behind the Liepkalni bakery and caf√© in Liepsalas, close to the town Pƒºavi≈Üas. The entire complex includes a shrine building, a ferry, an assembly and flag square, a monument to the ancestors, and a gate of the sun. The design was developed by LDS under the leadership of Celms.

Diokno in 1971, as a response to the suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus in the wake of the Plaza Miranda bombing. It became well known for the series of rallies which it organized from 1971-72, especially the most massive one on 21 September 1972, hours before the imposition of martial law by the Marcos dictatorship. The coalition was reconvened in 2005, and it continues to do advocacy work and lead the democratic movement in the Philippines today.  1971 establishment  With the Constitutional Convention occupying their attention from 1971 to 1973, statesmen and politicians opposed to the increasingly more-authoritarian administration of Ferdinand Marcos mostly focused their efforts on political efforts from within the halls of power. All this changed, however, with the Plaza Miranda Bombing at the Liberal Party Miting de Avance on August 21, 1971. Ferdinand Marcos blamed communists for the bombing, and used it as a reason to suspend the writ of habeas corpus and have the military pick up prominent activists, such as KM's Luzvimindo David and MDP's Gary Olivar. After the writ of habeas corpus was lifted, Diokno had concerns that Marcos could use this chance to declare martial law. Under the leadership of Jose W. Diokno, the Movement of Concerned Citizens for Civil Liberties (MCCCL) - \\"a broad alliance of civil libertarians, progressive Constitutional Convention delegates, students, professionals as well as workers\\" was formed to protest the controversial decision. As recounted by author and University of the Philippines Professor Petronilo Daroy: \\"The alliance had three basic demands: a) lift the writ of habeas corpus; b) release of political prisoners; and c) resist any plan by the Marcos government to declare martial law.\\"  September 21, 1972 rally  The MCCCL's rallies are remembered for their scale, with the biggest one held on September 21, 1972 - just two days before Marcos' announcement of Martial Law - which was attended by as many as 50,000 people at Plaza Miranda. With a specific set of demands, the MCCCL rallies also marked one of the first and most successful events at bringing together \\"diverse groups such as those from the ‚ÄòNat-Dem‚Äô groups and the ‚ÄòSoc-Dem‚Äô groups as well as various civic organizations.\\" During the rally, many protested against the infamous \\"Oplan Sagittarius\\", a secret plan to declare martial law. After the rally Marcos reacted with fear of deposition and finished signing Proclamation No. 1081 at 8:00 p.m., which would declare nationwide martial law. The same time next evening, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile was told to exit his car beside an electrical post near Wack-Wack village in Mandaluyong City, on the way to his private subdivision in Dasmari√±as Village. Another car approached beside the previous vehicle, and gunmen then exited the car and fired multiple bullets at Enrile's vehicle. Marcos would make a fraudulent claim that was quickly debunked by historians that due to these terrorist attacks planned by his opposition he would have to declare martial law. He would make the television announcement on September 23, 1972 at 7:15 p.m.  Martial law  Many of the activists who were active in the MCCCL, were arrested by the Marcos dictatorship when Martial Law was imposed. Diokno himself was one of the 400 individuals on Marcos' \\"priority list\\" who were arrested in the early morning hours of September 23, 1972 - before Marcos even announced Martial Law that evening. To make sure citizens forgot about the September 21 rally, he declared September 21 to be \\"National Thanksgiving Day\\", the start of his new era of dictatorship. The unintended effect was that many became perplexed as to the true date of the declaration of martial law, as the public announcement was actually on September 23, two days after he signed Proclamation No. 1081. Diokno would later create the Free Legal Assistance Group or FLAG, the first organization of human rights lawyers, to battle martial law and stop Marcos's nefarious plans.  2005 Return  While the coalition was effectively dissolved when martial law was implemented in late September 1972, it was reconvened in 2005 during the Gloria Arroyo Administration when multiple journalist deaths were reported in the first quarter of the year and talks of anti-terrorism bills emerged, which would label presidential critics as terrorists. The MCCCL has since continued to do advocacy work for democracy and civil rights in the Philippines.  See also  * Jose W.

She was prosecuted under the ‚Äúhomosexual propaganda law‚Äù in 2017.  Early life and education  Evdokia Romanova (Dunia) was born in Kuibishev (Samara since 1991), USSR. She studied at Samara State University (BA in Sociology) and the University of Texas at El Paso (MA in Sociology). She works as a social worker and community activist.  Work and activism  Dunia's human rights activism focuses on people with disability rights, women's rights, refugee rights, sexual and reproductive health and rights. Dunia is a member of the LGBT-rights movement Avers, which provides legal and psychological assistance to the LGBT community and defends the rights of other LGBT groups. She also works with Youth Coalition for Sexual and Reproductive Rights (YCSRR) and the young feminists‚Äô foundation. Dunia has used theatre as a tool for social change, based on the Theatre of the Oppressed methodology of popular community-based education. Evdokia spoke at the Commission on the Status of Women in March 2018.  Prosecution  On 26 July 2017 Evdokia was called into her local police station on the pretext of having to act as a witness in a case she had never heard of. On arrival, she was instead informed that she was facing legal proceedings for ‚Äúhomosexual propaganda‚Äù but denied disclosure of any details of the case against her. Dunia and her lawyer were refused any details about her case for weeks. They were granted access to her case file on 5 September 2017, only days before the trial. On 18 October 2017, Evdokia was prosecuted with the administrative offence of ‚Äúpropaganda of non- traditional sexual relationships among minors using the Internet‚Äù. This was on the basis of posts she shared on her private Facebook page in 2015 and 2016, including a Guardian story on Ireland‚Äôs same sex marriage referendum and a Buzzfeed article about an LGBTI exhibition in St Petersburg. She was fined 50,000 roubles (USD $870). Following her arrest, Dunia struggled with a loss of confidence and self-esteem as she shut down her social media accounts. She paid the fine, but is now appealing the decision.

Mission  The SSA‚Äôs aims are to add to and promote the scientific understanding of addiction and problems related to it, and to advocate the use of the evidence-base in policy and practice.  History  The SSA was originally named The Society for the Study and Cure of Inebriety and was founded in 1884 by Dr Norman Kerr who was the first president. It was originally restricted to qualified practitioners and was established in response to the 1879 Habitual Drunkards Act. The word \\"Cure\\" was dropped from the title in 1887, and it was renamed the Society for the Study of Addiction to Alcohol and other Drugs in 1946. The organisation lifted the restriction on membership in 1959. In 1884 the SSA started publishing the \\"British Journal of Inebriety\\", which became the \\"British Journal of Addiction\\" before changing to \\"Addiction\\".  Journals  The SSA supports the publication of two academic journals, Addiction and Addiction Biology. Addiction publishes peer-reviewed research reports on pharmacological and behavioural addictions, bringing together research conducted within many different disciplines. Its goal is to serve international and interdisciplinary scientific and clinical communication, to strengthen links between science and policy and to stimulate and enhance the quality of debate. Addiction Biology focuses on neuroscience contributions which aim at advancing the understanding of aspects on the action of drugs of abuse and addictive processes.  Funding and Prizes  The SSA‚Äôs academic funding schemes and prizes support addiction researchers throughout their careers. Project funding is given to support the dissemination of research findings or the convening of a group to review work in a particular area or geographic location to produce material for dissemination. The SSA funds professorships, academic fellowships, PhD studentships, Post-doctoral transitional development initiatives, bursaries and travelling scholarships. The Fred Yates prize is awarded annually to an early career researcher who has made a significant and specific contribution to the addictions field in recent years. Previous winners include: Dr Gemma Taylor, Dr Hamid Noori, Dr Kyla Thomas, Dr Andrew McAuley, Dr Leonie Brose, Dr Jamie Brown, Dr Frances Kay-Lambkin, Dr Jaime Delgadillo, Dr Jodie Trafton and Dr Simon Adamson. The Impact Prize is also awarded annually and recognises the contribution that the winner has made to influencing policy or practice in addiction. Previous winners include Dr Magdalena Harris and Dr Sarah Jackson.  Membership  Membership is open to UK and international applications from practitioners, researchers and policymakers with an appropriate academic or professional qualification or experience in the addiction field. The SSA offers a reduced student, and concessionary membership. Members receive the SSA journals free of charge.  Annual conference  The SSA‚Äôs conference has been running since 1985 and has been an annual event since 2005. The conference is for to members and non-members and typically runs across 2 days. Each year includes a society lecture from a leader in the field of addictions; this lecture has previously been given by Professor Colin Drummond, Dr Antoni Gual, Professor Louisa Degenhardt, Professor Wayne Hall, Dr Thomas McLellan, Professor Robert West, Dr Bruce Ritson, Dr Barbara McCrady and Professor Sally Casswell.

Early years and education Louise (or Louisa) Weber was born in Toledo, Ohio, in 1857. Her mother's father was the president of one of the Cantons of Switzerland. His daughter, Kathrina Zimmerman (July 5, 1832, Siblingen, Schaffhausen, Switzerland - November 29, 1916, Toledo), fell in love and eloped with Caspar Weber (May 30, 1826, Siblingen, Schaffhausen, Switzerland - 18 March 18, 1897, Toledo), a teacher in a Swiss university. The young couple came to the United States, finally fixing their home in Toledo. There, in a strange land, after a hand-to-hand struggle with poverty during those earlier years, Mrs. Weber died during childbirth, bringing Louise the youngest of her children, into the world. Louise's siblings included: Elizabeth, Charlotte, Jacob, Minnie, Emma, John, Helena, Flora, and Gustave. When but two weeks old, Louise was taken by her father's brother, George Weber, and his wife, to be brought up by them as their own child. She attended the public schools and showed great aptness as a scholar, but at the age of fifteen, her school career was brought to a close by her betrothal and marriage. Career She married Carl (or Charles) Markscheffel, a prosperous business man of large property on October 15, 1872. Markscheffel & Co. engaged in wholesale liquors, fancy groceries, and cheese. Four years later her son, Carlos, was born. She was widowed in August, 1892, after her husband suffered a long and painful illness. Markscheffel began her regular literary work around 1888, when continued misfortunes had caused the husband's loss of fortune and bereft him of health and ambition. She became the literary and society editor of the Toledo Sunday Journal. Her work immediately became a marked feature of the publication. She created social columns that were absolutely unique, and delightful even to those who cared nothing for the news details. Her leaders sparkled with bright comments upon things in general, with witty sayings, mingled with pathetic incidents, while underneath ran a current of kindly thought. She was an excellent dramatic, musical and literary critic. She occasionally found time to contribute short stories and sketches to eastern papers.

He noted that it was \\"originally written as a burlesque upon the sensation of the time,\\" where he \\"exaggerated the sensational parts of it, and it was something which I expected would be horrifying,\\" yet \\"I found it was taken in perfect earnest.\\" Thus, he altered the play somewhat into \\"a not altogether impossible, though somewhat improbable piece.\\" He opined that the play \\"is not good enough to win the success it has achieved, and not bad enough to receive the animadversions of the hypercritical.\\"Matthews, Brander & Laurence Hutton (eds.) Actors and Actresses of Great Britain and the United States:/books?id=FusLAQAAMAAJ&pg;=PA288#v=onepage&q;&f;=false, pp. 288-89 (1886) Upon receiving criticism in Philadelphia, Brougham announced from the stage before a performance that he had written the play not to please critics, but the public who was demanding plays of this type, and that his aim was to make money. The New York Herald received the play positively in New York, though with no illusions: \\"According to the legitimate drama of the day this is a first rate plot, especially as it abounds in the latest sensations from beginning to end.\\" It also complimented the New York scenery of the play, and quoted a departing patron as stating \\"this thing ought to succeed and will succeed, for it is really the legitimate drama of 1868, with all the modern improvements--pretty waiter girls, negro minstrels and all.\\"(9 June 1868).

It meets on a portion of the historic Hollin Hall estate. It is a long-time \\"welcoming congregation,\\" which means it is open and affirming to all. The church has a long history of supporting LGBTQ rights and is an active social justice congregation. History Founded in 1955, MVUC is one of the five congregations originally founded in the 1950s as groups who listened to the services of Rev. A. Powell Davies from All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.) by telephone until they were able to call their own ministers. The congregation then bought the historic Hollin Hall property in 1958. The church used the existing guest house as their meeting house until 1985 when a newly constructed sanctuary on the church grounds opened. In 1961, the church housed members of the Congress of Racial Equality to train students as freedom riders in the South and the Board of Trustees was threatened with legal action by Fairfax County. Every November for the past 55 years (through 2017), the church hosts an annual holiday bazaars called the \\"Holiday Shop,\\" which features dozens of artisans, crafters, and local sellers. The Every Thursday Group quilts and auctions off a new quilt each year, as well as preparing food to sell. Members of the church, including Joan Darrah, lead a successful drive in 2007 to have the UUA issue an Action of Immediate Witness to repeal the United States Policy of \\"Don't ask, don't tell.\\"  Grounds  The grounds currently include the meeting house (expanded in 2010s), Hollin Hall itself, a greenhouse, a restored windmill, Carriage House, historic turkey sheds, three-tiered boxwood gardens, formal garden, memorial walks, and open spaces and trees. Several other buildings were part of the church's purchase of its portion of the state, but they've been sold or demolished. The windmill, which long been a part of the identity of the church, was partly dismantled in 1962 but a campaign in the 1990s led to it being restored in 2000. Long-time caretaker John Stevens, who began in 1926, stayed on when the church bought the property until his retirement in the 1993 and continued to love and maintain the grounds; both Stevens and a minister at the time, Rev. David E. Bumbaugh, spoke out in defense of an old tree just off the property in 1978. In 2007, the church and its property made the local news when The Washington Post featured a story of how a large Paulownia tree was apparently stolen from its grounds, probably on the belief it would be valuable. The church is near the historic Hollin Hills housing development and the church's grounds were part of the inspiration for the production designers of Mad Men (Dan Bishop) and Sex and the City (Jeremy Conway), where they played sports on the grounds and Conway attended the Shakespeare productions hosted by the church on their grounds.  Fort Hunt Preschool  Fort Hunt Preschool (originally named Fort Hunt Co-Operative Preschool) began as part of the church in 1962 by a group of parents as a cooperative preschool and continues to lease the Carriage House building since becoming its own organization in 2003.

History  The paper was formed out of two competing 19th century papers: the Demopolis Express (1893) and the Demopolis Dispatch (1897). In 1905, both papers were bought by a group of investors, and by 1910 E. S. Cornish had begun editing the paper and was part-owner. With a brief hiatus early in his career (during which the paper was edited by C. A. VerBeck), Cornish would be associated with the paper until his death in 1936. Under his leadership, the paper went to linotype printing 1919, at a cost of three thousand dollars. In 1930, he asked his son-in-law, Ben George, to move back to Marengo County to eventually run the times. At the time, George had no newspaper experience, and he began work there as a linotype editor The paper was sold to George and his wife Elizabeth in 1936.

This rebellion was led by Kalender √áelebi against the Ottoman reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, who was extending his influence in the region. Although Kalender √áelebi gained the initial support of local tribal chieftains he was outmanoeuvred by Suleiman. Ultimately, the Ottoman Empire defeated the rebels, and killed √áelebi. Beginnings Entitled as a ≈ûah, Kalender √áelebi was an Alevi leader in the region Mara≈ü in Turkey. He was also a sheikh of the Bekta≈üi Tariqa. It is alleged that he was a descendant of Hacƒ± Bekta≈ü-ƒ± Veli. He had the support of the Safavids, Turkmen tribes who were influenced by the Safavi propaganda and were dissatisfied by economic decay and new reformations supported by Kalender √áelebi. The rebellion began with the Battle of Moh√°cs, with the support of the Turkmen tribes, √ái√ßekli, Ak√ßa Koyunlu, Masadlƒ±, Bozoklua, and splintered groups who remained after the Baba Z√ºnnun rebellion. With the support of Sunni Dulkadirli lords, the resistance grew in southeast Anatolia and to central Anatolia with the help of the sipahi's (Ottoman cavalry corps). According to different sources, around 30,000 men gathered around Kalender √áelebi. The news of the rebellion reached Kanuni Sultan S√ºleyman in Petrovaradin when he was returning from the Battle of Moh√°cs. Anatolian lords, including Behram Pa≈üa and Mahmud Pa≈üa, were sent to crush the rebellion. Before their arrival, Kalender √áelebi had already defeated Yakup Pa≈üa in Sivas. In Diyarbakir, Kalender √áelebi had to retreat but later defeated Behram Pa≈üa in Kara√ßayƒ±r. Additional lords from Aleppo and Karaman joined Behram Pa≈üa, and on 8 June 1527, in Tokat Cincife, they lost to √áelebi. During this battle, lords of Karaman, Al√¢iye, Amasya and Birecik lost their lives. Defeat After the growth of the rebellion, Kanuni appointed Sadrazam Pargalƒ± ƒ∞brahim Pa≈üa to crush the uprising with 3000 Janissaries and 2000 sipahi. When √áelebi realized he could not win, he considered fleeing to Iran, but ultimately chose Baghdad. Ibrahim gave many Turkmen tribes their rights and lands back, leading some Turkmen tribes to switch sides and join him. √áelebi had only 3000 to 4000 men left. Knowing this, Ibrahim attacked. Ottoman sources maintain that he died in battle, but Bekta»ôi tradition states that he was killed next to a mulberry tree in front of the tomb of his grandfather Bahm Sultan. Aftermath The Kalender Celebi rebellion was one of the largest rebellions propelled by religious motives. The rebellion was brought to an end with the death of its leaders. The end of the rebellion was followed by massacres and suppression of the Alevi-Bektashi people.

It was written by David Bridel, a past Dean of the USC School of Dramatic Arts. It was first performed in 2006 by the MFA Acting class of UCLA, of whom Bridel was a teacher. It was then staged professionally by The Los Angeles Theatre Ensemble in 2008.F. Kathleen Foley, Charlotte Stoudt, David C. Nichols, \\"Commedia troupe revived\\", Los Angeles Times (May 30, 2008).\\"Theater Reviews: Lady, A Chorus Line, I Gelosi\\", LA Weekly (May 26, 2008). It has since been produced by Helsinki West in Los Angeles, STAGERight in Seattle, and at the University of Alabama and the University of North Texas.  Summary  The play is very loosely based on the history of the troupe. The plot centers around Isabella Andreini's joining of the group in its early days, elevating them from poor street performers to massive success with her acting and poetry, and the revolutionary act of allowing a woman to perform onstage. Their attention earns them the patronage of the Duke of Mantua and their official adoption of the I Gelosi title. Throughout this, a romance buds between Isabella and Francesco. The play dramatizes the company's travels to France, where they perform a play satirizing the Pope that thrusts them into a scandal. They become involved in the Huguenot Rebellion on both sides, taken hostage by the Huguenots and labeled spies by the monarchy. They flee to Mantua only to be turned away for the controversy they have created. Isabella begins to go mad, and turmoil and conflict arise within the group. The play ends with Isabella dying, and the troupe being disbanded, their success lost and returning to poverty. The play is a fictitious account of the troupe, with the plot elaborating and dramatizing facts of the company's travels.  Historical Inaccuracies  * The play has Francesco Andreini forming I Gelosi, in reality it was Flaminio Scala who formed the troupe, with Andreini joining later. Scala is, in fact, omitted entirely from the play. * The troupe is shown embroiled in the Huguenot Rebellion, in reality they left France before even the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, with the true Huguenot Rebellion not occurring until 1620, after the group's disbandment. Though the group was captured by Huguenots at one point, there is no indication of violent resistance. * The troupe's disbandment is shown leaving the members in poverty and ruin; in reality the group was disbanded while still relatively successful, with the disbandment motivated more by the death of Isabella.

Description Procerodes littoralis is a small flatworm with a maximum length of and width of , but it is usually smaller than this. It has a fairly wide head with two distinctive marginal tentacles with a pair of eyes behind them. The neck region is slightly narrower and the body is plump and bottle-shaped. The dorsal surface is greyish or olive-brown and the internal organs are sometimes visible through the cuticle. The eyes are surrounded by pale patches which are separated by a slightly darker stripe. Distribution and habitat Procerodes littoralis is found in the temperate northwestern Atlantic Ocean, on the European coastline, and on the coast of North America from Newfoundland northwards. It is common round the coasts of Britain on the upper and middle shores where it is the most common marine flatworm. It is tolerant of wide fluctuations in salinity, and is often being plentiful in areas where freshwater streams flow across the beach; it conceals itself under boulders and stones, on shingle and sand. Ecology The chosen habitat of this species is streambeds on the upper shore. Here it is exposed for about eight hours in every tidal cycle to fresh water and for about four hours to salt water. It can survive in both these environments but is inactive at the two extremes of 0 psu and 44 psu. At high tide it tends to gather under large stones where it is protected from wave action while at low tide it tends to burrow down to the base of the gravel where there is probably some residual salinity. This is where it feeds on detritus and such small invertebrates as oligochaetes and marine isopods, including Jaera albifrons and Jaera nordmanni. Procerodes littoralis starts to breed when about long. It is a hermaphrodite and fertilisation is internal. Batches of about five eggs are laid in oval capsules about in diameter which are glued to the underside of stones. The eggs undergo direct development, hatching directly into miniature adults long.

journalist. A native of Detroit, at an early age, she wrote for the newspapers. She was \\"one of the more prolific women playwrights of the Victorian era\\". She had considerable success as a writer of verse and short stories, also as a dramatic and art critic. Her stories, written for New York City and Detroit papers, were quite extensively copied. One which appeared in the Detroit Free Fress enjoyed the rounds of different journals, and reached as far as New Zealand. Her verses appeared in Our Continent and the New York Sunday Mercury. Early years and education Alice Emma Ives was born in Detroit, Michigan, 1876, where she lived until September, 1890, when she removed with her mother to New York City, Ives' father dying when she was two years old. Her literary bent was early shown. Before she knew how to write in cursive, she printed the verses which she composed. When about seventeen years of age, she wrote her first story, which was promptly accepted by Frank Leslie. So severe was she in judging her work that, instead of being elated at her success, she was appalled at what seemed to her an unwarrantable presumption, and never sent another line to a publisher for ten years. Career She very early felt the necessity of earning her own living, and after a time that of two others. With her strong imaginative nature rebelling against the uncongenial task, she taught school till her health broke down under the strain. Then she began to send poems and stories to the press. They were extensively copied, but paid for poorly. Her first regular journalistic work was art criticism, and her articles attracted so much notice as to make for her a reputation. She then became a regular contributor to the Art Amateur. Compiling books, writing plays, magazine articles, dramatic criticisms, and, in short, all-around newspaper work, thereafter were her work. Her magazine article which attracted the most attention was \\"The Domestic Purse-Strings,\\" in the Forum, September, 1890. It was copied and commented on in column editorials, from London and New York to San Francisco. Ives, the playwright, is best known by The Village Postmaster and The Brooklyn Handicap. The latter was performed in 1894. Its theme is a sensational Brooklyn horse race. Ives stated:‚Äî\\"In order to write the play, I lived on the race-track for a couple of months, and I read all the sporting papers I could.\\" The Village Postmaster, 1896, describes a rural spot in New Hampshire, with rustic types. A country atmosphere pervades the play. Her first play, Don Roderic, was praised by Lawrence Barrett; Reward, a society drama, was presented in Detroit. Lorine, a Russian story, was played by Frederick Paulding in 1894; its production in Palmer's Theater, New York, was successful. Lavarre and A Flower of the Hills, are also her works. Old Miss Pod was written for Neil Burgess; and The Checkered Hat, was a one-act vaudeville play. Ives was a member of the \\"Twelfth Night\\" and other New York clubs. She died in 1930.

The suspects fired at the embassy from a distance of about 500 metres from Villa Von-Wei√ü-Stra√üe 8, located across the Rhine river in K√∂nigswinter. The incident was linked to the ongoing Gulf War. In a note left at the scene, the RAF said the attack was done to combat American imperialism and to get it out of Iraq. The attackers escaped their positions in a stolen Volkswagen Passat car and were never caught. The embassy received some bullet holes and broken windows, but no major damage was caused. The same G1 rifle was used by the RAF in the killing of Detlev Karsten Rohwedder afterwards. In October 2001, new DNA tests of a hair left in the passenger seat of the Passat revealed that Daniela Klette may have been one of the suspects. Klette is an RAF member who was already suspected in other attacks, such as the prison bombing in Weiterstadt in 1993. Klette remains at large and nobody else has ever been convicted for the attack.

She was the last abbess of Gernrode (r.1593-1614). After leaving the abbey, Sophie Elisabeth married George Rudolf of Liegnitz and was duchess of Liegnitz until her death in 1620. Family Sophie Elisabeth was a member of the House of Ascania. Her parents were John George I of Anhalt-Dessau and his first wife, Dorothea of Mansfeld-Arnstein (1561-1594), daughter of John Albert VI of Mansfeld-Arnstein. Sophie Elisabeth had four full siblings, and eleven half-siblings (from her father's second marriage to Dorothea of Simmern). These included John Casimir, Eleonore Dorothea, Sibylle Christine, George Aribert and Susanna Margarete. Abbess of Gernrode From the age of four, Sophie Elisabeth was abbess of Gernrode. The abbey had been in decline for some time before Sophie Elisabeth's abbacy. In particular, since the fifteenth century members of Sophie Elisabeth's dynasty, the House of Anhalt (descended from the House of Ascania) had successively tried to incorporate the abbey into their own domains. By the time Sophie Elisabeth became abbess, the abbey's possessions covered only about two square miles. Between 1610 and 1614, members of the House of Anhalt incorporated these last remaining possessions of Gernrode into their own domains. In 1614, Sophie Elisabeth left the abbey in order to marry. Her relatives, the princes of Anhalt, refused to appoint a new abbess and completed the incorporation of Gernrode into their territory.Schulze, Das Stift Gernrode, pp. 50f. Sophie Elisabeth was thus the last abbess of Gernrode. Marriage On 4 November 1614 Sophie Elisabeth married her cousin, George Rudolf of Liegnitz in Dessau. A book was written to record their magnificent wedding celebrations.Nick and Fl√∂gel: Die Hof und Volksnarren‚Äô‚Äô, p. 700. After marrying Sophie Elisabeth, George Rudolf converted from Lutheranism to Calvinism. As duchess of Liegnitz, Sophie Elisabeth was a literary and musical patron. She brought many volumes of French and Italian works were brought to the ducal library.Koldau, Frauen- Musik-Kultur‚Äô‚Äô, p. 265. The writer Martin Opitz wrote several poems about Sophie Elisabeth.Becker-Cantarino, Martin Opitz‚Äô‚Äô, p. 704. Sophie Elisabeth and George Rudolf had no children together. She died, aged thirty, in 1620.Ersch: Allgemeine Encyclop√§die‚Äô‚Äô, I.60, p. 102. In Dessau on 4 November 1614, George Rudolf married his first cousin Sophie Elisabeth (10 February 1589 - 9 February 1622), daughter of his maternal uncle John George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau. The marriage was childless.  Notes   Literatur  * O. von Heinemann, Geschichte der Abtei und Beschreibung der Stiftskirche zu Gernrode. (H. C. Huch, Quedlinburg 1877). * H.K.

It contains only one species, Timentes camerunensis, from Cameroon and possibly Tanzania. It is closely related to Thysbina. The genus was originally erected by Brian J. Selman for a single species, Timentes flavipes. According to Selman, the genus and species were originally named by Julius Weise at an unknown date (probably 1885‚Äì6), from material in the Jacoby collection found at the Natural History Museum, London. However, they were not described until 1965 by Selman himself, who preserved Weise's names for them. The holotype of T. flavipes has a label that gives its locality as \\"East Africa\\" without further indication, though it was thought by Selman to probably come from Tanganyika in Tanzania. In 2019, Stefano Zoia found that Timentes flavipes was a junior synonym of Thysbina camerunensis, a species described by Maurice Pic from Ed√©a, Cameroon in 1953, and moved the latter species to Timentes.

Despite exhibiting at the International Society, the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, and the Salon d'Automne in Paris, Wilenski was not successful as a painter.

All his books were aimed at the educated layman and showed his journalistic ability to convey his meaning using catchy phrases, periodisation, and easily understood language. For Wilenski, the purpose of studying the history of art was to enable contemporary art to be understood and in The Meaning of Modern Sculpture (1932), he rejected the idea that the Greeks had already achieved perfection in sculpture and discussed ancient sculpture by reference to its social function rather than its aesthetic value, which he questioned. His views were described by Peter Stewart of the University of Oxford as \\"remarkable\\" and \\"damn[ing] the art of the ancients by taking it out of the hands of the connoisseurs and dilettante\\". In 1933 he produced John Ruskin: An Introduction to Further Study of his Life and Work in which he attempted a psychological interpretation of Ruskin's life and work, arguing that he was a manic- depressive and mentally unwell from his early years, but acknowledging that he (Wilenski) had no qualifications in the field of mental health.\\"Reviewed Work: John Ruskin by R.

A descendant of the Scottish oatcake, the oatmeal raisin cookie has become one of the most popular cookies in the United States. When the cookies were becoming prominent in the United States in the early 1900s, they came to be known as a \\"health food\\" by reason of having increased fiber and vitamin contents from the oatmeal and raisins. Nonetheless, the nutritional value of an oatmeal raisin cookie is virtually equivalent to that of a chocolate chip cookie, with each having practically the same sugar, fat, calorie and fiber content.  History  In the early Middle Ages, traditional Scottish oatcakes had similar ingredients but were and are typically crispier than modern oatmeal cookies. The first recorded oatmeal cookie recipe was published in the United States by Fannie Merritt Farmer in her 1896 cookbook, the Boston Cooking-School Cook Book.

The game holds the record for the most combined points scored in an NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) regulation game with 137 total points, breaking the previous record (136 points, set in a 2007 game played between Navy and North Texas) by a single point. Before the game Syracuse With first-year head coach Dino Babers in command, the Syracuse Orange entered their final game of 2016 with a record of 4‚Äì7, 2‚Äì5 in ACC play. The Orange had experienced ups and downs throughout the 2016 season, with peaks including wins against seventeenth-ranked Virginia Tech and rival Boston College a week later. However, the lows of the season tended to outweigh the highs, as the Orange defense had allowed at least 20 points in all but two games, and the team had suffered blowout losses at the hands of nationally-ranked Louisville (No. 13), Clemson (No. 3), and Florida State (No. 17). The aforementioned loss to Florida State was Syracuse's seventh of the season, which put a bowl game out of reach coming into their final game. Pittsburgh Under second-year head coach Pat Narduzzi, Pittsburgh entered this game 7‚Äì4, 4‚Äì3 in ACC play, having clinched a bowl game berth the week prior. The Panthers entered their final regular-season with a few very impressive wins on their schedule, namely an early-season win against eventual Big Ten champions Penn State and a road win against eventual national champions Clemson. These two victories proved to be the only two against ranked opponents, however, as they lost at home to No. 25 Virginia Tech on October 27.

The female has an average length of about , and the males have an average length of about . Description M. longa females have an average length of about , with an average range between about and . Males are usually smaller, with an average length of around , and a range between about . It is bioluminescent, emitting light when mechanically, electrically, or chemically disturbed. This light is given through secretions containing luciferase from epidermal glands on the head and abdomen. Distribution M. longa is found in the sub-Arctic, Arctic, north Atlantic, and the Pacific, along the coast of the Americas and Asia. It has also been recorded in the Antarctic, in the Pacific Antarctic. Ecology Life history and reproduction At least in Balsfjorden, M. longa breeds from early to mid-May. It uses recently ingested food to complete and release the eggs, but it likely uses stored lipids in oogenesis. It has an average clutch size of about 33 eggs, not accounting for cannibalism. These eggs hatch with about 51% success after their 24 hour incubation period. Stage I through V copepodites then develop during the summer. Stages I through III are usually found below about during the day, and generally do not migrate. In Arctic waters, it is typically found closer to the surface. Also, in Balsfjorden, copepodite stages I through III were found to occur mostly in the top of the fjord. Copepodite stages IV through to the adult stage are migratory, moving from the deeper waters it inhabits during the day to shallower waters at night to feed. This is hypothesized to be because it could reduce the chance of predation, as predators relying on sight would find it harder to detect their prey in the dark. This is further supported by the fact that it spends more time at the surface during the winter, when the nights are longer. It is likely active during this winter season. It also uses stored lipids to develop its gonads when it is overwintering. Feeding M. longa is an omnivorous filter-feeder. It cannibalizes its eggs, with a 2008 study finding it removed 38% of its eggs when food was abundant, until chlorophyll a concentrations reached below per , when it started to remove an increasing amount of eggs, with a maximum of 85% of eggs removed. It has been suggested that it uses omnivory during the winter to supplement its metabolic needs and its gonad development.

It was built in 1971 by the U.S. Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA), which eventually became the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). More than 161 feet long and weighing at 1,450 tons, the Aurora Simulator was the first gamma radiation simulator of its size in the world at the time. It was also one of only four large machines in the United States that were built specifically to test complete nuclear weapons packages, with the other three being the Hermes I to III simulators at Sandia Base, New Mexico. Situated at the Harry Diamond Laboratories (which later became a part of the Army Research Laboratory) in Adelphi, Maryland, it was used to test complete weapons electronics packages from the warheads of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) to satellites. After more than 20 years of use during the Cold War, the Aurora Simulator was officially decommissioned and disassembled in 1996. In 1986, the Aurora facility set the world record for the largest amount of high-power microwave power generated from a virtual cathode oscillator. As a result, HDL was recognized by the American Defense Preparedness Association (ADPA) in 1987.  History  Following the use of the atomic bomb in World War II, studies on flash radiography found that field emission flash x-rays, which were previously used to analyze explosions, could simulate radiation from a nuclear bomb. Given this realization, the U.S. military began to prioritize the development of flash x-ray machines to test parts of missile packages during the 1960s. After the Soviet Union demonstrated the use of the world‚Äôs first anti-ballistic missiles (ABM) in 1964, DASA launched a series of projects in response that aimed to hasten the advancement of nuclear effects laboratories in the United States. The U.S. military was concerned that the introduction and subsequent nuclear explosion of Soviet AMBs into the airspace would increase the likelihood of the resulting radiation interfering with the electronics systems of inbound U.S. ICBMs. In order to thoroughly harden U.S. missiles, DASA initiated the construction of the Aurora Simulator as well as a full-threat level facility that engaged in gamma radiation testing and missile refinement in 1969. When selecting the site for the Aurora facility, DASA wanted the gamma radiation simulator to be situated at an existing military laboratory. After much deliberation between the Air Force Weapons Laboratory (AFWL) in New Mexico and the Army and Navy laboratories in the Washington, D.C. area, DASA chose the latter and granted the Harry Diamond Laboratory (HDL) the responsibility of operating the facility. In order to house the Aurora Simulator, HDL moved from its downtown Washington, D.C. site to an area of land in White Oak, Maryland, which would eventually become the now-present Adelphi. The cooperation between DASA and HDL on the Aurora project led to many HDL researchers becoming involved in the simulator‚Äôs development, including assistant to DASA Deputy Director for Science and Technology Peter Haas and former participant in the Manhattan Project Paul Caldwell, who later was placed in charge of the Aurora Simulator. In turn, Caldwell hired physicist Alexander Stewart from Ion Physics (IP) and HDL‚Äôs Robert Lamb and Dennis Whittaker, the four of whom (including Caldwell) made up the bulk of the research and development team for the Aurora project. The construction of the Aurora Simulator was completed on January 1971, costing about $16 million, and the first test was conducted on the Spartan ABM flight control set in April 1972. Throughout its entire run at HDL, which ended in 1995, the Aurora Simulator conducted 287 numbered tests, resulting in more than 9,100 test shots.  Operation  The Aurora Pulsed Radiation Simulator consisted of four 14 MV Marx generators, each of which contained four parallel 1.25 MJ units connected together to drive four parallel oil-dielectric Blumlein pulse- forming lines (PFLs). Each PFL was coupled with an E-beam diode. The Aurora Simulator emitted four short pulses of high energy bremsstrahlung radiation that overlapped to deliver a single 120 ns wide pulse of 20 to 50 krads (Si) into a 1m cube. It could also deliver 25 krads (Si) throughout a 1m diameter and 1m long cylindrical volume or 50 krads (Si) throughout a 25 cm sphere. What made the Aurora Simulator unique was its ability to provide an extremely high volumetric dose output. Due to this large irradiation volume, dose measurements ranged up to 200 locations within a single electronics system. However, in order to obtain the desired radiation levels, all four 8-MeV, 230-kA bremsstrahlung pulses had to overlay within 10 ns. This synchronization was made possible by the symmetrization of the four Blumleins. During active testing, the Aurora Simulator was capable of accommodating as many as 13 test shots in a single day. In comparison, nuclear weapons testing at the Nevada Test Site was limited to one test shot per three months. There were two main limitations to the operation of the Aurora Simulator. First, the long discharge time of the Blumeins often hindered the extraction of the bremsstrahlung pulses. Second, the high internal impedance of the Blumeins made them rather inefficient for energy transfer to low impedance loads.

He spent his early career with a multitude of non-league clubs, including: Chasetown, Coleshill Town, Cradley Town, Tipton Town, Tividale, Redditch United, Boldmere St. Michaels, Bedworth United and Stourbridge. He turned professional after being signed to Chester in October 2017 and then entered the English Football League with a move to Bury in July 2018. From Bury he was loaned out to Maidenhead United and Southport, before joining Port Vale after Bury were expelled from the Football League in August 2019. Having failed to break into the Vale first-team, he was loaned out to Stockport County in January 2020. He signed for Boston United in September 2020. Playing career Early career Archer spent time in the youth team at Chasetown, before scoring on his debut for the reserves in November 2011, and making his Northern Premier League Premier Division debut in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Marine on 3 March 2012. After eight appearances for the \\"Scholars\\" in the 2011‚Äì12 relegation season, Archer moved on to Coleshill Town, making his debut for the \\"Colemen\\" in a 2‚Äì0 victory over Alvechurch at Pack Meadow on 6 August 2013. He made a total of seven Midland Football Alliance appearances and one FA Cup qualification appearance, scoring his first goal in senior football with a penalty in a 4‚Äì0 win at Continental Star on 14 August. He went on to play for Cradley Town, Tipton Town and Tividale. He joined Redditch United on 4 June 2015. However he struggled to get games for the \\"Reds\\" as Luke Shearer and Daniel Dubidat were preferred up front by manager Liam McDonald, and he was loaned out to Boldmere St. Michaels. Archer moved on to Bedworth United in September 2015. Despite him scoring 16 goals from 34 league games, the \\"Greenbacks\\" were relegated out of the Southern League Premier Division at the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season. The Warwickshire-based club were placed in the Northern Premier League Division One South for the 2016‚Äì17 season. He joined Stourbridge on 6 November 2016. He worked at a bank during his time at Stourbridge. Stourbridge reached the Northern Premier League Premier Division play-offs and he scored in their play-off semi-final victory over Workington at the War Memorial Athletic Ground, though they were beaten by Spennymoor Town in the final. During his 11 months with the \\"Glassboys\\" he scored 22 goals in 51 appearances, and spent a week on trial at Walsall in summer 2017. On 24 October 2017, he turned professional after being signed to a two-year contract by National League side Chester. \\"Blues\\" manager Marcus Bignot said that he believed Archer could play in the Football League. Bury On 12 July 2018, Archer signed a two-year contract with League Two side Bury after being bought for an undisclosed fee (reported to be around ¬£20,000). \\"Shakers\\" manager Ryan Lowe said that Archer was \\"a wanted man\\" and praised sporting director Les Dykes and chairman Stewart Day for completing the deal. On 31 August, he joined National League side Maidenhead United on a two-month loan at York Road. He played eight games for Alan Devonshire's \\"Magpies\\". On 9 November, he joined National League North side Southport on a two-month loan deal at Haig Avenue. \\"Sandgrounders\\" manager Liam Watson went on to extend Archer's loan until the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season. He won the Liverpool Senior Cup with Southport, after they beat Prescot Cables on penalties after drawing the final 0‚Äì0. He was not paid for the last five months of his time at Gigg Lane and had to rely on 50% of his wages being paid by the Professional Footballers' Association. Port Vale Bury were expelled from the English Football League on 30 August 2019, and Archer signed a one-year deal with League Two club Port Vale the following day. He was signed by manager John Askey to provide competition for strikers Tom Pope, Richie Bennett and Mark Cullen. He made his debut for the \\"Valiants\\" on 3 September, coming on as a 60th-minute substitute for Tom Pope in an EFL Trophy tie with Shrewsbury Town at Vale Park; he went on to score the winning goal on 75 minutes as Vale came from behind to win 2‚Äì1. He dislocated his shoulder injury four days later, but rejected a shoulder operation in favour of physiotherapy as he wanted to avoid a lengthy spell on the sidelines recovering from surgery. On 17 January 2020, he joined National League play-off chasing side Stockport County on a one- month loan. Manager Jim Gannon said that he signed Archer to help arrest the \\"Hatters\\" dip in form, saying \\"I believe the new signings will add extra dimensions to us, add physical presence and the quality that has gone missing\\". However he was limited to just three appearances due to injury. He was released by Port Vale at the end of the 2019‚Äì20 season. Boston United On 4 September 2020, he signed with National League North club Boston United.

The film was recorded with Western Electric apparatus, which was an early sound-on-film system. This sound system was used in another Oswald short film entitled Hurdy Gurdy, which involves Oswald being substituted as a street performer's dancer after the original one was comically swallowed up by Oswald's chewing gum, or more specifically, bubblegum. That film was released in the same year as this one, albeit later. Copyrighted on July 26, 1929, and released on September 2 that same year, Race Riot was released by the film company Universal Pictures, so thus, is part of the Universal series of Oswald short films. Plot Oswald's horse is sleeping in a human bed. Oswald enters the room and wakes the horse with a scream, telling it the race is today. The horse, who does not want to participate in the race, feigns illness, with music from \\"Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning\\". Oswald attempts to give castor oil to the horse, but because this is a laxative the horse dives through the wall and no longer pretends to be ill. Oswald tries to weigh the horse with a scale, but he fails as the horse flattens it. Oswald whistles to a cigar-smoking, piano-playing dog to signal him to play a song. He plays while Oswald signals to the horse that he should do stretches. However, the poor execution of the stretches angers Oswald, who storms off. The horse goes up to the pianist and whispers that he should play something different. The horse dances to the new song; Oswald comes back and seeing the horse dancing he punches it in the gut, stopping it dancing. Oswald comments on the horse dancing rather than stretching. Oswald realises the race is starting when he hears applause. He mounts the horse and quickly explains what is going on. The race begins without them, but the crowd clap as they start the race. As they reach their first opponent, Oswald uses his ear to burst the hippo that a dog is using for racing. The dog runs in place of the hippo, who is now tiny, and Oswald jumps over them on the horse to reach third place. As they get to the second-place racer, an elephant and a mouse, Oswald uses a match to burn up the elephant ending its life. The mouse attempts to run the rest of the race, but Oswald and the horse jump over the mouse to become second in the race that theme became dark moving on. Oswald gets to his final opponent and tries to tie their horse's legs into a knot. They pass the other racer to become the front runner, but Oswald's horse tires out and the racer they just passed overtakes them. Angry, Oswald yells at his horse with his early wooden whistle voices and feeds it a piece of fence to get over boulders ahead, but the horse swallows one of them, turns into a boulder, and flattens the opponent ahead. Oswald goes into the lead and runs the rest of the race himself to victory. While Oswald is bowing and tipping his ears to the audience, his horse - still a boulder acting like a bouncing ball - flattens him, and tiny Oswalds and horses run around in different directions. 4 horses and 4 Oswalds in total (2 horses going left, and the other 2 going right. The 2 Oswalds go straight, and the other 2 went in the other way). Characters In this film, there are a variety of characters. One of them is Oswald, who trains his horse and ends up comically running a section of the race after his horse turns into a boulder and comically flattens a opponent near the end of the film. Another character is the horse, who originally does not want to participate in the race and attempts to fake being ill in an attempt to get out of the race. However, they both end up winning the race at the end of the film. There is also the opponents who all participate in the race. They are all defeated by Oswald in that race near the end of the film.  Reception  Race Riot was well received by the cinema magazines at that time. Variety said that the film was \\"Silly stuff, as usual\\", and also said that the film would \\"make for a bright filler spot\\". Whilst The Motion Picture News said that film had \\"some highly amusing and clever cartoon work\\", and also said that the film contained \\"plenty of fun\\" and would \\"please anybody, anywhere, should he be man, beast or exhibitor\\". And, The Film Daily said that the film contained Good Cartoonantics, and also said that the film is \\"excellent cartoon entertainment\\".

It is located southeast of Darrington, Washington, east of the Mountain Loop Highway, and northwest of Glacier Peak which is one of the Cascade stratovolcanoes. It is situated at the confluence of the White Chuck River and the Sauk River on land administered by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The mountain is named for the White Chuck River, which \\"chuck\\" in Chinook Jargon means \\"water\\".http://www.washington.edu/uwired/outreach/cspn/Website/Classroom%20Materials/Curriculum%20Packets/Treaties%20&%20Reservations/Documents/Chinook_Dictionary_Abridged.pdf The nearest higher neighbor is Mount Pugh, to the south-southeast. Climate White Chuck Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.White Chuck from Mt. Pugh (Mount Baker to left} Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. White Chuck seen from Mount Pugh The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is east-southeast of White Chuck, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Classified as a near-Earth asteroid and potentially hazardous object of the Apollo group, was discovered by amateur astronomer Claudine Rinner at the Ouka√Ømeden Observatory on 21 December 2017. On 21 June 2018, the pair of asteroids passed within 15.5 lunar distances or approximately from Earth. During the close encounter, was resolved in high detail by concurrent radar observations by the Arecibo and Green Bank observatories, along with individual observations by the Goldstone Solar System Radar. The discovery of 's binary nature was announced in a NASA press release in July 2018.  Discovery  was discovered on 21 December 2017, by French amateur astronomer Claudine Rinner at the Ouka√Ømeden Observatory in Marrakesh, Morocco. The discovery formed part of the Morocco Ouka√Ømeden Sky Survey (MOSS) directed by Zouhair Benkhaldoun at the Cadi Ayyad University. The MOSS survey was designed for searching and characterizing the orbits of small Solar System bodies such as near-Earth asteroids and comets. As the sixth near-Earth asteroid discovered by the MOSS survey, was found in images taken by the Ouka√Ømeden Observatory's 0.5-meter reflecting telescope, which was remotely operated by Rinner. At the time of discovery, was about away from Earth, located in the constellation of Gemini at an apparent magnitude of 19.8. imaged by the Ouka√Ømeden Observatory on 30 December 2018 The discovery of was subsequently reported to the Minor Planet Center's near- Earth object confirmation page (NEOCP), where a preliminary orbit was calculated from additional observations conducted at multiple observatories. Follow-up observations of spanned six days starting from its discovery, and the object was formally announced in a Minor Planet Electronic Circular issued by the Minor Planet Center on 27 December 2017. Precovery observations of were first identified and reported to the Minor Planet Center in February 2018. These observations were from the Mount Lemmon Survey, which had observed on 14 December 2017, seven days prior to its discovery by the Ouka√Ømeden Observatory. Earlier precovery observations by the Pan-STARRS1 survey on 12 December 2017 were later identified in May 2018, and are now known to be the earliest reported observations of .  Nomenclature  Upon discovery, the asteroid was given the temporary internal designation tltv005. After follow up observations confirming the object, it was then given the provisional designation by the Minor Planet Center on 27 December 2017. The provisional designation signifies the object's discovery date and year, with the second letter and numbers indicating that it is the 130th object discovered during the second half of December 2017. has not yet been issued a permanent minor planet number by the Minor Planet Center due to its short observation arc of 270 days, which is insufficient for an orbit to be accurately determined. is expected to receive a minor planet number once it has been observed for over at least four oppositions, which would take several years. Once it receives a minor planet number, it will be eligible for naming.  Orbit and classification  orbits the Sun at an average distance of approximately , taking 4.73 years to complete one orbit. The orbit of is slightly inclined to the ecliptic plane by 6.2 degrees, with its farthest apsis oriented below the ecliptic. has a highly elongated orbit with an orbital eccentricity of 0.71. Over the course of its orbit, approaches 0.82 AU from the Sun at perihelion and recedes 4.82 AU from the Sun at aphelion, beyond the outer extent of the asteroid belt. Animation of 's orbit during the 2018 close encounter with Earth, with the asteroid belt and orbits of the planets for scale At aphelion, approaches close to Jupiter's orbit, with a minimum orbital intersection distance (MOID) of 0.42 AU. At such close proximity to Jupiter's orbit, has likely been gravitationally perturbed by Jupiter, indicated by its Tisserand parameter of 2.877, which is considered to be characteristic of comets. Because of its comet-like Tisserand parameter and relatively large orbit for a near-Earth object, has been suspected to be an extinct Jupiter-family comet. As a near-Earth object, the orbit of crosses that of Earth's, which leads to occasional close approaches to the planet. It has a semi-major axis (orbital distance) greater than 1 AU and a perihelion distance within that of Earth's, therefore it is formally classified under the Apollo group of near-Earth asteroids. 's Earth MOID is approximately , or about 8 lunar distances. Given a small Earth MOID, is considered a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) by the Minor Planet Center, under the definition that PHAs have Earth MOIDs less than 0.05 AU and absolute magnitudes brighter than 22. Despite being considered potentially hazardous, there is no risk of impact by , as it will not make any close Earth encounters within 12 lunar distances or over the next 200 years. was removed from the JPL Sentry Risk Table on 6 January 2018, after extensive observations and refinements of its orbit ruled out future possibilities of Earth impacts.  2018 Earth approach  On 21 June 2018 at 20:53 UTC, made its closest approach to Earth from a distance of , or 15.52 lunar distances. During the encounter, approached Earth at a rate of and its apparent visual brightness peaked around magnitude 15, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. At closest approach, 's apparent motion in the sky was 0.51 degrees per hour and was in the constellation of Andromeda, with an apparent magnitude of 16.6 and an angular separation of 66 degrees from the Sun. After the close encounter with Earth, continued its approach to aphelion, passing by Mars from a nominal distance of on 30 June 2018. = Observations = Goldstone delay-Doppler images of during its close approach to Earth The June 2018 encounter with provided an opportunity for radar observatories to study the asteroid's characteristics in detail. On 17 June 2018, the first radar observations of were attempted by the monostatic Goldstone Solar System Radar (GSSR) in California, but failed to detect the asteroid due to uncertainties in the radar pointing position. was later successfully imaged and observed with the GSSR on 21 June 2018, revealing the asteroid's binary nature. Led by radar astronomer Marina Brozoviƒá, GSSR observations of spanned four days, lasting until 24 June 2018. During these observations, the GSSR's preliminary findings were alerted to astronomers at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico for further study. Arecibo radar observations of began on 23 June 2018. The binary system was observed using a bistatic radar system where the Arecibo Observatory transmitted a radar signal to the pair of asteroids while the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia received the signal reflected from the asteroids. Led by Arecibo radar astronomers Anne Virkki, Flaviane Venditti, Sean Marshal, along with Patrick Taylor at the Green Bank Observatory, bistatic radar observations resolved at a resolution of 7.5 meters per pixel. Radar observations of ended on 26 June 2018 after it had moved out of Arecibo's view. Concurrently, optical observations were also carried out by various observatories in order to compile a light curve of the binary system. Optical observations of continued after the June 2018 encounter and detected possible mutual events or eclipses occurring between the components of the binary system.  Future approaches  Over the course of its orbit in the next 200 years, will continue to pass by Earth, though it will not make any approaches as close as the June 2018 encounter. The next Earth encounter by will be on 15 April 2037, when it will pass by Earth from a nominal distance of approximately . In the next 100 years, will make three Earth encounters within 0.2 AU (approximately 80 lunar distances), which will occur in February 2051, July 2088, and May 2107. The expected nominal approach distances for these dates are 0.123 AU, 0.179 AU, and 0.145 AU, respectively.  Binary system  The secondary component of was discovered in Goldstone radar observations conducted by Marina Brozoviƒá on 21 June 2018. From the first Goldstone radar images, the two components appeared to be contact binary lobes as the components were viewed in front of each other. Additional radar observations by the Arecibo and Green Bank observatories resolved the system in high resolution, confirming that the two components were indeed separate objects. Under satellite naming conventions by the Minor Planet Center, the satellite would be provisionally designated .  Physical characteristics  Artist's rendering of the binary system, with the contrasting surface brightnesses and shapes of each component is an equal-mass binary asteroid consisting of two components approximately in diameter. Equal-mass binary systems are relatively rare among the population of binary near-Earth asteroids as they constitute less than 1% of radar-observed near-Earth asteroids larger than in diameter. is one of only four systems of that kind known; the other three are , 69230 Hermes, and . From their mutual orbit and measured diameters, both components are calculated to have low bulk densities less than , indicating a significant macroporosity of their internal structures. Given their measured diameters and absolute magnitudes, the optical albedos of their surfaces are calculated to be as dark as charcoal, reflecting less than 3% of incident light. Unlike other binary asteroid systems observed by radar, the components of appear to display a distinct difference in their shape, surface brightness and radar reflectivity. These differences imply that the two components may also have different densities, compositions, and surface roughnesses.  Orbit and rotation  Animation of Goldstone radar images of on 23 June 2018. The separation between the two components becomes more apparent as they move away from each other. The pair of asteroids orbit each other around a common center of mass (barycenter) between them. Their mutual orbital period is , with an orbital separation of or 4 times the component radii. It is uncertain whether both components rotate synchronously with their mutual orbital period, as there is evidence of non- principal-axis rotation (or rotational precession) and axial misalignment of both components. Light curve measurements of taken between June and August 2018 suggest an additional period due to non-principal-axis rotation or precession, while radar images suggest that the obliquities of the components are misaligned by a few degrees.

The first racially integrated orchestra in the United States, its history- making premiere took place at New York City's Carnegie Hall on May 6, 1965. Early years Playbill for Steinberg's recital as \\"Little Ben\\", age 11 Benjamin Steinberg was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on March 15, 1915, to Moses and Annie Steinberg. His parents were from Odessa (then part of Czarist Russia, now the Ukraine) and had fled to the United States following the anti- Jewish Odessa pogrom of 1905 and the failed Russian Revolution that year. Benjamin first performed violin on the concert stage as an 11-year old in 1927. Career in music Violinist Steinberg was a violinist in the first violin section of the NBC Symphony Orchestra, playing on their nationwide radio broadcasts in 1943 under the baton of conductor Arturo Toscanini. He was later first violinist with the Pittsburgh Symphony conducted by Fritz Reiner, with whom he also studied conducting. Other conductors under whom Steinberg performed were Otto Klemperer and Leopold Stokowski. Conductor and music director Steinberg began conducting in 1941 with the National Youth Administration (NYA) Symphony, having studied under Pierre Monteux. He conducted a performance of Darker America, written in 1924 by African-American composer William Grant Still. The performance was broadcast on WNYC (AM) radio in New York city on April 16, 1941. In the composer's program notes, Still wrote that the piece \\"is representative of the American Negro. His serious side is presented and is intended to suggest the triumph of a people over their sorrows through fervent prayer... the prayer of numbed, rather than anguished souls.\\" As early as 1940, Benjamin Steinberg began to work with black conductors Dean Dixon and Everett Lee to establish the first fully integrated professional symphony orchestra in the U.S. It would take another two decades to be achieved, however. =Symphony of the New World= Steinberg conducting the premiere concert of the Symphony of the New World orchestra at Carnegie Hall on May 6, 1965 As the civil rights movement of the 1960s gained momentum in the US, Steinberg founded a committee to create a symphony orchestra of accomplished musicians and conductors, irrespective of race. The mission statement of the Symphony of the New World was written two months before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was signed into law. Steinberg accepted the post of Music Director and obtained funding for the orchestra's first season. The debut concert of the first fully integrated orchestra in America was held at Carnegie Hall on May 6, 1965, two months before the Voting Rights Act of 1965 became law. Steinberg said of the effort, \\"We have a lot of talent in this city, and we have to create the opportunities to present it to the public\\". Sponsors included Samuel Barber, Leonard Bernstein, Ruby Dee, Langston Hughes, William Warfield, Aaron Copland, and Zero Mostel. As the orchestra developed, Marian Anderson and Leontyne Price joined the Board of Directors, and James DePriest became Principal Guest Conductor. Another prominent guest conductor was Everett Lee. The symphony's musicians were graduates of such respected music schools as Juilliard, Eastman School of Music, the Manhattan School of Music, and the New England Conservatory. Its performances were broadcast on the Voice of America and Armed Forces Radio to audiences worldwide. Ebony magazine pronounced it, \\"for both artistic and sociological reasons, a major development in the musical history of the United States\\". Following an August 1969, performance by the interracial Symphony, the Asbury Park Press (NJ) was effusive in its praise of Steinberg as the orchestra's \\"guiding light\\" in the belief that \\"discrimination has no place in the world of the symphony orchestra\\". His conducting was lauded by critic Charles Hill for its \\"impressive virtuosity\\". George Walker in 1968 While music director of the Symphony of the New World, Steinberg collaborated with Pulitzer Prize-winning composer George Walker in the premiere of Walker's Address for Orchestra, performed by the Symphony of the New World in 1968. In 1970, Steinberg conducted the Symphony of the New World at the Lincoln Center, New York City, in a performance of I Have a Dream, a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. Pulitzer Prize-winning music critic Donal Henahan said of the one- third black Symphony of the New World in 1970, \\"it regularly demonstrates the validity of its position in the largely lily‚Äêwhite symphonic world\\". Steinberg continued as music director of the Symphony of the New World until October 1971, when he resigned after an acrimonious policy dispute with the orchestra's board. At the time of his resignation, the group had 80 musicians. The papers of the Symphony of the New World reside at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. =At the ballet= Benjamin Steinberg and Alicia Alonso, with the Cuban National Ballet Between 1945-1947, Steinberg was the Assistant Conductor of the American Ballet Theatre. On November 26, 1947, he conducted the premiere of Theme and Variations, choreographed by George Balanchine for prima ballerina assoluta Alicia Alonso and Igor Youskevitch. Steinberg also did a South American tour with Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo with Alonso and Youskevitch in the late 1940s, as well as with Melissa Hayden and Barbara Fallis, both of whom joined Alonso's ballet company in Cuba in 1959. In 1959, Steinberg became the first Music Director and conductor of the Cuban National Ballet, the ballet company managed by Alonso, renamed when Fidel Castro came to power that year. Steinberg remained in that post until 1963, when he returned to the United States following a tour of the Soviet Union as conductor of the Cuban National Ballet Symphony Orchestra. =On Broadway= Steinberg conducted many well-known Broadway musicals, including Leonard Bernstein‚Äôs production of Peter Pan (1950), starring Jean Arthur and Boris Karloff.Imperial Theatre flyer, April 24, 1950. Others include The Golden Apple (1954), The Music Man (1957‚Äì1958), and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Appearance before House Un-American Activities Committee On June 19, 1958, Steinberg testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee, having been subpoenaed by the Committee as part of its wide-ranging probe of suspected Communist infiltration into the ranks of professional musicians. He declined to answer questions about certain musicians being investigated for Communist affiliation. Although he did not invoke the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination in his own behalf, Steinberg said that to provide such information about others was an infringement of his right to freedom of association and freedom of speech: In response to further questioning by Richard Arens, permanent secretary to the Committee from 1957‚Äì1960, Steinberg said, \\"It is now 11 years since the first investigation of cultural artists, and this is the fourth consecutive year in New York City. I consider this an illegal harassment of members of the entertainment industry\\". He continued: Personal life and death Steinberg met his future wife, Pearl (born Sondak, 1918‚Äì1994), while they were both studying music at Curtis Institute. In later years, they made their home in Manhattan. Steinberg died on January 29, 1974, of pancreatic cancer and is survived by a daughter, Barbara.

The building was granted the status of regional significance on the 28th of December 2001 (the Sverdlovsk oblast Government Decree No. 859). The object number of cultural heritage of regional significance is 661720976380005.  History  The construction of the Kamensk manor has been dated at 1870. The owner of the mansion was one of the descendants of Peter Zyryanov. Zyryanov was descended from a trading dynasty, whose name was famous in the Ural region. The earliest mention of the name dates back to the 16th century. Peter Zyryanov held the post of burgomaster of the Yekaterinburg City Hall in 1765‚Äì1770. In 1767, he was elected as the head of the city. Most of the family was engaged in ore mining and commercial activities. Three buildings survived on the land until contemporary times: a residential house, a shop and a storage room.  Architecture  All buildings are constructed with the elements of eclecticism style. The manor house is integrated into in the line development of the block. It has a rectangular form of the area extended in its depth. The residential building and shop form the front western and eastern borders respectively. The southern main facades of the residential house and the shop face Lenin Street (former Bolshaya Moskovskaya Street). The buildings are separated by wide gates to the courtyard. The two-storey rectangular brick house is set on a quarried stone foundation stretching from north to south. The walls are made of solid bricks. The veneer is done with circle and front bricks. The southern facade has three window axes and completed with a stepped friso, decorated with an arcaded frieze with a principal cornice and a barrier wall. The composition of the facade is symmetrical. The corners of the facade are presented as paired classic half-columns. The window surrounds are also decorated with semicolumns and crests. The main entrance is on the side of the eastern facade. The roof is four-pitched, but is not visible from the street, as it is obscured by an attic structure of complex shape. An external gutter system allowed rain and melted snow to drain away from the roof. The decorative elements of the other facades remained. The interior features sloped surfaces and ceiling rosettes. The one-storey shop is brick with a rectangular shape. ‚ÜêThe main facade has a symmetrical composition, in keeping with the main entrance. Located in the center, are a high stone porch and two side windows. The architectural and decorative elements of a typical residential house still remain.

He worked in the fields of painting and sound design in the past, and has released albums like Airport Music for Black Folk (2016) and Paradiso (2017) which explore themes of intercontinental security, post-apocalyptic narratives and afro-pessimism.  Early life and education  Amobi was born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama in 1984 and grew up in Virginia. Amobi's parents emigrated from Nigeria, and he frequently traveled to the country as a child to visit extended family. Concerned about assimilation into American life, Amobi's parents did not teach their children to speak their native Igbo. Amobi experienced alienation growing up in America and said \\"I can't speak Igbo so I never fully felt Nigerian or black American.\\" However, Amobi has also spoken of the importance and closeness of the Nigerian-American community in Virginia to his family. He has also recalled his travels to Nigeria as a significant early artistic influence. As a child, Amobi pursued art and learned to make music through software like eJay, the first-generation Playstation game MTV Music Generator, and Apple Inc.'s GarageBand. In high school, Amobi made hip hop music with his brother, who is now a rapper under the name Chichi the Eternal. He favored music with an immersive, world-building quality, naming video game music and musicians like Nas, Wu-Tang Clan, Bj√∂rk, and Radiohead as early influences. Amobi attended the public John Tyler Community College with a plan to transfer to undergraduate art school, obtain a doctorate, and teach painting at the community-college level. He transferred to Virginia Commonwealth University in 2006, graduating cum laude in 2009 with a BFA. Amobi is currently pursuing an MFA in graphic design at VCU.  Career   Diamond Black Hearted Boy (2009‚Äì2014)  While at art school, Amobi began releasing music under the alias Diamond Black Hearted Boy. His early music was self-released through Myspace. Amobi was quoted in a 2012 New York Times article on seapunk, an early-2010s subculture and microgenre that prized aquatic aesthetics: As Diamond Black Hearted Boy, Amobi became part of an underground scene of musicians using electronic production techniques to create avant-garde, sample-based sound collage. \\"Nigerian Hair,\\" a Diamond Black Hearted Boy track, appeared on Blasting Voices, a 2012 various-artists compilation featuring E+E (an alias of Elysia Crampton), James Ferraro, and Ryan Trecartin. In 2013, Diamond Black Hearted Boy released Father, Protect Me., a full-length cassette compiling several of the project's tracks. Praising the tape for its narrative cohesion, Adam Harper wrote that Amobi's voice is \\"on the outer reaches of hip hop culture and its means of self-expression. If Kanye is a 'God,' DBHB is a fallen god languishing in some weird purgatory, and his collected work is a Yeezus for even greater degrees of alienation.\\" Harper compared the tape's music to a subverted form of cloud rap, and remarked that it \\"mixes together the sweetness and violence of the modern soundscape (music and non-music) in ways that play on the mind and are often frankly distressing.\\" How The West Was Won, Wanted: Dead or Alive, Amobi's final long work as Diamond Black Hearted Boy, came out in 2014. Harper said this final release \\"flicks through the wreckage of the twentieth-century Americana like it was TV channels on a concave wood-paneled screen, jerry- building a mock-epic (anti-)hero's tale along the way.\\"  NON Worldwide and Airport Music For Black Folk (2015‚Äì2016)  By 2015, Amobi stopped using the Diamond Black Hearted Boy moniker for his new music, instead releasing work under his own name. Amobi told OkayAfrica he realized he had used the name as a \\"mask,\\" and \\"I didn't want to hide behind a mask and that I wanted to claim ownership of what I was making, to be able to face someone as me without an alter ego. In the same way that Wangechi Mutu or Richard Serra or Philip Glass create, I want my work to be an extension of me.\\" An early Amobi project under his own name was a noise-inspired remix of Michael Jackson's \\"They Don't Care About Us\\". He released a collaborative mixtape with Houston-based producer Rabit, The Great Game: Freedom From Mental Poisoning (The Purification of The Furies). That same year, Amobi‚Äîalong with the musicians Nkisi, from London, and ANGEL-HO, from Cape Town‚Äîco-founded NON Records (also called NON Worldwide). NON is an independent record label dedicated to artists who are African or of the African diaspora, with an artistic and political vision articulated in a manifesto written by Amobi, \\"NON SUPPORTS ITS CITIZENS OF THE UNITED RESISTANCE\\". In 2016, Amobi released the EP Airport Music For Black Folk. The title alludes to Brian Eno's landmark 1978 ambient album Ambient 1: Music for Airports. According to Matthew Trammell at The New Yorker, Amobi's EP offered \\"a more explicit take on air travel\\" than Eno's Music for Airports, with \\"buzzy synths swell into prominence like a takeoff, asymmetrical percussion mimics the metallic dance of landing gear unfolding, and talk-box samples evoke the chorus of voices, automated and analog, that echo through terminal halls.\\" Joe Muggs of The Wire called the EP \\"a sonic illustration of the tensions felt by non-white travellers in today's surveillance society.\\" Later that year, NON held a performance at the New Museum during Red Bull Music Academy Festival New York. Amobi contributed to two of his friends' albums in 2016: Elysia Crampton Presents: Demon City by Elysia Crampton and $uccessor, the debut album of the Sacramento, California-based producer Fred Warmsley (aka Dedekind Cut).  Paradiso (2017‚Äìpresent)  Amobi made his solo vinyl debut with minor matter, a soundtrack accompaniment to choreographer Ligia Lewis's piece of the same name. He also announced his debut album, Paradiso, described as \\"a musical epic set in a distorted Americana populated by a cast of sirens, demons, angels, imps, priests, hierophants, monsters and peasants.\\" Nina Power praised the album in The Wire as \\"an extraordinary record: utterly grandiose, pulsing and punishing.\\" Comparing the album's soundscape to the works of Hieronymus Bosch and Dante Alighieri, Power wrote \\"[m]odernity is Hell, Paradiso tells us, but the only way to understand this is to embrace it fully, to stare into the void, to get on all the fairground rides, even though you already feel sick and all the colours are wrong.\\" The Wire named Paradiso the release of the year in its annual critics' poll. Rolling Stone named the album the year's third-best avant-garde release.

The Reaper absorbed the competing Geneva Journal in 1902. By 1906, Johnson had moved purely to the business side of the paper, bringing on M. M. Brannen as head of editorial. Horace J. Wilkinson took over the paper from his father, Horace G. Wilkinson. Horace J. printed the paper from 1928 until his sudden death in 1945, at the age of 48. Wilkinson made a note in his final printing of the paper, \\"Unless I feel stronger very quick, I won't attempt to issue a paper next week. I need a week's rest.\\" He died 10 days later. The paper was purchased by Howard, Clarence, and Alton Scott but did not publish another edition until February 1946, months after Wilkinson died.

His main concern was the creation of a non-denominational school, in which the language of instruction would be English. However, as Griffith was a Protestant, it was impossible to convince the Catholic church that he was not biased. In 1890, Griffith wrote to Sir Daniel Morris to suggest that an experienced botanist come to the Seychelles to run an experimental botanical garden, if finances allowed it.

Perry built and operated a number of textile mills in late 19th century Philadelphia and Germantown.  Biography  Perry was born in England in the mid 1840s. In 1855 he immigrated to the United States, where he worked for in a workshop that produced stockings. With help from his nephew (who also immigrated to the United States), Perry founded his own stocking company in 1870. However, the business failed due to increasingly cost effective silk stockings outselling cotton and wool stockings. In 1884 Perry returned to the textile business with the opening of a factory specially designed to produce elastic cords and surgical tubing. Specifically, the mills Perry built were designed to run on gas power, as opposed to older and less efficient hydro or steam power. This business met with success, and Perry's company became the largest single producer of surgical tubing in turn of the century Philadelphia, supplying a number of hospitals and clinics. This success in turn allowed Perry, his son Fergus, and his nephew (whom he named as partners in his company) to open five mills in Philadelphia and Germantown, producing tubing, electrical wiring, and thread.Miers, Busch. 1912.

The object number of cultural heritage of regional significance is 661721097870005. Description The owner of the manor house was the Kamensk Ironworksmaster. The complex includes a residential house (117 Lenin Street), a coachman‚Äôs house (8/1 Pionerskaya Street), a bathhouse and a number of household outbuildings (119 Lenin Street). The building represents a good sample of a manor house for the 1870-1880s period. It has a typical asymmetric angular position on the plot of land. The building on 119 Lenin Street has the historical significance also as a headquarters of the Red Guards in 1917. The construction of the manor house has a rectangular shape. The main two-storey building is made of stone and also has a rectangular shape. It forms the northeast corner of the plot of land. The main northern facade faces the Lenin Street (former Bolshaya Moskovskaya Street). On the central axis of the facade is a balcony and an attic. Inside the courtyard there is a covered terrace at the second floor. In the original plan there should have been the main entrance to the house. But later it was transferred to the side of the northern facade. The southern facade is a bit higher because of the high barrier wall. The elements of eclecticism and classicism can be found in the decoration of the building.. Nowadays the Kamensk diocesan administration of the Russian Orthodox Church functions in the building. The household outbuilding on the territory of the manor house is hardly reconstructed and as a result lost its original appearance. The original construction of the roof and the covered gallery didn't survive to this day. Later additional window openings were installed on the first and the second tier. In the original version, the door and window openings of the first tier were made with arched crosspieces without extra decor. On the second floors of the western and eastern facades there are small round window openings. The side of the second floor of the eastern facade, in contrast to the smooth western, has a plastic working surface of the wall: a round window frames a flat clypeus, the window itself is inscribed in a wide corbel arch, and the corners of the wall are flanked by flat blades.

History  Smith Brothers Farms was established in 1920 by Benjamin Smith who had a couple of Holstein cows that he milked by hand. The dairy now delivers to more than 40,000 homes around the Puget Sound region, including Seattle, Olympia, and Everett. In 2001, their herd eventually outgrew the pastures in Kent and Snohomish and were moved to Grant County in Eastern Washington. Due to federal regulations in 2006, Smith Brothers Farms sold their cows and farm in Royal City. In August 2013, the dairy moved from their original location of 93 years on West Valley Highway to their current headquarters and milk-processing facility in Kent, Washington. The land was sold to Carpinito Brothers where it has since remained a farm. Since selling the herd, the milk is sourced from co-ops around Washington state, which is then pasteurized, homogenized, and packed at their plant in Kent. Their 50,000 square foot dairy facility includes equipment that can produce up to 60,000 gallons of milk a day. Before it was a dairy production facility, it was a Heinz frozen soup factory.

The building was granted the status of regional significance on December 31, 1987 (decision ‚Ññ 535 by the executive committee of Sverdlovsk oblast Council of People's Deputies). The object number of cultural heritage of regional significance is 661710794150005.  History  The hospital building of Kamensk Ironworks was not the first medical institution of the town. Earlier there were hospital wards for workers, but they were dotted around the town and were not well- coordinated. Before the beginning of the construction there was a realigning of street network. A modern view of Krasnykh Orlov Street (former Upper Novaya) was being formed. It was decided to build the hospital close to pinewood because of health requirements and logistics. The hospital was located straight to road from Razgulyaevsky mine to the Kamensk Ironworks. The order for construction was from the Kamensk Ironworks. The author of the project was Mikhail Pavlovich Malakhov, a Urals architector. The project was prepared in 1817. The works began in 1826. The provincial —Ålassicism building was a one-story stone building with straight lines and minimum elements of decor in the original plan. The composition was symmetrical. Later, in 1847-1849, the second floor was reconstructed and built up. It increased the space for more hospital beds. The hospital building was electrified in 1906. Nowadays the house is residential.  Architecture  The building is L-shaped complicated by a wooden extension at the southern facade, wind porches and stairs inside the courtyard. The main western facade faces Krasnykh Orlov Street. Its composition is symmetrical. The central part is distinguished by a protruding rizalit completed by a triangular front with a stepped parapet. Large-sized window openings are grouped in pairs. The cornice with a simple profile is continued along the entire belt of the building. On the other facades the original decor was lost. The building with a corridor-type arrangement is based on quarried stone foundation. The original inner decor was lost. The walls are made of solid bricks, plastered and painted. The floors are wooden, and the roof is pitched slate on wooden rafters.

The film follows a group of women from a retirement community who decide to start a cheerleading squad. It was theatrically released in North America on May 10, 2019, by STX Entertainment. Plot Martha, a woman dying of cancer, decides to forego further treatment, and relocates from her apartment in New York to a retirement community called Sun Springs in Georgia. When Martha arrives at Sun Springs, she meets community supervisor Vicki, who gives Martha a tour of the community, where she explains that every resident must belong to one of the community‚Äôs clubs. Martha moves into her new house and promptly meets her next door neighbor Sheryl. Later at night, Martha is unable to sleep due to loud noise coming from Sheryl's house, forcing her to call the community‚Äôs security chief Carl to stop the noise. But Sheryl and her party sneak into Martha's house to evade Carl, where she convinces a reluctant Martha to allow them to hide there. From that night on, Sheryl becomes interested in being Martha's friend and invites her to various activities, but Martha resists. Martha watches a television program about fireworks being used for funerals, and makes plans to use fireworks for her own funeral. A few days later, she accepts Sheryl as a friend, and while getting to know each other, Sheryl learns that Martha was a cheerleader, where she had to quit before her first game to care for her ailing mother. Sheryl says that Martha should try to be a cheerleader again. After thinking about it, Martha goes to see Sheryl at a high school where she works as a substitute teacher and convinces Sheryl to help her start up a cheerleading club in Sun Springs. After convincing Vicki to allow them to start the club and to recruit the minimum requirement of eight members, Martha and Sheryl hold tryouts. Six women join: Olive, Alice, Ruby, Evelyn, Phyllis and Helen. Martha hires Sheryl's teenage grandson Ben to be their DJ. As the group commences practicing, it quickly becomes difficult for them due to their age and physical conditions. When Vicki tells them they have to find a new place to practice, Sheryl reacts by getting them a spot at a pep-rally at the high school. In the locker room before the rally, they get teased by a group of younger cheerleaders, particularly Chloe, one of Sheryl's students. During the pep-rally, Martha's group performs okay until Helen hurts her ankle. When Helen is taken to the hospital, they discover from Ben that a video of them at the pep-rally has gone viral. In addition with Helen's overbearing son Tom threatening the group with a lawsuit due to her injury, Vicki and other members of the community vote unanimously to disband the club. With the group going back to their routine lives, Martha invites Sheryl to her house for a drink. When Sheryl watches the video of them, she hears a girl's voice and recognizes it as Chloe, leading her and Martha to blame Chloe for posting the video. They go to Chloe's house and berate her, but Chloe, who has become sympathetic for them, starts crying because she didn't know that her friends would post the video. When Chloe apologizes, Martha and Sheryl forgive her and tell her that they're reassembling the cheerleading squad and need Chloe's help. Chloe agrees to become their choreographer. Back at Sun Springs, Martha inspires her teammates to come back together so they can prove everybody wrong and show that they can be a team if they work together. With Chloe coaching them, the group improves greatly as they prepare for an upcoming cheerleading competition. Meanwhile, Martha's cancer, which she has kept secret from the group, has progressed. After leaving a group party, she collapses while walking home. In the hospital, she tells Sheryl that she's not going to the competition and is scared about dying. Sheryl urges Martha to continue her cheerleading despite her suffering. The next day, Martha and the group rescue Helen from Tom by springing her from her bedroom and escapes from a pursuing Vicki and a sympathetic Chief Carl as they make their way to the competition. Many men from the community, including Chief Carl, gladly attend the competition. The group performs successfully and wins the audience and the other cheerleading teams over. The next scene shows a firework going off, indicating that Martha has died and had her funeral. A year later, the group has added new members to their squad. They get ready to perform in another cheerleading competition, both as a charity benefit for cancer and in memory of Martha. During the end credits, video clips show other people doing the same kind of dancing that Martha and the group have done.

The object number of cultural heritage of regional significance is 661710974840005.  History  The church was raised near the town cemetery in the historical part of Kamensk especially for the funeral service. Earlier funeral rites were organised in the Holy Trinity Cathedral. The construction of the church began in the 1850s. It was completed in 1883. The church was consecrated on the 1st of July 1885 by Nathanael, bishop of Yekaterinburg and Irbit. The bell tower was built in 1905. In 1907 the parish was organized. The church stopped doing funeral rites in 1918. Divine services continued until 1934, when the last priest, Father John Zykov, was arrested. In the 1940s-1950s the building was used as a place of confinement for displaced persons, later as warehouses. The cemetery was demolished. In 1991 the church building was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church. During the Soviet era the church building became almost destroyed and the domes were lost. John Agafonov became the new arch-priest. The domes and the main bell tower were restored in 1992. In 1994 the inner mural decoration was made. The parish school for children and adults has been functioning since 1996. On the 26th of December 2000 Archbishop Vikentius consecrated the new throne and the entire church in the name of the Intercession of the Most Holy Mother of God. The construction of the church building and a library was completed on the territory in 2009. A monument in honor of the 200th anniversary of the Victory in the Patriotic War of 1812 was installed in 2012.  Architecture  The single-altar five-domed church is made of stone with the tented bell tower. The tent bell tower is located in the cemetery church. The church is one of the urban dominants.

It is the closing song on the album. Unlike many of the songs on the album, which were written by Dylan and Jacques Levy, \\"Sara\\" was written solely by Dylan, as an autobiographical account of his estrangement from then-wife Sara Dylan. It was recorded on July 31, 1975.  Background  The song is named after Dylan's wife at the time, and the song alludes to their earlier relationship, including the couple's children together. In his book Down The Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan, Howard Sounes quoted Jacques Levy's account of the recording of the song, stating that Sara was present at the studio and listened \\"from the other side of the glass\\" as Dylan played the song. According to Larry Sloman, Dylan turned to Sara just before beginning the song, and stated, \\"This one's for you.\\"Bob Dylan: The Recording Sessions by Clinton Heylin, p. 114. That first recording of the song is reportedly the one featured on the album. Bob and Sara would reconcile after the release of the song, but would divorce in 1977. The song contains the line \\"Staying up for days in the Chelsea hotel / Writing 'Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands' for you,\\" and has been a noted reference to Hotel Chelsea, where Dylan had resided in the 1960s.  Reception  \\"Sara\\" has been called one of Dylan's best love songs. The Irish Times stated the song was \\"as beautiful an expression of the preciousness and frailty of human love as has ever been put on a record.\\" Rolling Stone called the song perhaps his most personal song in his career. \\"Sara\\" was also featured at No. 48 on Rolling Stone's list of 100 Greatest Bob Dylan Songs.  Other versions  In 2002, a live version of the song from the 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue tour was featured on The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue. In 2019, that recording and four other live performances of the song from the tour were released on the box set The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings.

It was built by stonemason Sam Carnell. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The district owes its early origins to the Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) which was set up in London in December 1824. It received a grant of in New South Wales and subsequently set up its first colony at Carrington on the northern shores of Port Stephens in January 1826. The AACo was responsible for the development of the region and the town of Stroud was established in 1827. The township of Booral developed as an agricultural service town within the company's most important crop growing areas. The land was purchased in 1851 by John Lowry Esq. from the AACo. The first known owner was John Skillman. The probable date of construction of Gundayne House is . The stonemason was Sam Carnell, who was also stonemason of St Johns Church of England in Raymond Terrace. In 1981 Great Lakes Shire Council received an application for subdivision of land for the purpose of purchasing and restoring Gundayne House. To safeguard the satisfactory restoration of the house, Great Lakes Shire Council nominated Gundayne House for protection under the Heritage Act in 1981. An Interim Conservation Order was placed on the residence together with the outhouse and schoolhouse adjacent to it and its site on 23 April 1982. In 1982 the original property was subdivided to excise the house and grounds subject of the Interim Heritage Order from the remainder of the property under an application approved under the Heritage Act 1977. A Permanent Conservation Order was placed over Gundayne House on 25 May 1984.  Description  Gundayne House Group Gundayne is part of a larger group of significant buildings including Booral House, the former wharf remains, St. Barnabas Church and cemetery and the Booral School group.Branch Managers Report to the Heritage Council, 28 November 1983 ;Garden Remnants of the original garden layout and mature plantings, including two large specimens of magniflora still remain. ;House Gundayne is a two-storey residence of symmetrical design, built in approximately 1860 on land purchased from the Australian Agricultural Company. It is prominently located on the southern approach to the township to Booral. The land visually associated with the residence is bounded by the main road to the west, a lane to the south and a creek to the east and north and is approximately four hectares in area. Constructed of brick, the walls of the house are covered with stucco and lime. The windows throughout are of 12 or 16 panes. The hipped roof of the house is of corrugated iron as is the roof of the front verandah. Of particular interest are the tapered timber columns of the front verandah which are typical of the Stroud district. Further Stroud features can be seen in the squared patera and tapering pilasters of the ground floor fireplaces. All the joinery in the house is of cedar. ;Outbuildings Located at the rear of Gundayne House is a small rubble building which possibly predates the main house. Approximately 200 metres from the house is a small timber school house which dates from the 1890s. A former church structure was on the property, but deteriorated and fell down.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Gundayne House is significant as an example of a mid-nineteenth century house, with its rural setting, its detailing in the local idiom and its association with other nearby heritage items such as The Gables and Booral Wharf. It is noteworthy for its simple Georgian detailing, relatively intact interior, a scenic rural setting with significant outbuildings (remains of weatherboard schoolroom, underground well and weatherboard church). It is one of the few buildings which serve as a reminders of the establishment of Booral as an Australian Agricultural Company town.

It introduced Herriman's most famous pair of characters: Krazy Kat and Ignatz Mouse, who later featured in Herriman's best-known strip Krazy Kat (1913‚Äì1944). Publication and history George Herriman moved from California to New York to work for the New York Evening Journal. Six days after his arrival, Herriman began the daily strip The Dingbat Family, starring E. Pluribus Dingbat and his family. From August 10, 1910, to November 15, 1911, the strip ran under the title The Family Upstairs. During this period, the Dingbats fruitlessly attempted to deal with their irritating, noisy neighbors who lived in the apartment above them; the family upstairs was never seen in the strip. The original title returned after the strip of November 15, 1911, when the Dingbats' building was demolished to make room for a department store and they and their upstairs nemeses parted paths. Critics do not regard the strip highly, but it provided the vehicle for a fruitful situation: a cat-and- mouse that began as filler in the bottom of the strip's panels and later graduated to a tier of its own at the bottom of the strip. In the episode for July 26, 1910, the mouse threw a pebble (not yet the famous brick) at the family cat‚Äîcalled \\"Kat\\"‚Äîwhich hit the cat on the head. The antics of this mouse and \\"Kat\\" continued to appear in the bottom portion of The Dingbat Family. Herriman said he did this \\"to fill up the waste space\\". About a month after its first appearance, the \\"Kat\\" crept up on the sleeping mouse and kissed it loudly. The mouse awoke saying, \\"I dreamed an angel kissed me\\", while the \\"Kat\\" crept away and said, \\"Sweet thing\\". In July 1912, while Herriman had the Dingbats on vacation, Krazy Kat and Ignatz Mouse took over the strip, which was retitled Krazy Kat and I. Mouse for the duration. On October 28, 1913, Krazy Kat debuted as an independent strip on the daily comics page. The Dingbat Family ended January 4, 1916, and Herriman replaced it the next day with Baron Bean (1916‚Äì1919).

The fragment is from a codex, written on both sides with text from the first chapter of the Gospel of Mark; verses 7-9 on the recto side and 16-18 on the verso side. The manuscript has been dated paleographically to the later 2nd or earlier 3rd century, and has been published in the Oxyrhynchus papyrus series as P.Oxy. LXXXIII 5345.  Description  The fragment preserves parts of the bottom five lines (recto and verso) of a leaf; which could represent the first page of a single quire codex; and which may be reconstructed as having 25 lines per page with a written area of 9.4cm * 12 cm. On the recto side, the papyrus strips are laid vertically, while on the verso side they are laid horizontally. It is the earliest surviving witness to the text that it covers; otherwise the only early papyrus witness to Mark is in six surviving leaves of Papyrus 45, dated to the 3rd Century, which nowhere overlaps with the text in \\\\mathfrak{P}137. Letters on the verso survive clearly, but those on the recto are seriously abraded. The handwriting is in a formal bookhand which the editors propose as having the characteristics of the \\"‚ÄòFormal Mixed\\" hand (juxtaposing narrower and wider letter forms) elsewhere found in dateable documents of the later second and third centuries. The editors propose the fragments Papyrus 103 and Papyrus 77 of the Gospel of Matthew, also from Oxyrhynchus and conserved at the Sackler Library, as being the closest New Testament papyri to \\\\mathfrak{P}137 in handwriting and date.  Particular Readings  The term 'Holy Spirit' at verse 8 on the recto is shortened from œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÑŒπ to œÄÃ£ÃÖŒΩÃ£ÃÖŒπ as a nomen sacrum. Also in verse 8 on the recto, the dative preposition ŒµŒΩ('in') is not found in \\\\mathfrak{P}137 either before 'water' or before 'Holy Spirit'; whereas the standard text of Mark in Novum Testamentum Graece (NA28) has the dative preposition in the second instance only; \\"..he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit\\", following in this the Codex Sinaiticus. In omitting a dative preposition in both instances at verse 8, \\\\mathfrak{P}137 supports the alternative reading of this verse in Mark of the Codex Vaticanus and all editions of the Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece up to NA25. All four canonical Gospels introduce their accounts of the ministry of Jesus with these words from John the Baptist. In the Gospel of Luke (3:16) the dative preposition is found before 'Holy Spirit' but not before 'water'; whereas in the Gospel of Matthew (3:11) and the Gospel of John (1:33) both 'water' and 'Holy Spirit' are preceded by the dative preposition. The fragment otherwise supports no established variant readings from the standard texts for Mark; although the name of 'Jesus' is omitted from verse 17 at the third line of the verso, possibly through parablepsis as a scribal error. The editors note that the space presumed on the recto above the preserved lines of the fragment would imply an opening text of Mark of very similar length to that witnessed in the Codex Sinaiticus; contrary to the proposals of Karl Lachmann and others that some of these verses (especially 2 and 3) might be later intrusions. ; Present location It is currently housed at the Sackler Library (P. Oxy. LXXXIII 5345) in Oxford.  \\"First Century Mark\\"  \\\\mathfrak{P}137 was first published in 2018, but rumours of the content and provenance of a yet unpublished Gospel papyrus had been widely disseminated on social media since 2012, following a claim by Daniel B. Wallace that a recently identified fragmentary papyrus of Mark had been dated to the late first century by a leading papyrologist, and might therefore be the earliest surviving Christian text. Following its publication in 2018, the Egypt Exploration Society (EES), owners of the papyrus fragment, released a statement asserting that: * the provenance of the fragment was undisputed, having been excavated by Grenfell and Hunt in Oxyrhynchus, most probably in 1903; * at no time since had the fragment left Oxford; * at no time had the EES offered the fragment for sale; * at no time had the EES imposed a non-disclosure agreement on any scholar accessing the fragment. The EES clarified that the text in the fragment had only been recognised as being from the Gospel of Mark in 2011. In an earlier cataloguing in the 1980s by Revel Coles, the fragment had been described as 'I/II', which appeared to be the origin of the much discussed assertions of a very early date. In 2011/2012 the papyrus was in the keeping of Dirk Obbink, who had showed it to Scott Carroll, then representing the Green Collection, in connection with a proposal that it might be included in the exhibition of biblical papyri Verbum Domini at the Vatican in Lent and Easter 2012. It was not until the spring of 2016 that the EES realised that the much rumoured \\"First Century Mark\\" papyrus that had been the subject of so much speculation was one and the same as their own fragment P.Oxy. 5345; whereupon Dirk Obbink and Daniela Colomo were requested to prepare it for publication in the Oxyrhynchus Papyri series. In June 2019 a further statement was released by the EES, following the publication by the museum of the Bible \\"Scholars Initiative\\" director Michael Holmes of a contract between Professor Dirk Obbink and Hobby Lobby dated 17 January 2013, for the sale of a number of fragmentary texts, one of which Holmes identified as P.Oxy. LXXXIII 5345. The EES reaffirmed their previous statement that this fragment had never been offered for sale by the EES while offering the clarification that, in that statement, they had \\"simply reported Professor Obbink‚Äôs responses to our questions at that time, in which he insisted that he had not sold or offered for sale the Mark fragment to the Green Collection, and that he had not required Professor Wallace to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement in relation to such a sale.\\" In the July/August 2019 issue of Christianity Today, Jerry Pattengale wrote an article in which he published for the first time his own perspective on the 'First Century Mark' Saga. Pattengale states that he had been present with Scott Carroll in Dirk Obbink's rooms in Christ Church, Oxford in late 2011, when the \\\\mathfrak{P}137 fragment was offered for sale to the Museum of the Bible, which Pattengale then represented. Also offered for sale were fragments of the Gospels of Matthew, Luke and John, all of which Dirk Obbink had then proposed as likely to be of a 2nd century date; but the Mark fragment was presented as more likely 1st century. According to Pattengale, he had undertaken due diligence in showing images of the four fragments to selected New Testament textual scholars - subject to their signing non-disclosure agreements in accordance with Dirk Obbink's stipulations; and purchase was eventually finalised, with the fragments agreed to remain in Professor Obbink's possession for research prior to publication. It was not until a gala dinner in November 2017, celebrating the opening of the Museum of the Bible, that Pattengale realised that the \\"First Century Mark\\" fragment had been the property of the EES all along, and consequently had never legitimately been offered for sale.

It is also known as St John's Anglican Church. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The church was built in 1833, having been funded by Sir William Parry, the Commissioner of the Australian Agricultural Company and built by convict labour with construction supervised by the company's chief carpenter, Thomas Laman. The village of Stroud had been established by the company as part of a million-acre grant in the region it had received for its farming operations. A Congregationalist company chaplain, Charles Price, was initially in charge of the church, before William Cowper became the first Anglican rector in 1836. The company passed ownership of the church to the Anglican Church in 1853.  Description  The Church is a finely crafted and subdued example of early architecture that predates the influence of ecclesiology. Its design, although subdued reflects the religious philosophy of Parry and the governments attitude to Church construction at that time. Incredibly, few changes have been made to the building, and it remains to this day, essentially as it was designed and constructed in 1833. Built in 1833 by Thomas Laman in the Old Colonial Gothik style, the church has an unscholarly application of medieval motifs upon a simple classical form, built in a traditional manner with construction techniques and materials typical of its period. Externally the Church presents a simple yet eloquent fa√ßade. A small square bellcote on the ridge of the gabled roof marks the western fa√ßade. A centrally placed porch on the southern side and a vestry on the north have the effect of making the building symmetrical on its east and west axis. Both eastern and western facades originally contained gothic arched lancet windows with wooden Y tracery and a little quatrefoil cut into the space at the top of the Y. These simple pointed lancet windows are still symmetrically arranged on the facades. However, the most eastern windows on the northern and southern facades have since been replaced with new designs and stained glass as memorial windows. The original furnishings of the interior are still in use to this day and are surprisingly still in good order for their age. Internally, the plaster barrel vault ceiling is crowned with a simple cornice with fluorescent lights concealed above the wooden architraves. The gallery located at the western end of the building and intended as a memorial pew is approached by steps from the nave and has rods for curtains. Balancing pulpits flank the semicircular-railed sanctuary against the eastern wall. The internal joinery and fittings are of waxed local cedar, including the altar and seating in the form of benches with decorative shaped backs. The brick walls are plastered intern and in good condition. The doors are of uncommon design, yet all consist of six panels and many still have their original latches.  Condition  The condition of the built church is in very good physical condition due to its restoration in the early 1980s. However, some brickwork is deteriorating due to rising damp. Roof gutters, downpipes and drainage lines are in good condition and dispose of stormwater adequately. The fine cedar joinery appears in excellent condition and the stain glass windows are in good order, although some of the more recent repairs to the windows could be considered inappropriate in that they obscure some of the glass. Access to the roof was not gained and this should be inspected to ensure the structure is in a stable condition and no pest attack is occurring. The slate roof appears to suffer water ingress as a result of inadequate lap of the original slate installation. It is apparent that this problem is gradually worsening as slates slip and fixings fail, and there is immediate potential for water damage to interior fixtures and finishes, in particular the existing ceiling, if this problem is not immediately remediated. It is anticipated that relaying of the slates and rebedding and pointing of the ridge capping will be required to rectify this problem. The effect of rising damp and deterioration of the brick surfaces near ground level should be regularly monitored over the next 12 months to establish whether the deterioration si continuing or whether it was halted by the 1983 restoration.  Heritage listing  The St John the Evangelist Church, Parsonage and Parish Hall form a highly significant group in every sense of the word. Historically, it is significant for its links to A.A. Co. and Sir William and Lady Parry, and subsequent A. A. Company Commissioners. The role of the Parish Hall as a school provides links to early education systems in New South Wales. The Church has been credited as being \\"perhaps the finest and certainly the most intact Anglican Church in Australia which predates the influence of ecclesiology\\". Together, the group forms an aesthetically significant group of Colonial Georgian Buildings which remain virtually unaltered since construction. Socially, the group continues to remain a focus of religious and community life in Stroud, a role served by each building from its moment of completion.Conservation Management Plan - Hedley et al, 2002 St John the Evangelist Anglican Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The St Johns group of buildings in Stroud is historically significant for its close associations to the Australian Agricultural Company and its place in the establishment of the town of Stroud. The group remain an integral and undiminished assembly of buildings, which in their context reveal an important historical phase in the pattern of development in New South Wales. Stroud was established by the Australian Agricultural Company on its one million acre grant in the Port Stephens area. Dating from the earliest days of settlement in the Port Stephens are, this unique group of buildings were an early part of the Australian Agricultural Company's rural empire. The buildings are remnants from the early settlement of the town by the AA Company. The buildings were built during the convict period and there is no doubt that the A. A. Company had a large contingent of convicts working on their property (of which Stroud was a part) and therefore it is most likely that there was convict labour used in the construction. However, there is no historical evidence to prove this. Although the poor construction of the Western door of the church may suggest unskilled convict labour was used in its construction. The Buildings including the cemetery and surrounding landscape provide a tangible record of the local district history over more than a century. There continuing social value for the contemporary community is reflected both in the support and attention the community has for this site. The cemetery expresses, via its memorials, the major phases in the district's history, in particular the success of pastoral activity. The cemetery has been valued over time by the local community for its memorials, associations and, by the state of its present maintenance, is valued still as one of the important links with the early formation of the Australian Agricultural Company. The buildings and landscape are a reflection of the continuity and development of Anglican worship in the Stroud district. The church is the oldest operational church in NSW. The precinct has been a strong focus for the religious community since the early nineteenth century and retains a high level of social significance for the parishioners. The Church group contributes more broadly to the historical precinct of Stroud. The St Johns group is therefore significant at a State level for the process of growth and development they represent in relation to the A.A Company as a reminder of the most important agricultural activities in Australia's early history, the township of Stroud; and the Anglican religion. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. St Johns Stroud Group holds significant importance for its association with the Australian Agricultural Company, and it Super Intendants, especially that of Parry. Sir W. E. Parry before serving as a commissioner at Port Stephens from 1829-1834 was a former Royal Navy Hydrographer and acclaimed Arctic explorer Captain held in high regard for his contribution to the development of Stroud and in particular the development of religious worship within the community. Parry was one of the more significant figures in early Australian history. The site is locally significant for the association with the clergy and the priests and pastors that have served there. Furthermore, there is an important link between the Anglican community and Church of England. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The St. John's Group of buildings, Stroud has a very high degree of aesthetic appeal. They are a distinctive and attractive group of Colonial Georgian sandstock brick buildings, dating from 1830. They are representative of the colonial character and the style of buildings constructed at that time. Together the buildings form a cohesive group of Colonial Georgian buildings that are aesthetically significant, remaining virtually unaltered since their construction. The decorative detail of the church furnishings are significant for their creative styling and design. Furthermore, they are still in use today and in good working condition. The barrel vaulted elliptical church roof is technically interesting for its period. While the vast majority of cemetery monuments remain in relatively good condition today, there are some headstones which have not been replaced after either being vandalised or simply deteriorated from age. However, they demonstrate a remarkable range of high quality workmanship and skilled installation techniques. These fine examples of craftsmanship are enhanced by the use of sandstone and occasional white marble and the setting of the cemetery. The cultural plantings and garden beds associated with the rectory are somewhat earlier developments. However, they have incorporated some early plant material and now play a significant role in the aesthetics of the St John's group. The setting and surrounding landscape of Stroud has been virtually undeveloped and as such retains much of its original beauty. In terms of architectural characteristics, the St Johns group of buildings, landscapes and cemetery stands on its own merits as having aesthetic significance at a state level. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. From the beginning of European settlement in New South Wales, the role of the Church of England was closely tied to the interests of the state. Consequently, organised religion held an important place in early settlement of Stroud, being nurtured, if not perhaps enforced by the Australian Agricultural Company Superintendents. Therefore, religious worship has been an important element of the social fabric of Stroud, since its development. St John's Stroud Group stands as a reminder both of the churches role in convict society and of Parry's commitment to evangelicalism. St John's Stroud group is of spiritual significance to the evangelical community. The group of building's have contributed to the spiritual and cultural life of the Stroud community for over 170 years, serving as the centre of local Anglican worship and social activity. Stroud has seen the rise and decline of many local community groups typical of rural towns. The St John's Church Hall has played a pivotal role in providing a place for community groups since it was built until this day. The Buildings including the cemetery and surrounding landscape provide a tangible record of the local history over more than a century. In particular, the cemetery expresses, via its monuments, the major phases in the districts history, in particular the success of pastoral activity. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Buildings including the cemetery and surrounding landscape provide a tangible record of the local district history over more than a century. These buildings are the oldest of their type still in use and therefore have some potential to reveal information that will contribute both to the cultural and natural history of NSW and more significantly the local history of Stroud. These buildings have formed an integral part of the tangible history of the Stroud community, for over 170 years including its built fabric, social, cultural and spiritual development. The linkages with Australian Agricultural Company provide information about early settlement, the social structures and furthermore the development of NSW. The significant fabric of the buildings and landscape has the potential to reveal information about the type and style of construction techniques of the 1800s. For example, the originality of design and furnishings within the Church reflect the type of building construction and design of their period. In terms of archaeological potential, the St John's cemetery with inscriptions, dating from 1836 has the potential to reveal information of the hardships of life in an early colonial village. Being a small rural cemetery with a good range of monumental styles spanning two centuries, this site reveals the style and type of burials undertaken in the early and late 19th Century. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. By virtue of their age and condition the St John's Group has the potential to reveal historical information about early settlement in NSW. In particular, the Church reflects the governments attitude to Church construction at that time. Finally, the buildings have an interesting history that is interwoven with the history of the Australian Agricultural Company. Examination of that history gives a unique insight into the minds of those who first settled NSW. In particular the concepts of religious worship and its important place in the early communities of NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. St John's Stroud group is a considerably significant heritage item that is representative of the relationship between the buildings in terms of Church- School- Parsonage. Even despite the fact that this relationship is common place, Stroud group is an original example of that relationship where many other of its type may have been destroyed or altered by progress over time. Representative of the Church's role in early settlement and in particular in the convict society and of Parry's commitment to evangelicalism. The group as part of the township of Stroud provides evidence of early town layouts, where the street grid is arranged around earlier adhoc developments, and where it as predominantly in the hands of a single entity - the Australian Agricultural Company.

It was discovered in 1964, and excavated during 2004 and 2017. Stone tools found at the site were dated based on magnetostratigraphy in a 2018 study. Artefacts were found in 17 layers, dated to between 1.26 Ma (palaeosol S15) and 2.12 Ma (loess L28). The date of 2.12 Ma predates the earliest known fossils of archaic humans in Eurasia (Homo erectus georgicus) by 300,000 years.  Location  Shangchen is located in and named after the village of Shangchen (), Yushan Town (zh), Lantian County, Shaanxi, about southeast of the provincial capital at Xi'an. The archaeological site is on the cliff faces of a gully in the Loess Plateau. Because loess is a soil made by extremely fine particles blown in by the wind, all larger rocks found in loess deposits had to have been carried in by humans or other animals.  Discovery and excavation  Lantian County is where fossils of the Homo erectus, now called Lantian Man, were discovered in 1964. The oldest fossil, a skull, was initially dated to 1.15 million years ago. In 2001, geologist Zhu Zhaoyu and other scientists began researching the site again, and determined that the skull was 1.63 million years old. Zhu's team surveyed the region around the fossil site, and discovered stone tools buried deep in the side of a gully in Shangchen, less than three miles away. The team, later joined by British paleoanthropologist Robin Dennell in 2010, thoroughly searched the gully and excavated the site between 2004 and 2017, and their findings were published in July 2018 in the journal Nature. A total of 96 stone tools have been found at Shangchen, including flakes, points, and cores. They were found in 17 artefact layers.  Date  The oldest artefact- bearing layer at the site was dated at 2.12 million years ago, while the youngest was dated to 1.26 million years, indicating that the site was occupied (not necessarily continuously) for 850,000 years. Some of the tools were found with bone fragments of animals including deer and bovines. Even older remains may still lie undiscovered, as the deepest layers at Shangchen are inaccessible as of 2018 because the area is \\"actively farmed\\". The findings are highly significant as they represent the earliest evidence of Homo outside Africa, surpassing Dmanisi in the Caucasus region of Georgia, which was the previously known oldest Lower Paleolithic site outside Africa, dating to 1.85 million years ago. It is also older than the Yuanmou Man, the oldest hominin fossils found in East Asia, dating to 1.7 million years. As the Shangchen site lacks volcanic minerals which are abundant in African sites, the study dated the sediments using the paleomagnetism method. The authors of the study argue that a natural origin of the claimed artefacts is ruled out as Shangchen and its immediate vicinity have no known ancient rivers, which might have carved natural rocks into shapes resembling human-made tools. Uninvolved scientists who reviewed the findings consider the dates convincing. Study co- author Robin Dennell talking to a Nature News reporter was cited as speculating that \\"the Shangchen toolmakers belonged to an earlier species in the genus Homo\\" than H. erectus, and one William Jungers (unaffiliated with the study) is cited as even reserving \\"the possibility that the Shangchen toolmaker was a species of Australopithecus\\".

History  The constituency was created when, ahead of the 2008 general election, the Election Commission redrew constituency boundaries to reflect population changes revealed by the 2001 Bangladesh census. The 2008 redistricting added a new seat to Chittagong District, increasing the number of constituencies in the district to 16. The seat for Sandwip Upazila was renumbered from Chittagong-3 to Chittagong-16, and seats 2 through 7 were shuffled around so that the three metropolitan seats (Chittagong-8, 9, and 10) could be split into four (Chittagong-7, 8, 9, and 10). Ahead of the 2014 general election, the Election Commission renumbered the seat for Sandwip Upazila from Chittagong-16 back to Chittagong-3, bumping up by one the suffix of the former constituency of that name and the higher numbered constituencies in the district.

It consists of approximately thirty species found in the West Indies. Michael A. Ivie and Charles J. Hart named and circumscribed the genus in 2016. Taxonomic history The genus Xerolinus was circumscribed in 2016 by Montana State University coleopterists Michael A. Ivie and Charles J. Hart. They initially included twenty-nine species, which were mostly transferred from the genus Diastolinus. In a separate 2016 paper, Hart and Ivie described two new Xerolinus species. Ivie and Hart designated X. sallei, which French etymologists √âtienne Mulsant and Claudius Rey initially described as Diastolinus sallei in 1859, to be the type species of Xerolinus. The generic name Xerolinus has a masculine gender. Its etymology comes from the Greek (xƒìr√≥s; \\"dry, arid\\") combined with the ending of the generic name Diasolinus. This reflects the habitat these beetles are found in. Xerolinus is in the subtribe Opatrina within the tribe Opatrini. Distribution Xerolinus is found in southern Florida and the West Indies, including the Lucayan Archipelago, the Greater Antilles, and the British Virgin Islands. The majority of described species are from the Cuban archipelago, although Ivie and Hart note that there will likely be even more species in the Lucayan Archipelago once its fauna become better studied. Most species in Xerolinus are endemic to a single island or to a group of islands corresponding to a single island in the Pleistocene. The eastern extreme of this genus's range is Great Camanoe. Description Xerolinus species have an oval or elongate oval body length with a length of . Species , the following thirty-one species are recognized: * X. alfaroi ‚Äî Cuba * X. alutaceus ‚Äî USA (Florida), Cuba * X. armasi ‚Äî Cuba * X. bahamae ‚Äî The Bahamas * X. bielawskii ‚Äî Cuba * X. burtoni ‚Äî Cayman Islands * X. caguamensis ‚Äî Cuba * X. camanoensis ‚Äî Virgin Islands * X. caymanensis ‚Äî Cayman Islands * X. cubanus ‚Äî Cuba * X. dentipes ‚Äî Cuba, Cayman Islands * X. difficilis ‚Äî Cuba * X. dispar ‚Äî USA (Florida) * X. dozieri ‚Äî Turks and Caicos Islands * X. elongatus ‚Äî Cuba * X. garridoi ‚Äî Cuba * X. hernandezi ‚Äî Cuba (Isla de Juventud) * X. juraguensis ‚Äî Cuba * X. kulzeri ‚ÄîThe Bahamas (Mayaguana) * X. macamboensis ‚Äî Cuba * X. minor ‚Äî Cayman Islands * X. orientalis ‚Äî Cuba * X. puncticeps ‚Äî Cuba * X. rufoclavatus ‚Äî Cuba * X. sallei ‚Äî Hispaniola * X. smalli ‚Äî Cuba * X. swearingenae ‚Äî Jamaica * X. that ‚Äî The Bahamas * X. this ‚Äî The Bahamas * X. waterhousii ‚Äî Cuba * X. zayasi ‚Äî Cuba In addition, an undescribed species mentioned in Robert H.

History The Herald was founded in 1898, as The Weekly Herald by Howell Rose Golson. He was succeeded by his son Howell Hunter Golson, making him one of the youngest editors in the state at that time. The elder Golson died in 1916 in an automobile accident. From 1916 to 1932, H. R. Golson's daughter, Frances Golson, served as the first woman editor-publisher of the Herald, running it with her brother. Described as \\"bright, handsome, and marriageable\\" by the press, Frances Golson was the only woman delegate to the 1919 Alabama Press Association convention in Andalusia, Alabama. In 1949, a fire at the Herald building did extensive damage to both the building and equipment. From 1965 to 2003 the Herald was owned and run by Ellen and Gerald WIlliams. They sold the paper in 2003 to former Alexander City Outlook editor Kim Price. At the time the Herald had a subscriber base of 5,600 and 15 employees. During the transition, Peggy Blackmon remained editor.

Early life Tooker was born on December 12, 1839, in New York City. He was the third of seven children born to John F. Tooker (1807‚Äì1849) and Mary A. (n√©e Mead) Tooker (b. 1811), who married in 1835. His maternal grandfather was William Mead of Greenwich, Connecticut. He was the uncle of Anna Tooker Best, who was also prominent in New York and Newport society. He graduated with an A.M. degree from Columbia College in 1859 and a LL.B. degree in 1861. Career Tooker's family was prominent as merchants in New York City with the firm Tooker, Mead & Company. The firm had been run by his parents families. Tooker was a lawyer, with an office at 23 Nassau Street in lower Manhattan, who was also known as a successful investor. Society life In 1892, the widower Tooker was included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. He was a member of the New-York Historical Society, and an active member of the Reading Room, a gentlemen's club in Newport. The Tookers owned one of the finest homes in Newport, Rhode Island, referred to as the \\"Tooker villa\\", at Kay and Bellevue Avenue, and took part in prominent society there. In 1895, following the marriage of his youngest daughter Emily, Tooker gifts the house, including all its furnishings, chandeliers, and draperies, to his children, who promptly divided the contents and sold the home. His elder daughter was considered the \\"beauty of the family\\" and his younger daughter Emily, who was \\"not in the least bit pretty,\\" was reportedly engaged to A. Lanfear Norrie. Personal life On December 2, 1862, Tooker was married to Margaret Augusta Peckham (1843‚Äì1888), the daughter of Dr. Walton Hazard Peckham and Margaret (n√©e Milderburger) Stuyvesant Peckham. Margaret was the first cousin of biologist George William Peckham and Supreme Court Justice Rufus Wheeler Peckham and niece of U.S. Representative Rufus W. Peckham and District Attorney Wheeler H. Peckham, all descendants of George Hazard, a Governor of the Colony of Rhode Island. The Tookers New York residence was at 675 Fifth Avenue. Together, they were the parents of: * Charlotte Augusta Tooker (1864‚Äì1951), who married architect Whitney Warren (1864‚Äì1943) of Warren and Wetmore, in 1884. * John Stansbury \\"Jack\\" Tooker (b. 1866), an 1890 Harvard graduate who married Maud Somerville Jaffray (1871‚Äì1947) in 1903. * Emily Montague Tooker (1872‚Äì1903), who married J. Wadsworth Ritchie (1861‚Äì1924), son of Cornelia Adair and grandson of General James S. Wadsworth, in 1895. His wife died in Rome, Italy, on February 4, 1888. Tooker died on December 11, 1905, at Monte Carlo in Monaco, after having lived abroad for twenty years. He was buried alongside his wife in Rome, however, a memorial was place at Island Cemetery in Newport, Rhode Island. Descendants Through his daughter Charlotte, he was the grandfather of Charlotte Augusta Warren (1885‚Äì1957), who married William Greenough, and Whitney Warren Jr. (1898‚Äì1986), who was a horticulturalist and patron of the arts.

Description Painted by Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me between 1868 and 1869, the painting depicts a dark-skinned model dressed as a Bashi-bazouk, a levy of irregular Ottoman soldiers infamous for their brutality, looting, and lack of discipline. G√©r√¥me acquired the garb seen in the painting during a trip to the near east in 1868. The haphazard and mixed textiles the model is dressed in is reminiscent of the Bashi-bazouks, as the soldiers were traditionally unpaid and did not adopt a standardized uniform, resulting in the soldiers wearing whatever they could acquire on a march. This a key point of the painting, as the brutal reputation of a Bashi-bazouk is contrasted by the silk tunic, quality clothes, and noble bearing of the subject.

The bridge is also known as the Monkerai Bridge over Karuah River. The bridge is owned by Roads and Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000.  History  The bridge was completed in 1882. In 2017, funding was provided for a Conservation Management Plan to restore the bridge and determine its future use.  Description  The bridge carries the Weismantels-Dingadee Road over the Karuah River between Dungog and Stroud. It comprises six spans (three approach spans and three truss spans) with an overall length of and a maximum road width of between kerbs. The majority of the bridge is timber, with metal used for shoes, vertical tension rods, and bolts. In recent years, pier two was rebuilt with a concrete base, longitudinal decking was installed and timber endposts were attached to the railing at either end of the bridge. While little original fabric remains on the bridge, it is still considered to have a high degree of integrity, the reason being that timber truss bridges were designed with the requirement to replace timber elements in mind. The fact that timber elements on this Bridge have generally been replaced \\"like for like\\" means that this structure has a high degree of integrity. Its level of integrity is greater than that of the only other old NSW Public Works Department (PWD) truss bridge still in existence, the Clarence Town Bridge over Williams River, as it has had less structural modifications made to it.  Heritage listing  The Monkerai Bridge is one of the most significant bridges in the NSW road network from a heritage perspective. It has been assessed previously as being of heritage significance at a national level,McMillan, Britton & Kell 1998 although it is endorsed and managed by the Roads & Traffic Authority (RTA) as being significant at a State level. While the bridge is of aesthetic and social significance, its high level of heritage significance stems chiefly from it being of great historical and technical significance. The Bridge is the second oldest surviving timber truss bridge in the NSW road network, and is an exceptionally rare example of an Old PWD truss bridge. Old PWD truss bridges were the first in the five-stage development of timber truss bridges in NSW, and represent the genesis of this form of bridge construction. While the bridge as a whole has been assessed as fulfilling the criteria for listing on the SHR, the various elements that comprise the Bridge are of varying levels of significance: abutments, piers, decking and hand railing are of moderate significance, of works the cross girders are of considerable significance and the truss spans are of exceptional significance. Monkerai Bridge over Karuah River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The bridge is the second-oldest surviving timber truss road bridge in New South Wales, and is one of only two surviving Old PWD truss bridges in existence. The design of the Bridge is historically significant through its links to earlier European timber truss bridges, the designs of which can be traced back to the influence of the 16th Century Italian architect, Andrea Palladio. The Bridge is historically significant through its association with the expansion of the NSW road network, and the contribution of that road system to the settlement and development of NSW. The form and fabric of the Bridge are significant in reflecting the requirement of an 1861 parliamentary decree that local materials be used in the construction of public works, to reduce the costs associated with the importation of iron, which was not produced locally at that time. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The bridge is significant through its association with William Bennett, the Commissioner for Public Works, designer of the Old PWD truss, and \\"father\\" of timber truss bridges in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The form of the bridge is aesthetically pleasing. The structural detail of the bridge is clearly visible, and the form of the truss has an angularity and repetition of form that is pleasing to the eye. The bridge is located in a visually attractive landscape of gently rolling hills and valleys, and the Bridge itself forms an attractive addition to the built component of that landscape. The appearance of the bridge when viewed from up or downstream is quite striking. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The bridge is of significance to the people of the Monkerai area, both as a transport link, and as a local heritage item although there does not appear to be a high level of community awareness of its heritage significance. The bridge is of significance to the region for its place in the road network of the Hunter Region, and through its historical contribution to the settlement and development of the Gloucester region. Timber truss bridges are significant to the social identity of NSW as the \\"timber truss bridge state\\", being the only Australian state to widely use timber truss bridges as an integral part of its late 19th and early 20th Century road network. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The bridge is of high technical significance as a rare remaining example of an Old PWD truss bridge, the first truss type designed and used for timber road bridges in NSW. Through study of the Old PWD and later truss types, it is possible to track the design changes made to the various truss types as designs were refined for better durability and ease of maintenance. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The bridge is an exceptionally rare example of a once prolific form of bridge construction. Only two Old PWD truss bridges survive, out of a total of 147 constructed. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The bridge is highly representative of an Old PWD truss, and demonstrates the construction and design techniques used in the earliest form of timber truss bridge design in NSW. The bridge is intact and still functioning in its original role as a road bridge. Whilst elements of the Bridge have been altered to meet current traffic requirements, safety specifications or to make the structure less difficult to maintain, the most significant elements of the bridge, the truss spans, still retain the characteristics of the original design.

From his earliest group albums such as Reflections, Evidence and School Days, through solo recordings like Only Monk and More Monk, to the recent Monk's Dream - a period of well over forty years - Lacy has established himself as the greatest Monk interpreter, bar none.

At the beginning of the 20th century, in documents, it appeared as the property of Nicolay's wife Ekaterina Nikolaevna Solodova. \\"The House of Workers of Education\\", also known as the \\"Teacher's Club,\\" was located inside the building. A large library was also used by the school‚Äôs teachers and students. The house adopted an eclectic design. Window openings were squared, as well as sub-window niches and sockets. The two-story house had a rectangular shape with a cellar at the center and was plastered. Semi-circular window openings were issued by simple platbands and parapets were encased in openwork metal protection. The modeled decor was presented by macrons that decorated capstones and arms; they met in the registration of attics. While carrying out repair work, and overlapping roof was made.

It is constructed in 1890 on the project of the architect G. N. Vasilyev in the spirit of eclecticism. At the beginning of the 20th century, the house belonged to the tradeswoman P.K. Masalitina. Now the building occupies New York City restaurant. Masalitina's house has the status of an object of cultural heritage of regional value.  History and description  The profitable house of K. A. Vorozhein was built in 1890 on the project of the architect G. N. Vasilyev. As of 1913-1914 the house belonged to P. K. Masalitina. In it took place: haberdashery X. Mermelstein, factory on a production of halvah of N. M. Masalitin, sausage factory Boylan and Kyuntselm, envelope factory of N. I. Kravchenko, hour shop F. Voloshinova, the association under Veydenbakh. In the 1920s after the arrival of the Soviet power, the house was nationalized. On the second floor, inhabited apartments were placed. During the Great Patriotic War, the angular dome was lost. After the end of the war, it was restored in the simplified forms. In the 1950s, the first floor of the building was occupied: \\"Hairdressing salon\\", shop \\"Konditerskiye Izdeliya\\", \\"Pivnaya\\". In 1990s-2000s at the building the owner several times changed, and each of them made changes to the image of the building. At the beginning of the 2010s repairs of the building were made. Builders deviated from the project, therefore, the building changed the initial color scale: the first floor was painted in green color. On September 28, 2013, in the building, there was a fire.

A midterm election, those elected therein will take office on June 30, 2019, midway through the term of President Rodrigo Duterte. The following positions were contested: *12 seats in the Senate of the Philippines *All seats in the House of Representatives of the Philippines *All Governors and Sangguniang Panlalawigan (Provincial Councils) in the provinces of the Philippines *All Mayors and Sangguniang Panlungsod (City Councils) or Sangguniang Bayan (Municipal Councils) in the cities or municipalities of the Philippines Under the Local Government Code and the 1987 constitution, all terms start on June 30, 2019, and end on June 30, 2022, except for elected senators, whose terms shall end on June 30, 2025. The Commission on Elections administered the election. Preparation Date of the election The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines states that unless otherwise provided by law, the election of members of Congress is on every second Monday of May. According to Republic Act No. 7166, election for national, provincial, city and municipal elections are on the second Monday of May, since 1992, and every three years thereafter, with the president and vice president being elected in six-year intervals. It has been three years since the last general election of 2016, and with no law canceling the election, this meant that the election was held on Monday, May 13, 2019. The commission confirmed the day of the election day of May 13 when it released the calendar for the election. The important days are: *Filing of candidacies and nominations for party-list representatives: October 11 to 12, and October 15 to 17, 2018 *Campaign period **For Senate and party-list elections: February 12 to May 11, 2019 **For district congressional and local elections: March 29 to May 11, 2019 *Substitution of candidates: November 30 to 12:00 p.m. of May 13, 2019 *Election silence: April 18 to 19 and May 12 to 13, 2019 *Election day: May 13, 2019 *Deadline of filing of expenses: June 12, 2019  Automated election system  The Philippines adopted an automated election system (AES) for the 2019 elections. The COMELEC announced in December 2018 that the Philippine AES passed the review conducted by international systems and software testing firm, Pro V&V;, in Alabama, USA. The Commission had a 'trusted build' program wherein the program to be used in the midterms in 2019 is built using the reviewed components. Commissioner Marlon Casquejo on December 17, 2018 turned over the executable file of the Election Management System (EMS) Trusted Build for the May 13, 2019 National and Local Elections (NLE) to the Commission en banc. The file will be escrowed to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. The EMS compiled the number and profile of registered voters, their geographic locations and polling precinct information, and these were used in designing the official ballots. Equipment The Commission on Elections made a decision on February 1, 2018 to purchase vote-counting machines (VCM), which were used in the 2016 presidential election for a price of 2.122 billion pesos for the 2019 mid-term elections. Commission on Elections membership On October 17, 2017, the House of Representatives impeached Commission on Elections Chairman Andres D. Bautista due to allegations of manipulation of the 2016 vice presidential election in favor of Leni Robredo. Hours earlier, Bautista announced his resignation effective December 31. President Duterte accepted Bautista's resignation effective immediately, on October 23. Duterte then appointed Sheriff Abas as new chairman, in November 2017. The Commission on Appointments confirmed Duterte's appointment of Abas as Chairman in May 2018. Abas is expected to head the commission on the 2019 elections. At the confirmation hearing, Abas defended the commission's purchase of the vote-counting machines, saying that they were purchased at one-third of the cost. The commission later confirmed Duterte's appointment of Socorro Inting as Commissioner later that month. Duterte also appointed Marlon S. Casquejo as Commissioner on June and undersecretary of Justice Antonio Kho as Commissioner on July, completing the commission's seven seats. Proposed cancellation Due to the drive to change the constitution to make the Philippines a federation, Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said in January 2018 that the cancellation of the 2019 elections is possible, as a transition government would be needed. Later, the president ruled out the cancellation the election. By July, after the consultative committee submitted their draft constitution to the president and Congress, Alvarez proposed to cancel the 2019 elections so that Congress can concentrate in revising the constitution. Senate President Tito Sotto said that this is possible by Congress passing a law for the cancellation of the election. Members of the consultative committee, on the other hand, prefer holding the election. Aquilino Pimentel Jr. said that \\"I suggest elections will continue (because people suspect that) we are proposing federalism so that the elections can be postponed. It is not true, not at all.\\" Later that month, Senator Panfilo Lacson said that most senators, including those who are running for reelection, would have blocked any moves by the lower house to cancel the election. This came as Alvarez switched his preferred mode of amending the constitution via a People's Initiative. Franklin Drilon earlier said that the minority bloc would have sued if Alvarez's plan of cancelling the election pushed through. With the ouster of Alvarez by Gloria Macapagal Arroyo as Speaker in July 2018, the latter said that she preferred the elections pushing through.

According to COMELEC spokesperson James Jimenez, there are 400‚Äì600 out of 85,000 VCMs across the country (representing 0.7%) encountered glitches. The machines were from the 2016 elections, and the COMELEC admitted that it could be because the machines are not new. Faulty SD cards were also reported to be the cause of malfunction. The substandard ballot forms as well as markers that bleed ink are other causes of malfunction and anomalies. The COMELEC will probe the suppliers: Triplex Enterprises Incorporated for the ballot paper and marking pens and S1 Technologies Incorporated and Silicon Valley Computer Group joint venture for the SD cards. Jimenez, however, said that the problems experienced were still within range of expected range of expectation, as problematic machines account for only less than 1 percent of total machines used. There are reports of running out of ballots in a polling precinct in Alburquerque, Bohol; affected voters have waited for two hours before the extra ballots was delivered at 3pm. At around 10, the COMELEC has experienced problems with the transparency server where the unofficial tally has been stuck for hours, with only 0.38% of polling precincts have managed to transmit the results. But experts agree that the glitches don't necessarily mean cheating took place. The transmission happened, according to PPCRV Chairperson Myla Villanueva. In an interview, Villanueva said that 'results were receiver by transparency server continuously, despite media temporarily not being able to see the results.' She added that 'most importantly, the ERs match with transmitted results.' Despite the glitches, the random manual audits (RMA) conducted days after the elections show that the 2019 midterms yielded the highest rate of accuracy among the previous automated elections. Based on the 2019 RMA, the accuracy rate for the senatorial votes was at 99.9971 percent; for members of the House 99.9946 percent; and 99.9941 percent for mayor. The COMELEC recorded at least 20 people have been killed in an election-related incidents and 43 incidents during the course of election campaign as of May 13, most notably the killing of AKO Bicol congressman Rodel Batocabe on December 22, 2018. There are reported violence during the election day: a shooting occurred at the polling center in Panglima Estino, Sulu where six have been injured.  Reaction  In a Pulse Asia opinion poll dated June 24‚Äì30, 2019, 82% of those surveyed found the election to be believable while 82% said the release of the results were fast. Meanwhile, 10% of respondents found their names missing in the voters list, 4% of their registration was deactivated, 1% of the vote counting machine malfunctioned, as the issues in the election.

It derived from the Ecclesiastical Latin that was developed by the Latin Church fathers in the Western Church. Although Latin language was the official language of the Roman Empire, going back to the Italic tribe who in antiquity developed in Ancient Rome, the name was used irrespective of ethnicity, including by Germanic, Italic, Celtic and Slavic peoples. Thus the people associated with the states created during the Crusades were generally referred to as Latins or Franks, the latter being one prominent group represented. In the Byzantine Empire, and the broader Greek Orthodox world, it was generally a negative characterisation, especially after the East-West schism in 1054.

The ship changed names and owners several times; she was originally built for the Dominion Line and was known as New England, in 1903 she was transferred to the White Star Line and renamed Romanic. In 1912 she was sold to the Allan Line and renamed Scandinavian, the name which she retained for the rest of her career. Background, design and construction In the late 1890s the Dominion Line ordered three ships from Harland & Wolff for their profitable Liverpool-to-Boston service; the first of these was called New England; the others were the Commonwealth, and the Columbus. The New England was launched on 7 April 1898. New England had three overall decks, and a capacity of 200 First class, 200 Second class and 800 Third class passengers. She was powered by two four-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines which were coupled to two propellers, and could propel the ship to a maximum speed of . Career The New England started her maiden voyage from Liverpool to Boston on 30 June 1898. In 1902 the Dominion Line and the White Star Line were taken over by the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMMCo) which set about transferring ships between its subsidiary companies in order to increase efficiency. Most of the Dominion Line's profitable routes were soon transferred to the White Star Line including the Boston service. The New England made her last sailing from Liverpool under the Dominion Line on 17 September 1903, soon after she was sold internally within the IMMCo group along with her sisters to the White Star Line and renamed Romanic. She was initially retained on the Liverpool‚ÄìBoston service, and made her first sailing for White Star on 19 November 1903. Soon afterwards Romanic was transferred to a new service from Boston to Naples and Genoa in Italy in order to take advantage of the lucrative market for immigrants from Italy to the United States. She commenced service on this route on 3 December 1903. On 12 July 1907 Romanic collided with a 66-ton fishing schooner Natalie B. Nickerson in thick fog near the Nantucket Shoals. The schooner sank and three of her crew of eighteen lost their lives; the Romanic picked up the survivors and landed them at Boston. Romanic continued on the Boston‚ÄìItaly service until the growth of Italy's own merchant fleet began to displace British vessels on the Mediterranean service. Romanic was withdrawn from the service in November 1911, and in January 1912 she was sold to the Glasgow based Allan Line and renamed Scandinavian. Her new owners refitted the vessel's passenger accommodation to carry 400 Second and 800 Third class passengers. her gross tonnage was increased in the refit to 12,099 tons. She commenced service for the Allan Line on 23 March 1912 between Glasgow, Halifax and Boston for their winter service, switching to Glasgow‚ÄìQuebec‚ÄìMontreal during the summer months. Following the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 the Scandinavian was used as a troopship to transport Canadian troops to Britain. between 1917 and 1918 she was operated under the Liner Requisition Scheme. In 1917 the Allan Line was taken over by the Canadian Pacific Line. Following her release from government service, Scandinavian made her first voyage for her new owners on 22 August 1918 between Liverpool and New York. Three months later she was switched to the Liverpool‚ÄìSaint John service. In May 1920 she was switched again to the Antwerp‚ÄìSouthampton‚ÄìQuebec‚ÄìMontreal route, but by 1922 there were a surplus of ships on this route, and Scandinavian was withdrawn from the service in July that year and laid up at Falmouth for disposal. The following year she was sold for scrap, and in October 1923 she moved to Hamburg for breaking up.

Mayakin was appointed to this position in August 2016, following the retirement of Lieutenant General Valery Khalilov, who would also be killed in the Black Sea in December of that year. His first major event since becoming director of music was conducting the massed bands during the Moscow Victory Day Parade on May 9, 2017. He was born in Moscow in 1969. In his early childhood, he lived near a music school, where he would later be sent at 5 years old to participate in a violin class. In the early 80s, his mother brought home a newspaper with an article about the Moscow Military Music College, which he wanted to be enrolled in. His father however, who was an engineer in the Soviet Army, was hesitant to allow Mayakin to join, as he did not think he wanted to become a military musician. After graduating from the school in 1987, he enrolled in the military department of the Moscow State Conservatory and later the Military University of the Ministry of Defense of Russia, graduating with honors from both institutions.

McAteer accumulated various convictions, and in 2001 was sentenced to life for the 1999 murder of a gangland associate: he had been acquitted of a previous murder charge in 1998. McAteer was a suspect in other crimes, including the 1999 murder of television presenter Jill Dando. Background McAteer was born in Dalmuir, Clydebank, growing up between his birthplace and Easterhouse, Glasgow.The Cartel (Johnson), Chapter 1: The Big Bang By age 11, an impoverished McAteer was robbing purses and handbags to feed himself and his four siblings, all of whom had fractured childhoods and spent time in foster care. Investigative journalist Graham Johnson records McAteer's career as beginning in 1979, when he started to forge links with Glasgow's main drug barons. He attained preferred status as a distributor in Scotland, and developed an even more profitable relationship with the Liverpool Mafia. Aside from drug dealing, McAteer reportedly became involved in arms trafficking, debt collection and protection, and laundered money through his successful used car business.The Cartel (Johnson), Chapter 40: Warren Selkirk According to Johnson and Liverpool Echo crime reporter Tom Duffy, McAteer also worked as a hitman. McAteer was described in the Liverpool Echo as \\"one of Scotland's most feared gangsters\\", while a senior Liverpool detective labelled him \\"extremely dangerous\\". He was known within Merseyside as \\"Mad Jock\\";The Cartel (Johnson), Chapter 23: Repeat \\"Little Hands\\" has been reported as an alternate nickname. McAteer had a nomadic lifestyle, with home bases including Maryhill, Drumchapel and Leicester. He has two children. Criminal history Drug conviction and Bennett trial In 1993, McAteer was arrested while in possession of an abundance of recreational drugs. He represented himself at Glasgow's High Court later that year, but was nevertheless sentenced to five years in prison. While incarcerated at HMP Glenochil in Tullibody, he had conflict with Glaswegian criminal John \\"Jack\\" Bennett, a former associate. According to the family of Bennett, he rejected McAteer's sexual advances, which led to a rift between the two. On 28 February 1998, following both McAteer and Bennett's release from prison, the latter was killed in a daylight attack on Glasgow's Royston Road, incurring 57 stab wounds. McAteer and two other men (Robert Burke and Donald McPhail) stood trial for the murder; the prosecution posited that McAteer had put out a contract while in jail, offering \\"2 oz of tobacco and 50 temazepam tablets\\" to any inmate who killed Bennett. On 10 August a jury at Glasgow's High Court returned a not proven verdict. Shooting arrest and further scrutiny Later in 1998, McAteer was arrested in Merseyside on suspicion of shooting a man at a set of traffic lights in Glasgow: the incident had occurred mere yards from the site of the Bennett murder. He avoided charges when the victim refused to make a formal complaint. McAteer also became a suspect in the 1999 murder of English television presenter Jill Dando. Selkirk murder and additional convictions While in prison, McAteer met Liverpudlian Warren Selkirk, and later enlisted him as a drug courier. By 1999, McAteer reportedly feared that his colleague was becoming a liability, and had particular concerns over his mounting gambling debts. On 30 October, Selkirk was shot five times at Crosby Marina in North Merseyside, while his children waited for him in a nearby car; a plastic bag filled with dog excrement ‚Äì a sign of \\"contempt\\" ‚Äì was found in his right hand. Police traced McAteer travelling from Glasgow to Liverpool by tracking his mobile phone activity, which led to his arrest. McAteer maintained his innocence, and later blamed Liverpool associate Paul Bennett for setting him up.Druglord (Johnson), Chapter 22: Ontop to Death ‚Äì Haase's Second Crime Spree An Irish terrorist group appeared to take responsibility for Selkirk's murder, but police determined that this was a red herring devised by McAteer. According to Observer crime correspondent Tony Thompson, McAteer threatened to shoot multiple police officers as well as anyone who testified against him: at least two criminals were given new identities under the witness protection program in return for their testimony. On 5 April 2001 at Liverpool Crown Court, McAteer was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life. He was given a concurrent five-year term for attempting to pervert the course of justice, with sentencing delayed on a further conviction of plotting to supply ecstasy and heroin. Liverpool criminal David Baker received a four-year sentence for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, for asking an associate to provide McAteer with a false alibi. Glaswegian James O'Neill, who had also been charged with the murder, was exonerated due to a lack of evidence. Six months later, the drug offences ‚Äì for which McAteer and seven others were originally remanded in custody by Liverpool magistrates in February 2000 ‚Äì met with a 16-year sentence. As of September 2002, McAteer was incarcerated at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire. In December 2003, he was refused permission to appeal his murder conviction. Following a 2006 review of the case at London's Royal Courts of Justice, Mr Justice Grigson ruled that McAteer must serve a minimum of 22-and-a-half years before being considered for parole. =Paul Ferris= Former Glasgow gangster Paul Ferris has known McAteer since childhood. In his 2005 book, Vendetta, Ferris protested McAteer's innocence in relation to the murder of Selkirk, suggesting that police pinned the murder to McAteer in order to assuage grief among the city of Liverpool. He argued that McAteer's \\"jealous\\" henchman, George Bell Smith ‚Äì whose ex-girlfriend was now in a relationship with McAteer ‚Äì provided false testimony of his boss indicating guilt (including the brandishing of a gun) in return for having a child sexual abuse charge dropped.Ferris; McKay, Chapter 59: The Nephew McAteer's appeal would have indeed asserted that a key witness had charges against them dismissed after agreeing to give evidence. Ferris found it implausible that McAteer, whom he described as being \\"so cautious as to be almost paranoid\\", would implicate himself in such a way, and concluded that Selkirk was killed by Irish criminals due to unpaid debts. In a 2005 interview he said: \\"It is common knowledge that [McAteer] did not do it. Even the dogs in the street know it... he is being kept inside because of politics and nothing else.\\" Later life In 2011, McAteer, alongside another former Glasgow gangster, Jamie Stevenson, raised ¬£3,776 for Glasgow's Royal Hospital for Sick Children by running a marathon on a treadmill at HMP Shotts in North Lanarkshire. The effort was branded a \\"con\\" by the sister of Jack Bennett: she maintained McAteer's culpability for the murder of her brother.

It was proclaimed \\"the shortest railroad in the world\\" by residents of Stanwood. Route The short, rail line connected the newly built Stanwood depot on the Great Northern Railway with downtown Stanwood. The railroad tracks ran along 271st Street from 102nd Avenue to the depot in East Stanwood on the south side of the street, roughly where the sidewalks are today. History Stanwood was settled in the 1870s and in 1891 received its first station on the Seattle and Montana Railroad, which later merged into the Great Northern Railway. The station was located in the less flood-prone area east of the town, which was on the bank of the Stillaguamish River. A new railway was constructed between the depot and Stanwood in 1904 by local businessman John W. Hall. The railway was operated by John W. Hall (1870‚Äì1931), his wife Alice and later their son Jesse. He ordered a crew to demolish one corner of his stable on Market Street and Saratoga Street to lay the tracks of the H & H Railroad to East Stanwood. From 1904, the \\"Dinky\\" transported passengers and cargo between the town and depot. HC Anderson (1865‚Äì1914) was the main investor and the Stanwood Lumber Company initially the main client of the railway. Occasionally, it was used by children on the way to and from school. By the 1920s, passenger service was eliminated due to competition from automobiles. The railroad ceased operations in 1938 because of the low traffic and the completion of new highways between the two towns.

Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a number of vegetables set on a table. The work is currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It is considered Peale's finest still life.  Description  The painting is a still life, created to allow for an accurate representation of a physical object on a painted canvas.

The incidents surrounding Typhoon Morakot are known as the Eight- Eight Flood (ÂÖ´ÂÖ´Ê∞¥ÁÅΩ). The flooding is the most devastating flooding incident since the flooding caused by Typhoon Ellen in 1959. Typhoon Morakot is most remembered for the destruction of Siaolin Village in Jiasian, Kaohsiung. According to the Government of the Republic of China, 681 people died and 18 people went missing due to the typhoon. The Executive Yuan announced that all flags be placed at half-mast in mourning between August 22 and 24. The government was criticized for reacting slowly to the crisis, causing President Ma Ying-jeou's approval ratings to drop significantly and leading to the resignation of Premier Liu Chao-shiuan  Direct Effects   Nantou County  Provincial Highway 16 collapsed, causing seven cars to be washed into the Zhuoshui River. The most damage done to Nantou County was in Xinyi, which had the greatest rainfall in the county. The currents of the Chenyoulan River caused the foundations of roads and buildings to be wiped away. A building in Longhua Elementary School tilted 30 degrees as a result of the foundations being washed away and was on the verge of falling into the river. Provincial Highway 16 collapsed between Jiji and Shuili, causing seven cars to be washed into the Zhuoshui River. So far, only four out of fifteen bodies have been recovered.  Tainan County  Typhoon Morakot caused Zengwen Reservoir, which was originally short on water, to suddenly exceed capacity. In response to the excess water, the reservoir released over 100,000,000 liters of water, which is about 80% of the dam's total capacity.ÊõæÊñáÊ∞¥Â∫´ Ê∞¥ÊñáË≥áÊñôË°®Ôºå ÂçóÂçÄÊ∞¥Ë≥áÊ∫êÂ±ÄÊõæÊñáÊ∫™ÂñÑÂåñÊÆµÊΩ∞Â†§ ËòáÁÖ•Êô∫Á±≤‰∏≠Â§ÆÂä©Êê∂‰øÆ ÔºåËá™Áî±ÊôÇÂ†± The release of water caused severe flooding along the Zengwen River; in Xiaobei Village in Madou Township, the water level reached a story high.  Kaohsiung County  Cishan Township. Namasia Township. Kaohsiung County saw over 2,500 millimeters of rainfall within three days (Kaohsiung typically receives the same amount of rain in a year). The rain brought severe floods on the plains and landslides in the mountains. On August 14, Xiaolin Village was completely covered due to a landslide, causing the deaths of 398 people. Due to the rain, many bridges were washed away, including those on Provincial Highways 20, 21, and 27 and the bridge to the Maolin National Scenic Area. 14 people went missing after a weir under construction was washed away.  Pingtung County  Jiadong Township. Pingtung County is one of the areas hardest hit by the typhoon. Due to the collapse of embankment along the Linbian River, there was severe flooding in Linbian and Jiadong, with Jiadong reporting flood depths of two stories. Embankments along the Laonong River also collapsed, causing flooding in Gaoshu. A bridge on Provincial Highway 24 collapsed, effectively cutting off Wutai Township from the rest of the country. According to the Water Resources Agency, the area with the highest rainfall was in Wanluan Township with 135 millimeters per hour. The total highest rainfall was recorded in Sandimen Township with over 2500 millimeters. The railways in Pingtung also took a huge hit, with the Pingtung Line taking 6 months to repair. Linbian Train Station's train tracks were entirely covered in mud after severe flooding there.  Taitung County  A broken bridge on the TRA South-link line in Taimali Township. Most of the flooding in Taitung County occurred in the south part of the county, with Daren, Taimali, and Dawu Townships being especially hard hit. Flooding was especially serious in Zhiben Hot Springs, with 200 meters of its main road washed away. On August 9, the Jinshuai Hotel's (ÈáëÂ∏•Ê∫´Ê≥âÂ§ßÈ£ØÂ∫ó) foundations were washed away, and the eight-story hotel toppled over into the Zhiben River. Soon afterward, the top three floors of the hotel were washed away.YouTuBe-ÈáëÂ∏•È£ØÂ∫óÂÄíÂ°åÁï´Èù¢ The TRA South Link Line was also hard hit, with two of its bridges being washed away in Taimali Township. The Taimali River also flooded, destroying a large portion of Taihe Village in Taimali.  Other counties  The embankment along the Zengwen River was damaged. In Chiayi County, embankments along the Bazhang and Puzi rivers collapsed, causing flooding in Puzi Township. Since the coastal areas are lower in elevation, there was also widespread flooding in Dongshi, Budai, and Yizhu. Many villages in Alishan, Meishan, Zhuqi townships saw flooding and destruction done to their infrastructure. The Alishan Forest Railway saw some serious damage, and repairs took about a year. Central and North Taiwan saw some less severe flooding, with the most serious in Dacheng and Erlin in Changhua County.  Losses  ; Agriculture : The Council of Agriculture estimates that a total of $19.217 billion NTD was lost due to the typhoon, making it the second- costliest typhoon behind Typhoon Herb in 1996. Out of this, farms lost $12.9 billion, fisheries lost $4.7 billion, and livestock lost $1.6 billion. ; Roads : Twenty bridges were destroyed due to the typhoon, with eight being on a Provincial Highway.

With the assistance of firefighters and policemen, an estimated 41,752 people were rescued. On August 11, a helicopter delivering aid crashed in the mountains of Pingtung County. All three of its crew were lost.  Aftermath   Domestic Aid  On August 15, the Executive Yuan formed the \\"Typhoon Morakot Rebuilding Committee\\". The 37 person committee was given a budget of $116.5 million NTD to rebuild infrastructure and economic losses. The committee has built 3,481 permanent housing units in 40 locations and repaired most damaged roads. However, there was controversy surrounding the relocation of people to these new housing units. After the flooding, many organizations began raising money for rebuilding in areas affected by the typhoon. Special programs were aired on national TV to fundraise. Additionally, a fundraising festival named \\"Spread the Love\\" was held, featuring prominent TV personalities Matilda Tao, Chang Hsiao-yen, and Shen Chun-hua. The event lasted for 7 hours and was aired on national TV and raised $500 million NTD. Many large corporations also donated money to the cause, including Chi Mei, Evergreen, Delta Electronics, Foxconn, Formosa Plastics, TSMC, Cathay United Bank, and Asus. The Chunghua Post released a special edition stamp, with all proceeds going to helping rebuild.  Chinese Aid  The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits donated a total of $450 million Renminbi ($2 billion RMB) to rebuild. They specified that $150 million TWD be used on building 500 units of recovery housing and $1.7 billion TWD be used on rebuilding infrastructure.

It is situated in Ross Lake National Recreation Area which is part of the North Cascades National Park Complex. The Diablo Lake Overlook along the North Cascades Highway is at the foot of the mountain. The nearest higher peak is Colonial Peak, to the southeast. Precipitation runoff on the east side of the mountain drains into Ross Lake via Ruby Creek, whereas the west side of the mountain drains into Diablo Lake via Thunder Creek. Climate Ruby Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.  Geology  The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Further lines opened to Sandhill (South Launceston) on 27 October 1911, High Street (East Launceston) on 17 January 1914 and Cataract Hill (Hillside Crescent, West Launceston) on 15 May 1915. The King's Bridge line was extended to Trevallyn on 16 July 1912, and the Mowbray line to Racecourse (Mowbray Heights) on 26 January 1916. The King's Wharf line opened on 24 February 1919 to serve Bass Strait steamers. The Sandhill line was extended in 1929 to Carr Villa Cemetery. The Mowbray, Newstead and High Street lines were lengthened 1937, with the network reaching its maximum of 13.8 miles. The King's Wharf line closed in December 1947 when the steamer Taroona began berthing at Beauty Point because of the Tamar River silting. It had only operated on days ships berthed since 1932.

Sioux Falls did not have an entry in the rating because it did not have a flag. The flag of Sioux Falls was designed in 2014 by Max Rabkin. It was chosen as the winner of a design competition for both the \\"Best in Show\\" by a panel of experts and the \\"People's Choice\\" award. The city officially adopted the flag in 2018. Design The flag of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, has a 3:5 ratio and consists of: * a zigzag pattern of thin white and blue lines. This pattern represents the namesake falls of the Big Sioux River. The falls run in an ascending direction which represents the growth of Sioux Falls. * an upper blue portion that alludes to the blue field on the flag of South Dakota. * a yellow sun in the upper left corner. This sun is a symbol from the flag of South Dakota because the state was formerly nicknamed \\"The Sunshine State\\". * a lower pinkish-red portion over which the falls run. This represents the Sioux Quartzite quarried nearby and used to build early Sioux Falls buildings. This quartzite is recognized as part of the city's heritage and was used in the construction of almost all of the important early buildings including the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse, Old Minnehaha County Courthouse and the Carnegie Free Public Library. The local quarries were used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and the stone was not used for building after the quarries closed in the 1920s. The red, white and blue colors included in the flag are also a reference to the flag of the United States while maintaining city and state pride. History A flag of Sioux Falls flying in Downtown Sioux Falls, with a flag of South Dakota in the background In 2004, the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) rated the design of flags from the 100 largest cities in the U.S., all 50 state capitals and at least two cities per state. Sioux Falls was not included in the rating because it did not have a flag, but the mayor, Dave Munson, did not know why it did not. In 2014, a design conference hosted by OTA, an organization that connects creative communities in the \\"-ota\\" states (South Dakota, North Dakota and Minnesota), was held at the Washington Pavilion in Sioux Falls. The invited speaker Roman Mars noted that Sioux Falls was one of only three major U.S. cities (along with Fargo, North Dakota, and Hilo, Hawaii) not to have an official flag. OTA combined with the Sioux Falls Design Center and the American Institute of Graphic Arts to form The Committee to Establish a Suitable Flying Banner for the City of Sioux Falls (CESFBCSF) to design a flag for the city. The CESFBCSF held a public design contest and 91 entries were submitted. One flag won both the \\"Best in Show\\" by a panel of experts and the \\"People's Choice\\" award from over 3000 community votes. The designer, Max Rabkin, released the flag to the public domain. Ted Kaye, a vexillological expert and president of NAVA, stated that the design would be considered one of the best city flags in the U.S. The CESFBCSF tried multiple times to go to the city council and wrote them a letter to adopt the flag, but the city council had little interest. In 2016 the flag was introduced to the city council and former mayor, Mike Huether, but the council was busy with other issues. The CESFBCSF thought that the cost would be a potential issue and offered to pay for flags, but there was still no interest. Despite a lack of interest from the city council and mayor, there was a grassroots support- building effort to build community interest, which led local media to call it \\"The People's Flag\\". Local media identified the flag as a symbol of the community and it was displayed at homes, businesses and even a local march. Downtown businesses contributed to the grassroots effort through flag-related sales. There was a renewed push to get the flag approved in 2018 after the election of a new mayor, Paul Ten Haken. The council had concerns the flag would not have copyright protection, but it was argued that a flag in the public domain would be for all people. The city officially adopted the flag when it was approved unanimously by the Sioux Falls City Council on July 10, 2018. By November 2018, the flag was being flown in front of city buildings and inside the mayor's office. Local businesses and organizations have embraced the flag by creating flag merchandise. The flag has appeared on t-shirts of local businesses, on the jersey of the Sioux Falls Skyforce professional basketball team, and even on a Metallica concert graphic.

Bert Adams is located south of Covington, Georgia, situated on Lake Bulow Campbell; the camp is one of three major BSA summer camps in the Atlanta Area Council. The reservation is named after Albert S. \\"Bert\\" Adams, a \\"beloved leader in the city of Atlanta\\", and the president of what was then called the \\"Atlanta Council of the Boy Scouts\\", during the 1920s. Bert Adams has consistently been listed as one of the best scout camps in the United States by Boys Life and Scouting Magazines.  History   Camp Friendly  Early proposals for a new summer camp in the council began as early as summer of 1916, however, the United States entry into World War I delayed any potential progress on these proposals. After the war concluded, one of the original proposers of a new summer camp, Mr. Roland Shine, directed a temporary summer camp, Camp Friendly, which acted as a placeholder until a new permanent camp could be established. After some time, though \\"successful as a summer event\\", Camp Friendly, did not fully meet the needs and goals of the council, and was cancelled after its 1922 season.  First Permanent Camp  = Construction = After the closing of Camp Friendly, a representative of the council and advocator for the building of a new summer camp, Richard Darby, began the search for a location for a permanent camp. The property he settled upon was located in Vinings, about 11 miles (17.7 Kilometers) north of Atlanta. The plats the site was located on then were then purchased one by one by Albert \\"Bert\\" Adams (the president of the Atlanta Area Council, and the later namesake of the camp) and the Adams-Cates Realty Company, and began the building of the camp. After the land purchase was completed, sporadic and unorganized construction of the camp began shortly after. A dam was constructed on a creek running through the property, with the resulting 1.3 acre lake being named after Richard Darby, in recognition of his work in championing the idea of building a new camp. Though parts of the camp were still being built at the time, the core of the camp began welcoming scouts in the autumn of 1925. Much to the sadness of the council and Scouters throughout Central and North Georgia, Albert \\"Bert\\" Adams died in December 1926, before the construction on the camp could be completed. Shortly thereafter, Chairman Law of the Atlanta Area Council Executive Board proposed that the new camp, once completed, be named in his honor. The proposal was approved by the Council Executive Board unanimously. Due to Adams' death, financial troubles early on, and the slow and relatively unorganized rate of construction, the completion of the building of the camp missed its summer of 1926 deadline. A large campaign in order to raise the remaining $75,000 1926 USD (the equivalent of $1.08 Million USD in 2018), began in February 1927. The campaign was hugely successful and its goal was met on April 3 of that same year. On April 3, 1927, a groundbreaking ceremony for what would become the main structure of the camp, a 60 x 100 foot (~19 x 33 meters) dining hall, was conducted by the son of Albert Adams, Life Scout Albert S. Adams Jr. = Dedication = On June 11, 1927, the camp was officially dedicated and opening with a grand opening ceremony. Many of the general public from cities throughout the Atlanta area were in attendance. Among guests of particular note would include, Governor Clifford Walker, Atlanta Mayor I.N. Ragsdale, and Chief Scout Executive James E. West. In his address, West indicated that Atlanta was one of only a few councils at that time to own any overnight camping facilities. = Relocation = The camp continued operation at that site for 33 years, until 1960, when a new larger site was found, and moved to.  Current Permanent Camp  Following the 1960 summer season, with the original camp facilities growing old and falling to disrepair, a new site was chosen just south of Covington, Georgia. This site has been the location of the camp since that time. The current camp has received multiple commendations and awards from various scouting magazines for its layout, events, camp staff, and facilities. 2018 Accident On June 25, 2018, a severe weather storm came into the camp. Elijah Knight (14 at the time), went to his tent with two of his friends, seeking shelter from the storm. Minutes later, a tree came crashing down on their tent, crushing Elijah. The other two boys escaped unharmed. Elijah was found dead just minutes after.  Climate   Weather  Due to the camp's location in the North Georgia region of the American South, the camp often sees moderate to severe weather. This particularly includes thunderstorms and rain. In order to counter this, the council has several safety precautions and campwide alarms in place in an attempt to prevent incident. In June 2018, there was an incident where a Scout was killed as a result of a tree falling on the Scout's tent after severe storm force winds pushed the tree down.  Fauna  An American Copperhead (this picture taken particularly at the entrance to the camp) White Tailed Deer, similar to those found in and near the camp The camp is a native home to many of the same animals that are native to both Central and North Georgia. In the case of land animals, this includes, but is not limited to: Brown Bears, White Tailed Deer, American Copperhead, and the Cottonmouth. Deer are particularly prevalent, and can be found once or twice in any given week. In addition, the lake, Lake Bulow Campbell is home to several species of freshwater fish. Fishing is allowed on a catch-and-release practice.

Operations started with a test mine in 1887. From 1891 to 1933, the business was registered as a Swedish company called Sulitelma Aktiebolags Gruber. From 1933 to 1983, it was registered as a Norwegian company called A/S Sulitjelma Gruber, and from 1983 until it was shut down in 1991 the company was state- owned and was named Sulitjelma Bergverk AS. Chalcopyrite was found by the Sami Mons Andreas Petersen around 1858, but due to the very remote location of the place there was skepticism that the deposits could be commercially viable. It was only when the Swedish industrialist and consul Nils Persson gained interest in the ore deposits in 1886 that progress was made in developing mining in Sulitelma. The company Sulitelma Aktiebolags Gruber was founded in 1891. That same year, the narrow-gauge Sulitjelma Line was built. Until 1956, copper and semi-finished products were transported by train and steamship to the port at Finneid. Transport was an expensive part of the operations throughout the history of the mining company. Several technical innovations and inventions were made at Sulitjelma, including the Knudsen process and some of the world's first electric copper smelters. Later in the history of the works many other improvements were made, especially in concentrating ore and smelting. In the early 1900s, Sulitjelma Mines was the second-largest industrial company in Norway. Sulitjelma was initially an isolated mountain village inhabited by pioneer settlers, but the population increased rapidly in pace with mining, from about 50 around 1890 to almost 3,000 in 1910. The living conditions for the workers were very primitive, and the work conditions were difficult and hazardous to health. The class differences between workers, foremen, and officials were noticeable. After the large-scale assembly on the ice of Long Lake (Langvatnet) on January 13, 1907, when the first labor association was founded, conditions gradually improved. During the Second World War, Sulitjelma Mines was considered to be so important for the German war industry that production had to be maintained at all costs. Although the Gestapo knew that employees were engaged in illegal activities, they failed to intervene because they feared that the arrest of key personnel would impact production. The upswing after the Second World War turned to uncertainty when copper prices fell sharply in 1975. The weakened profitability that followed led to economizing operations and dismissals. Then there was also a need for large investments in the old plant. Among other things, pollution from the smelting hut had become an increasing problem that could only be solved with a costly treatment plant. Remedial measures were taken, but these were subsequently considered unsuccessful. Mining ceased in 1991. In its approximately 100 years of operation, six million tons of metal and sulfur were extracted. Most of this was sulfur. The remainder was 0.47 million tons of copper, 215 tons of zinc, 282 tons of silver, and 3.7 tons of gold.

It is protected by the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness within the Okanogan National Forest. Reynolds Peak has a subsidiary peak, North Peak (elevation ), which is north of the summit. The nearest higher peak is Oval Peak, to the southeast. Precipitation runoff on the east side of the mountain drains into the Twisp River via Reynolds Creek, whereas the west side of the mountain drains into the Stehekin River via Boulder Creek. Climate Lying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Reynolds Peak is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. With its impressive height, Reynolds Peak can have snow on it in late-Spring and early-Fall, and can be very cold in the winter. Geology Courtney Peak The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

The object number of cultural heritage of regional significance is 661720820900005.  Architecture  The residential complex has a significant historical and architectural value. It represents one of the variants of the socialist town. It was actively developed by the architectors of constructivism. The complex had been being constructed for a long time. It has an integral urban planning composition. The elements of —Åonstructivism and Soviet neoclassicism combine in the architectural design of the buildings. The complex is located in the northern part of Kamensk-Uralsky, in the Sinarsky district, near the Sinarsky Pipe Works. The specialists of \\"SiraStroy\\" developed a plan for socialist city in 1932. In the construction used new building methods: line and quarter buildings, wide green lines and a network of cultural and domestic facilities. In the initial plan, the city occupied a smaller area, compared to the final one. Street Trubnaya was central, divided the complex into two blocks and led through the park to the entrance of the plant. Karl Marx Street divided the complex into the eastern (residential) and western (park) zones. During the construction period of 1935-1940-ies the final volume-planning structure of the central part of the complex was formed. The square named after Belyaev is a center and a guide for the hotel, the palace of culture, shops and apartment buildings. During the construction, the zoning of the neighborhood was observed: in the north and south-west residential areas, in the north-east educational buildings, in the southeast public buildings of culture and recreation, the stadium and sports courts. From the south to the square there is a wide Karl Marx street, on which there is a shopping arcade. The farm buildings are hidden inside the blocks. On a red line of streets regular rectangular quarters leave. The corners of the blocks are accented by higher corner buildings. Residential quarters have their own internal composition axes that strictly symmetrically organize space. On the inner axes, as a rule, children's institutions are located. Much attention was paid to the primary spatial element of the living environment - the courtyard. Yards were small in size, with a closed or semi-closed character, were decorated with sculptures and small architectural forms: fountains, decorative fences (now lost). The structure of the residential complex included public buildings: a hotel with a dining room, a boiler room, six kindergartens, two schools, a club, a stadium, an ice court, a bath, a hospital, a built-in station for young technicians, a covered market, built-in shops and a pharmacy.

Circuit Road and Serpentine Drive in Schenley Park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The spring was built in 1906-1907 and is one of only three remaining springs within the city.  History  The first record of the natural spring in this location comes from an 1890 visitation of the park, and it describes the spring as extremely abundant in water.‚ÄúWild Indian Stories.‚Äù The Pittsburgh Press, June 12, 1890. However, there was no mention of a structure at the location until 1899 when a small stone alcove is described there.‚ÄúSketches at the Springs.‚Äù The Pittsburgh Press, May 14, 1899. The idea for the current fountain at the location was conceived following Fourth of July celebrations in 1906. The fund that had been for the celebrations had leftover money, and the donors chose to spend some of it erecting a new fountain in Schenley Park. James W. Clark, who was the Director of Public Works, approved the idea, and by September 1906 designs for the fountain were completed and published.‚ÄúDrinking Fountain in the Park will Recall Indian Days.‚Äù Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, September 23, 1906. Clark had been born into a prominent family in Washington, Pennsylvania, and had worked his way up through a career in public service, and he was the one who chose the subject matter for the fountain.‚ÄúDirector J.W. Clark is Dead.‚Äù Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, February 11, 1907. The man Clark chose to memorialize on the front fa√ßade of the spring was the Native American Shawnee Chief, Catahecassa. Chief Catahecassa claimed to be present at General Braddock‚Äôs defeat against the French during the French and Indian War after the failed British attempt to capture Fort Duquesne. He also fought at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, and was the Shawnee representative during the 1795 Treaty of Greenville signing, which ended hostilities between Native Americans and European-American settlers in Ohio.Hurt, R. Douglas. The Ohio Frontier: Crucible of the Old Northwest, 1720-1830. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1996. In the early 19th century Catahecassa was also known for his peace work as an avid proponent of adopting the customs of settlers, and adjusting Shawnee society into an agrarian one. He also refused to join with Tecumseh and Tecumseh‚Äôs War, instead choosing to lead his people away from confrontation.‚ÄúCatahecassa,‚Äù Ohio History Central, June 27, 2016, http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Catahecassa. The fountain in Schenley Park was meant as a memorial to his historical legacy in the region, and it was completed and installed by May of 1907. The only significant alteration to the spring since then was an act of vandalism in December of 1928, in which the vandals demolished the tip of Catahecassa‚Äôs nose.‚ÄúVandals Ruin Effigy.‚Äù Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 17, 1928. That portion of the nose has since been replaced with concrete. The spring was nominated in January of 2016 to become a City Historic Landmark by Preservation Pittsburgh.  Architecture  The Catahecassa monument was done using Realism as its architectural style. The fountain itself is made of roughly-hewn granite stele. It also has a bas- relief bust of Chief Catahecassa on the front, making it the only natural spring which has been fronted with a decorative, bas-relief stele. The relief is situated above a bronze plaque which reads: \\"Catahecassa, Blackhoof, war chief of the Shawnees, was present at the defeat of Braddock in 1755 and took part in all subsequent wars until the treaty of Greenville in 1795, after which he remained a friend and ally of the United States.\\"  Gallery  File:Catahecassa Spring.jpgPhoto from 1922 of Catahecassa Spring File:Catahecassa Spring 2.jpgPhoto from 1912 of Catahecassa Spring with car and family in front File:Ca-Ta-He-Cas-Sa, Black Hoof, Principal Chief of the Shawannes (15251349593).jpgPhoto of Catahecassa  References  Category:Fountains in Pennsylvania ","title":"Catahecassa (Snyder) Spring"},{"id":"57890109","text":"Malvern Community School District (MCSD) was a school district headquartered in Malvern, Iowa.

The title \\"Priyadasi\\" appears repeatedly in the ancient inscriptions known as the Major Rock Edicts or the Major Pillar Edicts, where it is generally used in conjunction with the title \\"Devanampriya\\" (\\"Beloved of the Gods\\") in the formula \\"Devanampriya Priyadasi\\".

Prinsep had originally identified Priyadasi with the King of Ceylon Devanampiya Tissa. However, in 1837, George Turnour discovered a Siamese version of the Sri Lankan manuscript Dipavamsa, or \\"Island Chronicle\\", associating Piyadasi with the early Maurya dynasty: It was then supposed that this Priyadasi, being a Mauryan, was probably the Ashoka of Buddhist accounts. Because of the association in the Dipavamsa, the title \\"Priyadasi\\" is thought to have been used by the Indian Emperor Ashoka (r.269-233 BCE) in his inscriptions (the Edicts of Ashoka).

The Tulabhara is mentioned as one of the sixteen great gifts in the ancient texts, and is performed in several parts of India.  Names  The Atharvaveda-parishishta uses the name \\"tula-purusha- vidhi\\" to describe the ceremony. The Matsya Purana calls it \\"tula-purusha- dana\\", while the Linga Purana calls it by various names such as \\"tula-purusha- dana\\", \\"tuladhirohana\\", \\"tularoha\\", and \\"tulabhara\\". Majority of the ancient inscriptions that record the ceremony are written in Sanskrit language; some of them are in Tamil and Kannada, and some later inscriptions also feature Telugu language. The early Sanskrit-Tamil inscriptions from Tamil Nadu and Sinhala-Tamil inscriptions from Sri Lanka used the name \\"tula-bhara\\" (literally \\"weighing on the scales\\") to describe the ceremony. The Sanskrit inscriptions from other regions, the Kannada inscriptions, and the Puranas generally use the name \\"tula-purusha\\" and its variants. \\"Tula-purusha\\" is the most common name for the ceremony in the historical records. The longer forms are \\"tula-purusha-dana\\" or \\"tula-purusha-mahadana\\", which are sometimes abbreviated as \\"tula-dana\\" (the words \\"dana\\" and \\"mahadana\\" mean \\"donation\\" and \\"great donation\\" respectively). The 13th century inscriptions from Tamil Nadu also use the terms \\"tularohana\\" (or \\"tularoha\\") and \\"tuladhiroha-vidhi\\" (or \\"tuladhirohana\\") for the ceremony.  Description  A Tulabhara mandapa at the Bhoga Nandeeshwara Temple The Matsya Purana provides several requirements for a tula-purusha ceremony, including directions for constructing the mandapa (pavilion) required for the ceremony. It states that the weighing scale (tula) should have two posts and a crossbeam, made from the same wood, and should be ornamented with gold. The text further states that the ceremony should be officiated by eight priests (rtvij), two for each of the four Vedas. A man knolwedgable about the Vedanta, the Puranas, and the Shastras, should be appointed as the preceptor (guru). Four homas should be offered to the deities, accompanied by the recital of Vedic hymns. After the homa ceremony, the guru should invoke the Lokapalas (deities associated with directions) with flowers, incense, and recital of mantras. Next, the brahmanas should bathe the donor, and have him wear a white garment. The donor should wear garlands made of white flowers, and circumambulate the weighing scale with flowers in his folded hands. Finally, the text states, the donor should step into one of the pans of the weighing scale, and the brahmanas should place pure gold pieces of equal weight in the other pan. After invoking the Goddess Earth, the donor should give half the gold to the guru, and the rest to the brahmanas. The donor may also grant villages to the priests. The donor should \\"honour the brahmanas, other respectable people, and the poor and the helpless with gifts\\". The Linga Purana gives a similar description, and adds that the gold pieces should be dedicated to the god Shiva.  History  The Atharvaveda-parishishta, composed in the 1st millennium BCE, describes tula- purusha, besides other sacrifices such as the hiranya-garbha (the donation of a golden vessel) and gosahasra (the donation of a thousand cows). A section of the later text Matsya Purana mentions the tula-purusha ceremony as the first and the best among the sixteen great gifts (maha-danas). According to scholar R. C. Hazara, this particular section was composed during 550-650 CE. The Linga Purana also mentions the sixteen great donations; according to R. C. Hazara, the relevant portion of the text was composed during c. 600-1000 CE, most probably after 800 CE. These donations are also described in the later digests devoted to the topic of charity (dƒÅna), such as Ballala's Dana-sagara, and the Danakhanda section of Hemadri's Chaturvarga-chintamani (13th century).  Performances  18th century king Marthanda Varma participating in a tulabhara ceremony A tulabhara donation of bananas in progress at the Chottanikkara Temple temple in Kerala  Legendary  Several legendary performances of Tulabhara are mentioned in the ancient Indian texts. For example, in the Mahabharata, King Shibi, a descendant of King Bharata of the Lunar dynasty, was tested by Lord Dharmaraja and Agni. They approached Shibi in the forms of an eagle and a dove. The dove sought Shibi's protection from the eagle, who asked Shibi to give his flesh measure for measure in exchange for the dove's life. Shibi, ready to offer anything to save the dove, began slice off bits of himself. Even after much cutting, the balance scales did not move, and when at last when Shibi himself stood on the scale of the balance, the Gods appeared to him and blessed him.  Historical  Several inscriptions of India mention the historical performances of the tula-purusha. The earliest of these inscriptions are from the present-day Tamil Nadu (7th-8th century) and Maharashtra-Karnataka region (8th-9th century). It is possible that the tula-purusha ceremony traveled from the southern Pandya kingdom of Tamil Nadu to Maharashtra-Karnataka, which was ruled by the Rashtrakutas. It may have subsequently spread to other neighbouring areas, such as Madhya Pradesh (from Maharashtra), Andhra Pradesh (from Karnataka), and Sri Lanka (from Tamil Nadu). Notable performers include: * Pandya kings (7th-8th century), in Tamil Nadu ** Jayantavarman alias Cendan (c. 7th century), according to one of his inscriptions, performed tulabhara along with hiranyagarbha and gosahasra. ** An inscription of the Pandya king Varaguna I (r. c. 768-811) states that his father and grandfather made these three donations many times. ** It is stated in the Tamil work Koyilolugu that Jatavarman Sundara Pandya (r. c. 1250‚Äì1268) constructed several tulapurusha mandapas in Srirangam temple and performed tulabhara there. * Rashtrakuta kings (8th-10th century), in Maharashtra-Karnataka region ** Dantidurga donated a village to a brahmana on the occasion of a tulabhara performance according to an inscription discovered in the Kolhapur district. ** Govinda III (c. 800) performed a tulabhara ceremony at Mayurakhandi on the occasion of a solar eclipse. ** Amoghavarsha I (c. 862) also performed a tulabhara ceremony during a solar eclipse. ** Indra III (c. 915) performed tulabhara on the occasion of his coronation, and granted villages to brahmanas and Jain monasteries. ** Govinda IV performed at least three tulabharas during c. 929-930, to mark his coronation and that of his queen. ** A vassal of Amoghavarsha III celebrated tulabhara in 937. * Pallava kings (9th century), in Tamil Nadu ** Viramahadevi (c. 891), a queen of the Pallava ruler Nrpatungavarman performed tulapurusha and hiranyagarbha ceremony in a Mahadeva temple. * Chola kings (10th-11th century), in Tamil Nadu ** Parantaka I (r. c. 907-955) made tulabhara, hemagarbha and other donations according to an inscription of his Ganga vassal Prithvipati II. ** During the ruler of Rajaraja I (r. c. 985-1016) a temple for performing tulabhara (tulavara-shri- koyil) existed at Uttiramerur. Around 1013, Rajaraja held a tulabhara ceremony at the Mahadeva temple of Tiruvishalur, where his consort Lokamahadevi simultaneously performed a hiranyagarbha donation. * Amma I of the Vengi Chalukya dynasty performed a tulabhara annually during his seven-year-long reign. * Dhanga (r. c. 950-999 CE) of Chandela dynasty claimed to have performed hundreds of tulapurusha rituals, in his Khajuraho inscription. * The Gwalior inscription of the Kachchhapaghata king Mahipala states that one of his ancestors celebrated tulapurusha in the 10th century. * Yashahkarna (r. c. 1073-1123 CE) of Kalachuri dynasty, according to his inscriptions. * Chalukyas of Kalyani ** Jayasimha III, a member of the younger brother and a vassal of the Kalyani Chalukya king Vikramaditya VI (r. 1076 ‚Äì 1126 CE). ** Jayakeshin II of Kadamba family, another vassal of Vikramaditya VI ** Hoysala kings (10th-14th century), including Vishnuvardhana and his successors Emperor Jahangir weighing his son Prince Khurram (the future Shah Jahan) on a weighing scale, by artist Manohar (AD 1615). * Chandradeva (r. c. 1089‚Äì1103 CE) of Gahadavala dynasty. According to his inscriptions, \\"the earth was discoloured hundreds of times by the scales\\" when he donated gold worth his own weight to the brahmanas. His Chandravati inscription records a village grant after the performance of tulapurusha and gosahasra before an image of the god Adi- keshava (Vishnu). * The Shilahara king Gandaraditya celebrated tulapurusha, according to the inscriptions of his grandson Bhoja II. * Vilasadevi, the queen of king Vijaya Sena (r. c. 1098-1160) of Sena dynasty, during the king's 32nd regnal year. * Jayachandra (r. c. 1170-1194 CE) of Gahadavala dynasty: his Kamauli grant inscription states that he performed a tula-purusha before the god Krittivasa (Shiva). * Chandeshvara, a minister of the king of Mithila: according to his own writings, he conquered Nepal and performed a tula-purusha in c. 1314 CE (Shaka year 1236). * Tulabhara mandapas are two small four pillared found in temples like Sri Varadharajaswami temple, Kanchi where Vijayanagar king Achyutaraya performed Muladhara in 1532. * The rulers of Travancore, until as late as the 19th century, performed tula-purusha and hiranya-garbha immediately ascending the throne to legitimize their claim to power. The Islamic Mughal rulers also appear to have borrowed the tula-dana practice from the Hindu rulers. According to emperor Akbar's courtier Abu'l-Fazl, Akbar was weighed against gold and other valuable items twice every year. English visitors such as Thomas Coryat and Thomas Roe mention that the custom was followed by his son Jahangir as well. Jahangir's successor Aurangzeb discontinued the practice for himself, but his sons were apparently weighed against objects to be donated, upon recovery from illness. This is suggested by the writings of the European travelers Niccolao Manucci, Jean- Baptiste Tavernier, and Fran√ßois Bernier. In 2015, the Sri Lankan prime minister Ranil Wickramasinghe participated in a tulabharam ceremony at the Guruvayur Temple, and offered 77 kg of sandalwood worth approximately 850,000 to the temple.

The assassination of one of the magicians from the Order, Eddie Lisowski, alerts the Magic Order, whose members then deduce that an unknown enemy is intent on picking them off one by one. Leonard Moonstone and his son Regan, as well as other members of the Magic Order, attend the Ceremony of the Broken Wand at Lisowski's funeral. Madame Albany and her allies of magician appear and antagonize the other funeral attendants. Regan accuse Albany of being the mastermind behind Lisowski's assassination as she proceed to leave the ceremony. The unknown assassin attacks another member of the Order, Dong-Sun. While Regan visits his brother Gabriel, a powerful magician who has left the magic world, to request assistance; although to no avail; the rest of the Order including Leonard's reckless, alcoholic, escapologist daughter Cordelia, held a meeting at Moonstone Castle, a castle hidden in an oil painting exhibited in the Art Institute of Chicago guarded by Uncle Edgar. The members suspect Madame Albany's intent to retrieve the Orichalcum, an indestructible magic tome containing the dark spells of Old Atlantis, so powerful it is said to cause two World Wars and are able to slay a deity. The tome was left to Leonard by his uncle, Conrad, on the condition that it should never be opened. The members are then alerted by a break-in at the Vault. Regan and Cordelia investigate the break-in to find the Horologium, a time-eater from the fourth dimension, and a Soul Camera stolen. Madame Albany and his her mysterious assassin, the Venetian, continue their attack by assassinating three members of the Order, Willie, Edith the Librarian, and Moe. Regan and Cordelia continue to seek information regarding Madam Albany's assassin after interrogating a lowlife magician named Rufus. Meanwhile, Leonard visits Gabriel to seek help fighting the new threat. Gabriel refused, and it is then revealed that his daughter Rosetta was killed in an accident involving his magic wand, which traumatized him and his wife, prompting him to leave the magic world behind. At her hideout in the Black Kingdom, Madame Albany continue to perfect her plan to destroy the Magic Order and proof them wrong. It is revealed that Albany is enraged after her father, the wizard Conrad, decided to inherit the Orichalcum to Leonard instead of her due to the fact that she is dangerously unstable. One night at the Coliseum Theater, where the Moonstones have work as professional stage magicians for years, he is approached by the Venetian. After a brief struggle, the Venetian unleash a magical monster called Theonoba to brutally finish Leonard. Following their father's death Regan and Cornelia was advised by Uncle Edgar to attempt negotiation with Madame Albany at Abington Hotel, a wizards only hotel existing outside time and space. Although the siblings offer peaceful resolutions, Albany aggressively threatens to destroy them and the entirety of the Magic Order. She then proceeds to inform them that Gabriel is currently being targeted by the Venetian. Gabriel, realizing that his neighborhood is being attacked by the Horoglobin, use his magic to save his wife Louise, defeat the creature, and trap it as his siblings arrive. The three siblings deliver Louise to the Moonstone Castle for protection, and decide to hunt for Madame Albany and her allies. They interrogate Angus, Madame Albany's gatekeeper, for the information regarding Madame Albany's whereabouts before trapping him within the magical version of the book \\"The Island of Doctor Moreau\\". The siblings proceed to Madame Albany's hideout at the Charles Laughton Theater in Los Angeles, where they shared their most painful memories in order to enter the Black Kingdom. They eventually corner and presumably outnumber her. Gabriel, much to Cordelia's shock, killed Regan under Madame Albany's instruction. At the same time, Louise, who turns out to be Madame Albany's shapeshifting henchman Lord Cornwall tasked to infiltrate the castle and retrieve the Orichalcum, incapacitate Uncle Edgar while the real Louise waits for Gabriel, accompanied by Albany's allies. Gabriel then states that the attack on him was a charade, revealing himself as the Venetian. Gabriel worked with Madame Albany, who promised to resurrect his daughter in exchange for his help to obtain the Orichalcum and destroy the Magic Order. Cordelia, seemingly outnumbered by Albany and her allies, revealed that she had memorized the entirety of the tome and use the spells to resurrect the dead members of the Order, including Regan and Leonard, while sacrificing Albany's allies to do so. Back at the Moonstone Castle, Uncle Edgar confronts Lord Cornwall. He tried to strike again, but is quickly obliterated by Uncle Edgar, who revealed himself to actually be a powerful deity intentionally trapping himself within the Castle. Leonard, after an intense battle, managed to kill Madame Albany. An enraged Gabriel overpower the Magic Order members, demanding they surrender so he can have his daughter back, until Cordelia offers Gabriel to sacrifice himself to resurrect his daughter. Gabriel accept, and he dies as his daughter is resurrected.

The building was granted the status of regional significance on the 28th of December 2001 (the Sverdlovsk oblast Government Decree ‚Ññ 859). The object number of cultural heritage of regional significance is 661710983730005.  History  The first wooden church was bought from Travyanskoye village and set in 1849. The building was renovated several times in the early 20th century. Later was decided to build a stone church. The document stated that the church was closed in 1936. During the Soviet period the church didn't function and stood abandoned. A new stone church was located in the south-eastern part of the town in Volkovo village (nowadays it is a microdistrict). The building was constructed in 1914-1916 in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Victory in the Patriotic War of 1812. It was consecrated in 1916. One of the first priests was Eugene Landyshev. He was arrested in 1917: \\"Fr. (Father) Eugene is the publisher of a reference book for priests. He gives instructions how to deal with socialism, and also criticizes Bebel \\". Divine services were stopped in 1936. The building was used as a grain storehouse, later as the builders' offices of the Ural Aluminum Combine and Krasnogorskaya Cogeneration. By decision of the Council for Religious Affairs under the Council of Ministers of the USSR, the church was again returned to believers in 1987. During this time the church came to desolation and was almost destroyed. Since 1988, the restoration is underway, the domes and gilded crosses are restored to their places, the interior painting is being restored. Regular services are held. On the 2nd of April 1988 the church was consecrated by Melchizedek, Archbishop of Sverdlovsk and Kurgan. There is a Sunday church and parish school for children and a library.

Scott Robert Franz, Rosemary's son by a previous marriage, was convicted of the murder of Alfred, his stepfather. Franz's high school friend Bruce Anthony Curtis, a Canadian citizen who was visiting the Podgis home, was convicted of the aggravated manslaughter of Rosemary. Both were sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. The crime attracted significant public attention in Canada, where supporters of Curtis ‚Äì whose defense was that the killing of Rosemary Podgis was accidental ‚Äì believed he had not received a fair trial or sentence in the United States, and successfully lobbied for his repatriation to Canada to serve out his sentence in the Canadian prison system. The case became the subject of a book and a television film. Background On June 29, 1982, Bruce Curtis flew from his home in Canada to the U.S., having been invited by his American friend, Scott Franz, to spend time at Franz's home in Loch Arbour, New Jersey. The two teenagers (both born 1964) had met at King's-Edgehill, a private Canadian boarding school in Windsor, Nova Scotia, where they had recently graduated. Franz was living with his mother Rosemary (aged 56) and stepfather Alfred (\\"Al\\") Podgis (aged 58), Rosemary's second husband. Al Podgis was a mail carrier who owned a number of guns. Curtis was the adopted son of Alice and Jim Curtis, a Canadian Air Force officer, who had paid for Bruce's trip to New Jersey as a graduation gift. Fatal shootings During Curtis's stay, Franz had a number of heated arguments with Al Podgis. According to later trial testimony, Podgis possessed a violent temper, which led Franz and Curtis to seek protection by arming themselves with rifles from Podgis's gun collection. On the morning of July5, 1982, Franz shot and killed Al Podgis in an upstairs bedroom. Moments later downstairs, Rosemary Podgis was shot dead by a rifle carried by Curtis, who maintained he had accidentally discharged the firearm while attempting to flee the house after hearing the gunshot upstairs. After the shootings, Franz and Curtis made a decision to conceal the homicides and flee the scene rather than notify authorities. They attempted to clean the house of bloodstains, and loaded the Podgises' bodies into Al's van. The two youths drove interstate to Clinton County, Pennsylvania, where they disposed of the two bodies in a ravine. They then drove to Texas, intending to seek out one of Franz's sisters there. In the meantime, police had begun a search for the Podgises, Franz, and Curtis after another sister of Franz reported them missing. Following the discovery of the Podgises' bodies in Clinton County, Franz and Curtis were arrested on July 10 at a motel in Richardson, Texas. Both were charged with murder. Trial The nine-day trial took place in New Jersey in March 1983. Franz pleaded guilty to the murder of Al Podgis as part of a plea bargain whereby he testified against Curtis, who pleaded not guilty to the charge of murdering Rosemary Podgis. The jury found Curtis guilty of the lesser crime of aggravated manslaughter. He was acquitted of a separate charge of stealing Al Podgis's van. Franz and Curtis both received the same sentence: 20 years imprisonment with a minimum non-parole period of 10 years. Aftermath Curtis's family in Canada, believing he should have received a significantly lighter sentence than Franz, began a high-profile campaign to have Curtis's sentence reduced or overturned. When these appeals were rejected, his supporters successfully lobbied to have him repatriated to Canada to serve out his sentence there. In May 1988, Curtis was transferred from New Jersey to a Canadian prison in Kingston, Ontario. Canadian authorities granted him day parole in July 1989, and full parole in 1990. In March 1992, Scott Franz escaped from custody for two weeks after he and a fellow inmate absconded from a New Jersey halfway house and fled to the West Coast. They were apprehended in San Marino, California, and were returned to prison in New Jersey. Franz later obtained parole in 1996. Social Security records indicate he died in Trenton, New Jersey on August 4, 1997. Book and TV film In 1986, Canadian author David Hayes published a book about the case, No Easy Answers: The Trial and Conviction of Bruce Curtis (reprinted in the U.S. as Blood Knot). A Canadian television film directed by Graeme Campbell, Journey into Darkness: The Bruce Curtis Story (screened in the U.S. as Deadly Betrayal), was released in 1991.

History  The land was granted to Henry Osborne in 1837. The following year Osborne sold the property to James Robinson who was Osborne's neighbour in the Illawarra region. Robinson was subsequently the first to settle in the Tumbarumba region. Robinson and his wife raised eight daughters and one son. The son later managed the property after Robinsons death in 1868. Most of the daughters married locally and due to the large family, Coppabella was the district's social centre for many years. In 1872 the property was subdivided and the main portion sold to Henry Whitty, a nephew of Robinson jnr. In 1876 Whitty sold to the Rial brothers. However, later, the property was resumed by the Bank of Australasia. The history of the property ownership is not known until 1920 when Mr Baker sold Coppabella to Tupra Pastoral Company, owned by the Creswick family of Melbourne. Upon the death of Sir Alex Creswick, they sold the property to Australian Newsprint Mills in 1983. In 1985 the Heritage Branch received community representations concerned for the future of the site as it was for sale. At the time the timber industry was replacing much of the traditional agricultural practices in the region. There was a possibility that the site would be cleared and used for pine plantation. A s.130 order was placed over the site on 2 August 1985 to provide emergency protection of the site. Following discussion with the owner of the site, Australian Newsprint Mills Pty Ltd conservation under the Heritage Act 1977 as supported and Interim Heritage Order was placed on 5 December 1986. In 1987 Australian Newsprint Mills commissioned an archaeology report to assess the structures and recommend a schedule of works. During 1988 and 1989 conservation works were completed on the site. A Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the site on 2 December 1988. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  Construction of the roof Coppabella is located on McGuinnity's Gap Road and Coppabella Road, Rosewood, approximately 50 km east of Holbrook near Tumbarumba in the Snowy Mountains. The site consists of a blacksmith workshop, stable and family burial plot at Coppabella Station. The blacksmith's workshop is a rectangular, timber structure. The walls are constructed of split slabs, let into the top plate and rest between battens fixed by wire drawn nails on the bottom plate. All the original plates are axe dressed. The top plates are fixed by iron spikes to a series of axe dressed perimeter posts set in the ground. The roof is corrugated galvanised iron, attached to the original stringy bark sapling farm. The gable ends are hand split weatherboards the floor is earth throughout. The brick chimney extends through the roof. The sulky horses were shod in the main room while the draft horses, weather permitting, were shod in the yard which separates the blacksmith's from the stables. Water was piped from a reservoir sited on the hill to the west of the blacksmiths. The water ran into a wooden keg which was then carried to the blacksmiths shop. Inside rough work benches are installed along the accessible walls and the forge itself stands close to the north wall. There is a large bellows labelled \\"JOHN C. ONIONS, BRADFORD STREET, BIRMINGHAM, PATENTEE NO. 26855.\\" The bellows is complete with its water jacket around the nozzle. The forge area as a whole is very complete with layers of wheels, horseshoes and ferrriers' tools, representing perhaps a century of accumulation. The tools are outstanding in terms of their authenticity and variety some being hand made, displaying a good standard of the Smith's art. The Stables, originally a weatherboard structure has been partially reclad with galvanised iron sheeting. It is timber framed with an impressive central aisle of timber posts. The aisle is flagged with stone and lined with half height doors, swung on forged strap hinges. The stalls are separated by vertical slab partitions. The ceiling and corresponding floor of the hayloft, is bark, supported on poles. To the north- east of the blacksmithy and stable is the Robinson family plot. There are three graves with two remaining headstones made from local granite enclosed by a railed fence and shaded by elm trees. The graves belong to James Robinson who died in 1878 and James Dawling Robinson who died in 1868. Adjacent to the graves are a number of exotic trees which were planted along the original driveway to the property.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Coppabella Station is of State heritage significance as the first station in the Tumbarumba region and one that played a central role in the society of the region. The blacksmiths shop, stables and graves date to this initial period of occupation and display traditional and now rare building construction techniques - based on hand hewn timbers, bark and corrugated iron. Constructed 1863 the blacksmith workshop, stable and graves are substantially intact and have not been significantly altered since construction. Coppabella Blacksmith Shop was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Episodes Season 1 (2019) Production Development On January 5, 2017, Netflix announced that it would produce its first original South Korean television series, with a release planned for 2018. The premiere date was eventually pushed back to August 2019. In an interview, director Lee Na- jeong mentioned that the production of a second season was dependent on the first season's popularity. On October 29, 2019, Netflix renewed the series for a second season. The first script reading took place on February 21, 2020. Casting The male lead role was initially offered to Ahn Hyo-seop but he declined the offer. Lee Na-jung cast Kim So-hyun as Jojo because of a high synchronisation rate in appearance and her rich acting skills that were beyond her age. Moreover, Kim was the first choice to play Kim Jo-jo of Love Alarm webtoon author Chon Kye-young and online fans. When explaining the reason for casting Jung Ga-ram, the director praised his eyes, saying they were lyrical, clear, and clean, not like other actors in their 20s these days. Meanwhile, Song Kang went through audition competing with 900 people and got cast. Promotion Love Alarm held an interactive experience zone from August 18 to September 1, 2019 at Lotte World Tower World Park Square. Each space was decorated as if the app function in the drama is visualized in reality and gave a romantic experience to lovers, friends, and family who visited the place. Moreover, an app that looks like the one in the series has been released for the promotion events, but it works differently. Reception Forbes's Joan MacDonald finds that Kim So-hyun fits well with the character Jojo. For MacDonald, it is interesting that the two main characters kiss already in the first episode, without being a couple or before confessing their love. This is unusual for Korean dramas. For Stephen McCarty from the South China Morning Post, Love Alarm is not only an innocent love story but also deals with data protection, gay rights, the extreme consequences of heartache, and smartphone invasion. Kim Minyoung, director of content at Netflix Korea describes the drama as \\"focused on unique storytelling with creative edges in their narrative\\". According to a survey conducted by SBS, Love Alarm ranked first among the Korean dramas in 2019. On December 30, 2019, Netflix unveiled the 10 Most Loved Shows in Korea in 2019, in which the series was ranked eighth on the list. Original soundtrack The soundtrack of Love Alarm includes seven main theme songs and fourteen background music. It was released through several music portals, including Melon, iTunes, and Spotify.

She attended Atlanta University, Boston University and the New York School of Social Work. It was in New York at the School of Social Work where in 1930 Bond Logan received a scholarship in conjunction with the National Urban League, to study abroad in Helsignor, Denmark at the International People's College and at Woodbrooke in Birmingham, England. Bond Logan is the grandmother of American poet and essayist Elizabeth Alexander who recited \\"Praise Song for the Day\\" at Barack Obama's 2009 Presidential Inauguration. Bond Logan is the source of inspiration for Alexander's chapter \\"My Grandmother's Hair\\" from her work Power and Possibility.  Life  Georgia Faigan first married Moses West in 1888 and had a daughter named Caroline. Georgia remarried to John Bond in 1905 after Moses West passed away. Together, Georgia and John had two children, Wenonah and her brother John. In total, Georgia had three children. Wenonah had a dark-olive complexion, with coarse dark hair that is slightly straighter and lighter than that of her brother. The family was included in a Harvard sociology study of Negro-White families in the United States. A lock of Wenonah's hair remains at the Harvard Peabody archive as a part of the study conducted in 1927. Wenonah studied abroad in Europe through 1930 -1931. On January 5, 1934 Wenonah married Arthur C. Logan at St. Martin's Church in New York City. Wenonah gives birth to their daughter, Adele Bond. In 1959 Adele marries Clifford L. Alexander, Jr. and three years later Adele and Clifford have Elizabeth. Wenonah and Elizabeth would bond while brushing each other's hair. After her grandmother's death, this is how Elizabeth is reminded of Wenonah.  Education and career  Wenonah Bond Logan studied sociology at Atlanta University, Boston University and New York School of social work in the United States. In April 1930, Bond Logan set sail to Denmark to study international sociology at the International People's College in Helsignor. Students at the International People's College asked Bond Logan about race problems in the United States and every day life. In May 1930, Bond Logan wrote to W.E.B DuBois asking him to send materials to help her evidence the experiences of black people in the United States. Following her five-month study in Denmark, Bond Logan then spent a year studying in England. Bond Logan served as the Girl Reserve Secretary for the YWCA of West 137th in Brooklyn. She continued this position after her study abroad trips. In 1931 Bond Logan became a part of the James Weldon Johnson literary guild.  Death  Wenonah Bond Logan died on September 11, 1993 at the age of 86.

Its origins are older, from the 16th century. Long in the possession of the Prichard (less commonly, Pritchard) family, it changed hands a number of times in later centuries and remains a private residence. The house is Grade II* listed, its listing describing it as a \\"fine Renaissance house\\". An adjacent barn has its own Grade II Listing. History The original house dates from the very early 1600s. The Monmouthshire antiquarian Sir Joseph Bradney records a datestone showing DP 1605, but this is no longer in situ. According to Bradney, the \\"DP\\" refers David Prichard, member of a notable Monmouthshire family who served as High Sheriffs of the county. Walter Prichard is recorded as having played bowls with Charles I at nearby Raglan Castle. Bradney reproduces an illustration of an oil painting showing the house in an elaborate 17th century garden. The house is approached through an avenue of poplar trees and is set in grounds ornamentated by fountains, statuary and parterres. The original of the painting is now at St Fagans Castle, although a copy remains at Treworgan. In the early 1700s, the house was significantly expanded. Sir Cyril Fox and Lord Raglan, in their three- volume study, Monmouthshire Houses, date the rebuilding to 1700‚Äì1714. Passing through a number of owners from the 18th to the 21st centuries, the manor remains privately owned and serves as the farmhouse for a working estate. Architecture and description The architectural historian John Newman describes the setting of the manor as \\"uncomfortably close to the A449\\". The earliest part of the house faces this road and is constructed in stone. The larger, two-storey extension is of brick, with five bays. The manor is listed Grade II*, its listing recording it as \\"a fine Renaissance house with good interior detail\\". A barn adjacent to the house has its own Grade II listing.

It has hairless and leathery inverted lance-shaped to oblong leaves tipped with mostly three teeth and globe- to egg-shaped flowerheads of 6‚Äì8 cm in diameter, that consist of pink to orange, later crimson flowers. From the center of the flowers emerge almost straight styles that jointly give the impression of a pincushion. It is called Potberg pincushion in English. New pink to orange flower heads occur between August and November, but older, crimson heads may persist until January. It is a critically endangered species, only known from one location in the Western Cape province of South Africa.  Description  Leucospermum fulgens is an upright and rounded shrub of up to 3 m (10 ft) high and 4 m (13 ft) across. It grows from a single main stem of up to 10 cm (4 in) thick, and has a smooth, grey bark. The flowering stems are rather stern and stiff, ¬Ω‚Äì1 cm (0.2‚Äì0.4 in) thick, and initially have some fine crisped hairs, which soon wear off. The hairless and leathery leaves are inverted lance-shaped to oblong, 6‚Äì9 cm (2.4‚Äì3.6 in) long and 1¬Ω‚Äì2 cm (0.6‚Äì0.8 in) wide, having two, three or four teeth near the tip. The globe- to egg-shaped flowerheads of 6‚Äì8 cm (2.4‚Äì3.2 in) in diameter are seated or have a very short stalk of up to 1 cm (0.4 in) long, are usual set individually but sometimes grouped in pairs. The common base of the flowers in the same head is cone-shaped with a pointy tip, 2‚Äì4 cm (0.8‚Äì1.6 in) long and approximately 1¬Ω cm across. The bracts that subtend each flower head are greyish because they are covered with densely matted woolly hairs, tightly overlapping and pressed against the flower head, oval with a pointy tip, about 1 cm (0.4 in) long and 7‚Äì8 mm (0.3 in) wide, and cartilaginous in consistency. The bract that subtends each flower individually is oval in shape with an extended pointed tip (cuspidate), about 6 mm (0.24 in) long and 4 mm (0.16 in) wide, and very densely set with woolly hairs. The 4-merous perianth is 3¬Ω‚Äì4 cm (1.4‚Äì1.6 in) long, initially pink to orange coloured but later changing to brilliant crimson. The lowest, fully merged, part of the perianth, called tube, is 0.8‚Äì1.0 cm (0.32-0.40 in) long, narrow and hairless near the base but expanded and widened and minutely powdery higher up, to become constricted where it merges into the middle part. The middle part (or claws), where the perianth is split lengthwise and coils tightly when the flower opens, is covered in villous hairs and the margin has long, straight, spreading hairs. The upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud consists of four lance-shaped lobes with a pointy tip of about long, which are covered in villous hairs. The yellow anthers are directly fused to the limbs, 4¬Ω‚Äì5 mm (0.18‚Äì0.20 in) long, rounded at the top and lack a filament. From the perianth emerges an almost straight style (or slightly bent towards the center of the head) of 4.6‚Äì5.3 cm (1.8‚Äì2.2 in) long, bent very slightly in the direction of the centre of the head, initially yellow but later becoming crimson in colour. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is narrowly cone-shaped with a pointy tip and about 4 mm (0.16 in) long, with a groove acting as the stigma across the very tip. The ovary is subtended by four awl-shaped scales of about 2 mm (0.08 in) long.  Taxonomy  John Patrick Rourke described this species in 1970. The species name fulgens is a Latin word meaning \\"shyny\\". L. fulgens has been assigned to the section Tumiditubus.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  The Potberg pincushion can only be found near De Hoop Nature Reserve just south of the Potberg on Cupido's Kraal farm. It grows only on partially stabilized sandy hills in the trough between the Potberg (consisting of Table Mountain Sandstone) and the limestone ridge of the Alexandria Formation, parallel to the coast. This narrow zone of only a few hundred meters at an altitude of about 150 m (500 ft) above sealevel, consists of deep Tertiary to Quaternary white sands. The species does not occur on either the bordering limestone or Table Mountain Sandstone. It appears as a dense stand in a vegetation that further mostly consists of tall, tufted Restionaceae, Passerina and Metalasia species. The average annual precipitation in this area is 375‚Äì500 mm (15‚Äì20 in), most of which falls during the winter.  Conservation  The Potberg pincushion is considered critically endangered, because only one small, shrinking population is known, within a potential distribution of only , increasing dominance of invasive species is a current thread, while agricultural development and inadequate fire management could add to the risk.

The building was created in the Art Nouveau style. Address of the building is Frunze street, 38.  History  The building of the modern main post office was built in 1911 by the order of the banker A.A. Davidovich. The brick was used as the main building material. The first floor of the building was allocated under office of bank \\"E. Facini and Co.\\", the opening of which took place on January 20, 1912. The founder of this office was Emmanuil Karlovich Facini. On the building was posted a sign \\"Bank house of E. Fachini and Co\\". In the same year on the second floor of the banking house of Davidovich was placed the postal and telegraph office, earlier it was in the house of Taganrog of merchant Skurich in Greek street. This building hasn't remained till our times. When the nationalization of the building took place, the Taganrog communication center was placed on the first and second floor. In 1981 the balconies of the Taganrog post office building were lost. For more than centenary history of the house there weren't made capital repairs and nevertheless, the building remains in good condition.  Description  The building is unplastered. The facade is created using bricks of yellow and gray color. The main entrance is decorated with arc-shaped cornice. The characteristic elements of the architectural style of Art Nouveau were the balcony grilles, now they are lattices of a parapet of a flat form.

In the Czech Republic, football originated in Bohemia between 1890 and 1990, mainly played by Germans (the country was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire). The first Czech championship, won by CFK Kickers Prague (spring) and Deutscher FC Prag (autumn) was disputed. In 1897 the Czech Crown championship was won, won by Slavia and in 1902 the Czech Football Association championship won by the Cesky AFC Vinohrady.

He is the first Indonesian and the only Asian male to win any medal in at the IAAF World U20 Championships by winning a gold medal in the 100m. He is the current holder of the Indonesian 100m and 200m national records, and is labelled the \\"fastest man in Southeast Asia\\". Biography Zohri was born and raised in West Pemenang village of the Pemenang subdistrict in North Lombok Regency, on the eastern island of Lombok, in a house made of wood and woven bamboo. He is the youngest of four children. His mother died when he was in elementary school, and his father died when he was 17. He couldn't even afford shoes, prompting him to train barefoot. He convinced his sister to lend him Rp 400,000 (21 Euros) so he could buy a pair of spikes for his meets, although this partly came from his allowance. He won the 100 m at the 2018 Asian Junior Athletics Championships in Japan in a time of 10.27 seconds. Zohri competed for Indonesia at the 2018 IAAF World U20 Championships in the 100 m. In the first round, he placed first with a time of 10.30 seconds. In semifinal, he placed second with a slightly better time at 10.24, behind World Youth 100m Record Holder and gold medal favorite Anthony Schwartz. He was drawn to lane eight in the final, which started less than three hours later. When the pistol fired, Zohri got a decent start, staying right behind Schwartz who led. He closed-in slowly at 60 metres, and in the last ten metres, he surged ahead of Schwartz to take the gold medal by a dip. His time of 10.18 seconds (+1.2 m/s) became an Indonesian junior record, just slightly different from Indonesian National Record at the time of 10.17 by Suryo Agung Wibowo at the 2009 Southeast Asian Games. Zohri was labeled as a national hero for his deeds; Indonesian President Joko Widodo ordered two cabinet ministers to arrange for his house to be renovated. Zohri is part of a contingent of high performing Indonesian athletes, coached by Harry Marra, a program designed to make Indonesia a competitive player in the international athletics scene. On home soil in the 2018 Asian Games, he reached the finals but placed seventh with a time of 10.20 seconds in the 100 m. He and his fellow athletes won a silver medal in the 4 √ó 100 m relay, Zohri was the second runner. Following the Asian Games, Zohri participated in the inaugural event of the Malaysia Open Grand Prix, timing 10.20 seconds in the 100m race and winning gold. In the 2019 Asian Athletics Championships, Zohri recorded 10.13 seconds in 100m, placing second behind Japanese Yoshihide Kiry≈´. During the competition's semifinals, Zohri recorded 10.15 seconds, which was a new national record until the finals less than 150 minutes later. On May 2019, Zohri further improved his record to 10.03 seconds as he won a bronze medal in the 2019 Seiko Golden Grand Prix in Osaka, breaking Southeast Asian records and securing a spot in the qualifications for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. He further broke the 200m national record in August 2019, when he finished at 20.18 seconds during the 200m finals of the 2019 Indonesian National Athletics Championship in Bogor, West Java.

It was formed as a searchlight brigade to protect the British Expeditionary Force's bases just before the Battle of France. After the Dunkirk evacuation it was reformed as a conventional anti- aircraft (AA) brigade and served through the rest of the war in Anti-Aircraft Command, defending various parts of the United Kingdom against bombing raids and V-1 flying bombs. It continued to serve in the Regular Army during the early postwar years. Origin As the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France expanded during the Phoney War period, new headquarters (HQs) were formed to control the various groups of AA guns and searchlights (S/Ls) of the Royal Artillery (RA) and Royal Engineers (RE) that were deployed to defend its field formations and base installations. 5th AA Brigade HQ was formed at Blackdown on 2 February, redesignated 5th Searchlight Brigade on 6 April, and sent to France shortly before the Battle of France began on 10 May.Frederick, p. 1048. Its commander was Brigadier Edmund Rait-Kerr, RE, who had been commandant of the Army's School of Electric Lighting at Gosport.Rait-Kerr at Generals of World War II.Farndale, Annex J. Coming directly under General Headquarters (GHQ) the brigade's role was to administer the S/L units deployed to protect airfields, ports, and the BEF's forward gun areas.Farndale, Annex A.Routledge, pp. 114‚Äì6.

They deployed their Boys anti-tank rifles and Bren guns, using S/L lorries as roadblocks, while French forces withdrew through them. The towns were bombed and S/L positions were machine-gunned by Luftwaffe fighters. 4th Searchlight Bty, deployed round Lille, saw constant enemy air activity. On 17 May it detached a group of riflemen with Boys rifles to defend 5 AA Bde HQ at Lens while the remainder joined the Bethune canal guards. On that day 1st S/L Bty was ordered back to Calais, a move made difficult because all the roads were choked with refugees. There it operated in the S/L role to defend the port.3 S/L Bty War Diary, 1939‚Äì40, TNA file WO 167/682.4 S/L Bty War Diary, 1939‚Äì40, TNA file WO 167/683.Routledge, pp. 116-7. Meanwhile, Army Group A had cut the BEF's lines of communication into France and driven it back towards the coast at Dunkirk, cutting off the British troops at Calais and Boulogne from the main force. When planning the evacuation from Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo), the BEF's commanders decided that Calais and Boulogne should still be held as supply points for further fighting or possible exit points for a final withdrawal.Routledge, pp. 117‚Äì8. Calais British prisoners being marched away after the fall of Calais, 26 May 1940 By 20 May, 1st and 2nd S/L Btys of 1st S/L Rgt, with part of 2nd S/L Rgt, were deployed as a screen of S/L detachments one mile apart round the east side of Calais and Lt-Col Goldney of 1st S/L Rgt was appointed AA Defence Commander for the town. They were joined on 22 May by 30th Infantry Brigade, just before advanced German troops began probing the defences, beginning the Siege of Calais. On the night of 22/23 May the AA units engaged Luftwaffe raiders that bombed Calais, starting fires. But ground attack was now the biggest danger, and the S/L men had to man the perimeter as infantry, a role for which they (mainly older Territorials, raw militiamen and a few ex-RE reservists) were untrained. Nevertheless, they put up a stout fight, halting tank columns for several hours before they were overwhelmed. The remnants were forced back to the citadel and harbour, where some were evacuated by sea but most became Prisoners of war (PoWs) when the citadel fell on 26 May. The town's three-day defence, holding up Heinz Guderian's XIX Panzerkorps, had provided some respite for the Dunkirk evacuation.Ellis, France and Flanders, Chapter X.Farndale, pp. 57‚Äì8.Routledge, pp. 118‚Äì22.Neave, pp. 29‚Äì45, 65, 96 208.Jon Latimer, 'Sacrifice at Calais' at HistoryNet. Hondeghem 2nd Searchlight Rgt was more widely spread. While part went to Calais, a Troop of one officer and 80 men found themselves attached to K Battery, Royal Horse Artillery, with orders to help hold the small village of Hondeghem which was on the main German axis of advance. The gunners fought a valiant action on 26 May then, running short of ammunition, they charged the German positions and broke through, giving them a route out towards Dunkirk. By now, 2nd S/L Rgt had 5 Bty completely missing, 6 Bty had over 50 per cent missing and 8 Bty was missing just under a quarter. By the time the evacuation was complete, the Regiment had lost over 50 men killed and approximately half the regiment captured.Ellis, France and Flanders, Chapter XI.Farndale, pp. 65‚Äì7.Hughes, pp. 184‚Äì6. Dunkirk 3rd (Ulster) Searchlight Rgt fared much better. Its batteries were deployed relatively close together around the Dunkirk perimeter with 12 Bty in the town itself. On 19 May, after some hard fighting often against tanks, the bulk of the regiment was ordered to destroy their searchlights and make for Dunkirk. By 21 May, 9, 10 and 11 Btys were in defensive positions around the port while 12 Bty continued in its S/L role inside the town. Over the next six days the regiment withstood many attacks from the enemy. Once the decision had been made on 24 May to evacuate, the HQs of 2 AA Bde and 5 AA Bde bore the brunt of AA defence of Dunkirk and the beaches, taking over those remnants of AA units that made their way back to the port. On 27 May 3rd S/L Rgt was relieved; RHQ and 9, 10 and 11 Btys were evacuated to England the next day. Two Troops of 12 Battery were evacuated in small boats the following day, while the rest of the battery was ordered to destroy the remaining lights and assist in the defence of the beaches. They were eventually taken off the beach in small batches by 31 May. 3 (Ulster) S/L Rgt had been very lucky with only 28 killed, 41 wounded and three men taken prisoner.Ellis, France and Flanders, Chapter XI.Farndale, p. 65. Home defence Orders were issued on 13 July for the brigade to be reformed (as 5th AA Brigade) in the Gloucester area within 5 AA Division of AA Command. It became a mixed AA formation containing heavy (HAA) and light (LAA) gun units as well as S/L units. The Gloster Aircraft Company factory at Brockworth, Gloucestershire, was a strategic target in the area and was protected by 24 HAA guns.'Reorganisation of 5th AA Division' in 37th (TEE) S/L Regt RA, War Diary 15 May‚Äì16 June 1940, TNA file WO 167/679.Collier, Appendix XXII.

There were few air raids in 5 AA Bde's area, although the Gloster works at Brockworth and Hucclecote were targeted. Otherwise, enemy air activity was reported as 'slight' and 'small scale', and was mainly heading towards Birmingham and Coventry in the neighbouring 11 AA Division area, with one raid on Cheltenham on 11 December.37 S/L Rgt War Diary August 1940‚ÄìSeptember 1941, TNA file WO 166/3054.Air Raid on Gloster Aircraft Company at BBC WW2 People's War.Air Raid on Cheltenham at BBC Gloucestershire. From November 1940 searchlights were deployed in clusters of three lights in an attempt to improve the chances of picking up enemy bombers and keeping them illuminated for engagement by AA guns or Royal Air Force (RAF) night-fighters. Eventually, one light in each cluster was to be equipped with Searchlight Control (SLC) radar and act as 'master light', but the radar equipment was still in short supply.Routledge, pp. 388-9, 393.

During the Blitz, which ended in May 1941, the composition of 5 AA Bde was as follows:9 AA Division at RA 39‚Äì45.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79. * 85th (Tees) HAA Rgt ** 174 HAA Bty ‚Äì attached to 61 AA Bde until Summer 1941 ** 175 HAA Bty ** 220 HAA Bty ‚Äì attached to 45 AA Bde until Summer 1941 ** 413 HAA Bty ‚Äì joined by May 1941 * 88th HAA Rgt (part) ‚Äì transferred to 1 AA Division by May 1941 * 47th LAA Rgt ** 66, 131 LAA Btys ** 85 LAA Bty ‚Äì attached to 8 AA Division * 37th (TEE) S/L Rgt ** 307, 308, 348, 349 S/L Btys Mid-War In the Summer of 1941 AA Command began to receive purpose-built SLC radar in sufficient numbers to allow some S/Ls to be 'declustered' into single-light sites. These were redeployed into 'Indicator Belts' of radar-controlled S/L clusters covering approaches to the night-fighter sectors, repeated by similar belts covering AA Command's Gun Defence Areas (GDAs). Inside each belt was a 20-mile deep 'Killer Belt' of single S/Ls spaced at intervals in a 'Killer Belt' cooperating with night- fighters patrolling defined 'boxes'. The pattern was designed to ensure that raids penetrating deeply towards the Midlands GDAs would cross more than one belt, and the GDAs had more S/Ls at close spacing. The number of LAA units to protect Vital Points (VPs) such as aircraft factories and airfields was growing, albeit slowly. At this stage of the war, experienced units were being posted away to train for service overseas, which led to a continual turnover of units. However, newly-formed units continued to join AA Command, the HAA and support units increasingly becoming 'Mixed' units, indicating that women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) were fully integrated into them.Routledge, pp. 398‚Äì404.Routledge, p. 99.

(Unlike most of AA Command's Territorial Army brigades, which retained their strong regional identities, 5 AA Bde was regularly relocated and/or resubordinated as required.) In October 1942 AA Command abolished its hierarchy of divisions and corps, and established a single tier of AA Groups corresponding to the Groups of RAF Fighter Command. 5 AA Brigade came under 2 AA Group covering South East England (outside London) and affiliated to No. 11 Group RAF.Routledge p. 401 & Map 36.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/82. The turnover of units accelerated with the need to provide AA cover for the Allied invasion of North Africa (Operation Torch) in late 1942 followed by the landings in Sicily and Italy in 1943. 21st Army Group was established in early 1943 to begin preparing for the Normandy Landings (Operation Overlord). As the threat from the Luftwaffe waned, AA Command was forced to release men for other duties, and a number of searchlight units were disbanded or converted, and some batteries were disbanded.Routledge, pp. 399 & 409.

In November 1943 it was also ordered to plan for the expected onslaught of V-1 flying bombs (codenamed 'Divers') against London, to which it responded by planning a thick belt of 8-gun HAA positions across the likely flight path, backed by LAA guns. Meanwhile, the Group also had to deal with a sharp increase in Luftwaffe air raids trying to reach London during the winter of 1943‚Äì4 (the so-called 'Little Blitz'). AA Command relieved the burden on 2 AA Group by bringing down 6 AA Group HQ from Scotland and giving it responsibility for the Overlord ports in the Solent‚ÄìPortsmouth area. 5 AA Brigade, together with 134th (M) HAA Rgt, 19th LAA Rgt and its GORs, transferred to the command of 6 AA Group in March 1944.Routledge, pp. 408‚Äì10.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/85.

The first V-1 missiles were fired against London in June, a week after D-Day, and Operation Diver was activated. 2 AA Group's HAA batteries left their 'Overlord' sites and moved to pre-planned sites across the 'funnel' of V-1 flightpaths. 5 AA Brigade was one of four reinforcing brigade HQs moved into the Group within two weeks, taking over units deployed in the area. However, the results were disappointing, and after a fortnight AA Command changed its tactics. Firstly, mobile HAA guns were replaced with static installations that could traverse more quickly to track the fast-moving targets. These were emplaced on temporary 'Pile platforms' named after the Command-in-Chief of AA Command, Gen Sir Frederick 'Tim' Pile. Secondly, the HAA gun belt was moved to the coast and interlaced with LAA guns to hit the missiles out to sea. This new belt was divided into six brigade sectors, with 5 AA Bde HQ taking charge of one sector under 1 AA Gp. The whole process involved the movement of hundreds of guns and vehicles and thousands of servicemen and women, but a new 8-gun site could be established in 48 hours. The guns were constantly in action, but the success rate against the 'Divers' steadily improved, until over 50 per cent of incoming missiles were destroyed by gunfire or fighter aircraft. This phase of Operation Diver ended in September after the V-1 launch sites in Northern France had been overrun by 21st Army Group.Collier, Chapter XXIV.Collier, Appendix XLV.Routledge, pp. 410‚Äì16; Table LXX, p. 423; Map 38. thumbright LAA guns emplaced on the South Coast, August 1944.

In addition, the brigade's Mixed Signal Office Section comprised 5 male other ranks and 19 ATS.AA Command Organisation Table, October‚ÄìNovember 1944, TNA file WO 212/148. Winter 1944‚Äì45 A new phase of Operation Diver began when the Luftwaffe began launching V-1s from aircraft over the North Sea. AA Command had to reorganise its defences, stripping HAA guns from inland sites and moving them to the coast of East Anglia, together with Pile platforms and accommodation huts. In November 1944 a new 9 AA Gp was formed to take over the 'Diver' defences in East Anglia and 5 AA Bde was transferred to this new formation.Routledge, pp. 416‚Äì7. By the end of 1944, 21st Army Group was suffering a severe manpower shortage, particularly among the infantry.Ellis, Defeat of Germany, pp. 141‚Äì2. At the same time the Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious aerial attacks on the United Kingdom could be discounted. In January 1945 the War Office began to reorganise surplus anti-aircraft regiments in the UK into infantry battalions, primarily for line of communication and occupation duties in North West Europe, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.Ellis, Defeat of Germany, pp. 369, 380.

They were important in safely transporting gold, and were in most cases carried out by police assisted units.  Victoria  During the Victorian Gold Rush of the 1850s, a special armed detachment from South Australia provided a 'Gold Escort' for the secure transportation of gold overland from the western Victorian gold fields to Adelaide. The first gold escort led by Alexander Tolmer (a 'colourful' character who later became the South Australian Police Commissioner ) departed Victoria on 5 March 1852 carrying of gold and arrived in Adelaide two weeks later. Eventually, eighteen trips were made between 1852 and 1853 transporting of gold. The Victorian- goldfields to Adelaide route was notable for the distance and amount of gold carried, almost a quarter of all gold, , transported within Victoria during the gold rush (1851-1865). The Gold Escort route started in the Bendigo area and then went west across the Pyrenees to the small settlement of Horsham. From Horsham, the route passed north-west through the Little Desert region into South Australian territory and then ran roughly parallel with the coast to Adelaide.

The oldest cinema in the city. It is a monument of local architecture.  History  In 1903 in Novocherkassk on Platovsky Avenue of Golokolosova in Kondratova's house was opened a cinema \\"Path√©\\". It was equipped with equipment brought from Paris by the French company \\"F. and E. Path√© \\", in honor of it was originally called a cinema. Local Cossack Evdokiya Petrovna Kondratova organized the construction of the building specifically for the cinema. This building became the first in the city constructed especially as cinema in what its historical importance consists. In the summer and autumn of 1914 the military theme was popular in the cinema. The following announcements were often met in the local press: in the electro-biographer Path√© there is a picture \\"Struggle against the demon\\" \\"with the participation of the famous kino-artist V.

Initially, the building had a balcony. On the first floor on the left side was a haberdashery store, and on the right - a hairdresser. In the basement was a wine cellar. Throughout the twentieth century, the building was used for its immediate purpose. There were no more shops in it, only its name changed in 1927 the '\\"Path√©\\" cinema was renamed \\"Temp\\", then \\"III International\\", \\"Sovetskiy\\", \\"Komsomolets\\" and already in the 90's -\\" Tanais \\".

It was one of the most successful and productive Australian 'indie' labels of the period, issuing over 300 singles and dozens of EPs and LPs. Fable made a significant initial impact in Australia in 1970-71, scoring a string of hits by new Australian artists, and throughout its history the company discovered and promoted local talent. Fable enjoyed further success between 1972 and 1975 through its subsidiary label Bootleg Records, which racked up a string of hit albums and singles by artists including Brian Cadd, the Bootleg Family Band and Kerrie Biddell. Fable/Bootleg released a wide variety of music from rock to mainstream vocal music. Its catalogue also included theatre organ music, Christian gospel music by singing group The Proclaimers, comedy recordings by veteran entertainer Frankie Davidson, and occasional novelty items like Drummond's 'chipmunk' version of \\"Daddy Cool\\" and a piano version of \\"In The Summertime\\" by film critic and honky-tonk piano virtuoso Ivan Hutchinson. Its debut single was \\"Curly\\", by variety performer and TV host Jimmy Hannan, and one of its last releases was single by TV personality Bert Newton and the Debney Park High School Band, which reportedly reached #11 on the Melbourne charts. Fable also had a long association with Victorian Football League (VFL), beginning in 1972, when it released a series of officially-authorised VFL football club songs, adapted from 'standards' like \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\". These were widely played in the 1970s, at matches and on TV and radio broadcasts. In 1979, Fable artist Mike Brady released \\"Up There Cazaly\\", which effectively became the VFL anthem, reaching #1 on the Australian charts and selling over 250,000 copies, becoming the most successful Australian single ever released up to that time, and earning it a place in the Guinness Book of Records. History Background Company founder Ron Tudor began his career in the music industry in the mid-1950s when he joined Melbourne label W&G; Records as a sales representative, just as the company's new recording division was starting up. Over the next ten years he worked his way up through promotion to A&R; and record production. Tudor discovered and first recorded emerging artists including Diana Trask, Ernie Sigley and The Seekers and was instrumental in getting The Seekers signed to W&G; for their first recordings, producing their first album, which was recorded just before the group left for the UK. After leaving W&G; in 1966 Ron spent two years working at Astor Records and in 1968 he left to set up his own independent record production company, June Productions. A year later, in late 1969, he founded Fable Records with start-up capital of just $2. Tudor also established Fable Music Publishing; songs from its catalogue have been recorded by many notable Australian acts including John Farnham, Slim Dusty, Rolf Harris, Judith Durham, Anne Kirkpatrick, Olivia Newton-John, Brian Cadd, Debbie Byrne, Max Merritt, Margaret Urlich, Natalie Imbruglia, Marcia Hines, Col Joye, Diana Trask, Normie Rowe, The Bushwackers and Colleen Hewett. An important factor in Fable's initial success was Tudor's association with the Nine Network TV talent quest New Faces. He was a member of the judging panel for several years, and among the prizes offered to heat and series winners was the chance to record with Fable. Many New Faces heat and series winners recorded for Fable and several became very successful‚ÄîLiv Maessen, John Williamson, Stephen Foster, Dutch Tilders and Franciscus Henri were all New Faces 'discoveries' who launched their recording careers with Fable. Label launch Fable was officially launched in April 1970 with a batch of five singles (all by Australian artists), and quickly became very successful - seven of its first twelve singles made the national Top 40, and of the forty- one singles Fable released between April and December 1970, seventeen became hits, including two national #1s - The Mixtures' \\"In The Summertime\\" and \\"The Pushbike Song\\" - as well as four other Top 10 hits by Hans Poulsen, Liv Maessen, Jigsaw and John Williamson. Liv Maessen's version of \\"Knock, Knock, Who's There?\\", which reached #2 nationally, was one of the most successful Australian singles of 1970, selling over 50,000 copies and earning Maessen the first Gold Record ever awarded to an Australian female performer. John Williamson also earned a Gold Record for his debut single \\"Old Man Emu\\", the song he had used to win New Faces and which helped him gain his Fable contract. Another notable Fable achievement was that the label scored thirty- six charting singles in Sydney alone during 1970. Fable's second batch of singles, released in May 1970, included The Strangers' \\"Melanie Makes Me Smile\\", John Williamson's \\"Old Man Emu\\" and Jigsaw's \\"To Love Means To Be Free\\", each of which became a hit. The Strangers and John Williamson both debuted on the Go-Set national chart on 18 July 1970, joining \\"Knock, Knock, Who's There\\", Hans Poulsen's \\"Boom Sha La La Lo\\" and Pat Carroll's \\"All Kinds of Everything\\", giving Fable five singles in the national Top 40 in the same week. Fable and the Radio Ban A critical factor in Fable's chart breakthrough was the controversial 1970 radio ban, which began in May that year, a month after Fable was launched. The ban was the climax of a simmering \\"pay-for-play\\" dispute between a group of local record companies and the commercial radio sector. After Australia's new copyright laws were proclaimed in 1968, a group of major labels (EMI, Festival, Warner, CBS and Philips/Polygram) decided to scrap their long-standing agreement with commercial radio, dating back to the late 1950s, in which they provided radio stations with free promotional copies of new singles and albums. The record company group now demanded that a new royalty should be paid on all tracks played on air, but the radio stations, not surprisingly, balked at the idea of a new levy, which was set at 1% of the total annual revenue of the entire commercial radio industry, and when talks between the two parties broke down broke in April 1970 the labels placed a six-month embargo on the supply of free promotional records to commercial radio stations. The commercial stations responded by black-listing major-label product and refusing to list major- label titles in their Top 40 charts. Desperate for material, radio stations turned to smaller local companies like Fable and Sparmac, who had declined to take part in the ban, and these independents made the most of this window of opportunity. Fable, in particular, achieved considerable commercial success during that time. Tudor was being sent regular packages of new UK releases from London by his friend, former EMI house producer David Mackay, and he optioned songs he thought would be suitable for his Fable acts. He had already scored a hit with the Liv Maessen version of Mary Hopkin's \\"Knock, Knock, Who's There?\\", and when he offered The Mixtures \\"In The Summertime\\", a song that had recently been a UK hit for Mungo Jerry. The band jumped at the chance to record it‚Äîalthough lead vocalist Idris Jones declined to sing on it, feeling it was too 'poppy', so bassist Mick Flinn performed the lead vocal. For several weeks in the period from July to October 1970, at the height of the ban, Fable dominated the Go-Set singles chart, with as many as seven singles simultaneously in the Go-Set Top 60. They included a joint #1 hit (shared with Mungo Jerry) with \\"In The Summertime\\", a #2 hit with \\"Knock, Knock, Who's There\\" and a #3 hit with \\"Old Man Emu\\". On the 3 October chart, there were five Fable singles simultaneously in the Top 20‚ÄîThe Mixtures at #1, Jigsaw at #3, John Williamson at #6, The Strangers at #16 and Liv Maessen at #17. Maessen's new single, \\"Snowbird\\", debuted the same week, giving her two simultaneous Top 40 hits. Fable's success continued through 1971. Early in the year it scored another Top 20 hit with a version of Cat Stevens' \\"Wild World\\", credited to the studio group Fourth House. This song (which competed with the Jimmy Cliff version) had been intended as a solo release for Mike Brady (ex MPD Ltd), but an oversight during the recording of the backing track resulted in the song being pitched too high for Brady's vocal range, so Tudor called in former Wild Cherries lead singer Danny Robinson to overdub the lead vocal. A few weeks later The Mixtures' follow-up single \\"The Pushbike Song\\" became a major local and international hit‚Äîit spent 12 weeks at #1 in Australia and also topped the charts in the UK, making it the first international hit to be entirely written, recorded and produced in Australia. Fable's next hit was an unlikely success. In late 1970, Tudor concocted another anonymous studio band, which he dubbed Drummond, made up of members of folk-rock band Allison Gros (Graeham Goble, Russ Johnston and John Mower) and anonymous session players. They recorded a cover of George Harrison's \\"For You Blue\\" as Drummond's debut release. It made no impression, but the second Drummond single‚Äîa novelty 'chipmunk' rendition of Slay & Crewe's \\"Daddy Cool\\"‚Äîturned out to be one of the biggest Australian hits of 1971. Cashing in on the popularity of top local band Daddy Cool, who had included the song on their hugely successful debut LP, Drummond's version shot up the Go-Set national chart, reaching #1 in just six weeks and knocking Daddy Cool's landmark hit \\"Eagle Rock\\" off the top spot in mid-September. It stayed at #1 for eight weeks, charted for 21 weeks and became one of the biggest-selling local recordings of the year. Brian Cadd and Bootleg Records Fable was also the launching pad for the solo career of singer-songwriter-keyboardist Brian Cadd (ex-The Groop, Axiom). Fable issued the Brian Cadd-Don Mudie duo single \\"Show Me the Way\\" in December 1971. It was a Top 40 hit, reaching #17 in February 1972 and charting for 12 weeks. In early 1972 Brian joined Fable as an A&R; manager and house producer, and in this capacity he wrote, sang, played on and produced many Fable releases, including Robin Jolley's 1972 hit single \\"Marshall's Portable Music Machine\\" and Robin's debut album. Cadd also produced Hans Poulsen's second solo album Lost and Found, Coming Home the Wrong Way Round (1972) and produced and/or played on Fable and Bootleg albums and singles by Stephen Foster, Fat Mamma, The Strangers, New Dream, Dutch Tilders, Bluestone, Kerrie Biddell and Daryl Somers. In late 1971 Tudor and Cadd set up Fable's new subsidiary imprint Bootleg. Cadd had been inspired by the example of Leon Russell's Shelter Records label, and the way that Russell‚Äîa former member of crack L.A. session team 'The Wrecking Crew' -- had organised a group of regular players around him for projects like Joe Cocker's phenomenally successful \\"Mad Dogs & Englishmen\\" tour. In a similar vein, Cadd envisaged a regular Bootleg house band to back himself and all the other artists on the label, whom he would also produce, for recording and touring. At the time, the roster included singer-songwriter Steven Foster, jazz vocalist Kerrie Biddell, and the harmony-pop group Mississippi. Bootleg quickly became the most successful independent record label in the history of Australian popular music, and it was rivalled in the long term only by Michael Gudinski's Mushroom Records. Over the next few years Cadd earned many gold and platinum records as a solo artist, numerous awards for film scores, title songs and TV themes, he produced many other acts and wrote and also produced advertising music. His debut solo single \\"Ginger Man\\" (inspired by the J.P. Donleavy novel) established him as a major Australian solo artist. It was a chart success, reaching #16 nationally on its release in October 1972 and charting for 18 weeks. His self-titled debut album reached #2, and spent 20 weeks on the album charts. Cadd also won the composer's section of the last 1972 Hoadley's National Battle of the Sounds with one of the songs from the LP, \\"Don't You Know It's Magic\\". He also performed the song at the Tokyo World Popular Song Festival, where he won the 'Most Outstanding Composition' award; John Farnham recorded his own successful version in 1973. In 1973 Cadd formed the Bootleg Family Band to back himself and other artists on recordings and for touring; the group included many of the best Melbourne session musicians of the period including drummer Geoff Cox, who has played on scores of Australian hits. He also oversaw the Bootleg Family Band's own recordings, singing lead vocals and playing keyboards on their version of Loggins & Messina's \\"Your Mama Don't Dance\\", which was another major Australian hit that year, reaching #4 and charting for 17 weeks. Cadd's second album Parabrahm reached #5 nationally, and spawned a string of successful singles: \\"Every Mother's Son\\" (March), \\"Silver City Birthday Celebration Day\\" (July) and \\"Keep on Rockin'\\" (October). Cadd's next single \\"Alvin Purple\\" (November) was the theme song from Tim Burstall's feature film of the same name. Cadd also wrote the scores for both Alvin Purple (1973), and its sequel Alvin Rides Again (1975). Cadd scored more hits through 1974 - the LP Moonshine (#16, September), the single \\"Class Of '74\\" (April), the theme song from the TV series of the same name, \\"Let Go\\" (#14 in September) and \\"Boogie Queen\\" (December). By this time Cadd had signed an American distribution deal and both Parabrahm and Moonshine came out on Chelsea Records in the USA and he toured the USA with the Bootleg Family Band during 1975. Fable continued to score hits through 1972-73, including Matt Flinders' \\"Butterfly\\" (#4) Robin Jolley's debut single \\"Marshall's Portable Music Machine\\" (a #4 hit written and produced by Brian Cadd), The Mixtures \\"Captain Zero\\" (#5), the theme song from Bruce Beresford's The Adventures of Barry Mackenzie, performed by veteran 'trad' jazz singer Smacka Fitzgibbon, which reached #21, Jigsaw's \\"Mademoiselle Ninette\\" (#20) and Johnny Chester's Mother's Day tribute, \\"The World's Greatest Mum\\" (#9). This was the last major Fable hit for some time, but the label bounced back in early 1975 with Bill & Boyd's \\"Santa Never Made It Into Darwin\\", inspired by the disaster of Cyclone Tracy which went to #1. The duo had further success with their next single, \\"Put Another Log On The Fire\\". Late 1970s to label closure When Brian Cadd relocated to the USA in 1976, Bootleg lost its main creative force and its fortunes waned (although Fable continued to release records on Bootleg until 1978). By this time, major changes were taking place on the Australian music scene‚ÄîAustralia's \\"pop bible\\" of the late '60s and early '70s, Go-Set magazine, had ceased publication, colour TV had just been introduced, the ABC's national weekly pop show Countdown was ushering in the music video era and radio station 2JJ in Sydney - the first new radio station launched in Australia in over 30 years and Australia's first 24-hour non-commercial rock station - was fast becoming a major new force in radio, and recent media reforms by the Whitlam government saw the establishment of the community radio sector in Australia. Other local independent labels were also eating into Fable's market share, most notably Michael Gudinski's fast-growing Mushroom Records, which had shot to prominence in early 1975 with the record-setting success of Melbourne band Skyhooks. When interviewed about the Radio Ban for a feature article by Toby Creswell, published in The Australian, Tudor stated that although his refusal to take part in the 1970 Radio Ban had helped to launch the label, it ultimately had damaging long-term consequences. He claimed that Fable had been unofficially 'blackballed' by the major labels, with the result that his business was effectively strangled by the problem of getting its records distributed, since smaller local independent labels like Fable were heavily reliant on the pressing and distribution facilities of the majors. In September 1978 Tudor and Leon Hill (of Armstrong Audio Video) approached the Minister for Posts and Telecommunications, Tony Staley and requested \\"an increase of local content on commercial stations... [eventually reaching] 40 percent.\\" Fable records struggled on into the early 1980s, scoring a last hit in 1980 with Mike Brady's VFL anthem \\"Up There Cazaly\\", which became the HSV-7 (Melbourne) football theme song and the biggest-selling Australian single released up to that time. Finally in 1984 Tudor sold the company and its catalogue to John McDonald's Image music group. The combined companies were subsequently relaunched as Fable Music. Fable won many industry awards during its fifteen-year life. At the end of 1971 Fable won the Go-Set Pop Poll Professional Non-Performers award for the biggest contribution to the Australian Pop Industry by an individual or company. In 1972 Fable and Bootleg between them won eight of the sixteen awards given out by the Federation of Australian Commercial Broadcasters, including a Special Award of Merit for services to the industry. By the end of his association with Fable in July 1984, the company had amassed 20 gold and platinum records and 32 industry awards. Discography notes All Fable and Bootleg singles and EPs were catalogued in the same numerical sequence, which started at \\"001\\", so numbering for releases on each label were non-consecutive. Fable 7\\" singles were prefixed \\"FB\\" and EPs were prefixed \\"FBEP\\", while Bootleg singles and EPs were prefixed \\"BL\\" and \\"BLEP\\".

He made his debut in round 16 of the 2018 season against the Greater Western Sydney Giants at Perth Stadium.  Junior career  Allen is from Perth, Western Australia. He played junior football at Whitford Junior Football Club, but also played basketball. As a junior, he played as a small defender, before a growth spurt at 16 meant he started to play key-position roles. Allen joined West Australian Football League club West Perth in 2016. He initially played at colts level. At West Perth, Allen played as an inside midfielder, a centre- half forward, a centre half-back and a ruckman. He played for his state as co- captain in the 2017 AFL Under 18 Championships and won the Larke Medal as the best player in the first division after kicking 11 goals over four games. Allen said he was \\"really excited\\" about the award, but it \\"wasn't something that went to [his] head\\". He played as a centre half-forward, but was named in the Under 18 All-Australian side as a full-forward, confusing WA coach Peter Sumich. Allen was lauded as a possible early pick in the 2017 national draft after his performance. He was compared to former St Kilda captain Nick Riewoldt by his West Perth coach Bill Monaghan, and to Essendon forward Jake Stringer. Allen played two reserves matches with West Perth, where he played with his older brother Angus. He also played two senior matches to give him experience at a higher level.  AFL career  After speculation that West Coast would take Allen with their first selection (pick 13) in the 2017 draft, he was eventually selected by the club with pick 21. He arrived at the Eagles with a tibia stress fracture, which Allen believed was character building. Forwards coach Jaymie Graham said that senior players were impressed with his work ethic. On debut against the GWS Giants, he accumulated seven disposals at 100% efficiency, two marks and three tackles. Allen singled out his smother on Giant Matt de Boer and watching Nic Naitanui take a flying mark as highlights. Allen played a defensive role in his AFL debut with West Coast, but said that he was happy wherever coach Adam Simpson played him and that he was sure he would play as a forward at some point.  Personal life  Allen has two brothers: Gareth, a lacrosse player who won a bronze medal for Australia at the 2010 World Lacrosse Championship in Manchester; and Angus, who plays for West Perth's reserves.

Moon House is a private home constructed by architect Darius B. Moon for his own use. It is located at 216 Huron Street in Lansing, Michigan. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History Darius B. Moon was born in 1851 in Cattaraugus County, New York, and moved to Eaton County, Michigan when he was three years old. He was married in 1877 and moved to Lansing by 1883 and began his career as a builder. He was interested in architecture from an early age, and was likely self-taught. Following his interest, by 1888 he was working as an architect. In 1894, Moon designed this Queen Anne house, then located at 112 Logan Street, for his own residence. He lived there until his retirement in 1923, at which time he converted the second floor into an apartment. Moon lived in the apartment, while his daughter Princess and her husband, Howard Adams, occupied the downstairs apartment. Moon lived in the house until his death in 1934, and his daughter lived there through the mld-1950s. In the 1970s there was a fire on the second floor, and the house was abandoned. In 1975, a local non-profit, Save the Moon House, Inc., purchased the house and in 1978 moved it to its present location. The house was sold to a private owner, and rehabilitated by 1979. Description The Darius B. Moon House Is a two-and-one-half-story, Queen Anne-style house with a cross-gable-and-hip roof topped with a prominent three-story, square tower. Ornamental tin cresting runs along the roof ridge, and a tin finial is located at the peak of the tower. A single-story porch is located on one side. At the rear is a single-story 1904 addition, and a second 1978 addition constructed after the house was moved. The exterior walls of the house are divided into panels with horizontal and vertical half-timbering, with clapboard in between. The gables are shingled. On the interior, the first floor contains an entrance hall leading to a staircase, along with a small parlor, living room, a long narrow dining room, a half-bath and an office. The rear addition houses the kitchen and breakfast area. The second floor contains three bedrooms and two bathrooms.

One of them is by law allocated to the German-speaking electoral college and the remaining ones are allocated to the Dutch-speaking and to the French-speaking electoral college in accordance with a population formula, giving them respectively twelve and eight seats, as in 2014.30 JULI 2018. - Koninklijk besluit tot vaststelling van het aantal zetels dat toegekend wordt aan het Nederlandse kiescollege en het Franse kiescollege voor de verkiezing van het Europees Parlement Voters could only vote on the lists depending on the language area they live in. This means that in the bilingual arrondissement of Brussels-Capital, voters could choose whether to vote for the Dutch-speaking or for the French-speaking electoral college. There was an exception to this rule for the six municipalities with language facilities in the Brussels Periphery, whose inhabitants could also opt to vote for French- speaking lists despite being in the Dutch language area. Seats were allocated according to the D'Hondt method in each of the three electoral colleges; however, the German-speaking electoral college de facto used a first-past-the- post system, since it elected only one MEP. The electoral threshold was 5%, which was based on the vote share per electoral college rather than nationally. All Belgian citizens aged 18 or over and residing in Belgium were obligated to participate in the election. Other EU citizens residing in Belgium as well as Belgians living in another EU member state had the right to vote on Belgian lists in European Parliament elections.

Life  Benedetta Day was born in 1914 in Famagusta, Cyprus. She came to the UK when she was ten. A lifelong interest in flying lead her to the Insurance Flying Club in London. Her husband, Charles Henry Willis, was an instructor there when they met. They married in 1938 and started a family. They also bought a plane. Willis worked as an architects assistant. When World War II began her husband joined up and encouraged his wife to join the Air Transport Auxiliary. Willis became a First Officer when she joined up on 1 September 1941. She left Air Transport Auxiliary on 3 August 1943, a year after flying her first Spitfire because she was pregnant. She went on to have a total of four children. In 1949 she was commissioned into the Women's RAF Volunteer Reserve (WRAFVR), as a Pilot Officer. During her 5-year commission, Willis trained to become a RAF-qualified pilot and was duly awarded the RAF pilot's brevet, or 'Wings', on 18 August 1953. She and her husband retired to Bembridge, Isle of Wight. Charles Willis died in 1990 aged 81. Willis herself died in 2008. First five Jean Bird, Benedetta Willis, Jackie Moggridge, Freydis Leaf and Joan Hughes were the first five women to qualify as pilots of the RAF. All qualified in the early 1950s, as officers of WRAFVR, and were awarded the standard 'Wings' of an RAF pilot. There was a gap of nearly four decades until the next woman, Julie Ann Gibson, a regular officer of the WRAF, qualified in 1991.

Written by Noonie Bao, Sarah Aarons and its producers Zedd and Lotus IV, the song was released by Interscope Records on 18 July 2018. Background Initially titled \\"Are You Happy Now\\" and features Norwegian singer Sigrid, the song was first revealed during a cover shoot interview in 2017 with Billboard magazine. On 3 July 2018, Zedd debuted the song at his Zedd in the Park festival, where he brought Elley Duh√© on stage for a live performance. Duh√© posted a short video of the performance on social media with the caption: \\"Not gonna lie my [heart] is pretty full\\". Zedd officially announced the song's release date and unveiled its cover art on 13 July, and later teased the lyrics in multiple tweets. He premiered the song on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show as the World Record of the day. During the radio interview, Zedd explained the reason behind working with Duh√©: \\"I think why I really gravitated towards her was that she had a genuine and honest approach to the song and she felt vulnerable and real.\\" Duh√© said of the song in a press statement: \\"To me, 'Happy Now' is more than just a song. It's a significant moment in my life, the golden opportunity to work with one of the greatest DJ's/producer of our time. Being able to come together with complete strangers to do something beautiful, sing something meaningful, to share something special is what 'Happy Now' is all about.\\" Composition \\"Happy Now\\" is a post-breakup pop ballad, stylized as a \\"vocal-centric pop/electronic hybrid\\". It opens with an acoustic guitar line, before becoming \\"a bounding, chiming pile of percussion\\", eventually ending with \\"Zedd's signature robotic voice\\". The drop features a \\"memorable beat\\" composed of \\"whimsical, multi- toned synths cascading in mid-tempo, mellifluous breakdowns\\". In a press release, Zedd regarded \\"Happy Now\\" as \\"the most organic sounding song [he has] made in a long time\\", noting that the majority of the song was recorded using real instrumentation, specifically \\"a lot of pianos and a lot of guitars\\". Lyrically, he described the song as \\"both happy and sad at the same time\\", while musically, the song \\"rather leans towards a happier, sunnier side\\". Critical reception Rachel Narozniak of Dancing Astronaut called the song a representation of \\"yet another sonic step in a direction opposite the high- powered electro constructions of earlier foundational singles like \\"Clarity\\" and \\"Stay the Night'\\". She noticed a more minimalist melodic arrangement in the song than that in \\"Stay\\" or \\"The Middle\\". Remixes On September 21st, 2018, a remix EP was released containing 5 remixes from DJs Marc Benjamin, DJ duo BEAUZ, DJ duo Duke & Jones, DJ MXXWLL, & DJ duo Magnificence.

In Bannu, a remotely exploded bomb planted in a motorcycle left 5 people dead and 37 others wounded in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Akram Khan Durrani. Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen, an extremist organization, claimed responsibility for the attack. In Mastung, a suicide bomber blew himself up during a rally for the Balochistan Awami Party's Siraj Raisani, the brother of former Balochistan chief minister Aslam Raisani. One of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistani history, it killed 149 people and wounded 186 others. Siraj was taken to hospital in critical condition and died of injuries. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the event and named the suicide bomber as Abu Bakar al- Pakistani, though authorities identified him as Hafeez Nawaz of Abbottabad.Mastung suicide bomber identified as Hafeez Nawaz from Abbottabad  Background   Pre-election violence  The attacks came 12 days before general elections. In the beginning of the month, a bombing took place in Ramzak Tehsil of North Waziristan at the office of Malik Aurangjeb Khan, Pakistan Movement of Justice's candidate for NA-48 (Tribal Area-IX), leaving 10 people injured. A week before the current attack in Bannu, a bomb planted in a motorcycle was remotely exploded at an election campaign of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal's PK‚Äì89 candidate Shein Malik in the Takhti Khel area of the city. Two days prior to the attacks, a suicide bombing at an election rally of the Awami National Party's leader Haroon Bilour in Peshawar left 20 people, including Bilour, dead and wounded 63 others. On 12 July, the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP)'s office in Khuzdar came under gunfire before a bomb detonated injuring 2 people.  ISIL in Pakistan  After the group's defeat in Iraq and Syria, many commanders of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) fled to other countries where resistance was weak. Many fighters headed to Afghanistan where Al-Qaeda was fighting against the United States. Since ISIL's entry intervention in Pakistan, Balochistan has been a focus of its militancy. In 2016, ISIL claimed responsibility for two attacks in Quetta; one in August and the other in October. The following year, it perpetrated a suicide bombing at a shrine in Sehwan. In Mastung that year, the group carried out a suicide bombing to assassinate Deputy Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan Abdul Ghafoor Haideri.  Prior intelligence  Soon after the Peshawar ambush, National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) forwarded 12 threats to federal and provincial interior ministries, following which committee chairman Rahman Malik directed authorities to enhance security of politicians named by NACTA. In its report, NACTA named six politicians that can be targeted. The list included Durrani. The other five politicians included Pakistan Tehreek-e- Insaf (PTI)'s chairman Imran Khan, Awami National Party leaders Asfandyar Wali and Ameer Haider Khan Hoti, Qaumi Watan Party's head Aftab Sherpao and Hafiz Saeed's son Talha Saeed. It also suggested that members of PML-N and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) were under threat.  Prime targets   Mastung  Siraj Raisani was a prominent member of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) and was to contest the next elections from PB-35. The brother of former Chief Minister of Balochistan Aslam Raisani, Siraj has served as chairman of Muttahida Mahaz Balochistan (MMB), founded by his father. He merged MMB into the BAP on 3 June 2018. Earlier, in July 2011, Raisani had survived an assassination attempt after grenades were thrown at him. In the ambush, his son Hakmal Raisani was killed.  Bannu  Akram Khan Durrani has served as chief minister of KPK from 2002 to 2007 and is contesting 2018 elections from NA-35 (Bannu) against Chairman of Pakistan Movement of Justice Imran Khan. Leader of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, Durrani was appointed as Minister for Housing & Works by the President of Pakistan Mamnoon Hussain on the advice of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on 29 August 2013. The current attack follows two previous unsuccessful attempts to assassinate him, one in 2015 and another in 2007.  Attacks   Mastung  Siraj Raisani was about to address an election rally when a suicide bomber, carrying around 16‚Äì20 kg of explosive material in his vest, blew himself up among a crowd of more than 1000 people. Along with Raisani, the explosion killed 128 people. Two days after the attack, on 15 July 2018, the number of dead increased to 149, while 186 other people were injured, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in Pakistan since the APS massacre in Peshawar in 2014.  Bannu  Former KPK chief minister and Jamiat Ulema-e Islam (F) leader, Akram Khan Durrani was coming from an election rally. Due to death threats to Durrani, his security was increased and 40 policemen were deployed in his convoy. When the convoy came near Haved Bazaar, an IED, planted in a motorcycle, exploded near the tire of his vehicle. Durrani remained unhurt. Having taken place 40 meters away from JUI (F)'s rally site, the explosion left 5 people dead and wounded 37 others. There were conflicting views about the nature of the detonation. An eyewitness reported having watched a motorcycle rider blowing himself up, while officials said that the bomb was planted in a motorcycle. RPO Bannu called it a remotely exploded bomb.  Aftermath   Rescue services  Before arrival of rescue teams, people took the injured to hospital via cabs. The ambulances brought survivors to Quetta Civil hospital where a state of emergency was imposed by provincial government. 73 bodies were first transported to the hospital. Later Shamim Akhtar, a hospital official, stated that they were treating 110 victims brought to them. Secretary of Sindh Blood Transfusion Authority (SBTA) Zahid Ansari asked blood banks to provide 1000 blood bags for the victims of the Mastung blast. Ansari was approached by Balochistan Health Department, and urged citizens of Karachi to donate blood, following which mobile messages asking for blood donation started circulating in Karachi. On 14 July 2018, Quetta civil hospital overflowed due to the excess of patients. Beds in the hospital fell short of need and many patients were treated in the corridor of hospital.  Investigations and security measures  On the next day of attacks, a First Information Report (FIR) was registered against the Bannu bombing at the Haved police station. The FIR included charges of terrorism. Caretaker Chief Minister of KPK, Dost Muhammad Khan, formed a seven-member Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to probe the Bannu bombing and apprehend the assailants. 86 teams of Frontier Constabulary containing 3338 security personnel were positioned across the province and another 500 officers from Azad Kashmir were summoned to be deployed in the region. Earlier, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) sought a briefing from NACTA over the Bannu bombing and also sought a report from the caretaker CM, IG and chief secretary of KPK over inadequate security of politicians. After Mastung incident, ECP ordered NACTA's coordinator to appear before it on the following day. ECP declared 17,000 polling stations across the country as sensitive. These included 5,487 from Punjab, 5,878 from Sindh, 3,874 in KPK and 1,768 in Balochistan.  Arrests  On next day of attack, security forces detained two suspects. According to security forces, the suicide bomber, who blew himself up in Mastung, came from Afghanistan two days prior to the attack and stayed in Chaghi. The apprehended duo is suspected to have sheltered the assailant inside their residence. On 19 July, IG Balochistan Mohsin Hassan Butt said the suicide bomber named Hafiz Nawaz was resident of Abbottabad. Nawaz had traveled from Abbottabad to Sindh and therein affiliated with Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ). According to Butt, efforts were underway to arrest Mufti Haider, a facilitator of Nawaz.  Media coverage  On the day of attacks, former Pakistani Prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz arrived in Lahore from Abu Dhabi. The duo's arrival was more in the crosshairs of the Pakistani media, hence it was covered in more detail than the bombings. Initially only a few news channels gave it short coverage but later when the death toll exceeded 100, media started covering it broadly. Many people took to Twitter and criticized the media for sidelining coverage of the bombings. Geo News's journalist Hamid Mir said if these attacks were carried out in Punjab, they would have received much more media coverage.  Responsibility  Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the Mastung bombing. Two days later, ISIL released picture of the suicide bomber and identified him as Abu Bakar al-Pakistani. In a series of statements released on its official news agency Amaq, the organization, referring to Raisani, stated that deceased included one of the Pakistani intelligence officers who was contesting elections. A group called Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen claimed responsibility for the Bannu incident.  Domestic reactions   Government  Caretaker Prime minister of Pakistan Nasirul Mulk condemned the attack and directed the interior ministry to issue a notification declaring Sunday, a day of mourning. Accompanied by Chairman senate Sadiq Sanjrani and caretaker Chief Minister of Balochistan Alauddin Marri, Mulk arrived in Quetta two days after the bombing and condoled the victims in hospital. He also met with Raisani's family and expressed his grief. Interim chief minister of Punjab, Hassan Askari condemned the attack and said that no religion asks for violence against innocent people and that the entire nation was united against terrorism. Marri expressed his grief over loss of lives. Denouncing the massacre, he called it \\"a conspiracy to derail elections\\". He also vowed to beat terror by education. The acting government of Balochistan announced two days of mourning in the province. The national flag was raised at half-mast throughout the province. The caretaker chief minister of Sindh Fazalur Rehman condemned the attack and expressed sorrow over loss of lives. Interim chief minister of KPK Dost Muhammad Khan prayed for injures and expressed sympathies for bereaved families. Denouncing the bombings, he vowed that perpetrators'd be dealt with iron hand. KPK Governor Iqbal Zafar Jhagra denounced both the attacks and prayed for the victims. On 16 July, the senate passed a unanimous resolution condemning the Mastung bombing and expressed grief over loss of lives.  Politicians  Chairman of Pakistan Peoples Party Bilawal Zardari denounced the attacks. He also said that these assaults shouldn't delay elections. Former President Asif Ali Zardari condemned both attacks and expressed his \\"profound grief\\" over loss of lives.

It was created from the defunct Accelerated Poverty Alleviation Agency,http://www.iita.org/wp- content/uploads/2016/12/The-Bulletin-21-February-2014-No.-2212-Special- Issue.pdf and was designed to develop policies and programs that foster youth participation in agricultural entrepreneurship in Ondo State. In 2016, the agency's youth development programs earned the commendation of the African Development Bank.  Partners  WECA has partnered with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, the United States Agency for International Development MARKET II, the Foundation for Partnership Initiative in the Niger Delta (PIND), West and Central African Council for Agricultural Research and Development CORAF/WECARD, the Federal College of Agriculture (FECA), Federal University of Technology, Akure, the Nigeria Cassava Grower Association (NCGA), FADAMA, the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA), United Nations Human Settlements Programme UN-Habitat, Agro Bayu, and SURE-P.  Departments  The WECA programs department is made up of the Livestock Unit, the Arable Cultivation Unit, the Aquaculture and Fisheries Program, which had employed a 100,000 youths in Ondo State by 2014, the Apiculture unit, which is responsible for training of IT students from tertiary institutions on beekeeping and honey production, the Sericulture Section, which produces silk used in the state's production of lawyers' wigs, and the Agro Business Cities Section. Functions WECA exercises management supervisory control over the Ondo State Agro Business Cities ABCs. Through the ABCs, WECA facilitates financial aid for agribusinesses from the state government, and trains youths on modern agricultural methods, while exposing the trainees to the entire value chain of agriculture through the initiatives. WECA designs platforms and implements policies for wealth creation through aggressive promotion of small- scale enterprises and indigenous products and services, via four initiatives known as the Profarmers & Agropreneurs Sustainable Scheme through Agro Business Cities (P.A.S.S.THRU ABC's), the Adiye/Eja WECA Promo, the Made in Ondo Brand Promo and the Wealth Creation Fund. WECA functions to drive industrialization and employment opportunities in Ondo State through the establishment and management of agro allied industries. WECA organizes the Made in Ondo Fair. WECA organized the Youth entrepreneurs with Innovation in Nigeria (YouWin!) business clinic in 2014, and the 9th Western Nigeria International Agribusiness Conference (WESNAGRIC) Summit in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Agro Business Cities (ABC) Under the Mimiko administration, WECA re-modelled the farm settlement concept, introduced by Obafemi Awolowo under the old Western Region, Nigeria, and established four modern farm settlements called Agro Business Cities (ABCs). These settlements include: * Ore Agro Business City in the Odigbo Local Government area in the South Senatorial District * Epe Agro Business City in Ondo East Local Government Area in the Central Senatorial District * Isuada and Auga Agro Business Cities in the Owo and Akoko North East Local Government Areas respectively, in the North Senatorial District. Agricultural practices being carried out in the four Agro business cities include poultry, fishery, cattle rearing, arable farming, sericulture, and apiculture. The Agro Business Cities are established across the state as training and business incubation centres for Agriculture and Agribusinesses, and are mandated with the task of teaching the trainees, under the Profarmers and Agropreneurs Scheme. The ABCs include modern accommodation, amenities, and recreation facilities for participants. The Agro Business Cities are deliberately created to have an ambience, which youths would find attractive. In 2016, the facilities and infrastructure at the business cities were commended by officials of the African Development Bank. The Ore Agro Business City was chosen as the model ABC as a result of its strategic location in southwest Nigeria, and the acquisition of a 30-megawatt power plant for the Ore Industrial City, by the administration. The Ore ABC spans over 3,500 hectares of land, and was upgraded to international standards through its partnership with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture IITA and other institutions in 2014.Agreement signed between Ondo State Wealth Creation Agency (WECA) and IITA for ‚ÄúUpgrading Ondo State Agricultural Village, Ore‚Äù- IITA 2014 annual report, IITA In 2014, the IITA Youths Agripreneurs IYA program and the Wealth Creation Agency Program collaborated to train youths in Agribuisnesses at the Ore Agribusiness City. The Ore ABC is one of the sites for the Ondo State Oil Palm Revolution. The Auga ABC includes a cattle ranch and goatry, for meat production and processing. Thousands of pro-farmers have been trained at the ABCs by WECA. The Profarmers & Agropreneurs Sustainable Scheme (P.A.S.S) The Profarmers & Agropreneurs Sustainable Scheme (P.A.S.S.) was launched on 19 May 2014 by the Mimiko administration. Under the scheme, young graduates are assigned to the Agro Business Cities and other units under WECA for training and practical knowledge. Between 18‚Äì24 months, the trainees are taught the business of agriculture through the entire value chain of agricultural finance, supply of input, production, preservation, and processing, packaging, marketing, distribution, and other services, including export. The Ondo State government provides all the agricultural inputs and basic facilities such as land, accommodation, electricity, and training under the scheme. The participant is paid a monthly stipend, in collaboration with the Nigerian Federal Government under the SURE-P Graduate Internship Scheme (GIS). The Profarmers & Agropreneurs Sustainable Scheme is a participation-ownership scheme where the participants develop agro-enterprises wholly funded by WECA. The trainees are entitled to profits from the proceeds of sale of agricultural products they produce during their stay in the agro business cities, while the capital is injected back into the business. The farm produce is bought at competitive market prices by the Ondo State government.

Description and themes It shows city-dwellers in the countryside pretending to be peasants. In the centre a young man dressed in an elegant doublet and a plumed beret dances what seems to be a minuet with a young woman in a satin dress whilst a musician plays for them. One other couple observes the dancers, another couple whispers to each other and a third plays with a swing. Several details are directly inspired by the work of Peter Paul Rubens - the musician, his neighbour, the shepherd embracing the woman next to him and the dog in the foregroundChantilly, mus√©e Cond√©. Peintures du XVIIIe siecle, p.151.. The affected character of the scene is heightened by the presence of a real shepherd, whose sheep graze in the far right background, almost hidden by bushes. Overall the painting transposes French pastoral poetry of the time into painted form. It refers to Poussin's Bergers d‚ÄôArcadie, but this is misleading since the pastoral paintings by Poussin show a mythological Arcadia peopled by idealised classical shepherds, with no trace of real contemporary shepherds. The shepherds painted by Watteau and written about by Fontenelle are instead 'half-true', as Fontenelle himself later explained: The style is close to the shepherd-lovers and wrapped-up shepherdesses of abb√© Du Bos Alfred Lombard, L‚ÄôAbb√© Du Bos, un initiateur de la pens√©e moderne (1670-1742), Paris, Hachette, 1913, 614 nb. p, p.298..

Background The Initiative was first proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron in his Sorbonne keynote in September 2017. 9 members signed a Letter of Intent to begin work on 25 June 2018.Nine EU states sign off on joint military intervention force, Guardian 25 June 2018 Finland joined the military project on the 7th of November 2018. Aims The ultimate aim of the EI2 is a shared strategic culture that would enhance the ability of its members to act together on missions as part of NATO, the EU, UN or other ad-hoc coalitions. The project is intended to be resource neutral and makes use of existing assets and other joint forces available to members.

There are no specific criteria to a state participating in EI2, but it is built around:European intervention initiative , French Government *Compatibility with the EU and NATO *Common vision regarding security concerns *Ability to deploy liaison officers *Long term efforts in defence *Commitment to European security operations *Ability to deploy effective capabilities. Relationship with PESCO EI2 seeks some synergies with the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) that has newly been established within the European Union's (EU) Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), and PESCO projects are intended to be integrated into the EI2 where feasible. France's concern is that developing the EI2 within PESCO would result in lengthy decision times or watered down ambition. This led to some tensions regarding the project between France and Germany, with the latter concerned that it would harm the EU's political cohesion.

The Uffizi (inv. 1004) and the Wildenstein collection hold autograph copies of the work, but X-ray examination has shown much retouching of the Chantilly version and so it is accepted as the original of the composition. Such collaborations were common - in the 1630s Poussin only produced small private commissions, with foreground figures in his own hand and background architecture by a specialist painter such as Le Maire. The first record of the painting dates to the 19th century, when it was in the United Kingdom, passing through the hands of John Knight, Higginson and Nieuwenhuis before being acquired by the Duke of Aumale. It shows a scene from Plutarch's Life of Theseus. Theseus's mother Aethra and Theseus himself were both born in Troezen. She had had sex with both Poseidon and the mortal Aegeus, king of Athens, in Troezen on the same night. Before leaving her in Troezen to return to Athens, Aegeus left his sandals and sword under a heavy boulder and instructed that - if Aethra's son could lift the boulder and recover the items under it - he must come to Athens to Athens to meet his father. Theseus later managed to do so without effort, as shown in the painting.

May Morn Estates (NZ) Ltd was a London company of investors. They intended to mill the Akatarawa Forest, convert the land to pastoral use and build a township. There was even a long-term plan to extend the tramway to the North Island Main Trunk Railway at Otaki. The mill operated for only about a year from 1914-1915. It was closed on 5 August 1915, after the outbreak of World War I, by which operating funds could not be sent from London to New Zealand. The gullible investors thus lost all their investment (approx NZD $15M or USD $10M in 2017 money). From 1913 the public began to worry about the deforestation and the silting of the Hutt River.Parliamentary Debates. Vol. 164, New Zealand, Parliament, 1913, p. 110. It was desired to bring the May Morn Estate into public ownership. In 1940 the Minister of Scenery Protection and Commissioner of State Forests commented negatively about Tudor Atkinson, a lawyer who had been involved in setting up the May Morn scheme. The Minister had \\"scoundrelly, thieving concerns\\" and said that the government would not help out people who \\"dig their own graves\\". As late as 1950 Arthur Seed, the General Manager of the mill, was still trying to sell the land at an acceptable price. His price expectation was based on logging, but public officials believed that the land was only suitable for preservation purposes.

It is currently on display at the Mus√©e Cond√©.  Description  This painting depicts a scene set in 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars. Under low cloud cover, two rows of cuirassiers await the signal to begin charging, with five non-commissioned officers in front of them also at the ready. They are wearing the distinctly coloured uniforms of the 12th Cuirassier Regiment. On the left, a Division General in a tail-coat and distinctive gold and scarlet sash is pointing in a direction while addressing a cuirassier officer, probably the Colonel of the 12th Regiment. Behind them stand a trumpeter in yellow, an aide-de-camp to the Division General in a hussar-style uniform, and two more cuirassiers. On the right, a group of artillerymen are moving in front of a row of houses. In the far distance, on a hill between the second and third non-commissioned officer from the right, can be seen Napoleon and his chief of staff. Meissonier's intention was not to depict a specific battle, but rather a celebration of the cuirassiers of the First French Empire.  Provenance  The painting was first exhibited at the Exposition Universelle of 1878 in Paris. It was bought for 275,000 francsLes cuirassiers de 1805, avant le combat on the Mus√©e Cond√© website by the Belgian collector Prosper Crabbe, and then passed into the collection of Ernest Secr√©tan. In the 1889 auction of that collection, it was listed as lot 39 and bought for 199,652 francs Henri d'Orleans, duke of Aumale. The painting is later donated, alongside the rest of his collection and property, to the Institut de France with the rest of his collection; it now forms part of the Mus√©e Cond√©.

Ralf Wohlleben (born February 27, 1975 in Jena, Germany) is a German Neo-Nazi and was a supporter of the terrorist group Nationalsozialistischer Untergrund (NSU). He was deputy state chairman and press spokesman of the Nationaldemokratischen Partei Deutschlands (NPD) in Thuringia and chairman of the district association of the NPD Jena. He is one of the leading Neo-Nazis in the Free State of Thuringia. On July 11, 2018, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Personal life Ralf Wohlleben worked as an IT-specialist for system integration. Politically, he has been active since the mid-1990s. Until 1999 he was in a relationship with a woman from Jena's right-wing extremist scene. In 2014, the governmental Investigation Committee of Thuringia on the NSU stated, that the Thuringian State Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Amt f√ºr Verfassungsschutz Th√ºringen) temporarily procured this woman, in order to obtain information from Wohlleben. Wohlleben is now married and has two children. NSU On the 29th of November 2011, the Federal Prosecutor arrested Ralf Wohlleben because of the murder series of the NSU in Jena. In the mid-90s he founded the \\"Kameradschaft Jena\\" together with Uwe Mundlos, Uwe B√∂hnhardt and Beate Zsch√§pe and was active with them in the so called \\"Thuringian Homeland Security\\". With around 20 other Neo-Nazis, Wohlleben also took part in a meeting with Zsch√§pe and B√∂hnhardt during this time, in which crosses were burnt in the style of the US Ku Klux Klan. In 1998, Wohlleben should have played a key role in the submergence of the NSU trio. As the \\"most important supporter\\" during this time, he therefore kept in touch by phone with B√∂hnhardt, Mundlos and Zsch√§pe and should have supported them financially in their flight. For this purpose, he should have given them donations from solidarity concerts and taken out a loan for them. Wohlleben's name also appeared on an address list, which could be secured by the authorities and contains 35 addresses and telephone numbers of alleged contact persons of the NSU. In criminal matters, Ralf Wohlleben is accused of aiding and abetting the six NSU killings by \\"procuring a 'firearm and ammunition' to the 'NSU' in 2001 or 2002, the 'courier' on his behalf as 'NSU' members brought \\". According to the Federal Prosecutor's Office, \\"he is said to have known about the terrorist crimes because of his persistent connection to the group living under false identity\\". Wohlleben was the only alleged NSU helper who was consistently remanded during the NSU trial. The detention conditions of Wohlleben, who was remanded in Tonna, Thuringia, were tightened in early September 2012. He was said to have bypassed the post office control in prison, trying to influence witnesses and co-accused persons as well as trying to escape. Concretely, Wohlleben should have tried to contact the neo-Nazi scene, which was apparently partly successful. In October 2012 he was transferred from Thuringia to Munich. One year after the Nazi terror series became known, the Federal Prosecutor's Office filed an indictment on 8 November 2012 against Ralf Wohlleben for aiding and abetting the murder in six cases. Wohlleben is represented by lawyer Nicole Schneiders, who during her studies in Jena in the years 2000 and 2001, according to her own information, was a member of the NPD \\"for a short time\\", because she was of the opinion that \\"a defensive democracy does not need a party ban\\". While Wohlleben at that time was district chairman, Schneiders held the office of deputy district chairman and should also have had contacts with the free comradeship scene. In addition, Schneiders was active until its prohibition in the aid organization for national political prisoners and their relatives (HNG). The law firm Harsch and colleagues pronounced the termination to Schneiders in December 2011, due to \\"the enormous public pressure\\". Wohlleben is represented next to Schneiders by the Cottbus lawyer Olaf Klemke, a third mandatory lawyer rejected the Munich court. From 6 May 2013 Wohlleben had to answer in court in the NSU trial. After it became known that the main defendant Beate Zsch√§pe wanted to get involved in the allegations in December 2015, Wohlleben's lawyers announced in November 2015 that this would also testify. In his testimony, he denied being involved in the procurement of the murder weapon and said he regretted any violent act. He concluded his statement with the words: \\"The relatives of the victims is my compassion.\\" On July 11, 2018, Ralf Wohlleben was sentenced to six years 'imprisonment for murder and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. On the 18th of July 2018, Wohlleben was released from custody after six years and eight months. The court saw as well as the Federal Prosecutor's Office in view of the maximum still to be served detention period of three years and four months, no more risk of flight. During Wohlleben's imprisonment, both the Neo-Nazi Internet portal Altermedia and Andr√© Kapke and the NPD politician Karsten H√∂hn participated in the campaign for freedom for \\"Wolle\\", where \\"Wolle\\" is the nickname of Wohlleben.

After Pavel Vasilyevich, the estate passed into the order of his son Katon Pavlovich. In 1829‚Äì1830 the new owner lodged in these territories of 200 peasants which came from the village of Ushakovka of the Oryol region. Katon Shabelsky was a large landowner ‚Äì he possessed 17 807 tithes of the earth in the territory of the villages of New Margaritovka, Semibalki, Shabelsk and Port-Katon. In the 1860s, the manor had already another owner, his son is Nikolay Antonovich Shabelsky. It brought to the village from another manner of 13 families which lived in the Kharkiv province earlier. Approximately in the second half of the 19th century the mansion was built. About development and appearance of the estate of the landowner Shabelsky at the end of the 19th century a note in \\"The Taganrog bulletin\\" in which it was said that in the village of Semibalki wide streets, tidy houses, and the estate of the landowner Shabelsky differs in reserved style and fancy constructions was published. At this time the owner practically did not live in the estate. When the manor became Pavel Nikolaevich Shabelsky's property, Vladimir Mikhailovich Turkin was appointed the managing director. It was engaged in affairs of the estate and provided with earnings of peasants: the fish plant of Turkin provided to fishermen of a tackle in exchange for fish, at the same time the catch made in winter time, peasants could keep. It is known that after 1912 Turkin constructed two-cool school in Semibalkakh. He married the servant, the peasant Anna Serdyuk, in the 1920s at spouses the son was born. In 1924 the family Turkinykh was dispossessed and sent into exile. Economic constructions and church were destroyed, but the house in which there lived the landowner ‚Äî remained, and often it was called not the house of Shabelsky, but Turkin's house. Till 1956 in it there took place church services, then it was a warehouse and office.

The brand is sister with Desjardins Financial Security, and both of them regroup under the banner of Desjardins Insurance.They now serve customers in three provinces of Canada: Quebec, Alberta and Ontario. DGI is one of the property and casualty leaders in Canada, and in 2014, Desjardins General Insurance ranked third for customer satisfaction in Quebec.  About  Their main products are auto insurance, home insurance and business insurance, and are available through agents in the Desjardins Caisses network, Client Care Centres, website and mobile app.  History  In 1944, Desjardins Group's first subsidiary was created under the name of \\"Soci√©t√© d'assurance des caisses populaires (SACP)\\", today rebranded Desjardins General Insurance. It was created to meet everybody's need, from their members to themselves: it offered in a single-contract protection against fire, hold-ups, burglaries and write-offs. In 1987, in order to save their insurance company that was having financial problems, they completely turned around their business model and launched direct insurance. Insurance was now available directly through the caisses and call networks. It is considered to be \\"one of the most controversial developments to hit the industry\\", because it affected not only the Desjardins Group, but also the traditional brokerage network territory. They almost had to shut down, and had to go to court to defend their rights before their model was accepted. In 2008, DGI extended their home and auto insurance services outside their usual range to include the Ontario sector. In 2014, Desjardins Group acquired the Canadian operations of State Farm to become the second-largest property and casualty insurer in Canada. Until 2018, all 1.2 million customers in Ontario, Alberta and New Brunswick were still served under the name of State Farm, but on May 1, 2018, Desjardins officially started a campaign to rebrand State Farm Canada as Desjardins Insurance Agents. The transition is to be done by December 31, 2019.  The Personal  Founded in 1974, The Personal is subsidiary of Desjardins General Insurance and a Canada property and casualty (P&C;) group insurer that specializes in home insurance and auto insurance. They offer multiple services to their partners, and are specialized in offering group exclusive rates. They represent over 700 public and private organizations, professional orders and unions across Canada. \\"It prides itself on high customer satisfaction, with 96% of respondents saying they are satisfied after making a claim and 95% of insurance holders renewing their policies each year. The renewal rate is one of the highest in the insurance industry.\\"  History  In 1974, in Canada, The Personal created the auto and home group insurance concept. The concept of group insurance was popular for life policies, but for the first time the concept was applied to cars and homes. Auto and home were then the only products offered; later The Personal broadened their range of services to include other products, such as recreational vehicles, travel and pets. On May 2 of 1986, The Personal (then called The Security), was reaching an agreement with the Centrale de l'enseignement du Qu√©bec (CEQ), who were looking for a group insurance. This agreement signed the official start of the history of group P&C; insurance in Quebec.  Prices and distinctions  According to a J.D. Power study about customer satisfaction with home insurance, The Personal ranked first in Quebec in 2015. The same study in 2018 for the auto insurance sector also ranked the company as first in Canada.
