From a design by Walter Hayward, modeled by Albert Hallam This is a list of Royal Doulton Bunnykins figurines. Doulton & Co. (Royal Doulton) introduced the Bunnykins figurines in 1939 with six original Bunnykins figurines designed by Charles Noke based on illustrations by Sister Mary Barbara Bailey. Shortly thereafter, and prior to World War II, Doulton & Co. discontinued their manufacture. After Royal Doulton purchased the Beswick Pottery factory in 1969, Royal Doulton reintroduced the Bunnykins figurines. After the closure of Royal Doulton factory in England in 2005, Bunnykins figurines are produced in Asia. The Bunnykins figurines are in ascending order and include the name of the figurine, designer/modeler, date introduced, and the date discontinued. ==Original Bunnykins 1939== * D6001 - Billy Bunnykins * D6002 - Mary Bunnykins * D6003 - Farmer Bunnykins * D6004 - Mother Bunnykins * D6024 - Freddy Bunnykins * D6025 - Reggie Bunnykins ==Figurines DB1 to DB99== {  width=\\"85%\\" border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" - ! width=5%  Number ! width=40%  Title ! width=30%  Designed by/Modeled by ! width=5%  From ! width=5%  To - DB1 Family Photograph Walter Hayward/Albert Hallam 1972 1988 - DB2 Buntie Helping Mother Walter Hayward/Albert Hallam 1972 1993 - DB3 Billie Cooling Off Walter Hayward/Albert Hallam 972 1987 - DB4 Sleigh Ride Walter Hayward/Albert Hallam 1972 1997 - DB5 Autumn Days Walter Hayward/Albert Hallam 1972 1982 - DB6 Clean Sweep Walter Hayward/Albert Hallam 1972 1991 - DB7 Daisie Springtime Walter Hayward/Albert Hallam 1972 1983 - DB8 Dollie Playtime Walter Hayward/Albert Hallam 1972 1993 - DB9 Storytime Walter Hayward/Albert Hallam 1972 1997 - DB10 Busy Needles Walter Hayward/Albert Hallam 1973 1988 - DB11 Rise and Shine Walter Hayward/Albert Hallam 1973 1988 - DB12 Tally Ho!

It was contested by Brazilian club Flamengo and Chilean club Cobreloa. The first leg of the tie was played on 13 November at Flamengo' home field, with the second leg played on 20 November at Cobreloa'. Flamengo won the series after winning a tie- breaking playoff 2-0 at Montevideo's Estadio Centenario. ==Qualified teams== {  - !Team !Previous finals appearances (bold indicates winners) -  Flamengo None -  Cobreloa None } Both teams came into the finals as first-time finalists of the Copa Libertadores. ==Format== The finals will be played over two legs; home and away. The team that accumulates the most points ‚Äîtwo for a win, one for a draw, zero for a loss‚Äî after the two legs will be crowned the champion. If the two teams are tied on points after the second leg, a playoff in a neutral venue will become the next tie-breaker.

The event draws over 1,300 artisans who offer over a million pieces for sale, which represent all of the state‚Äôs major handcraft traditions. It also includes other events such as a handcraft competition, exhibition of indigenous dress, food and other traditions, concerts, dance and more. The event is centered on the very large main plaza of the city of Uruapan, but extends over to adjoining streets and to other plazas in the city. ==The tianguis== La Calavera Catrina figures from Capula at the market The tianguis (open air market) runs during Holy Week, officially beginning on the day before Palm Sunday and runs until the day after Easter Sunday, with the most important day being Palm Sunday (Domingo de Ramos). This is a major vacation period in Mexico, and the event draws visitors from Mexico and abroad. It is the largest handcrafts event in Michoac√°n, followed closely by the D√≠a de Muertos Fair in P√°tzcuaro, and it is claimed to be the largest of its kind in Latin America. In 2015, the event drew over 1,300 artisans from all over the state, especially the Pur√©pecha highland region, from towns such as Tzintzuntzan, San Jos√© de Gracia, Capula, Hu√°ncito, Patamban, Santo Tomas, Cocucho and Paracho. It is the most important event for the four major indigenous communities of Michoac√°n (Mazahua, Nahua, Otomi and Pur√©pecha). However, not all vendors are the artisans themselves, some are resellers. Section of the market selling maque and textiles The tianguis fills the large main plaza (Plaza de Mart√≠res de Uruapan) of the city and overflows to adjoining streets and other plazas such as Morelos Plaza, Huatapera Plaza and the Garcia Ortiz alleyway next to the Casa de Cultura (cultural center). Related events occurs in these areas as well as the Plaza de la Ranita, the Casa de Cultura, and the entrance to the Barranca de Cupatizio National Park. In 2015, there were over one million pieces for sale, representing all of the major handcraft traditions. These include textiles and traditional clothing, miniatures, jewelry, toys, furniture, lacquered gourds, chests, leather goods, iron, other metals, and the various types of ceramics produced, and those from stiff fibers such as wicker and palm fronds. Most of the items for sale are of high quality and are of styles only found in Michoacan such as clay pots from Huancito with animal heads, needlework from Charan, pre Hispanic lacquerware (maque) from Uruapan, copper pieces from Santa Clara del Cobre and wooden masks from Pamatacuaro, but there are some stands selling mostly tourist and cheap items. For Palm Sunday, there are even more craftspeople, mostly Pur√©pecha, on the atriums of the two main colonial churches, weaving palm fronds into intricate designs for churchgoers. ==Related events== Pur√©pecha children representing their community at the event in 2015 Over its history, the tianguis proper has since been expanded with other cultural events such as music and dance performances, a parade of artisans, a food exhibition featuring the traditional cuisine of the Pur√©pecha and more. The week is inaugurated with a parade of artisans and others in traditional dress, representing the four indigenous peoples found in the state, representing 45 communities and 25 Michoacan municipalities. The parade also include artisans with examples of their wares such as those from Santa Clara del Cobre, Pamatacuaro and Paracho along with marching bands and mojigangas (large cartoner√≠a puppet figures) . The parade runs from the National Park to the center of the city along Culver City and Emilio Carranza streets, ending at the Casa de Cultura. Corundas (similar to tamales) steaming in a huge vat at the Plaza de la Ranita The Casa de Cultura host‚Äôs the state‚Äôs main handcraft competition, where winners are announced on Palm Sunday. In 2015, the competition awarded over a million pesos in prizes in 259 awards. On the same day there is the State Regional Costume Festival held at the Huatapera Museum, in which all four indigenous communities are represented, both in dress and traditions such as dance. At the Plaza de la Ranita, there is a demonstration and sale of traditional Pur√©pecha food, which includes pozole, corundas, atole, enchiladas, bu√±uelos, uchepos (tamales of sweet corn) and fish dishes. The goal of this is to provide example of more traditional and less tourist foods. Atole includes the atolenuitede from San Miguel Pomocuaran, which is salty and spice with serrano chili peppers. Churipo is a beef soup, atole de pinole (with toasted corn), tamales de chapata, made with amaranth seed. ==History== The event is located in Uruapan, which has been an important commercial center since the pre Hispanic period because it is centered among the major Pur√©pecha regions (Lake, Purepech highlands, Ca√±ada de los Once Pueblos and Ci√®nega de Chapala), as well as between the highlands and the ‚ÄúTierra Caliente,‚Äù the lower elevations that extend to the coast. The area has been an important one for trade since the pre Hispanic period as it is centered among the major Pur√©pecha regions (Lake, Purepech highlands, Ca√±ada de los Once Pueblos and Ci√®nega de Chapala). The original tianguis was dedicated only to pottery. which lasted for two or three days on Melchor Ocampo Street onto Santiago Street and the Izazaga Plaza. Later, this area was remodeled to create the current Morelos Plaza. This posed a problem for the vendors until the current event was established in 1960. ==References== Category:Arts in Mexico Category:Annual events in Mexico Category:Spring (season) events in Mexico ","title":"Palm Sunday Handcraft Market"},{"id":"46316693","text":"Our Lady of Mount Carmel is the name or patron saint of many churches.

Based on tooth structure, researchers have speculated that this species may have been a small herbivorous animal that ate very hard plants. The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) has a special craniodental structure that serves as a durophagous feeding adaptation for bamboo, and a similar tooth structure was also found in K. beatrix, indicating that this species may be the oldest relative of the giant panda and might have resembled it in appearance. == Diet and feeding adaptation== Unlike most of the Ursoidea species, K. beatrix had strong distal cusps on the premolars and a relatively forward-positioned metaconid. In addition, K. beatrix had a more strongly developed sectorial blade in the trigonid, and relatively shorter second molar talonid. These traits indicate a need for pronounced chewing and grinding, and suggest that these enhanced molars and premolars were evolved to more efficiently break down hard plant tissues. The fossil records for these teeth structure suggest that the early development of the distal and mesial cusps on the premolars of K. beatrix may indicate an evolutionary trend towards more complex premolars for the plant-feeding Ursoidea species, and may explain why extant giant pandas have very complex molars. == Extinction == A hypothetical explanation for the extinction of K. beatrix is based on climate and environmental changes. In the early Turolian, high precipitation and humid environments in Western Europe favored smaller plant-feeding animals like Kretzoiarctos species. However, severe climate changes during the late Miocene led to widespread extinctions. A crucial event in this period is the Messinian salinity crisis, a huge decrease in Mediterranean Sea level due to evaporation and desiccation. This has been put forward as a possible cause for the significant decline in Ursidae species diversity in the late Miocene, including the species of the genus Kretzoiarctos. == References == Category:Miocene bears Category:Prehistoric mammals of Europe ","title":"Kretzoiarctos beatrix"},{"id":"46316729","text":"LGen Brian Lachlan Melville Smith CMM CD (born April 22, 1939) was a Royal Canadian Air Force officer.

Padr√≥n) is a poet, writer, editor and translator. She was born in Havana on December 8, 1939. She left Cuba in 1961. Since then she has lived in many cities, including Washington, Caracas, Madrid, New Orleans, Miami, and Boston, where she currently resides. From 1989 to 1992 she was Visiting Professor at Tulane University. She is considered one of the most important contemporary Cuban and Latin American poets. The late Nicaraguan poet Pablo Antonio Cuadra hailed her as \\"one of the outstanding voices of Cuba‚Äôs pilgrim culture. Book after book Juana Rosa Pita has been creating a mysterious realm of love and prophecy: an island of enchantment where words restore all that hatred turned to ashes\\". == Example == Her ars poetica can be illustrated in a grain of poetry, using her words, a sip of light: {  Puede uno contentarse   One can be content -  con poco en la vida  with little in life -  siempre que el poco sea inmenso. if that little is immense. } == Poetry and prizes == In 1975 Pita won first prize for Latin American poetry from the Institute of Hispanic culture in Malaga, Spain. Since then she has published over two dozen titles, first under the seal of Ediciones Solar, \\"itinerant editorial\\" (in the words of Octavio Paz) which she co-founded with David Lagmanovich and sustained for ten years with over 26 books of poetry published by twelve different authors. In 1981 she gave a lecture and reading tour to several universities in Germany and traveled to Caracas as a special guest of the II Congress of Writers in Spanish Language. Her poetry has been widely studied, partly translated to seven languages; mostly to English and Italian; and included in international anthologies such as Poetisch Rebellieren (Kassel: Werkstatt Verlag, 1981); New Directions in Prose and Poetry 49 (New York: New Directions Books, 1985), translated by Donald D.Walsh; A Century of Cuban Writers in Florida. (Pineapple Press: Sarasota, 1996), Doscientos a√±os de poes√≠a cubana/ 1770-1990/ Cien poemas antol√≥gicos (La Habana, 1999), La p√©rdida y el sue√±o (Ed.

Juana Rosa Pita travels frequently to Italy, and also writes and publishes poetry in Italian. In 1985 she was awarded the VIII Premio Pisa Internazionale Ultimo Novecento in the section 'Poeti nel mondo \\"(\\"it is so significant for Italian literature at the beginning of the century the life force of her poetry composed with an exemplary harmony, brilliant, concise and new, because it pursues no balancing of fashion, but springs from an expressive sensitivity orchestrated with an original rhythm \\"). Two years later in 1987 she was awarded the 'Culture for Peace' Premio Alghero. On both occasions she was guest of honor at the Congress of Poets and Critics held in Sardinia, Italy. In 1993 she received the poetry award ‚ÄòLetras de Oro‚Äô of the Iberian Studies Institute in Coral Gables. More recently she participated as a special guest in the congresses of the Universit√† degli Studi di Firenze \\"La parola stuadiata e creata\\" - Celebration of Hispanicism, and \\"Cuba dentro e fuori\\" - Cuban literature of the XIX and XX centuries (May 2007 and May 2008, respectively). She has edited and prologued works such as the second edition of El pan de los muertos and the first edition of Cartas √† la carte, both by Enrique Labrador Ruiz. Her poems, essays and articles can be found in publications in America and Europe, from La prensa literaria in Managua and Vuelta in Mexico to Cuadernos del Matem√°tico, Alhucema and Diario de Cuba, from Spain. She has translated several works from the Italian, including essays by Paolo Spinicci and Miguel de Unamuno, as well as poems by Antonia Pozzi and Valerio Magrelli. Two Latin American composers have created, with some of her poems, art songs and other compositions: Cartas Interdimensionales by German C√°ceres and \\"Epigramas\\" by Diana Arismendi. == Work ==  Poetry collections  * Pan de sol.

Shoichet , is a Canadian science professor, specializing in chemistry, biomaterials and biomedical engineering. She was Ontario's first Chief Scientist. Dr. Shoichet is a biomedical engineer known for her work in tissue engineering, and is the only person to be a fellow of the three National Academies in Canada. In 2019, she was elected to the UK's Royal Society. == Education == Shoichet studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and received her bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1987. She attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst for her doctoral studies and earned her PhD in polymer science and engineering in 1992. == Career == After receiving her doctorate, Shoichet joined the faculty of Brown University as an adjunct professor, while simultaneously working in industry. Shoichet joined the University of Toronto in 1995, where she remains as of 2019. Her work includes tissue and polymer engineering, focusing on drug delivery and tissue regeneration. Early in her career, she studied the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Her lab's methods involve using a gel to deliver drugs to a specific location in the central nervous system and to bypass the blood-brain barrier. The drugs delivered in this way include chemotherapy drugs and agents to slow or reverse damage from a stroke. This delivery method is also being tested with stem cells, and include studies on the use of hydrogels that deliver stem cells to nonfunctioning retinas. These hydrogels are designed to be easily injectable into the tissue and they then form a scaffold for cells to grow in the appropriate three-dimensional shape. In 2015, Shoichet co-founded Research2Reality to showcase scientific research in Canada through a combination of accessible blog posts and short videos. She has also curated the \\"Artful Science\\" exhibit at the Toronto Pearson International Airport. In November 2017, Shoichet was named as Ontario‚Äôs first Chief Scientist by then Premier Kathleen Wynne. She was leading a team of six to build connections between the federal government, science and business sectors, and promote the use of evidence in policy development. On 3 July 2018, Shoichet was dismissed from her position by the newly appointed Conservative government. == Honors and awards == In 2010, Shoichet was one of 30 people to be awarded the Order of Ontario. Shoichet was the North American recipient of the L'Or√©al-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science in 2015 for her work on regeneration of nerve tissue, and in developing direct drug delivery methods for the spinal cord and brain using novel materials. She has advocated for women in science and women professors. The University of Toronto designated her a \\"University Professor\\" in 2014. She is the only person to be a fellow of the three National Academies in Canada. The University of Toronto also honored her in 2013 as an \\"Inventor of the Year\\". She is the 2017 winner of the Kalev Pugi Award of the Chemical Institute of Canada.Kalev Pugi Award Chemical Institute of Canada. Retrieved 2016-12-18.

For close to three decades, Kelemu and her team's research has contributed to addressing agricultural constraints in Africa, Asia, Latin America and North America. Since 2013, Kelemu has been the Director General of the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology,International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology, Retrieved 2017 Africa's only institute dedicated to research on insects and other arthropods. Previously, she was the Director of Biosciences eastern and central Africa (BecA); Vice President of Programs at the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), and Leader of Crop and Agroecosystem Health Management at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). Kelemu has received many international accolades including: the L'Or√©al-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science in 2014; Fellow, TWAS ‚àí The World Academy of Sciences; honorary doctorate by Tel Aviv University, in May 2016; recognition as one of Forbes Africa top 100 most influential African women, in May 2014; mentioned as one of 10 most influential African women in agriculture by the Journal of Gender, Agriculture and Food Security (AgriGender Journal) and election as a Fellow of the African Academy of Sciences. Her other honours include: CIAT's Outstanding Senior Scientist Award; Friendship Award granted by the People's Republic of China and the TWAS Prize for Agricultural Sciences, by TWAS, The World Academy of Sciences. ==Early life== Segenet Kelemu was born in the Ethiopian town of Finote Selam in 1957. Her parents sent their daughters to school, where Kelemu, though exuberant; prone to challenging and contradicting teachers, demonstrated self-determination and, above all, academic prowess. She was fortunate to have teachers who recognized and nurtured her potential. Like many other children in her village, Kelemu was expected to help out with farming chores. Moreover, from an early age, she displayed a strong sense of responsibility, and as a result, her mother assigned her the task of selling farm produce in the market; certain that she would negotiate the best prices and keep the money safe. Thus, Kelemu learnt the hard truths about agriculture: its back breaking labour‚Äîespecially for women, as well challenges to productivity, which placed people in her community in a constant struggle to meet minimum households food needs; but amidst all, the sector's potential. As a result, she felt a calling to seek solutions for agricultural constraints. Therefore, though an all-round top grade student, Kelemu decided to dedicate herself to science and agriculture. ==Education== Segenet Kelemu from \\"The Mind of the Universe\\" series In 1974, Kelemu became the first woman from her region to join Addis Ababa University‚Äîwhere she was one of five girls in a class of 200‚Äîgraduating, on top of her class, with a Bachelor's degree in 1979. She then proceeded to Montana State University USA, where she earned an MSc in plant pathology and genetics in 1985, before joining Kansas State University, for a PhD in molecular biology and plant pathology in 1989. Her PhD thesis was titled Molecular cloning and characterization of an avirulence gene from Xanthomonas campestris pv. oryzae. Kelemu undertook postdoctoral research on the molecular determinants of pathogenesis at Cornell University from 1989 to 1992. ==Career== Between 1992 and 2007, Kelemu worked at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Colombia, first as a Senior Scientist, and later Leader of Crop and Agroecosystem Health Management. Her research focused on elucidation of molecular determinants of host-pathogen interactions, development of novel plant disease control strategies including genetic engineering, biopesticides, pathogen population genetics and dynamics, endophytic microbes and their role in plant development. In August 2007, Kelemu decided to return to Africa, determined to contribute her experience in applying cutting-edge science to developmental issues, towards resolving the continent's problem. She accepted a position as the Director of the Biosciences eastern and central Africa (BecA) Hub. Under her leadership, the BecA initiative was transformed from a contentious idea into a driving force that is changing the face of African biosciences. BecA's research capacity, staff, facilities, funding, partners and training programs have expanded at an ever accelerating pace. She has assembled and inspired a scientific and technical team bound by a common passion for using science to enhance Africa's biosciences development. In 2013, Kelemu joined the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) as Vice President for Programs for about a year. In November 2013, Kelemu became the Director General of the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe), Africa's only institution dedicated to research on insects and other arthropods, which is headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya. She is the fourth chief executive and the first woman to head the institution.

He was a two- time Southeastern Conference Scholar-Athlete of the Year, and in his sophomore year earned all-America honors when he finished 10th individually at the 2011 NCAA Championship. In 2010 he was named to the SEC All-Freshman team. He served as a mainstay in the Razorback lineup during his college career with 48 tournaments played, a 73.37 career stroke average and nine top-10 finishes. Cook was the runner-up at the NCAA Fayetteville Regional in 2013, earning him all-central region accolades. ==Professional career== Cook turned pro in 2014. He finished T-130 in Web.com Tour Q-school, but never got to play a Web.com Tour event due to his finish in Q School and limited status. In the summer of 2014, he made it into the FedEx St. Jude Classic through Monday qualifying, finishing tied for 13th place, at 5-under-par. Cook has played on the Adams Pro Tour. His career earnings as of April 1, 2015 were over $100k. In April 2015, Cook made it into the Shell Houston Open through the Monday qualifier, finding himself in contention in short order. With a 4-under-par 68 on Thursday, Cook made a strong close on Friday, with four consecutive birdies to win a spot in the final group along with Andrew Putnam and Phil Mickelson. On Saturday of the tournament, Golfweek said Cook \\"did not fold under the pressure of playing alongside Phil Mickelson,\\" and carded a 2-under 70 as he headed into Sunday's final round one off of Jordan Spieth's lead, tied for second place at 203 with first-round leader Scott Piercy and Johnson Wagner. On the final day, Cook finished at ‚àí10 and tied for 11th, one position short of automatic entry into the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, the next full-field PGA Tour event. His earnings for the tournament were $135,000. At the 2015 Barbasol Championship, Cook Monday qualified his way to a T6 finish. That gave him entry into the RBC Canadian Open, where he finished T7. Cook earned enough non-member FedEx Cup points to qualify for the 2015 Web.com Tour Finals. He ended the Finals 51st among players who had not earned their cards through the regular season, one place short of full Web.com Tour status and avoiding Q School.

The night before he leaves, he is getting oral sex from his new girlfriend Marjorie (Marla Sokoloff). The relationship does not last. Amanda (Kaitlin Doubleday) is another incoming freshman from Pittsburgh and is getting dropped off at a sorority house by her mother, a legacy member of the sorority. Amanda has a sorority scholarship to go to the school. Clay goes to a party with his friend Matt (Mike Erwin), where he meets Amanda and tries to hook up with her, only to lose her to another man. Clay returns home only to notice that his roommate hanged himself. Clay and Matt move in. Amanda's sorority is going through the initiation process. Each pledge must draw from a hat and find a man described on the piece of paper to get to fall in love with her. Amanda's selection is a gay man. The mission is for them to bring their dates to a party in 3 weeks and dump them. Clay and Matt go to check out the sorority Amanda is in. Clay concludes that they need to become frat boys in order to go out with one of those girls. They try to join a fraternity. When they are passed out, a frat member drags them by their feet, strips them naked, and puts them in a sleeping bag together and places them in the quad for them to be humiliated. Now everyone in school thinks they are gay. Amanda is searching out a gay guy to go out with and when she sees Clay, realizing that he was one of the two guys in the sleeping bag, goes up to talk to him, thinking he's gay. Clay slips up and claims that he is. Now that he's claimed to be gay, he goes out to learn more about homosexuality and how to be a gay person, including joining the on-campus LGBT club and going to a gay bar. Clay asks the bar owner Rodney (John Goodman) how to be gay and is given instruction on everything, including how to dress and how to act. Clay and Amanda go out to a club where Clay sings on stage. Their friendship continues to blossom. Amanda kisses Clay, but then regrets it shortly afterwards because she still thinks he's gay. Clay tries to tell her the truth when she's in his dorm room, but she leaves before that opportunity. Amanda wants to back out of the deal she was under, but Serena, the sorority head, threatens to kick her out. Once again, Clay tries calling Amanda to come clean that he's not really gay. Sherman, whom he met at the gay bar, assaults him for not going out with him. Clay is knocked out and taken to the hospital, where he recovers quickly. His friend Brennan, who found him knocked out, thinks the fraternity brothers did it and tries to tell it to a campus police officer. Brennan goes to the LGBT Club and claims that Clay was gay bashed and that the campus police are covering it up. The Club therefore thinks a hate crime was committed and they arrange to have all of the historically oppressed minority groups unite and go fight against the fraternity. Meanwhile, Amanda tries to prevent Clay from going to the upcoming party because she doesn't want to break up with him. Clay nevertheless shows up and after seeing a number of break ups on the spot, realizes that it was a set-up and dumps Amanda. He returns and discovers that Matt is gay. When walking across campus the next day, Clay sees posters up with his picture on them, claiming him to be the victim of a hate crime. He sees Marjorie, who's now lesbian, putting up one and asks her to take it off. He also reveals to her that he's not even gay and she gets mad. Clay sees Professor Jackson in the library and she reveals that she knew the whole time that he wasn't gay. After a talk with her, he decides to go make up with Amanda. He shows up at a fraternity house, where a party is being held, and sees a brawl going on between the minority groups and the fraternity and sorority. He gets on stage and gets everyone's attention. He reveals that Sherman was the attacker and the LGBT Club members get mad at Sherman. Clay reveals to everyone that he's not gay and that he's in love with Amanda. He tries to get everyone in the room to reconcile, but they start rioting when a black woman is called ‚Äúdyke‚Äù. Amanda storms out of the house. Clay tries to get back with her, but she still leaves and decides to go back to Pittsburgh. Clay goes back to the gay bar where he reveals to Rodney that he wasn't gay and that he was only pretending in order to get Amanda to like him. He asks Rodney if he's mad, who responds by saying that he isn't and feels honored to hear a straight man wanting to be gay. Amanda, who has lost her scholarship but got a job at a make-up counter, is seen sitting at a bus stop. Clay goes up to her and tells her that pretending to be gay made him a better person. They rekindle their relationship and Amanda, having already missed her bus, misses the next bus, in order to spend a little more time with Clay. ==Cast== *Sam Huntington as Clay *Kaitlin Doubleday as Amanda *Marla Sokoloff as Marjorie *Mike Erwin as Matt *Heather Matarazzo as Jessica *Jud Tylor as Serena *John Goodman as Rodney ==Release== Critical response Home of Phobia received mixed reviews from critics.

It forms the coastline of the suburbs of Cleveland and Ormiston in the City of Redland. ==History== Estate map of Raby Bay Estate, 1885 Aerial photography of the Raby Bay canal estate, 2015 The bay was named by the surveyor James Warner on 1 July 1841, after the Duke of Cleveland who was also known as Baron Raby. In 1864 Queensland's first lighthouse was constructed on Cleveland Point. Now heritage-listed, the Cleveland Point Light remained in use until 1974. In October 1885, there was a land sale to the south of Raby Bay known as the Raby Bay Estate. 16 subdivided allotments were auctioned by James R. Dickson & Company. In June 1979 the Queensland Government approved a canal estate development in Raby Bay which would expand the suburb of Cleveland into the bay using land reclamation to create waterfront building sites for prestige residential and commercial purposes with canal access to Raby Bay for recreational boats moored either at the individual properties or in marinas. Construction commenced in 1983 and the first stage was officially opened on 23 November 1984 with 158 blocks to be sold at prices between $53,000 to $96,000 each. The canal estate was marketed under the name Raby Bay and this name is commonly used as a neighbourhood name to distinguish this land from that of the rest of Cleveland (of which it is officially part). As with other canal estates in Queensland, the Redland City Council finds itself under pressure to provide for maintenance of the canals in these canal estates as the original development company no longer exists. In 2014, it was estimated up to 23 kilometres of canal wall were in need of repair. The owners of the properties in the canal estate claim they should not have to pay a levy as the canals are not part of their land and should be maintained by the council in the same way as roads. However, other residents in Redland City do not believe that their rates should be increased to pay for expenses associated with residents who chose to purchase land in a canal estate. ==Environment== Raby Bay is known for its seagrass meadows, which support the local dugong population. The canal estate development destroyed seagrass meadows, mangroves and roosting sites for migratory wading birds. However, there are signs the seagrass is recovering in Raby Bay with sightings of the dugongs within the canals. However, larger populations of dugongs can be found in the Ormiston parts of the bay which have not been so affected by development. ==References Category:Bays of Queensland Category:Cleveland, Queensland Category:Ormiston, Queensland Category:Moreton Bay ","title":"Raby Bay"},{"id":"46317211","text":"Steven Schoenberg (born October 17, 1952) is an American composer, songwriter, film composer, and pianist.

After graduating, he left the band and landed a job in Manhattan, writing television and radio commercials for music production agency Sherman and Kahn. == Career == For children's television, Schoenberg has composed songs for Sesame Street and scored animations for the Children's Television Workshop's 3-2-1 Contact and short films for the 1999 PBS TV series Zoom. In 2005, he composed music for the award-winning children's book and CD My Bodyworks, written by his wife, Jane. He was one of the executive producers as well as musical director and composer for Kid Quest, a children's TV pilot airing on WGBY-TV/PBS. It won the 2007 New England Emmy Awards for Best Director and Outstanding Children's Program. In 2014, Steven and Jane formed Learn With A Beat, LLC, partnering with 21iLab, located in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, to produce and develop interactive and educational iOS, and Android apps, whose mission is to inspire and challenge young children. Their debut series, My Bodyworks, designed for five- to nine-year-olds, launches in 2015, inviting kids to understand and discover how their bodies work, in playful and creative ways. As a musical theater composer, Schoenberg saw his first musical, It's 11:59, written with Songwriters Hall of Fame lyricist Edward Eliscu, premiere in August 1980 at Lucille Lortel's The White Barn in Westport, Connecticut. In 2001, Schoenberg's musical, Haunted‚Äîbook by Marilyn Stasio, lyrics by Diane Seymour‚Äîhad a reading at New York University produced by Goodspeed Opera House, East Haddam, Connecticut. Also in 2001, Family Album: A Musical Reminiscence, a dramatic song cycle for eight performers, with poetry by Paul Mariani, premiered at The York Theatre Company, Citicorp Center, New York City, directed by Michael Montel. In 2004, The Independent, a musical with book and lyrics by Steven Scott Smith, based on the occult film of the same name, had a reading at CAP21 in New York City. His recent film scores include the POV/PBS documentary, Farmingville (2004); A Class Apart (2009), for the PBS series American Experience; the HBO documentary Monica & David (2009); and the feature film Graceland (2012), which he scored with his son, Adam Schoenberg, premiering at the Tribeca Film Festival. In concert, Schoenberg is best known for his piano improvisations. A 2010 review in Time Out New York described Schoenberg as \\"a pianist with a staunch commitment to pure improvisation,\\" performing \\"heartfelt solo pieces that range from the bluesy to the rhapsodic.\\"Time Out New York, May 7, 2010 == Recordings ==  1980‚Äì2000  Schoenberg recorded his first album of piano improvisations after Western MA-based radio station WRSI began airing a tape recording of a concert he had performed, opening for David Mallett. Because of the overwhelming response from that radio play, Schoenberg produced a concert at Buckley Recital Hall at Amherst College in December 1982. The concert sold out in less than 24 hours. Schoenberg asked renowned recording engineer Pat Jacques to record the concert, and Jacques brought in the Live From Lincoln Center sound truck. Schoenberg subsequently formed Quabbin Records in 1983 and released Pianoworks (Quabbin 1001), with selections from the concert. It debuted on Radio & Records Jazz National Airplay chart March15, 1985 at Number 28, ultimately reaching Number 9. After its release, National Public Radio's Lee Thornton said, \\"I think Steven's music is some of the most incomparably beautiful music I've ever heard. When I listen, I am transported‚Ä¶ to someplace very peaceful. If I were to be banished to an island and could take music, his would be among what I'd choose‚Ä¶ and if there were only two choices, Schoenberg would be one!\\" Thornton, Lee, Senior Host, Weekend Edition (1983). All Things Considered, National Public Radio. In 1984, Schoenberg recorded his second Quabbin album, Three Days in May (Quabbin 1002) at Dick Burwen's sound studio in Lexington, Massachusetts. Co-produced by Schoenberg and David Sokol, the album received widespread praise. The album was named among 1985's Top 10 records in The Boston Globe. A review in Down Beat referred to the album as \\"an eloquent, lush, and flowing series of improvisations that are spliced together to form sequential states of mind. (Schoenberg) claims that the performances are completely spontaneous, and if that's so, they are within strict melodic and rhythmic frameworks.\\" Diliberto, John (September 1985). Down Beat. p. 36 Reflecting on his early career, a Hearts of Space article described Schoenberg as: Soon thereafter, Schoenberg \\"was approached by Brian Carr, who was Keith Jarrett's manager, but declined signing with him, later signing with Ted Kurland Associates in 1985.\\" Kurland's roster at the time included Chick Corea, Sonny Rollins, and Pat Metheny.Ted Kurland Associates, artist roster, 1985 Six months after signing, Schoenberg tore ligaments in the fifth finger of his right hand and his career came to a sudden end. It was during the next three years that he started scoring documentary films for networks including PBS, BBC, and HBO. He performed other concerts in 1990 and 1994, but because of the chronic injury, his improvisational process became compromised and he stopped performing for years, turning toward composing for musical theater, film scores, and children's music.  2000‚Äì  In 2005, Steven and Jane Schoenberg were asked by Target Corporation to participate in the company's 2005 children's book tour to present a stage show featuring songs from their newly recorded My Bodyworks CD. The songs teach young children about their bodies and health awareness. The Schoenbergs published the songs as a book, also called My Bodyworks. It reached Number 9 on Amazon's Top 100 bestsellers in August 2005. Author Eric Carle described My Bodyworks as \\"a splendid book for all the senses... the illustrations are lively and delightful,\\" while author Jane Yolen called the book, \\"a delicious combination of talents: lyrics, music, and facts all together.\\" After years of physical therapy, Schoenberg returned to the stage to record his third album, Steven Schoenberg Live: An Improvisational Journey (Quabbin 1003). The concert was recorded at Sweeney Hall, Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts, and released in 2009. It was reviewed in Jazz Weekly, All About Jazz, and Stereophile, where the magazine's music editor wrote: Schoenberg's latest album, 2014's Christmas Reimagined, features his improvisational style around classic holiday songs and carols. Recorded in Los Angeles at Sonic Veil studios, it is Schoenberg's first album not to appear on Quabbin Records. A review in All About Jazz calls the album, \\"a collection of refined miniatures played with grace and humor.\\" == Composer for award-winning projects == Read- A-Loud Rhymes For The Very Young: * Knopf Book and Cassette Classic, published by Alfred A.

The work was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic while Stucky was their composer-in-residence for the inaugural season of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. It was completed in 2003 and was first performed on March 12, 2004, with the conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen leading the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The piece was awarded the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Music. ==Composition== Background Stucky conceived the piece as a celebration of his musical influences. Thus, the work freely references passages from many previous classical works.Stucky, Steven (October 2003). Coming Home: On Writing a Second Concerto for Orchestra. Retrieved April 4, 2015. In 2003, Stucky elaborated: Stucky also assigned letters of the alphabet to pitches in order to form a musical code in the first movement. He wrote that the first movement \\"enshrines essential personal loyalties, using musical code to refer to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, my musical home for almost sixteen years, and to many of the people most important to me there.\\" Structure The Second Concerto for Orchestra has a duration of approximately twenty-five minutes and is composed in three movements: #Overture (with Friends) #Variations #Finale Instrumentation The work is scored for three flutes (second doubling alto flute, third doubling piccolo, three oboes (third doubling English horn), three clarinets (third doubling bass clarinet), two bassoons, contrabassoon, four French horns, four trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (anvil, bass drum, bongo drums, chimes, Chinese cymbal, glockenspiel, large triangle, Latin cowbells, marimba, snare drum, suspended cymbals, tambourine, tamtam, tom-toms, vibraphone, wood blocks, xylophone, whip), harp, piano, celesta, and strings. ==Reception== Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times called the concerto a \\"colorful, delight- bringing score\\" and praised the references to other classical works, commenting, \\"The strongest impression throughout the concerto ‚Äî which has a richly expressive, exquisitely tinted variations movement in the center and a rollicking final movement ‚Äî is of Stucky's sumptuous ease with the orchestra. He makes the transition from Ravel's sound world to Salonen's not only natural but fresh, the way new blooms always are. This is music of eternal springtime.\\" Reviewing the premiere recording by Lan Shui and the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, Richard Whitehouse of Gramophone praised Stucky's \\"fastidious orchestral sense\\" and added, \\"those looking for contemporary music that is approachable but never facile will find undoubted rewards here.\\" ==Discography== A recording of the Second Concerto for Orchestra performed by the National Orchestral Institute Philharmonic, conducted by David Alan Miller, was released June 2018 and was nominated for a Grammy Award in the field of \\"Best Orchestral Performance.\\" An additional recording of the Second Concerto for Orchestra, performed by Evelyn Glennie and the Singapore Symphony Orchestra under conductor Lan Shui, was released April 27, 2010 through BIS Records and features Stucky's other orchestral works Spirit Voices and Pinturas de Tamayo. ==References== Category:Concertos by Steven Stucky Category:2003 compositions Stucky 2 Category:21st-century classical music Category:Pulitzer Prize for Music-winning works Category:Music commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic ","title":"Concerto for Orchestra No. 2 (Stucky)"},{"id":"46317469","text":"Sassafras tzumu (Chinese sassafras, Cha mu) is a species of Sassafras native to China, in Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Yunnan and Zhejiang.

The leaves are alternate, gray-green, ovate or obovate, 9‚Äì18 cm long and 6‚Äì10 cm broad with 2-7 centimeter, slender, reddish petioles. Leaves may be two-lobed or three-lobed. Flowers are yellow and about 4 millimeters with blue-black and white waxy fruit. One historical source reports trees of up to 100 meters (330 ft), although this is not corroborated by modern sources. Sassafras tzumu and Sassafras randaiense differ from the North American species in that they may have both male flowers with 3 staminodes and 1 rudimentary pistil, and female flowers with 12 staminodes on the same tree, while the North American species (see Sassafras albidum) are dioecious (individual plants bear only male or only female flowers). Molecular data also supports some differences between the Chinese and North American species. Like those of Sassafras albidum, Sassafras tzumu's leaves may have 2 or 3 lobes, although leaves with 3 lobes occur more frequently in S. tzumu while they are possible but rare in S. albidum.Arboretum Trompenburg: Sassafras photo ==Uses== The bark of Sassafras tzumu is durable fine-grained and yellow. The wood is used in shipbuilding and furniture making because of its durability. The plant is used for medicinal purposes, to treat rheumatism and trauma. Essential oils may be extracted from bark, roots, or fruit, and contain a 1% concentration of phenylpropene safrole. According to other sources, the bark of Sassafras tzumu contains a particularly large quantity of safrole oil at 97%, making it valuable for those wishing to use the oil for commercial purposes or for the purposes of producing illicit drugs. == See also == * Sassafras albidum * Sassafras randaiense * Sassafras hesperia * Chinese medicine ==References * Category:Lauraceae Category:Medicinal plants Category:Trees of China ","title":"Sassafras tzumu"},{"id":"46317495","text":"Lake Crystal is a lake in Blue Earth County, Minnesota, in the United States. The city of Lake Crystal, Minnesota is located near this lake. == History and Information == Lake Crystal was named after its crystal-clear water by John C. Fremont and J. N. Nicollet. Lake Crystal, also known as Crystal Lake, was the second lake that the founders of the town of Lake Crystal landed upon during their 1854 exploration. One such founder, William Riley Robinson, settled near the shore of Crystal Lake. Crystal Lake throughout history has been the center of recreation, travel, and resources. In 1893 the Lake Crystal Boat Club built a pavilion at what is now Robinson Park. As well as launching a steamboat named the 'New Era' in the same year. The New Era carried 25 passengers on daily, twenty minute trips throughout the lake. The ship is believed to have sunk near the southwest shore of the lake. In the late 1800s to early 1900s, the harvesting and sale of ice from Crystal Lake was a major business. Throughout Crystal Lake's history multiple land fill projects slowly polluted the lake, along with the nearby farming. The Crystal Waters Project is an organization that has cleaned not only Crystal Lake, but other Lake Crystal water systems as well. In 2013, 2014, and 2017, projects by the Crystal Waters Project restored the coastline of Robinson Park. In 2015, 97,000 pounds of carp were removed from Crystal Lake and surrounding bodies of water. Two floating filtration islands were launched into Crystal Lake to filter and clean the water. In 2019, Robinson Park was rededicated and a new fishing dock and erosion garden were added along the lake. alt= Crystal Lake viewed from Robinson Park in 1956, when Robinson Park was a popular swimming beach Crystal Lake is the largest of the three lakes near the town of Lake Crystal. Multiple Parks and natural areas are still located along the lake, including private landings and homes. The Lake Crystal Cemetery is located on a peninsula completely surrounded by Crystal Lake. The largest park on the lake is Robinson Park, which is one of the most popular parks in the town of Lake Crystal. Robinson Park includes a boat landing and a fishing pier. ==See also== * List of lakes in Minnesota ==References== Category:Lakes of Minnesota Category:Lakes of Blue Earth County, Minnesota ","title":"Lake Crystal (Blue Earth County, Minnesota)"},{"id":"46317505","text":"Joan Namazzi Kagezi (14 July 1967 to 30 March 2015), was a Ugandan lawyer and prosecutor. At the time of her death, she was the assistant director of public prosecution and head of the International Criminal Division in Uganda's Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs. ==Background and education== She was born Joan Namazzi to Kaggwa Sserwadda and Mrs. Sserwadda of Luteete Village, Rakai District, on 14 July 1967. She attended Nsuube Primary School from 1973 to 1980. She studied at Mount Saint Mary's College Namagunga, an all-girls boarding senior secondary school in Mukono District, for both her O-Level and A-Level education. In 1987, she entered Makerere University to study law, graduating in 1990 with a Bachelor of Laws degree. In 1992, she earned a Diploma in Legal Practice from the Law Development Centre. At the time of her death, she was pursuing a Master of Business Administration from the Eastern and Southern African Management Institute. ==Career== Throughout her 23-year career as an attorney, Kagezi served as a public servant with the government of Uganda. Straight out of the Law Development Centre in 1992, she secured a position as land officer in the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development. In May 1994, she was appointed a state attorney in the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs. She received a promotion in February 2002 to principal state attorney. In August 2007, she was promoted to senior principal state attorney. In January 2015, she was appointed head of the International Crimes Division, at the rank of assistant director of public prosecutions. ==Death== On 30 March 2015, at about 7.30 pm local time, Kagezi, who was driving an official Ford double-cabin pick up with government number plates without security, stopped at a road-side stand to buy fresh vegetables in the Kampala suburb of Kiwaatule. Her intended final destination was her home in the adjacent neighbourhood called Najjera. In the pick-up with her were three of her four children, two girls and one boy. One of the girls left the vehicle to pick up the products while the rest of the family stayed in the vehicle. While the girl was walking back to the car, a man approached the truck. He knocked on the driver's window which was closed, appearing to be making an inquiry. When Kagezi opened the window, the man shot her twice in the neck at close range, jumped on the back of a waiting motor cycle (boda boda), and sped off. She was rushed to Mulago National Referral Hospital, where she was pronounced dead on arrival at about 8.00 pm. She was 47 years old. ==Case load== Among the high-profile prosecutions that Joan Kagezi participated in or led, over her 21 years as a government prosecutor were the following: * The prosecution of Ugandan-born Australian cardiologist Aggrey Kiyingi for the assassination of his wife, lawyer Robinah Kasirye Kiyingi. She was gunned down in July 2005 outside the gate of the family mansion in Buziga, an upscale neighbourhood in Uganda's capital Kampala. The state lost that case. * The trial and conviction of former Arua Municipality, Akbar Hussein Godi, whose wife was killed on 4 December 2008 in Mukono District. In February 2011, Godi was sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted of murdering Rehema Caesar Godi, who was 19 years old at the time of her death. * The prosecution and conviction of Kampala businessman Thomas Nkulungira, also known as \\"Tonku\\", whose girlfriend was killed sometime between 21 and 30 December 2010. Her body was dumped in the septic tank at Nkulungira's house in Muyenga, a Kampala neighborhood. On 13 August 2011, a judge sentenced Tonku to death for capital murder. * The prosecution of Thomas Kwoyelo, a warlord in the Lord's Resistance Army, on charges of kidnapping, murder, rape, and human mutilation and torture. The trial was terminated when Uganda's Constitutional Court granted Kwoyelo amnesty. On appeal, however, the Supreme Court of Uganda reversed that decision on 8 April 2015, sending the case back to the Uganda High Court for trial. * The prosecution that was ongoing when Kagezi died of 13 individuals accused of participating in the July 2010 Kampala attacks, which occurred during the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final match, killing at least 79 people. ==Family== While an undergraduate at Makerere University in the late 1980s, she met her future husband, Henry Morton Kagezi. He died of natural causes in 2006. Together, they had two boys and two girls: George Phillip Kagezi born in 1993, Carol Milcah Kagezi born in 1994, Pearl Priscilla Kagezi born in 1999, and John Harvey Kagezi born in 2004. President Yoweri Museveni has pledged to pay the children's school fees until each child determines that he or she decides to end his or her education. ==Search for her killers== On 8 April 2015, a heavily armed force of Ugandan and U.S. security officials apprehended Jamal Abdullah Kiyemba, an individual formerly held in Guantanamo. While there was no conclusive evidence tying Kiyemba to the killing of Kagezi, detectives were questioning him about his possible role in that crime and a range of other offenses. ==See also== * Kale Kayihura * Kahinda Otafiire * Aronda Nyakairima * Jim Muhwezi ==References== Category:1967 births Category:2015 deaths Category:People from Rakai District Category:Ugandan lawyers Category:Ugandan women lawyers Category:Ganda people Category:Makerere University alumni Category:Law Development Centre alumni Category:Eastern and Southern African Management Institute alumni Category:People educated at Mount Saint Mary's College Namagunga Category:Ugandan Christians Category:Deaths by firearm in Uganda Category:Assassinated Ugandan people ","title":"Joan Kagezi"},{"id":"46317507","text":"Graghanam () is an unreleased Tamil supernatural crime thriller film directed by Elan and produced by Big Print Pictures Production.

It was filmed and produced at locations in France and Switzerland, and bases on the 1985 novel Sweetheart by Andrew Coburn. == Plot == The French detective superintendent Christophe Vade (Patrick Bruel) investigates the murder of an elderly French couple in the French Alps. In the course of his investigation he encounters Jeanne Gardella (Mathilda May), the wife of the businessman Antoine Gardella (Jacques Dutronc), a member of organized crime, and the son of the murdered couple. Antoine Gardella and his wife Jeanne live harmoniously, but Jeanne Gardella was forced by Thurson (Vernon Dobtcheff), a dubious agent of Interpol to her \\"role as wife\\" in the context of an undercover action against the European organized crime. Despite his criminal background, Jeanne loves her husband. Thurson also urges Christophe Vade to investigate Gardella and his wife in connection with the murder of those parents, and to get an additional pressure medium to gouge Jeanne Gardella to continue that farce. Thurson does not explain that plan either to inspector Vade or Jeanne Gardella, who fell in love, finally tolerated by Antoine Gardella who accepts that his wife was forced to that undercover action by Thurson. Tightly interwoven with the main story, the subplot plays in the milieu of the Swiss city of Z√ºrich, and the advances of the brutal and corrupt city police officer Scatamacchia (Hans Heinz Moser) against a hostess allow a very personal view on Scandurat (Bruce Myers), Gardella's business partner and close friend.

In the late 1970s he was a founder of Radio Chicano, a community and student broadcasting organization based at Cal State Santa Barbara. Rizo started on Santa Barbara commercial radio station KIST AM, doing a public affairs show called La Voz De La Raza that aired Sunday mornings from 1975 to 1976. He served as program director for two years. Rizo hosted a radio show called Barrio Salsoul from 1976 to 1982, on the UC Santa Barbara campus radio station, KCSB, and was the program director at KCSB in 1978.

While a student at University of California, Santa Barbara, UCSB, Rizo began spinning music and interviewing people on Santa Barbara top-40 commercial radio station KIST AM, producing a public affairs show called La Voz De La Raza that aired Sunday mornings in 1975 to 1976. From 1976 to 1982, Rizo worked at the UCSB student radio station, KCSB FM, broadcasting the weekly radio show Barrio Salsoul, and serving as the radio station program director in 1978. Some of his earliest radio interviews included Cal Tjader, Los Lobos, Gato Barbieri, and Carlos Santana. Rizo was the founder of Radio Chicano, a community and student broadcasting organization based at KCSB (UC Santa Barbara) that produced daily Chicano/Latino programming. Rizo was influenced early in his career by Chico Sesma, a pioneer Latin music disc jockey and bandleader, who became a friend and mentor. Sesma was the first to bring the mambo and cha cha cha to radio audiences in Los Angeles in the 50s and 60s. Another significant influence on Rizo's career was Chuck Niles, the only jazz disc jockey honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Dedicated to bringing a more authentic approach to Latin jazz to radio, in 1990, Rizo approached public radio station KLON 88.1 about producing a regular program. After an audition, and a recommendation from Poncho Sanchez, the station invited him onto the airwaves, and his show Jazz on the Latin Side became a success, debuting on Sunday night, January 7, 1990. About a year later the show switched to Friday nights. Rizo served as program director for the station from 2007 until 2010. The success of the radio show Jazz on the Latin Side led to a series of successful yearly productions like the KLON Latin-jazz Club Caravans and'KLON Cinco de Mayo Latin-jazz Dance Concerts. Rizo was also the founder of the KJazz High School Jazz Festival. Besides the best in Latin jazz, Rizo had frequent live interviews with guests like Cachao, Kenny Burrell, Horace Silver, Mongo Santamaria, actor Andy Garcia, Eddie Palmieri, Poncho Sanchez, Gerald Wilson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hubert Laws, Al McKibbon, Willie Colon, and Marc Anthony. In the mid-1990s he was invited to participate in Grammy Award committees and later, Latin Grammy Award committees. Rizo has been an integral part of the yearly Central Avenue Jazz Festival since its inception in July 1996. Through the years he has served as artistic director alongside such jazz luminaries as Buddy Collette and Teddy Edwards. He has worked with Los Angeles jazz greats such as Gerald Wilson and Ernie Andrews. Rizo received the Jazz Journalists Association's 'A' Team Award for support of the Central Avenue Jazz Festival in 2007. Rizo was co-founder and artistic director of the Luckman Fine Arts Latin Jazz Concert series (2000-2005), where he produced yearly Latin jazz concert events with such as Eddie Palmieri, Jerry Gonzalez and the Fort Apache Band, Poncho Sanchez, Dianne Reeves, Ozomatli, Tolu, Los Lobos, and Francisco Aguabella. In 2004, Rizo and his wife Leticia started Saungu Records. Rizo is the artistic producer of the L. A.

Recognized as an authority on the works of Richard Wagner, he served as a consultant to the Bayreuth Festival from 1951 until his death four years later. He was the husband, accompanist and, voice teacher of Swedish soprano Astrid Varnay, whose career he managed to international success. He also served as accompanist and vocal coach for soprano Kirsten Flagstad for many years. ==Life and career== Trained at the Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Musik, Weigert began his career working as a vocal coach at the Magdeburg Opera and at Theater L√ºbeck. He left those posts to join the conducting staff at the Berlin State Opera in 1920 where he worked with Dimitri Mitropoulos, Otto Klemperer, George Szell, and Heinz Tietjen. While conducting in Berlin, he simultaneously worked as a professor at the Royal Berlin Academy of Music. Due to his Jewish ancestry and the rise of the Nazi party in Berlin, Weigert resigned from his post at the Berlin State Opera in 1934. After working for a brief period in South Africa, he joined the staff of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City where he worked as the chief vocal coach and accompanist for the German repertoire. At the Met he became known as an expert on the works of Richard Wagner, and became the primary vocal coach to sopranos Kirsten Flagstad and Astrid Varnay; the latter of whom he married in 1944. In 1948 Weigert left his post at the Met and returned to Europe with Flagstad and Varnay where he helped orchestrate a successful international launch to his wife's career, beginning with the Royal Opera House in London. In 1951 Varnay made an acclaimed debut at the Bayreuth Festival where she appeared annually for the next seventeen years. Weigert served on the musical staff of the Bayreuth Festival from 1951-1955.

He is best known for his oil painting that depicts Julia Gardiner Tyler, the second wife of the 10th U.S. President John Tyler. Anelli's monumental masterpiece and most acclaimed painting, entitled The End of the World, has been lost. ==Early life== Anelli was quite celebrated in his own time, especially for his monumental work called The End of the World. He was born in Italy and emigrated to New York City from Milan about 1835. Almost immediately Anelli attracted a good deal of attention, not for his portraits, but for his gigantic apocalyptic historical pictures, beginning with his rendering of a family group during the Deluge, which was the principal work in an exhibition of his pictures shown in rooms at the New York Athenaeum on Chambers Street at the end of 1836. ==Portrait style== Anelli's portrait style is distinctive‚Äîin its sharp linearity, bright lighting, and highly reflective surfaces‚Äîand appears the antithesis of the dominant romantic approach to portraiture practiced contemporaneously by Thomas Sully (1783‚Äì1872), Henry Inman (1801‚Äì1846), and Samuel F. B. Morse (1791‚Äì1872). Anelli's manner corresponded to that practiced by other immigrant Italian and German painters such as Spiridione Gambardella (active 1838‚Äì39), Gherlando Marsiglia (1792‚Äì1850), and Christian Mayr (about 1805‚Äì1851), whose works are all relatively little known today. In 1839 the painter-critic John Kenrick Fisher (born 1807) distinguished these portraitists, along with Charles Cromwell Ingham (1796‚Äì1863), as the practitioners of an exceptional and distinctive style, which he denounced as \\"prompted and encouraged by an aberration of the public taste.\\" In 1843 Anelli had on his easel Conrad and Medora (unlocated) taken from Lord Byron's Corsair, while his most acclaimed painting was the Opening of the Sixth Seal, or The End of the World (unlocated), which was shown at the Apollo Rooms at 410 Broadway in New York City in April 1844. This picture‚Äîwhich offered the light and promise of Christianity as humanity's only spiritual salvation in the face of utter annihilation‚Äîdisplayed lurid light effects complete with dark clouds, bloody skies and lightning, and centered on a figure representing the church, or the spouse of Christ, with a crumbling temple and a bewildered and terrified multitude of sinners, both repentant and unrepentant, in a \\"grand catastrophe\\". The picture, hailed in the press as the largest painting in America‚Äîmeasuring 23 feet by 19 feet‚Äîwas described as a masterwork and considered the \\"Boldest attempt at the highest effect in art, which has yet been made on this side of the Atlantic.\\" Anelli toured his masterwork through the northeastern United States and continued to create allegorical compositions derived from historical and biblical sources. In the early decades of the 19th century, apocalyptic fascination was manifest visually by such artists as Benjamin West, Rembrandt Peale, and Washington Allston. The End of the World, which was exhibited in New York, Boston, Portland, Maine, and Brooklyn from 1844 through at least 1850, attests to this continued apocalyptic tradition. Anelli, whose stated aim was \\"to represent a great catastrophe to the world\\" and not \\"a doctrine\\", claimed he had no wish to engage in arguments with philosophers or naturalists concerning the particulars of this catastrophe. ==Diogenes Successful== In the New York Crystal Palace at the World's Fair‚Äîheld in New York City in 1853‚Äîhe showed Diogenes Successful (unlocated), wherein Diogenes had finally located his truly \\"honest man\\" in the person of George Washington. ==Boston Athenaeum, and the National Academy of Design== When Anelli first began to contribute paintings to the annual exhibitions held at the Boston Athenaeum and the National Academy of Design, New York, he showed only portraits. Probably the most notable of these is the depiction of Julia Gardiner Tyler (1820‚Äì1889), the second wife of the 10th U.S. President John Tyler. ==Portrait of a Child as Cupid== Anelli's oil painting, Portrait of a Child as Cupid, depicting young William Paterson Van Rensselaer, Jr., Anelli's Portrait of a Child as Cupid‚Äîdepicting William Paterson Van Rensselaer, Jr.‚Äîwas painted in New York City and was commissioned by the subject's father, William Paterson Van Rensselaer, Sr. (1805‚Äì1872). The picture was lent by him in 1847 to the annual exhibition held by the Albany Gallery of Fine Arts, of which Van Rensselaer was an honorary member. The painting, which descended in the family, may have hung in the Rensselaer Manor House in Albany and almost certainly hung in both the Elk Street town house built by William Paterson Van Rensselaer, Sr., at the time of his first marriage in 1833 and then in Beverwyck, in Bath (now Rensselaer), New York, which Van Rensselaer built after inheriting the Rensselaerswyck estate lands on the east bank of the Hudson river, following the death of his father, Major General Stephen Van Rensselaer III, on 26 January 1839. During the late 1830s, Anelli also painted portraits of William Paterson Van Rensselaer, Jr. (Private Collection); his sister, Euphemia White Van Rensselaer (1816‚Äì1888; Private Collection); and his sister-in-law, Mary Rebecca Tallmadge Van Rensselaer (1817‚Äì1872; Albany Institute of History and Art). Anelli's records of other sitters suggest that he drew his patronage from New York State citizens of upper classes. In Portrait of a Child as Cupid, Anelli presents Van Rensselaer, Jr. in a spectacularly theatrical manner, revealed triumphantly by the parting of the heavy red draperies. The Empire period ormolu daybed‚Äîwith its gold embroidery and tassels‚Äîbespeaks high-style furniture such as that produced concurrently by Charles-Honor√© Lannuier, Joseph Meeks (1771‚Äì1868), and Antoine-Gabriel Quervelle (1789‚Äì1856). With the bow and quiver of arrows by the side of the bed, the artist identifies the child with Cupid as a symbol of love, a conceit similar to that chosen later by William Henry Rinehart (1825‚Äì1874) in his statue of Henry Elliot Johnston, Jr., Cupid with a Bow, 1874 (National Museum of American Art in Washington, D.C.). ==Death== Anelli died in 1878. His diary is on display at the Frick Art Reference Library in New York City. ==Gallery== Garret- Hasbrouck-By-Francesco-Anelli-c.1838.JPG oil by Anelli of Garret Decker Hasbrouck (1810‚Äì1888) Julia Lawrence 1809-1873, painted by F.

The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) ‚Äì 1. Shyampukur, 2.

A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government. With the implementation of the Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation was enlarged. Certain areas were already there but more parts of them were added (current spellings) - Entally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watganj and Ekbalpur, and Garden Reach and Tollygunj.

He was a leading community figure in Canberra from inception until 1939 when he returned to Melbourne. He is best known for his time heading the Department of Shipping and Transport. In 1920, he played four games with the Essendon Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL). ==Life and career== McFadyen was born on 29 October 1892 in Melbourne, the son of Alexander McFadyen, railway worker, and his wife Mary Elizabeth. They lived in the suburb of Ascot Vale. Charles was the eldest of three children, with two sisters, Doris and Maude. The family name is Scottish, with the McFadyens a sept of the Maclaine clan and with ancestral association with Mull, one of the Scottish Inner Hebrides. Charles attended Moreland State School and in 1906 won one of eight scholarships awarded by the Victorian Education Department. He attended Scotch College in 1907. The following year he joined the Victorian public service as a telegraph messenger and in 1911 following success in the Commonwealth Public Service Clerical Examination was appointed a clerk in the Department of Trade and Customs at its railway shipping shed, Spencer Street. McFadyen was an active and gregarious young man, nicknamed 'Chub' because of his solid build and complexion. He was a member of the Flemington Presbyterian Church youth group, the Jolly Beggars (after the cantata by Burns), played sport, notably cricket and Australian Rules Football, and enjoyed summer visits to the beach at Frankston. The Australian Natives Association with its requirement of Australian birth became a lifelong involvement with its debating contests and involvement in topical issues. Charles was president of the Flemington Branch in 1915, aged only 22, and again in 1922.  Sport, Military and war service  In 1911, McFadyen joined the Victorian Scottish Regiment, trained at Albert Park and went on marches and bivouacs with the 52nd Battalion. On 12 May 1915 he enlisted in the First Australian Imperial Force with the Second Australian Casualty Clearing Station (2nd ACCS), 8th Field Ambulance. McFadyen was photographed in military uniform at this time and described as tall with brown hair, blue eyes and 'of good physique and military appearance.' On 23 November the unit embarked on the troop ship Ceramic with McFadyen as a Warrant Officer First Class bound for Egypt, en route to Gallipoli. Owing to the evacuation he spent nearly three months in Egypt before being moved on to France and the Western Front in the early summer of 1916. The commander of the 2nd ACCS was Lieutenant Colonel Harold Skipton Stacy, who recruited McFadyen. The unit was, in Charles' later recollections, the most efficient of its kind in forward battle areas in WW1. Stacy was a Sydney Hospital surgeon who brought practical experience and the latest methods to bear on the treatment of the wounded in the field. In this he received strong support from the Australian Red Cross. Stacy enlisted specialist personnel and secured resources for the work. McFadyen, who was a soldier, was one of the unit's few non-medical officers and involved in general administration. Casualty clearing stations were located typically at rail heads or transportation hubs in forward areas. Their role was to provide emergency treatment and to move the wounded back to stationary and general hospitals. Because of the static trench warfare that developed in France in the early summer of 1916 the 2nd ACCS became more of a stationary hospital. 'We were established on a Belgian farmer's property at Trois Arbres near Steenwerck alongside the railway from Bailleul to Armentieres. With the aid of engineers and Belgian labourers the field was quickly transformed into a modern operating centre within 10 miles of the front line and less in a few places.' Stacy had arranged for an X-ray plant, technician and engineers from the Sydney Hospital. He set up a workshop that made splints and thigh cases and, eventually, the station was supplied with electric light. The X-ray plant was the first of its kind in any CCS in France. A steam cooker from the Red Cross supplied food. Qualified surgeons and physicians were added. It was 'the showpiece of the Army Corps and there were continual inspections by high-ranking French and British military and medical personnel.' McFadyen recalled that 'Stacy was far too good for the ordinary run of medical officers' and that he returned to Australia 'without proper recognition.' Stacy contracted influenza early in 1917 and applied for release citing financial and family reasons. This was granted and his appointment terminated on 19 July 1917. The unit he had established continued, however. McFadyen was promoted Lieutenant Quartermaster with the 8th Field Ambulance based at Albert Somme, France, in February 1917. He attained the rank of Quartermaster and Honorary Captain in August 1918. McFadyen saw the war's brutal consequences first hand and would have experienced many of the privations and dangers of field life in forward locations. At the same time he was not involved directly in the fighting, working instead in administration and provisioning. He enjoyed periods of leave in Paris, Belgium and, notably after the Armistice, other places in Europe, Germany, the United Kingdom and Ireland before returning to Australia on the Bremen on 25 July 1919. McFadyen played sport at a high level during the war, notably Australian Rules football and rugby with the 8th Field Ambulance Rugby team in France in 1917. This was, in his view, 'possibly the best rugby side (as a unit) in the ANZAC corps' and 'would have beaten any club team in NSW or QLD.' He was fullback in the team that won the 5th Division championship after the Armistice. As an athlete he won the 5th Division officers 100 yard sprint. He particularly enjoyed leave in Charleroi, attending opera in Brussels and the music halls in Paris where he heard the young Maurice Chevalier sing the Madelon de la Victoire and also the singer's older patron and lover, Mistinguett. He retained an affection for the French and things French all his life. Years later, in 1956, he would again seek out Chevalier after a performance at the Casino de Paris. In all, he spent four full years abroad and was billeted in locations in Belgium, England and Ireland awaiting return to Australia. McFadyen participated in the farewell march of Australian soldiers through London on 25 April 1919. A photograph of Charles newly demobilised taken in Melbourne in 1919 shows him fit, healthy and handsome. He resumed an active life. In his short VFL Australian Rules football career he played four games for Essendon in 1920, in which he scored two goals. In the 1920-21 seasons he played first grade cricket for Essendon under A.G. 'Johnny' Moyes. On 22 of November, 1922, he married Rose Craig the daughter of Walter and Margaret Jones of Essendon. On 12 February 1923 his father, Alexander, died, aged 54. McFadyen enlisted for part-time duties on 12 June 1942 in WW2 and was discharged on 10 October 1945  Public service career  McFadyen rejoined the Commonwealth Public Service on demobilisation in 1919. He was transferred to Canberra together with his young family in the first big move of government departments and staff to the new Australian capital in 1927 to work with the Department of Trade and Customs and rented a newly built home near Telopea Park. He took on a variety of professional, sporting and community activities, revealing a capacity for leadership. Later, he and his family moved to Barton. Probably, it was his WW1 field hospital experience that led him to become prominent in the movement for a new Canberra hospital. The administration of the Australian Capital Territory was the responsibility of the Federal Capital Commission until it was dissolved in 1929 when the Government of Stanley Bruce was defeated. The former Minister for Health, W.M. Hughes, had instigated a board for the Canberra Hospital with John Crapp as its first chairman. Two board members were nominated by Hughes and Mrs Pattie Tillyard and Charles McFadyen were elected by public vote. Charles was re-elected in 1938. In the same year, the Acting Minister for Health, Archie Cameron, dissolved the nominee board and created a wholly elected body, of which McFadyen became chairman. Charles persuaded the Minister for Health Frederick Stewart and the Treasurer Percy Spender to have an amount placed on the forward estimates to enable a hospital to be built at a later date. McFadyen resigned from the Hospital Board in December 1939 when in his public service capacity he was transferred to Melbourne. The new Canberra hospital on Acton Peninsula on Lake Burley Griffin was commenced in 1940 and completed in 1943. McFadyen was a leading figure in Canberra in other ways as well. He was the first president of the Federal Capital Territory branch of the Commonwealth Public Service Clerical Association, president of the Canberra branch of the Australian Labor Party for four years and campaigned for representation for Canberra citizens in the Commonwealth Parliament. In 1931, he was narrowly defeated as one of two ALP candidates for the three-person Canberra Advisory Council. This was the extent of representation offered the Territory for the Seat of Government as the Australian Capital Territory was then known. At this stage Canberra residents had no direct representation in the Federal Parliament. Another concern of his was the high cost of living in the new capital for low waged public servants compared with Melbourne or Sydney. He was president of the Canberra Public Service Welfare Committee. McFadyen came to be considered as a possible Labor candidate for the Federal seat of Eden-Monaro and was encouraged by Prime Minister James Scullin but full ALP endorsement was not forthcoming. He remained a leading ANA member and played competitive sport, notably football, tennis and cricket. In 1928, aged 36 and disappointed with performances of his local Australian Rules Football Club, Eastlake, he donned his boots once again. That same year Eastlake took out the premiership. McFadyen was Vice President of the Australian Capital Territory Cricket Association and in 1936 led a Canberra XI against a test strength touring English team led by Gubby Allen at Manuka Oval. His mother, Mary Elizabeth McFadyen, of 259 Beaconsfield Parade, Middle Park. a widow, died on 10 May 1940. Charles H. McFadyen in 1957. In his public service capacity McFadyen was Chairman of the Tariff Advisory Committee, 1935‚Äì39. This was a post Ottawa Agreement committee established by the United Kingdom and Australian governments. In 1939 he was transferred to Melbourne as Trade and Customs liaison officer to the Department of Supply and Development under Professor Jim Brigden, later Munitions under John Jensen, to which he was transferred in 1941. McFadyen chaired the Tallow Advisory Committee, 1942‚Äì44, composed of industry and government representatives. Its purpose was to ensure adequate supplies of glycerine for munitions purposes for the war effort. In 1944 he was appointed Deputy Controller of Materials and Supply with the Department of Munitions. As Deputy Director of the Secondary Industries Division from 1945 he developed the NSW Division of Industrial Development. In this capacity he was responsible for mining, shipping and ports. His son, Ken, recalled he moved around a lot and at this time was living in Manly and working in Martin Place, Sydney.Ken McFadyen to David Dunstan, personal communication 2015. In 1948, McFadyen acted as Director of the Division of Industrial Development in the Department of Post-War Reconstruction during the absence of the Director Harold Breen. He was appointed Secretary of the Department of Shipping and Fuel in December 1948. Under his leadership, the Department became the Department of Fuel, Shipping and Transport in March 1950, and then the Department of Shipping and Transport in May 1951, fuel rationing having been abolished following Menzies' election victory in 1949. McFadyen was a member of the Australian Shipbuilding Board 1949-50. Issues in these years included the lack of efficient coastal shipping services, particularly for Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland. Charles formed close personal and professional friendships with many notable industry figures. Arthur Deakin of the shipbuilding firm of Evans Deakin was a close friend. McFadyen presided over a conference held in Launceston in 1954 to inquire into Tasmanian shipping and freights. He served two ministers directly in his capacity as a departmental head, the South Australian George McLeay and Western Australian Senator Shane Paltridge. McFadyen has little positive to say in his recollections about McLeay who died in 1955. In one instance McLeay asked McFadyen to chair the Cargo Clearance Committee for the Port of Melbourne. Sheds were being used for storage rather than transit and shipping had begun to build up. The Prime Minister R. G. Menzies had expressed concern. McFadyen was reluctant to involve himself in what was a State matter but did as he was requested. Disagreement between Customs and the Melbourne Harbor Trust representatives on the CCC was the issue. McLeay then caved in to ship owner and Harbor Trust complaints about McFadyen's chairmanship and in 1952 disbanded the Committee. This was despite expert commentary praising the Committee's work. ‚ÄòI cleared the port and in the process stood on a few corns,‚Äô Charles recalled and added: ‚ÄòI have an idea the P.M. was not happy about McLeay‚Äôs treachery.‚Äô Paltridge, his Minister from 1955, he held in high regard. Charles believed his advice and Paltridge's advocacy in Federal cabinet were instrumental in the government's decision to create the Australian National Line. McFadyen remained Secretary of the Department of Shipping and Transport until his retirement, aged 65, in October, 1957, when he was succeeded by D.C. Williams. He appears to have had no difficulties with Liberal and Country Party administrations and was well regarded by Menzies, his early involvement with and sympathy for the Australian Labor Party notwithstanding. Also, by his departmental peers and senior political and industry figures, if testimonials on the occasion of his 1955 CBE honour and retirement are any indication. Unlike other permanent heads of his time he was not offered a knighthood. A lifelong public servant, he had the distinction of joining as a junior by way of competitive examination and rising to the top. The year following his retirement he joined the Board of Mercury Transport Ltd. McFadyen was a genial man, a keen reader and follower of horse racing. His clubs included the Caulfield Returned Servicemen's League, Canberra Golf Club and the Essendon Commercial Travellers Association. The 1960 Credit Squeeze had an impact on his investments and savings. His last residence was 3 Newton Court, St Kilda. Charles Hector McFadyen died on 26 August 1965 following a series of strokes. He was survived by his sisters Maude and Doris (Mrs J.E. McKeddie), his wife Rose, sons Ken and Alan (now all deceased) and a daughter, Marie Rose (Mrs J.K.Dunstan). ==Awards== In the 1955 Queen's Birthday Honours, McFadyen was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services as Secretary of the Department of Shipping and Transport. ==References * Category:1892 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Australian public servants Category:Australian Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Essendon Football Club players ","title":"Charles Hector McFadyen"},{"id":"46317934","text":"Louren√ßo Soares de Valladares, Lord of Valadares and Tangil (c.1230-1298) was a Portuguese nobleman, who served in the Court of Afonso III as Tenente of Ribeira do Minho and Mayor of the Palace.

It is commonly grown as a garden plant and produces large numbers of white or creamy yellow flowers, sometimes highly scented, in spring. == Description == Melaleuca incana is a shrub or small tree which grows to a height of about and has fibrous or flaky bark. The leaves are in threes, sometimes rings of four along the branchlets, long and wide, linear or very narrow elliptic in shape and tapering to a point. The leaves and young branches are covered with fine, soft hairs giving the foliage a grey appearance. The flowers are arranged in spikes, usually on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. Each spike has between 6 and 55 individual flowers and is up to long and wide, white, creamy white or yellow. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing between 3 and 11 stamens. Flowering occurs in spring and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long in cylinder- shaped clusters up to long. M. incana leaves and flowers M. incana fruit ==Taxonomy and naming== This species was first formally described in 1819 by Robert Brown in Edward's Botanical Register. Edwards called the plant \\"Grizzly Melaleuca\\" and noted that the plant was ...first observed by Mr. Brown, in King George the Third's Sound, on the south-west coast of New Holland. ... We were favoured with the specimen, for the drawing, by Lady Aylesford ... We are indebted to Mr. Brown for the specific characters, and all we know concerning the plant. The specific epithet (incana) is from the Latin incanus meaning \\"quite grey\\", \\"in reference to the colour of the leaves\\". There are two subspecies differing mainly in the form of the plant, the shape and size of the leaves, their flowering time and in their distribution: * M. incana subsp. incana occurs on the south-west coast of Western Australia between Albany and Jurien Bay and inland as far as the Dryandra woodland and is naturalised in parts of Victoria. * M. incana subsp. tenella occurs on the south coast of Western Australia between Albany and Esperance. ==Distribution and habitat== This melaleuca occurs in the south-west of Western Australia and on the south coast as far east as Esperance in the Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions. It grows on swamp edges, in low woodland and heath in peaty soil and sand. ==Conservation status== Melaleuca incana is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. ==Use in horticulture== This species, especially the nominate subspecies incana is widely cultivated. It is a hardy plant, fast growing, tolerating a range of soils and conditions after initial establishment and is frost hardy. It is widely available in commercial nurseries and tolerates pruning to form a hedge. It is susceptible to scale insect attack. ==References== incana Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Rosids of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1819 Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia ","title":"Melaleuca incana"},{"id":"46318005","text":"Nicholas Gilman Thacher (August 20, 1915 ‚Äì March 11, 2002) was a United States diplomat. ==Early life and career== He was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1915 to John Hamilton Thacher and Edith Gilman Thacher.

As an informant of the Shodon dialect, he also worked with linguists Yukio Uemura, Shir≈ç Hattori and Samuel E. Martin. ==Biography== Kanehisa was born to a wealthy family in Shodon, a village in southwestern Kakeroma Island of the Amami Islands. Unlike his half-brothers and sisters, he was grown up by his grandparents. His grandfather Minesato (Â∂∫‰ΩêÁôª) was an important source of his folkloristic studies in his later life. He studied English literature at Kyushu Imperial University. Being disappointed with it, he spent about five years pursuing folkloristic studies in his hometown Shodon. He then worked for the Nagasaki Prefectural Government while teaching linguistics at Kwassui Women's College. He published his folkloristic work at the Nant≈ç (Southern Islands) edited by Eikichi Kazari, and the Tabi to Densetsu (Travels and Legends). He won fame for his paper Amori Onagu (Â§©Èôç„ÇäÂ•≥‰∫∫) (1943), where he proposed a couple of novel theories on Amami's swan maiden motif, a conundrum originally posed by Shomu Nobori. His work was highly commended by Kunio Yanagita, the father of Japanese folkloristics. His main source of information was a group of young men from Amami who had been drafted into the armament industry in Nagasaki. His informants were all killed by the U.S. atomic bombing on Nagasaki in 1945. He himself gradually lost his eyesight after the bombing.Yamashita Kin'ichi Â±±‰∏ãÊ¨£‰∏Ä (2011). Kaisetsu Ëß£Ë™¨.

After World War II, he returned to Shodon and soon moved to Naze (part of modern-day Amami City), the center of Amami ≈åshima. His blindness kept him from using his talent for prestigious jobs. He ran a private-tutoring school for the English language during daytime while continuing folkloristic and linguistic research at night. His decades of work resulted in the book titled Amami ni ikiru Nihon kodai bunka (Ancient Japanese Culture Still Alive in Amami). Its publication was done with the help from linguist Shir≈ç Hattori. Being a linguist himself, he worked as an informant of the Shodon dialect, which is part of the Southern Amami ≈åshima dialect group of the Japonic languages. He worked with Yukio Uemura, Shir≈ç Hattori and Samuel Martin. He was praised as an ideal informant by Hattori. His primarily linguistic work include the Amami h≈çgen on'in no sandai tokushoku (Three features of the Amami dialect phonology) and the Amami ni ikiru kotengo (Literary language still alive in Amami). He spent his final years in Kagoshima. He died in 1997, leaving an uncompleted dictionary of the Amami dialect. ==Notes *Ayahavela (in Japanese): Kanehisa's son Noboru Unasaka's website.

After debuting at several international film festivals, it was released on September 9, 2020, in Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. Despite the story's popularity among the Chinese, due to souring Korea-China relations after the former deployed the THAAD missile defense system, no Chinese investors would support the film and it was not released in China. ==Works== Long and short comic *Author J (, October 2009 ‚Äì November 2010, 48 episodes) *Bonbon au Chocolat (, April 2011 ‚Äì August 2012, 69 episodes) *The Cliff (, July

Australia and is naturalised in the south of Victoria in Australia. It is commonly grown as a garden plant and produces large numbers of white or creamy yellow flowers in early spring. == Description == Melaleuca incana subsp. incana is a medium to tall shrub with weeping branches. It grows to a height of about and has rough, grey bark. The leaves are in opposite pairs, sometimes rings of three, curved and crowded along the branchlets, long and wide, linear or very narrow elliptic in shape and tapering to a point. The leaves and young branches are covered with fine, soft hairs giving the foliage a grey appearance. The flowers are arranged in spikes, usually on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. Each spike has between 6 and 55 individual flowers and is up to long and wide, white, creamy white or yellow. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing between 3 and 11 stamens. Flowering mainly occurs in August to September and is followed by woody capsules long in cylinder-shaped clusters up to long. Melaleuca incana incana leaves and flowers Melaleuca incana incana fruits ==Taxonomy and naming== This species was first described in 1819 by Robert Brown in Edward's Botanical Register. Edwards called the plant \\"Grizzly Melaleuca\\" and noted that the plant was ...first observed by Mr. Brown, in King George the Third's Sound, on the south-west coast of New Holland. ... We were favoured with the specimen, for the drawing, by Lady Aylesford ... We are indebted to Mr. Brown for the specific characters, and all we know concerning the plant. The specific epithet (incana) \\"is from the Latin incanus, hoary, white, in reference to the colour of the leaves\\". ==Distribution and habitat== Melaleuca incana subsp. incana occurs between Albany and Jurien Bay and inland as far as the Dryandra woodland in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic region. It is also naturalised in the Gippsland and Otway plains areas of Victoria. ==Uses== Horticulture Melaleuca incana subspecies incana is widely cultivated. It is a hardy plant, fast growing, tolerating a range of soils and conditions after initial establishment and is frost hardy. It is widely available in commercial nurseries and tolerates pruning to form a hedge. It is susceptible to scale insect attack. ==Referencesincana subsp. incana Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Rosids of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1819 Category:Plant subspecies ","title":"Melaleuca incana subsp. incana"},{"id":"46318644","text":"James H. \\"Jimmy\\" Boyd (November 5, 1906 ‚Äì April 11, 1974) was an Atlantic City politician and crime and political boss, who served under corrupt Atlantic County treasurer Enoch ‚ÄúNucky‚Äù Johnson and New Jersey Senator Frank S. Farley. == Early life == James Boyd was born on November 5, 1906 in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States. == Prohibition == Boyd was working as a bellhop at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel during the time Prohibition went into effect in 1920. But, soon Boyd started to move up to the chain of command in corrupt Atlantic City treasurer and Southern Jersey Irish Mob boss Enoch ‚ÄúNucky‚Äù Johnson's organization. Boyd and Johnson met around the time that Johnson and Charlie Luciano were forming the Big Seven and they took an instant liking to each other; Johnson began grooming Boyd to become the next boss in his organization. He later became Johnson's right-hand man. He oversaw speakeasies, brothels, illegal casinos, and the numbers rackets. Boyd was also Johnson's and future boss Farley's top enforcer.  Personal life  Boyd was married to Marie E. Boyd. == Frank Farley == After Johnson was convicted of tax evasion in 1941, New Jersey State Senator Frank S. Farley took control of Atlantic City's political machine. In order to create a ‚Äúbridge‚Äù between the new and old regimes, Boyd was appointed the overseer of all operations in Atlantic City. He also became the executive chairman of the Fourth Ward Republican Club and assistant clerk and clerk of the Atlantic Board of Freeholders and boss of the fourth ward. Under the regime of Farley, Boyd was known as a vicious man.  World War II  Boyd enlisted in the Army during World War II. From 1942 to 1945, Boyd was a soldier in the 79th Infantry Division. He served in the Normandy battles, Northern France campaign, the Rhineland battles, and in Central Europe. == Death == Boyd died in his home on April 11, 1974 of cancer, at the age of 67. Prior to her death in 2006, his wife established the James H. Boyd Memorial Scholarship at the Atlantic Cape Community College, worth $10,000. == Television adaptation == Jimmy Darmody in the first two seasons of the HBO show Boardwalk Empire is, to some degree, based on Boyd. The fictional version of Boyd is a World War I veteran with a son and a wife. In the show, his father is Louis ‚ÄúCommodore‚Äù Kaestner (based on Louis ‚ÄúCommodore‚Äù Kuehnle) and his one-time mentor is corrupt Atlantic City treasurer and political boss Enoch ‚ÄúNucky‚Äù Thompson (based on Enoch L.

Atlas of Living Australia. and lantana sap-sucking bug.Aconophora compressa. Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. Queensland Government. This insect is native to Mexico, Central America, and Colombia. It is best known as an import to Australia, where it was introduced in 1995 as an agent of biological pest control for the invasive plant species lantana (Lantana camara). Since the introduction of the treehopper on lantana, it has also been found in abundance on fiddlewood (Citharexylum spinosum). The propensity of the insect to attack non-target plant species inspired greater attention to testing of potential biocontrol agents before their release.Palmer, W. A., et al. Analysis of the non-target attack by the lantana sap-sucking bug, Aconophora compressa and its implications for biological control in Australia. In: Proceedings of the 14th Australian Weeds Conference. September, 2014. It also suggests the importance of monitoring such releases for longer periods to track their activity.Dhileepan, K., Trevino, M., & Raghu, S. (2006). Temporal patterns in incidence and abundance of Aconophora compressa (Hemiptera: Membracidae), a biological control agent for Lantana camara, on target and nontarget plants. Environmental Entomology 35(4), 1001-12. This treehopper is brown in color and up to 8 millimeters long with a thorn-shaped body. It produces a large amount of honeydew. The bug is gregarious, gathering in large numbers to suck the sap from the stems of plants. Most of its known host species are in the verbena family, Verbenaceae.Manners, A. G., & Walter, G. H. (2009). Multiple host use by a sap-sucking membracid: population consequences of nymphal development on primary and secondary host plant species. Arthropod-Plant Interactions 3(2), 87-98. In its native range in Mexico it is only associated with plants in genus Lantana. It lays eggs on the stems of the plants and then guards them against predators. The nymphs progress through five instars before reaching adulthood in about 45 days.Heystek, F., & Baars, J. R. (2005). Biology and host range of Aconophora compressa, a candidate considered as a biocontrol agent of Lantana camara in Africa. BioControl 50(2), 359-73. Before it was released in Australia the insect was tested on 62 other plants to determine if it would damage them incidentally; the common ornamental tree fiddlewood was not included in the testing. Within a few years after its release on lantana, it was reported in large numbers on fiddlewood. Some infestations were heavy, as the insects \\"encrusted all available branches and stems,\\" secreting copious honeydew which then grew sooty mold, defoliating the trees and yellowing nearby lawns. Populations on fiddlewood \\"overflow\\" onto other garden plants. The insect has not been used for biological control since 2001. The bug was tested for lantana control in South Africa, where it is a serious weed. It was found to prefer ornamental Lippia species and lemon verbena (Aloysia citrodora), and it was rejected as an agent of biocontrol. ==References== Category:Membracinae Category:Insects used for control of invasive plants Category:Hemiptera of Central America ","title":"Aconophora compressa"},{"id":"46318712","text":"Julien Sidney Devereux (1805-1856) was an American planter and politician from Texas. ==Early life== Julien Sidney Devereux was born on July 23, 1805 in Montpelier, Hancock County, Georgia.Dorman H.

He was born in Sioux City, Iowa and grew up in Glendale, California. From 1940 to 1942, Jennings worked on a survey crew for the Union Pacific Railroad. He served with the United States Army in Europe during World War II. With the aid of the GI Bill, Jennings enrolled at the University of California at Davis with the aim of earning a degree in dairy science. He earned a Bachelor, Masters and PhD, eventually becoming a professor emeritus. His interest in flavor chemistry led him to investigate technologies such as gas chromatography to help investigate the chemistry behind the flavor. This led to technological innovations in support of gas chromatography including the production of fused silica (glass) capillary columns for separation of chemical compounds through this specialized analytical chemistry technique. Jennings and a graduate student began manufacturing capillary columns for gas chromatography; originally operating out of a garage, they went on to form a manufacturing company J & W Scientific based in Folsom, CA. Jennings produced over 200 publications in his field and was also in demand as a lecturer. He was awarded a Humboldt Fellowship in 1973, the Founders Award in Gas Chromatography from the Beckman Foundation, the M.J.E. Golay Award, the Keene P. Dimick Award, and the A.J.P.

The Lost Colony of the Confederacy. Texas A&M; University Press, College Station, 3rd. printing, 2006 Jacob Philip Wingerter (1914) Wingerter decided to migrate to Brazil in 1867 with a group of settlers led by former officers Frank McMullen and William Bowen. Of the approximately 130 people who made up this group,Griggs, William Clark. The Elusive Eden: Frank McMullan's Confederate Colony in Brazil. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1987. many were Confederate veterans and many traveled with their families. Wingerter brought his second wife, Susan, whom he married in Grimes County, Texas on July 4, 1865, and her daughter Amy. ==Immigration to Brazil== The members of the colony left the port of Galveston, Texas aboard the old British ship \\"Derby\\". These southerners left the U.S. for a variety of reasons - to escape violence postwar, escape from the poverty, to obtain fertile land in a country with few cultural similarities. There was also the strong encouragement of the Brazilian government, the Emperor himself diligently D. Pedro II in bringing immigrants to the country.Bocai√∫va, Quintino.

Before the trip, McMullen and Bowen were in Brazil and obtained from the Empire a land for the colony in Sao Paulo. The old vessel, however, was shipwrecked near the island of Cuba, being rescued and taken to New York, facing severe storm that made them initially stop in the Virginia. After arriving in New York, finally managed to board the \\"North America\\" to Brazil. In May 1867, arrived in Rio de JaneiroGriggs, William Clark.

Wingerter's wife, Susan, died a few months after giving birth to her son Carlos. Sometime later, with two small children, when we lived in Santa Barbara d'Oeste (SP), Wingerter marries for the third time, with Anna Luisa B√ºchner, daughter of an immigrant family. Then move on to Campinas (SP). ==The Evangelist== Upon arriving in Brazil, Wingerter devoted himself to the evangelist action and in 1870, the physician and the Rev. Edward Lane, co-founder of the first Presbyterian Church of Brazil, invites him to work in the evangelization of the settlers of German origin living in Sao Paulo - SP. Wingerter joined the \\"Mission of Nashville\\", organized in Brazil by Nash and Edward Morton Lane to evangelize Americans southern Christians who came to the region of Campinas, besides seeking conversion of Brazilians. Wingerter moved to Mogi Mirim (SP) and when the local church was organized, it becomes one of his priests. In \\"Mission Nashville\\" acted as colporteur, i.e., distributed and sold religious tracts and Bibles in Portuguese, English and German. According to a letter written by the wife of Edward Lane, Mrs. Sarah Lane, Wingerter made copies of Bibles in villages or neighborhoods and come back six months or a year later, when he sold dozens of copies. For her, writing in May 1877 to the children of the Sunday school in Baltimore (USA) to thank a sum of money raised for the purchase of a wagon for the colporteur, Wingerter letter was \\"humble, patient, earnest, self-denying, laborious, tireless, always happy and willing to move anywhere or do anything that the work of spreading the Gospel demanded.\\"Matos, Alderi Souza de.

Wingerter was gradually playing a prominent role in supporting the expansion of the main leaders of the Presbyterian Church in Brazil. Worked in Sao Paulo (state), Minas Gerais, Goias and Mato Grosso. On many trips, accompanied him evangelistic pastors, such as the Reverend John W. Dabney, Delfino Teixeira and Miguel Torres. In August 1879, accompanied the Rev. Dabney on a trip to the city of Cabo Verde (Minas Gerais) and the district of Sao Bartolomeu de Minas.Matos, Alderi Souza de.

In his later years, Wingerter would return to Cabo Verde with his family and there would be born their younger children. In 1879, the Reverend John Boyle, who arrived in Brazil six years ago, settling initially in Recife (Pernambuco), moved to Mogi Mirim (SP), where Wingerter was already. This continued his hard work canvassing and preached the Gospel in cities like Casa Branca (SP), Mococa (SP), Ribeirao Preto (SP), Batatais (SP), Franca (SP), Santa Rita (now Santa Rita do Passa Quatro - SP), Uberaba (MG), Passos, Minas Gerais (MG), Santa Rita de Cassia (current C√°ssia - MG), Divisa Velha (current Campos Gerais - MG), Ventania (current Alpin√≥polis - MG) and Sao Simao, Goias. Bringing back to Mogi enthusiastic news about the existing opportunities to evangelization in Central Brazil, Wingerter encouraged the Rev. Boyle to do the same route in 1881 and 1882, a core mission for Presbyterian Church expansion in the Central Brazil.Matos, Alderi Souza de.

Anna and Jacob Wingerter In 1883, Wingerter was in Paracatu, Minas Gerais and again provided an encouraging report on the responsiveness to evangelical Christian faith. The following year, he and Boyle visited Bagagem - current Estrela do Sul (Minas Gerais - MG), Araguari (MG), Paracatu (MG), Formosa (GO) and Santa Luzia de Goias - current Luzi√¢nia (GO). In 1887, Boyle went to live in Bagagem at the region of \\"Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro\\", to dedicate to the expansion of the Presbyterian Church in the region and in the state of Goias, but Boyle died suddenly in 1892.

In the early twentieth century, Wingerter, his wife and minor children move to Cabo Verde, Minas Gerais (MG), where he remained until his death in 1916. ==Descendants== Wingerter had many children. From his marriage to Susan left Amy and Carlos (born in Iguape in 1868 or 1869). From his marriage to Anna Buchner, left John William, born in 1871 or 1872; Jonas; Carlota, born in Mogi Mirim, in 1889; Luis Bruno, born in Mogi Mirim on September 15, 1891; Laura, born in Mogi Mirim on January 22, 1894; Felippe, born in Cabo Verde in 1907 or 1908, Lydia, and Guilhermina.di Santis, Neusa Maria Wingeter.

The family name among his descendants has changed over the years. Could be found, in addition to the original version, Wingerter, Wingester, Wingeter, Wingerther, Wingter and Wengerter variations.

Educated at Schull National school, he came to Australia in 1887 to join his brother, John Leahy and began work as a journalist with the Brisbane Courier. He then moved to Western Queensland where he established The Herald newspaper in Thargomindah and became secretary of the Bulloo Divisional Board. In 1900 he established the Johnstone River Advocate newspaper (later the Johnstone River Advocate and Innisfail News) in Innisfail. ==Political career== After being a member of the Bulloo Shire Council for several years, Leahy stood as a Ministerialist candidate for the seat of Warrego at the 1902 state election, defeating the sitting Labour member, David Bowman. He held the seat until the 1907 state election when was defeated by Labour's George Barber. Leahy appealed the outcome on the basis that Barber was an uncertified insolvent and in September the Elections Tribunal reversed the result and Leahy was declared duly returned. In November 1907, Leahy was appointed as Secretary for Public Works and Mines but at the 1908 state election, he lost the seat to Harry Coyne of the Labour Party. On 1 July 1912, he was called up by the Denham Ministry to the Legislative Council. He took a leading role in fighting against the abolition of the Council, making many well considered speeches against it. When the State Governor, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams was being pressured by the Labour Government to make additional appointments to the Council, he called on Leahy who was opposed to the idea to hear his views on the matter. Leahy was constantly and strenuously opposed to any legislation that savoured of socialist or communist ideals. He had a good knowledge of law, especially laws that applied to the land, and was a Justice of the Peace. ==Personal life== On 13 December 1885, he had married Julia Alice Costello at Thargomindah and together had five children. He died in October 1927 and was buried in Toowong Cemetery. ==References== Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Council Category:1860 births Category:1927 deaths Category:Burials at Toowong Cemetery ","title":"Patrick Leahy (Australian politician)"},{"id":"46318750","text":"Sueiro Belfaguer was a medieval knight, the 1st Lord of the House of Sousa.

The cape is approximately in height. It is the turning point when bound from any of the Fox Islands Passes to Dutch Harbor or Iliuliuk. It is a high, rocky promontory separating Unalaska Bay from Kalekhta Bay. The extremity and western side of the cape are rugged, precipitous cliffs, with a few rocks but no beach at the water line. Seen from a distance, its north end is convex in outline, being steepest at the water and sloping more gently toward the summit. From the summit of the cape, the land falls to the break at Constantine Bay, and then rises to the higher land farther south. While the position of this break can be distinguished, its full extent can be seen only when in Unalaska Bay. From most directions the end of the cape appears as a conical peak. North and west from Cape Kalekhta, distant 0.75 mile, is the outer extremity of a dangerous ledge which is usually well marked by breakers. The cape should be given a berth of 1.75 miles to clear the ledge, as the strong tidal currents may tend to carry a vessel on it. Priest Rock, close-to off the northwest side of Cape Kalekhta, is a pinnacle about 80 feet high. While classed as a conspicuous landmark, its usefulness to strangers is uncertain. It can only be seen clear of the land when well through Akutan and Unalga passes and when close to the north side of Akutan Island. It shows against the land from all other directions and can not be made out except when close-to. There are similar rocks off several other points in this vicinity, which in thick weather might easily be mistaken by strangers for Priest Rock. * ==References== Category:Fox Islands (Alaska) Category:Unalaska Island Category:Peninsulas of Alaska ","title":"Cape Kalekhta"},{"id":"46318776","text":"Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union, was a case taken by a member of the Auckland University Rugby Football Club and a member of the Teachers Rugby Football Club against the decision of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) Council to accept an invitation for the All Blacks to tour South Africa. The invitation came just four years after the 1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand had divided the New Zealand public over the All Blacks refusal to participate in the sporting boycott of South Africa during the Apartheid era. The decision primarily concerned whether the two plaintiffs had sufficient standing to challenge the NZRFU decision. The decision marked the adoption of the principles of R v Inland Revenue Commissioners ex p National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses [1982] AC 617 approach to standing in judicial review into New Zealand law. ==Background== On 20 May 1985 the two plaintiffs, as members of two Auckland rugby union clubs, sought to overturn a decision by the NZRFU Council to accept an invitation for the All Blacks to tour South Africa. As Cooke J noted, > They claimed that the decision failed to comply with the object of > promoting, fostering and developing amateur rugby union football throughout > New Zealand, and that for various specified reasons it gives the game a > tarnished and sullied image and will reflect adversely on the game. These > contentions we will refer to as the against-the-objects ground. They also > claimed that the decision was outside the powers of the Council and could > only have been made by the Union in general meeting. This we will refer to > as the wrong body ground. They claimed therefore that the decision was > invalid and unlawful, and sought a declaration and injunction.Finnigan v New > Zealand Rugby Football Union Inc [1985] 2 NZLR 159 at 175. The NZRFU as defendants sought to strike out the statement of claim as, \\"disclosing no cause of action and as frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of process.\\"Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union Inc [1985] 2 NZLR 159 at 175. On 6 June the defendants strike out application was heard in the High Court by Sir Ronald Davison, the Chief Justice, who struck out the claim and dismissed the action, declining to grant the plaintiffs standing. The plaintiffs appealed.Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union Inc [1985] 2 NZLR 159 at 175. ==Judgment== The plaintiffs succeeded in their appeal, clearing the way for the claim to proceed to a substantive hearing. Cooke J delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The judgment considered two points of law. The first point concerned whether the NZRFU Council was the wrong body to make the arrangement of matches and tour. The Court agreed with the Chief Justice that the Council was not the wrong body to accept the invitation and held that the appeal failed on this point.Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union Inc [1985] 2 NZLR 159 at 177. The second point concerned whether the plaintiffs had the requisite standing to bring their action against the NZRFU. The Court rejected the plaintiffs argument that implied contracts linked each of them with the NZRFU.Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union Inc [1985] 2 NZLR 159 at 177. However it approved earlier judgments that standing could be granted to those claiming an incorporated association acted beyond its powers even where no contract existed. Here Cooke J said, > In cases where an incorporated association is alleged to have acted against > its objects but the plaintiff cannot show a contract, we think that all the > circumstances have to be considered - case by case or category of case by > category of case - in order to determine as a question of mixed law and fact > whether or not he or she has sufficient standing.Finnigan v New Zealand > Rugby Football Union Inc [1985] 2 NZLR 159 at 178. The Court noted that the plaintiffs were connected to the club by a \\"chain of contracts\\" and that the plaintiffs were \\"at grass roots level; but it is the players, who are all at that level, for whom basically the organisation exists\\".Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union Inc [1985] 2 NZLR 159 at 178. The Court also noted that in exercising its discretion to grant standing regard had to be had to the plaintiff's claims that the NZRFU was acting contrary to the fundamental goals of its constitution and that \\"the decision challenged is probably at least as important as - if not more important than - any other in the history of the game in New Zealand.\\"Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union Inc [1985] 2 NZLR 159 at 179. As Cooke J noted, > The decision affects the New Zealand community as a whole and so relations > between the community and those, like the plaintiffs, specifically and > legally associated with the sport. Indeed judicial notice can be taken of > the obvious fact that in the view of a significant number of people, but no > doubt contrary to the view of another significant number, the decision > affects the international relations or standing of New Zealand.Finnigan v > New Zealand Rugby Football Union Inc [1985] 2 NZLR 159 at 179. The Court also noted that although the NZRFU was a private, voluntary association, its decision in this case put it in a \\"position of major national importance\\"; that the plaintiffs could not be dismissed as \\"mere busybodies, cranks or other mischief makers\\"; that unless persons such as the plaintiffs were granted standing they would have no \\"effective way of establishing whether or not the Union is acting within its lawful powers\\"; and that, > As a result of the disturbances accompanying the 1981 South African tour of > New Zealand many citizens, including normally law-abiding citizens, were > alleged to have gone too far when indulging in protest activity. The > importance of preserving law and order was rightly stressed. The Courts > applied the law impartially. There were numerous prosecutions, many of them > successful. It is now no less appropriate that the lawfulness of the Union's > decision under its own constitution to arrange the proposed tour should be > open to test in the Courts.Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union Inc > [1985] 2 NZLR 159 at 180. ==Significance== With standing granted, the hearing of the substantive action began in the Wellington High Court on 8 July, with the All Blacks due to leave for South Africa on 17 July. On 11 July the plaintiffs applied for an interim injunction to prevent the team leaving as it became clear the hearing would not be finished before the All Blacks were due to depart. Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union Inc (No 2) [1985] 2 NZLR 181 at 181. Casey J ruled that, > [T]he plaintiffs in my opinion have put forward a strong prima facie case at > this point for their proposition that the present tour cannot benefit rugby > in this country. The correspondence and other evidence demonstrates much the > same split in the community [as in 1981] over the issue, and those opposed > cannot be brushed aside as irresponsible trouble makers or publicity > seekers, as some of the evidence and opinions from the Union suggests. It is > impossible to regard the leaders of nearly all our major churches, or a > unanimous House of Representatives or the Auckland and North Harbour Rugby > Unions in this light. Nor is the case answered by counting the heads of > those who support the tour and suggesting they may be in a majority.Finnigan > v New Zealand Rugby Football Union Inc (No 2) [1985] 2 NZLR 181 at 184. With the injunction granted the All Blacks tour of South Africa was halted. However an unofficial New Zealand team dubbed the New Zealand Cavaliers did tour South Africa in 1986. ==See also== * 1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand * Sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era * South Africa under apartheid ==References== Category:1985 in New Zealand law Category:Court of Appeal of New Zealand cases Category:1985 in case law Category:Rugby union and apartheid Category:1985 in New Zealand rugby union ","title":"Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union"},{"id":"46318796","text":"Barbara Fest (born 6 July 1953) is a retired American judoka.

In his senior season, Kinney was The News-Gazette All-Area Player of the Year. ==College career== As a freshman in 2009‚Äì10, Kinney played at Ohio University under coach John Groce. In 19 games with 3 starts, Kinney averaged 9.7 points and 1.5 rebounds. On February 10, 2010, Kinney, already suspended indefinitely by Groce, pleaded guilty in Athens County court to a count of possession of marijuana. He was given a suspended jail sentence of 30 days, and his driver's license was suspended for 180 days. Groce subsequently dismissed Kinney from the team, and Kinney transferred to the College of Eastern Utah, a junior college. After Kinney's suspension began on February 4, Ohio won the 2010 Mid-American Conference Men's Basketball Tournament and as #14 seed in the NCAA Tournament upset #3 seed Georgetown before losing to #6 seed Tennessee in the second round. At Eastern Utah in 2010‚Äì11, Kinney averaged 13.0 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 3.5 assists in a 22‚Äì8 season and was named second-team All-Scenic West Athletic Conference. Kinney transferred to San Jose State University to play under coach George Nessman. In his junior season, 2011‚Äì12, with the San Jose State Spartans, Kinney started all 31 games and led the team in scoring with 15.8 points per game. He also had 3.6 rebounds and 2.7 assists, as well as the most total steals on the season (40) and led the Western Athletic Conference in free throw shooting at 85.3%. San Jose State went 9‚Äì22 (1‚Äì13 WAC) that season. As a senior in 2012‚Äì13, Kinney played 14 games with average 20.6 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. Kinney was suspended twice in the season for violating team rules, the first time for the December 22, 2012 game against James Madison, the second time beginning January 11, 2013. On February 8, Nessman confirmed that Kinney's suspension would continue until the end of the season; the San Jose Mercury News reported that the suspension \\"is believed to be related to academics.\\" After Kinney's second suspension, when the team was 9‚Äì6, San Jose State's scoring average went down 15 points to 49.8, and the team never won another game on the way to a 9‚Äì20 final record. Nessman was fired immediately after the season. ==Professional career== On August 6, 2013, Kinney signed with √ñzel Geli≈üim Koleji of the Turkish Basketball Second League. Kinney played 4 games for the team, with 2.5 points a game. He was sidelined by an ankle injury much of the season.http://www.mackolik.com/Basketbolcu/12782/James- Kinneyhttp://www.invictussportsgroup.com/news_2160_INVICTUS+signed+JAMES+KINNEY!

He is most known for writing CLARITY: Clear Mind, Better Performance, Bigger Results, a book about achieving mental clarity. In 2015, he published his second book, titled Little Book of Clarity: A Quick Guide to Focus and Declutter Your Mind. == Career == Smart grew up in an alcoholic household and started drinking by the age of 12. In his early 30s he decided to stop drinking, but found himself left with a thinking problem leading to stress and depression. He became curious about how the mind works, started exploring positive psychology and created a company called Salad in 2003 creating education programs. He sold the business in 2012. == Bibliography ==  CLARITY: Clear Mind, Better Performance, Bigger Results  In 2013, Smart wrote his first book CLARITY: Clear Mind, Better Performance, Bigger Results. The book discusses the use of implication-based learning for achieving mental clarity. Smart suggests that mind has its own \\"self-clearing\\" capacity. In the book, he writes about the misperception that circumstances are responsible for feelings. He refers to ‚Äúclarity of understanding‚Äù as the recognition that feelings are always and only caused by moment to moment thinking. In May 2013, after Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge scored a hat trick against Fulham, in his post-match interview, he walked in holding a copy of Clarity. Financial Times wrote about the book that, \\"Unlike some self-help books Clarity feels like a gentle pep talk rather than a military boot camp. It guides you along the way rather than asking you to set out specific goals within strict time frames. Worth a read.\\" The PA Life magazine gave the book a positive review saying, \\"broken down into clear chapters that take you on a pathway to clarity and guide you in making changes as you move forward.\\"  Little Book of Clarity Smart released his second book, titled Little Book of Clarity: A Quick Guide to Focus and Declutter Your Mind in March 2015.

His scrupulousness in ·∏•adƒ´th transmission, alongside other scholars such as SufyƒÅn al-Thawrƒ´, is understood to have laid the foundation for the concretization of ·∏•adƒ´th sciences. ==Biography== Shu øba bin al-·∏§ajjƒÅj was born with a speech impediment (althagh) sometime between the years 80‚Äì86 AH, though likely 85, in WƒÅsi·π≠, a historical city located on the west bank of the Tigris River in central  øIrƒÅq. He then moved to Ba·π£ra as a child, where lived, studied, and later died in 160/776 AH/CE due to plague. Another famous scholar and ·∏•adƒ´th transmitter, SufyƒÅn al-Thawrƒ´, called Shu øba \\"commander of the faithful concerning ·∏•adƒ´th\\" (amƒ´r al-mu'minƒ´n fƒ´ al-·∏•adƒ´th), but Shu øba himself is quoted by Ibn Qutayba al-Dƒ´nawarƒ´ as saying \\"By God, truly in poetry I am more sound than in ·∏•adƒ´th.\\" He was instrumental in transmitting ·∏•adƒ´th, and is understood to be one of the first individuals mentioned as a zƒÅhid amongst the early ·∏•adƒ´th transmitters.

This corporate university was designed to instruct personnel employed by Apple in the various aspects of Apple's technology and corporate culture. ==History== Steve Jobs established Apple University in 2008 as a way to inculcate employees into Apple‚Äôs business culture and educate them about its history, particularly as the company grew. The program was devised by Joel Podolny, then the dean of Yale School of Management. Jobs selected him when the program was founded, and Podolny remains head of the program and effectively serves as dean of the university. He also is a vice president at Apple.https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/-inside-apples-internal- training-program-.html New York Times Courses are not required, only recommended. Employees sign up for courses tailored to their positions and backgrounds on an internal website available only to Apple staff members. It is highly secretive and rarely written about. Employees are strongly discouraged from talking about the company in general, including Apple University. No pictures of the classrooms have surfaced publicly. Apple has strenuously pursued the vision that function and beauty come from simplicity, and teachers in its internal training program sometimes point to a series of Picasso lithographs that illustrate the drive to boil down ideas to their most essential components. ==Academic staff and instructors== The full-time members of the faculty design and teach the courses. Faculty members include professors from universities like Yale; Harvard; the University of California- Berkeley; Stanford; and M.I.T. Some of the faculty continue to hold positions at their universities while also working for Apple. The instructors include: *Tim Cook, CEO. *Joel Podolny, formerly the dean of Yale School of Management *Richard Tedlow, a Harvard University business historian. *Randy Nelson who came from the animation studios Pixarhttps://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/-inside-apples-internal- training-program-.html and DreamWorks Animation *Joshua Cohen, a Stanford professor *Morten Hansen, of Berkeley ==Courses== Some of the courses teach case studies about important business decisions that Apple made. These strategic decisions include the one to make the iPod and its iTunes software compatible with Microsoft‚Äôs Windows system. This was a topic of fierce debate internally at Apple with Steve Jobs strongly opposing the notion of sharing the iPod with Windows. Jobs eventually gave in to his lieutenants. It turned out that opening the iPod to Windows users led to explosive growth of the music player and the iTunes Store, and this in turn would later be critical to the success of the iPhone. ‚ÄúCommunicating at Apple.‚Äù This course focuses on clear communication for making products intuitive, sharing ideas within Apple, and marketing products. ‚ÄúProject Management.‚Äù No information provided, Course is confidential ‚ÄúVendor Management.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat Makes Apple, Apple.‚Äù Focuses on one of Jobs's goals: to make complex computer technologies feel understandable and natural. In the course an instructor showed a slide of the remote control for the Google TV. The remote had 78 buttons. Then the instructor, Nelson, showed a photo of the Apple TV remote, a thin rod with three buttons. ==Campus== The classes are taught on Apple‚Äôs corporate campus in Cupertino, California. Apple University is in a section of buildings called City Center. The rooms are built in a trapezoid shape. Occasionally, classes are offered in Apple‚Äôs offices overseas, and the professors travel there to teach.

Primarily an undergraduate institution, it offers full-time studies in 20 majors leading to a Bachelor of Music (Honours) Degree, as well as programmes for NUS students and young artists. The YST Conservatory maintains an undergraduate cohort of 220 Bachelor of Music students, all of whom receive full financial support through government grants, the Yong Loo Lin Trust and other donors. It also hosts a performance calendar of around 200 concerts annually. ==History== In 1999, Dr Tony Tan, then-Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, proposed the establishment of a conservatory in Singapore within a university. An agreement was then signed in 2001 between the National University of Singapore and the Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins University to develop what was to be known as the Singapore Conservatory of Music. Dr Steven Baxter, former Dean at the Peabody Institute, was appointed Founding Director, and Mr Goh Yew Lin was appointed the founding Chairman of its Governing Board. In 2003, the conservatory was renamed the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music in recognition of a S$25 million gift by the Yong Loo Lin Trust, to honour the late Ms Yong Siew Toh. It also welcomed its inaugural class of 72 students comprising majors in orchestral instruments, piano and composition. 2006 and 2007 saw the official opening of the current YST Conservatory building, and the inaugural class of graduates respectively. The Yong Loo Lin Trust subsequently made another contribution of S$25 million in 2008, endowing the YST Conservatory with a total gift of S$50 million, which was matched by funding from the Ministry of Education, Singapore. In 2008, Professor Bernard Lanskey, former Associate Director of Music at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, was appointed Director of the YST Conservatory and is currently the Dean. All 220 steady-state student positions were filled. With the support of the National Arts Council Singapore, the Young Artist Programme was established. Developments in academic programmes followed over the next few years, with the Recording Arts & Sciences major introduced in 2010, the Joint Degree Programme established with the Peabody Institute as well as the Voice major introduced in 2011, the Master in Music programme with a further major in Conducting offered in 2014, and two new majors in Music & Society and Music, Collaboration & Production introduced in 2018. As of 2018, the YST Conservatory has seen around 550 Bachelor of Music graduates since its founding. Mr Robert Tomlin assumed the role of Governing Board Chairman from November 2018. ==Bachelor of Music (Honours) Degree== The Bachelor of Music (Honours) degree programme is a four-year, full-time programme which builds out from a focus on one of 20 music majors in instrumental performance, Composition, Voice, Audio Arts and Sciences, Music & Society and Music, Collaboration & Production. Students undertake core classes in the major, electives of their choice with a possibility for a Second Major in another area, academic music studies, collaborative music-making, professional integration, alongside University General Education requirements. Students receive access to attend and participate in the Conservatory's year-round concert calendar; support to go for student exchanges as well as overseas festivals, competitions and platforms; and pathways into the community and industry through professional integration and community engagement opportunities. ==Young Artist Programme== Established in 2008, the Young Artist Programme is offered to 15-18 year olds who demonstrate outstanding performance abilities, till they become eligible for placement in the Bachelor of Music programme. Students receive professional performance training and academic study, and are expected to be concurrently enrolled in Singapore schools. == Access for National University of Singapore students == The YST Conservatory offers several levels of musical engagement for National University of Singapore students. Every academic year, a number of Conservatory modules are open to NUS students from all faculties. Students can further extend their exposure by taking the Minor in Music Studies as a capstone. Students can also initiate intensive major study through Access to Major, where they receive major study access for one academic year and are expected to take first-year Conservatory modules in their respective major fields. Upon satisfactory completion, they are then eligible to be considered for the Second Major, where they can take modules for second-year students and higher. ==References== Category:Music schools in Singapore Category:National University of Singapore ","title":"Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music"},{"id":"46318895","text":"Elachista confirmata is a moth in the family Elachistidae.

He has occupied several positions in the oil sector. He is known for editing the book The People Want Reform in Qatar Too, which was subsequently banned in Qatar due to its critical views of government policies. He is one of the primary advocates for political reform in the country. ==Education== He obtained a BA in business administration from Damascus University in 1966 and received a PhD in philosophy from Durham University in 1974. ==Career== Al-Kuwari started his career in Qatar's oil and gas industry, where he served as vice chairman of Qatar Liquefied Gas Company and the National Company for Petroleum Products. He also served as chairman of the Qatar‚ÄìUnited Kingdom Joint Committee for Economic Cooperation. In 1959, he was involved in the founding of Taliaa Club Qatar, a self-titled cultural club which often held political discussions. The club's headquarters was raided by tanks and its members imprisoned in 1961. From 1975 to 1982, he worked as an economics professor at Qatar University. He co-founded the project Democracy Studies in the Arab Counties in 1991 with Raghid Al-Solh. He has published research on the 1963 Qatari nationalist movement. He traces this movement as the origin of opposition to government policies and demands for reform in the country. He is the host of a monthly meeting, known as The Monday Meetings, in which Qatari citizens debate issues related to reform. In an interview with Heinrich B√∂ll Stiftung Middle East, he commented on the demographic imbalance between foreigners and citizens in Qatar, claiming that rulers benefit from this imbalance. He goes on to state the imbalance could \\"uproot Qatari society, erase its identity and culture, take its mother tongue, Arabic, out of circulation\\". The People Want Reform in Qatar, Too In 2012, he published the book The People Want Reform in Qatar Too after successive year- long talks with 60 other Qatari writers, who formed the \\"Qataris for Reform\\" group. In it, the authors criticize the country's unpredictable economic policy and lack of transparency. They also address topics such as education, over-reliance on the United States, and the declining use of Arabic language in administration and education. The book refrained from criticizing the Qatari royal family, however. In the book's introduction, Al-Kuwari highlights four primary obstacles to reform: the lack of availability to information related to public affairs; the lack of transparency in decision-making; the absence of free and independent civil society; and the unclear boundaries between the public and private sectors, in addition to sub-par administration of these sectors. Furthermore, the book proposes alterations to the country's administration and describes ways in which the changes could be implemented. Though local authorities permitted the book's publication, Al-Kuwari's blog was censored and the book was banned in Qatar. He has previously authored numerous works in which he criticizes the lack of democracy in Arab countries. ==References== Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Qatari writers Category:Qatari journalists Category:Qatari activists Category:Qatari academics Category:Qatari economists Category:Damascus University alumni Category:Alumni of Durham University ","title":"Ali Khalifa Al-Kuwari"},{"id":"46319006","text":"Elachista watti is a moth in the family Elachistidae.

It was founded in 2008 by Jarret Myer and Brian Brater, and acquired by Woven Digital (later renamed Uproxx Media Group) in 2014. The site's target audience is men aged 18‚Äì34. It was acquired by Warner Music Group in August 2018, but Myer and CEO Benjamin Blank will remain in control of the company's operations. ==History== Uproxx was founded in 2008 by Jarret Myer and Brian Brater. The two also founded hip hop label Rawkus Records in 1996 and YouTube media company Big Frame in 2011. Uproxx was initially a network of blogs and formed when the founders partnered with the owners of other blogs, including acquiring With Leather and FilmDrunk from Fat Penguin Media founder Ryan Perry, who later signed on as creative director. Uproxx was acquired by Woven Digital in April 2014. Myer joined Woven as general manager of publishing. In December 2014, Woven raised US$18 million in Series A funding. A portion of the capital was allocated to growing Uproxx through staff hires and video development, including new web series. Uproxx acquired Dime Magazine in January 2015 to expand the sports division of the site. ==Content== Uproxx is a news and discussion website that is geared toward millennials, specifically males aged 18‚Äì34. The site covers viral news stories related to entertainment and culture, with an emphasis on sports, film, TV, and music. Uproxx is divided into verticals including Entertainment, Sports, and Life, each of which comprises multiple blogs. These blogs include \\"With Spandex\\", about pro wrestling; and \\"Dime Magazine\\", which focuses on basketball. In addition, Uproxx offers a platform for live Q&As; with celebrities and creators to promote upcoming projects. Video Video makes up a significant portion of the site's content and Uproxx produces both original and sponsored video. In 2013, Uproxx partnered with 5-Second Films to produce longer content for Uproxx Video on YouTube. Since its acquisition by Woven, Uproxx has placed more emphasis on video content and released several web series. The site launched \\"Luminaries\\", its first original series in January 2015. The show profiles young inventors and the first two episodes generated 18.5 million views within the first four months. The series was nominated for a Webby Award in 2015. The site's second series, a parodic news series called The Desk, debuted in March 2015. The next month, in April 2015, Uproxx began a documentary series centered on pop culture called Uproxx Docs. It commenced with a three-part piece about rock band Guns N‚Äô Roses. Also in 2015, Uproxx launched several sponsored video series. Among these were \\"Uncharted: Power of Dreams\\", a show that profiles rising musicians, with Honda, and \\"Human\\", a video series about artisans and others who preserve traditional work, sponsored by Coors Banquet. Human won an OMMA award in 2015. ==Staff and operations== Uproxx is headquartered in Culver City, California. The editorial staff is led by editor-in-chief Brett Michael Dykes, head of publishing Kris Maske, and Head of Studio Kurt Campbell-Anderson. The company's video production is overseen by chief creative officer Benjamin Blank. Other staff members include Steve Bramucci, managing editor of the site's Life section, Brandon Stroud, pro wrestling editor, Brian Grubb, senior TV editor, Mike Ryan, senior entertainment writer, and Vince Mancini, senior film writer. ==Uproxx Media Group== Uproxx Media Group, originally named Woven Digital, was the owner of Uproxx and its related properties until their acquisition by Warner Music Group in August 2018. History The company was founded as Woven Digital in 2010 by Scott Grimes and Michael Laur as an ad network with Grimes serving as the CEO. The network's intended audience was young men, 18 - 34 year old. Woven's mission was to bring the passion points of guys together in one place via a platform agnostic network of websites, videos, and branded content. The company grew through purchases of websites with large followings. Its first acquisition was lifestyle site BroBible in 2012. Following this were the acquisitions in 2013 of Animal New York, Guyism, and Brotips Media. As Woven's CEO, Grimes drove the 2014 acquisition of Uproxx more than doubling Woven's viewership. In that same year, Woven's reach, including its affiliated sites, exceeded that of Vox Media or Vice Media. Woven was included in the top ten of Fast Company list of \\"Most Innovative Companies in Hollywood\\" in early 2015 for \\"helping brands speak a young man's language\\". In 2015, Woven Studios was built in Culver City to produce original digital content. The company expanded Uproxx's coverage of sports with the 2015 acquisition of Dime Magazine, diversifying in film and TV by acquiring HitFix in 2016. The company changed its name in 2017 to Uproxx Media Group, to consolidate under its most public-facing brand and to focus on Uproxx's original, long-form content. On August 2, 2018, Warner Music Group announced that it had acquired Uproxx and its properties (except for BroBible, which will continue to publish independently) for an undisclosed sum, although Uproxx has raised around $43m (¬£33m) from previous investment, which provides some sense of the firm's valuation. With this acquisition, Uproxx Media Group is no longer active, with its remaining properties existing under Warner Music Group. Operations Uproxx Media Group was a digital media company that owned multiple entertainment sites and created branded content focused on a male millennial audience. , it had six main brands: Uproxx, HitFix, Dime, Real Talk, With Spandex, and BroBible. The company's sites reached more than 90 million unique viewers per month. Uproxx was the company's largest brand, with a viewership of 40 million per month. Headquartered in Culver City, the company also had production facilities in New York and Chicago. The Culver City offices housed a full production studio staffed by writers, illustrators, presenters and video editing staff; the company produced all of its own sponsored videos. Benjamin Blank was the company's chief executive officer and chief creative officer, and Colin Digiaro served as executive chairman for mergers and acquisitions and fundraising. Other key personnel included Scott Grimes, executive chairman overseeing revenue, Jen Sargent as president, and Uproxx co-creator Jarret Myer, who served as publisher. Original programming Uproxx Media Group developed web originals, long- and short-form series and films through Uproxx Studios. Specializing in documentary-style productions, the studio created a piece of branded content for fast food chain Checkers in 2017 featuring rapper Rick Ross. The short documentary-style video received a positive critical reception and was a featured entry in PR Week and Campaign's 2017 Brand Film Festival. Uproxx Media Group also created a short documentary on Guns N' Roses in 2015, and as of 2017 it has released several original series. The Uproxx series ‚ÄúUncharted‚Äù was created in partnership with Honda Stage, and has won numerous awards, most notably a Gold Clio Award in 2016. Uproxx worked with MillerCoors on \\"Human\\" and \\"Human Limits\\", a series of short documentary videos that profiled \\"inspirational\\" people, entrepreneurs, and artists that was nominated for several awards. It was a MERIT winner for 2017 The One Show and a winner at the 2017 D&AD; Awards. Uproxx has also partnered with the United States Marine Corps to create sponsored content. ==References * Category:American entertainment websites Category:Internet properties established in 2008 Category:Mass media about Internet culture Category:American companies established in 2008 Category:2008 establishments in California Category:Companies based in Culver City, California Category:Warner Music Group ","title":"Uproxx"},{"id":"46319060","text":"Elachista cupreella is a moth in the family Elachistidae.

The Frisco Silver Dollar Line is a narrow-gauge amusement park heritage railroad and attraction located in the Silver Dollar City amusement park in Branson, Missouri. The railroad opened in 1962, making it one of the oldest operating rides at Silver Dollar City.Branson's Best Day Trips: A Guide to Discovering the Best of Branson & Ozark Mountain Country, p. 80 It is themed after American railways in the 1800s. The ride includes an 1800s themed train depot, a water tower, a trestle overpass bridge, a train wreck scene, a staged train robbery, a tunnel, a rectangular shaped roundhouse and an at-grade railroad crossing. It consists of a total of seven steam locomotives, with five of them in operating condition. In 2022, the railroad will be celebrating its 60th anniversary in operation. In the middle of the ride, guests experience a show where uneducated train robbers try their best to rob the train, but guests are saved just in time by the conductor, who was tricked into searching for \\"Yankees\\" or \\"Indians.\\" Recently, the conductor may be tricked into checking to see whether or not the tunnel down the line was blown up. During the Old Time Christmas festival at the park, the train is decked- out in lights and becomes the \\"Frisco Sing-Along Steam Train\\". During this time, the train robber act is replaced by Grandpa telling the Christmas story. ==Locomotives== The Frisco Silver Dollar Line consists of a total of seven steam engines. Currently, five are in operating condition, but as of 2019, four of them are currently in active service. All five of them fire on No. 2 diesel fuel as their fuel source. They are 610 mm (2 foot) narrow-gauge steam locomotives.http://www.startribune.com/steam-engines-that-gave-children-rides- sold-to-theme-park/380374971/http://sdcfans.com/sdc-purchases-additional- steam-trains/ Engine #7 Engine #7 was built by Orenstein & Koppel (O&K;) in Hamburg, Germany in 1934. It is an type that is currently on display as in the train wreck scene, which is also known as the \\"Wreck of Old Engine 82\\". It poses as \\"Old Engine 82\\" in the fictional story of Ichabod Q. Peabody as he took said engine around a tight curve with a speed limit of 2.3 mph at the raging, blazing speed of 11.7 mph. The train jumped the tracks and crashed into the trees. Nobody was hurt and they sobered up Ichabod and got him running the train again. Davenport Locomotive The Davenport is the original steam locomotive of the Frisco Silver Dollar Line. It was built by the Davenport Locomotive Works in Davenport, Iowa in 1922. It was originally numbered 76 and it was the only engine on the line for about 8 years. It is a type tender engine. While it is unknown the official current number (76 is the number of a different engine now), some people refer to it as \\"#9\\" or more commonly, the \\"Davenport\\". It was put on display after its retirement from service up until late 2008 when it was moved to the rail yard outside of the engine roundhouse. As of 2017, it has been repainted and is currently sitting at the Depot on display. Whether or not it will run again is currently uncertain. Engine #43 Engine #43 is currently the smallest and oldest operational steam engine of the Frisco Silver Dollar Line. It was built by Orenstein & Koppel in Hamburg, Germany in 1934. #43 is the \\"sister\\" engine to #7, simply meaning that both were built by the same manufacturer of the same year and of the same model. #43 weighs about 11 tons and is exactly 21 feet, 6 1/2 inches in length from pilot to coupler. #43's cab is about 4 feet wide. The operating pressure is about 135 lbs. #43 was sold to Silver Dollar City in the 1960s. It is on many brochures and billboards and other advertisements and has become one of the most popular and iconic engines of the Frisco Silver Dollar Line. #43 operated as a type from the 1962 to 2018, but in early 2019, its pilot wheels were removed, so it is an type again. Engine #13 Engine #13 is currently the largest and second oldest operational steam engine of the Frisco Silver Dollar Line. It was built by Orenstein & Koppel in Hamburg, Germany in 1938. #13 weighs about 20 tons and is exactly 21 feet, 6 1/2 inches in length from pilot to coupler. #13's cab is between 5 1/2 and 6 feet wide. The operating pressure is about 145 lbs. #13 was sold to Silver Dollar City in the 1960s. It is probably the engine that runs the most on the line. #13 seems to have pretty strong endurance especially for an engine as old as it is. #13 started off with a \\"taper\\" shaped smoke stack meaning it was mostly straight but SLIGHTLY angled outward like a slight \\"V\\". It then had a diamond stack for a long while and eventually had a \\"funnel\\" shaped stack like #43's stack. #13 eventually got a smoke stack of its own. The particular type of stack is called \\"Radley and Hunter\\" which is shaped like an incongruent octagon. This particular stack had a \\"tin\\" sound and started trapping some of the smoke and exhaust inside the stack. The original taper stack was put back on in 2011 and has helped #13 sound more powerful than before. As of early 2018, #13 has been taken out of service and is currently awaiting a massive overhaul in the distant future. Some of its parts, most notably its bell, is currently being used on its recently restored sister engine #14. #13 operated as a type from 1962 to early 2017, but once its overhaul takes place, it will be transformed back into an type again. Engine #76 Engine #76 is currently the second youngest operational steam engine of the Frisco Silver Dollar Line. It was built by Ceskomoravska Kolben-Danek in Czechoslovakia in 1940. #76 weighs about 13.75 tons and is exactly 21 feet, 6 1/2 inches in length from pilot to coupler. #76's cab is about 5 feet wide. The operating pressure is 160 lbs. She can keep a good amount of steam in the boiler to usually steams at or around 160 lbs. #76 was sold to Silver Dollar City in the 1980s. It seems to be very popular along Frisco Silver Dollar Line fans over the years. Two things that have stood out a lot to the community are the diamond-shaped smokestack and the use of a Western Locomotive Supply Southern 3 chime steam whistle. What is unique about that particular whistle is that it is made of steel as opposed to brass or cast iron. In early 2014, #76 went into a massive overhaul to make many changes and to replace the boiler. On November 7, 2015, #76 ran trains for the first time since the rebuild and also started off the 2015 season of Silver Dollar City's Old Time Christmas. #76 operated as a type from the 1980s to 2018, but before Silver Dollar City‚Äôs Opening Day of 2019, they transformed it back to an type wheel arrangement by removing its pilot wheels. Engine #504 Engine #504 is currently the youngest operational steam engine of the Frisco Silver Dollar Line. It was built by Ceskomoravska Kolben-Danek in Czechoslovakia in 1941. It is probably the same design as #76. It is an type that was converted into a tender engine in the 1970s. It is currently the only operating locomotive on the Frisco Silver Dollar Line with a tender. The Davenport locomotive is the other engine with a tender, but is not in operating condition. In 2016, Silver Dollar City made purchases from an estate called the Northfield & Cannon Valley Railroad in Northfield, Minnesota. Those purchases were #504, a German tank engine originally numbered 2, which would be restored and renumbered to #14 to work on the Frisco Silver Dollar Line, and #2825, a little Plymouth 24\\" Switching Diesel engine. #504 began restoration to operating condition at Silver Dollar City. It was also converted from burning wood to burning oil and would be heavily Americanized. #504 made her first test runs in February 2018 and she made her official debut to the public on June 18, 2018. Since then, #504 quickly became one of the most popular engines working on the Frisco Silver Dollar Line behind both #76 and #43. However, as of October 2020, #504 is temporarily out of service while it currently undergoes some major improvements to its operations. Engine #14 Engine #14 is currently the second largest and third oldest/youngest operational steam engine of the Frisco Silver Dollar Line. It was built by Orenstein & Koppel in Hamburg, Germany in 1938 after her twin sister, #13. She steams at about 150 lbs. They both originally worked for a rock quarry in Germany as #1 and #2. In the 1960s, #1 was sold to an amusement park in the US called Silver Dollar City. It was renumbered to #13 and ran trains up until early 2017 and then being taken out of service in early 2018 awaiting a massive overhaul in the distant future. #2 worked at the quarry until the 1970s when it was sold to the original owner of #504, Jim Machacek, for his Northfield & Cannon Valley Railroad in Northfield, Minnesota. He passed away in 2012, and in 2016, both locomotives were sold to Silver Dollar City in Branson, Missouri. #504 retained its original number and #2 was renumbered to #14 to work on the Frisco Silver Dollar Line, as it is the younger twin of engine #13. #14 has been restored to operating condition and she made her official debut to the public on March 20, 2019. #14 is heavily Americanized with an 1880s style look. It is an type just like all of the other engines. She weighs about 14 tons and is 13 feet tall. Engine #2825 Engine #2825 is currently the roundhouse switching engine of the Frisco Silver Dollar Line. It was built by the Plymouth Locomotive Works between the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is a little Plymouth 24\\" Switching Diesel engine. It was first sold to Jim Machacek for his Northfield & Cannon Valley Railroad, an estate in Northfield, Minnesota, in the 1970s. After his passing in 2012, it was sold to Silver Dollar City in Branson, Missouri in 2016 along with two steam engines, #504 and #2, which would be renumbered to #14 to work on the Frisco Silver Dollar Line. It is used by the Frisco Silver Dollar Line for moving engines and empty coaches in the engine roundhouse and railyard. The engine is also used for track work and maintenance. ==Frisco‚Äôs Involvement== The St. Louis‚ÄìSan Francisco Railway, also commonly known as the ‚ÄúFrisco‚Äù, was a standard-gauge railroad which operated in the general area. It supplied construction help to the park, along with the rails and ties, back when this line was being built in 1962. Perhaps for these reasons, the trains sport the Frisco name and logo. However, this was never an actual Frisco rail line and the steam locomotives were never actual rolling stock on the Frisco. ==See also== *Dollywood Express *Rail transport in Walt Disney Parks and Resorts *Stone Mountain Scenic Railroad ==References * Category:Heritage railroads in Missouri Category:Railroads of amusement parks in the United States Category:Steam locomotives of the United States ","title":"Frisco Silver Dollar Line"},{"id":"46319229","text":"The Regional Football Association South West (), the FRVS, is one of five regional organisations of the German Football Association, the DFB, and covers the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland.Regional Associations DFB website - Map and details of the regional associations, accessed: 6 April 2015 ==Overview== DFB, its five regional and 21 state associations The association was formed on 3 August 1950 as the Fu√üball-Verband Rheinland-Pfalz when the South West German Football Association left the Southern German Football Association in mutual consent over a dispute over whether the Oberliga should be played in one or two regional divisions.100 Jahre S√ºddeutscher Fussball- Verband, p. 19 It was renamed on 11 July 1956 to Fu√üball-Verband Rheinland- Pfalz-Saar before receiving its current name on 12 July 1958.FRVS website accessed: 6 April 2015 The FRVS is in turn subdivided into the Rhineland Football Association, South West German Football Association and the Saarland Football Association.

There, he became an engineer working in the field of electronics, telecoms and guided weapon systems. ==Career== Baxter's career in the Australian Army spanned nine years from 1986 to 1995. In 1994, at the age of 23, Baxter put his life savings of $11,000 on the line to launch his first start-up, an internet service provider, SE Net from the spare room of his Adelaide home. Servicing more than 35,000 customers, SE Net was eventually acquired by Ozemail/UUNet under the stewardship of its founding Director and former Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull. In 2001, Baxter teamed with schoolmate and Australian technology entrepreneur Bevan Slattery to launch his second start-up, PIPE Networks.

They have released two albums and two EPs. ==Career== Gates formed in 2011 while the various band members had settled in New Jersey. Koozer (ex Lydia), moved from Arizona while King, Maroney and Crapanzano were in the band Bears & Bright Lights. Koozer joined the band and Dye replaced the original singer, prompting the name change to Gates. Originally from Michigan, Dye moved to Brooklyn in 2010 after earning a degree in Telecommunication, Information Studies and Media. He interned at a number of studios, including Levon Helm Studios under the tutelage of Justin Guip. In 2011 they self- released debut EP titled The Sun Will Rise And Lead Me Home. The following year they released their second self-released EP titled You Are All You Have Left To Fear. Both recordings were produced and engineered by Dye. In 2012 their six-track debut EP was re-released on vinyl by Devildance Records. On April 30, 2013 Gates signed to Pure Noise Records. Their second EP was remixed by Mike Watts and re-released in the fall of 2013 via Pure Noise Records. In April 2014 Gates announced they were supporting Have Mercy and Pentimento on their co-headlining tour. They also supported The Gaslight Anthem in the same year, and embarked on their first UK tour with Fallacies. In September 2014, Gates premiered a new song titled \\"Low\\" from their first full-length album. In September, the band released another song from the album titled \\"Not My Blood\\" and premiered \\"Born Dead\\" via Alternative Press.

As opposed to the previous record, Dye began using a piano and a sampler to develop songs such as \\"Color Worn\\". On alreadyheard.com the album was described as an \\"airy and ethereal listen\\".

According to automatic visa revalidation, people on some non-immigrant visa statuses who visit Canada, Mexico or some adjacent islands close to the United States for a period of less than 30 days can re-enter the United States based on a valid Form I-94 even if their visa has expired. ==Rules== A person is eligible for automatic visa revalidation provided the following conditions are met: * The underlying authorization for the current status continues to be valid (such as the Form I-129 for non-immigrant workers or Form I-20 for students in F status). * The person‚Äôs absence from the United States was 30 days or less. * The person did not visit any countries other than Mexico or Canada in that period. People on F visa or J visa statuses are also allowed to have visited adjacent islands to the United States (i.e., the Caribbean Islands). * The person does not have a pending (or rejected) application for a new visa. Since it is not possible to renew a non-immigrant visa in the United States a person on a non-immigrant visa may travel to a nearby country to apply for a new visa. However, such a person becomes ineligible for automatic visa revalidation based on the rules, so automatic visa revalidation cannot be used as a fallback option for somebody trying to renew an expired visa. * The person is not a citizen of one of the countries designated by the US as a state sponsor of terrorism. As of 2018, the list includes four countries: North Korea (designated November 20, 2017), Iran (designated January 19, 1984), Sudan (designated December 29, 1979), and Syria (designated August 12, 1993). ==Similar exceptions== * The Visa Waiver Program allows nationals of 38 countries to enter the United States without visas, but they can enter only for short-term business/tourism trips, under conditions similar to those governing B visas. * Some people currently in the United States can apply for advance parole that allows them to leave and re-enter the United States without a valid visa. Advance parole is not a generic re-entry permit. == Relation with change of status == Automatic visa revalidation also applies to cases where the applicant never acquired a visa for his or her current non- immigrant status but rather transitioned through it by filing the appropriate form to change non-immigrant status (such as Form I-129 or Form I-539). Instead of the \\"visa\\", what gets revalidated is the change of status, and therefore in lieu of the visa the applicant must carry the Form I-797 Approval Notice in addition to all the other supporting documentation. In particular, it does not matter if the applicant has never acquired a visa for the new status. ==References== Category:Visa policy of the United States ","title":"Automatic visa revalidation"},{"id":"46319516","text":"Kanda is a Michelin 3-star kaiseki restaurant located in Minato, Tokyo.

The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) ‚Äì 1. Shyampukur, 2.

He was instrumental in establishing the townships of Drayton and Toowoomba. ==Early life== Thomas Alford was born on 6 September 1817 in The Rectory, St Audries church, West Quantoxhead, Somerset, England, the son of Charles Alford (the rector of West Quantoxhead) and his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Symes). On 7 August 1839 he married Elizabeth Boulton at Paterson, New South Wales. ==Drayton== Meehans Hotel in Darling Street Drayton, originally established by Thomas Alford, circa 1856 Drayton started out as a settlement known as The Springs near a number of pastoral properties in the eastern Darling Downs in the early half of the 1840s. Thomas Alford was an early settler in the area who built a house and general store in the area. He named his house St Audries (the name of his father's church in England) and the town after his home village, Drayton in Somerset. Alford obtained a license to sell alcohol from his store in 1844, after which it became known as The Downs Inn. In 1846 the inn was transferred to Stephen Mehan (or Meehan) and Alford built a house and store that incorporated the first post office on the Darling Downs, opening on 1 January 1846. Thomas Alford's son, Henry King Alford, was born on 22 July 1842, apparently the first white child born in Toowoomba. Henry King was to be the mayor of Toowoomba from 1911-1912. Henry's christening on 29 August 1852 was the first Anglican church service in Toowoomba and the first time the name \\"Toowoomba\\" appears in a written document, the name being attributed to Henry's mother, Elizabeth Alford. ==Later life== Thomas Alford died at his residence in Russell Street, Toowoomba, on Saturday 9 January 1864 aged 46 years after a long illness.

Intracellular transport is contrasted with intercellular transport, the directed movement of vesicles and substances between cells. Eukaryotic cells transport packets of components to particular intracellular locations by attaching them to molecular motors that haul them along microtubules and actin filaments. Since intracellular transport heavily relies on microtubules for movement, the components of the cytoskeleton play a vital role in trafficking vesicles between organelles and the plasma membrane by providing mechanical support. Through this pathway, it is possible to facilitate the movement of essential molecules such as membrane‚Äêbounded vesicles and organelles, mRNA, and chromosomes. Intracellular transport between the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum because they possess organelles enclosed in membranes that need to be mediated for exchange of cargo to take place. Conversely, in prokaryotic cells, there is no need for this specialized transport mechanism because there are no membranous organelles and compartments to traffic between. Prokaryotes are able to subsist by allowing materials to enter the cell via simple diffusion. Intracellular transport is more specialized than diffusion; it is a multifaceted process which utilizes transport vesicles. Transport vesicles are small structures within the cell consisting of a fluid enclosed by a lipid bilayer that hold cargo. These vesicles will typically execute cargo loading and vesicle budding, vesicle transport, the binding of the vesicle to a target membrane and the fusion of the vesicle membranes to target membrane. To ensure that these vesicles embark in the right direction and to further organize the cell, special motor proteins attach to cargo- filled vesicles and carry them along the cytoskeleton. For example, they have to ensure that lysosomal enzymes are transferred specifically to the golgi apparatus and not to another part of the cell which could lead to deleterious effects. ==Fusion== Small membrane bound vesicles responsible for transporting proteins from one organelle to another are commonly found in endocytic and secretory pathways. Vesicles bud from their donor organelle and release the contents of their vesicle by a fusion event in a particular target organelle. The net movement of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the golgi apparatus represents one form of intracellular transport through this mode of vesicle budding. Since the ER is the site of protein synthesis, it would serve as the parent organelle, and the cis face of the golgi, where proteins and signals are received, would be the acceptor. In order for the transport vesicle to accurately undergo a fusion event, it must first recognize the correct target membrane then fuse with that membrane. This fusion event allows for the delivery of the vesicles contents mediated by proteins such as SNARE proteins. SNAREs are small, tail-anchored proteins which are often post- translationally inserted into membranes that are responsible for the fusion event necessary for vesicles to transport between organelles in the cytosol. There are two forms of SNARES, the t-SNARE and v-SNARE, which fit together similar to a lock and key. ==Role of endocytosis== Intracellular transport is an overarching category of how cells obtain nutrients and signals. One very well understood form of intracellular transport is known as endocytosis. Endocytosis is defined as the uptake of material by the invagination of plasma membrane. More specifically, eukaryotic cells use endocytosis of the uptake of nutrients, down regulation of growth factor receptors‚Äô and as a mass regulator of the signaling circuit. This method of transport is largely intercellular in lieu of uptake of large particles such as bacteria via phagocytosis in which a cell engulfs a solid particle to form an internal vesicle called a phagosome. However, much of these processes have an intracellular component. Phagocytosis is of great importance to intracellular transport because once a substance is deemed harmful and engulfed in a vesicle, it can be trafficked to the appropriate location for degradation. These endocytosed molecules are sorted into early endosomes within the cell which serves to further sort these substances to the correct final destination (in the same way the Golgi does in the secretory pathway). From here, the early endosome starts a cascade of transport where the cargo is eventually hydrolyzed inside the lysosome for degradation. This capability is necessary for degradation of any cargo that is harmful or unnecessary for the cell, this is commonly seen in response to foreign material. Phagocytosis has an immunologic function and role in apoptosis. Additionally, endocytosis can be observed through the nonspecific internalization of fluid droplets via pinocytosis and in receptor mediated endocytosis. ==Role of microtubules== A cytoplasmic dynein motor bound to a microtubule. A kinesin molecule bound to a microtubule. Microtubules function as tracks in the intracellular transport of membrane-bound vesicles and organelles. This process is propelled by motor proteins such as dynein. Microtubules are organized so their plus ends extend through the periphery of the cells and their minus ends are anchored within the centrosome, so they utilize the motor proteins kinesin‚Äôs (positive end directed) and dynein‚Äôs (negative end directed) to transport vesicles and organelles in opposite directions through the cytoplasm. Each type of membrane vesicle is specifically bound to its own kinesin motor protein via binding within the tail domain. One of the major roles of microtubules is to transport membrane vesicles and organelles through the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. It is speculated that areas within the cell considered \\"microtubule-poor\\" are probably transported along microfilaments aided by a myosin motor protein. In this manner, microtubules assist the transport of chromosomes towards the spindle poles by utilizing the dynein motor proteins during anaphase. ==Diseases== By understanding the components and mechanisms of intracellular transport it is possible to see its implication in diseases. Defects encompass improper sorting of cargo into transport carriers, vesicle budding, issues in movement of vesicles along cytoskeletal tracks, and fusion at the target membrane. Since the life cycle of the cell is a highly regulated and important process, if any component goes awry there is the possibility for deleterious effects. If the cell is unable to correctly execute components of the intracellular pathway there is the impending possibility for protein aggregates to form. Growing evidence supports the concept that deficits in axonal transport contributes to pathogenesis in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. It is proposed that protein aggregations due to faulty transport is a leading cause of the development of ALS, Alzheimer‚Äôs and dementia. On the other hand, targeting the intracellular transport processes of these motor proteins constitutes the possibility for pharmacological targeting of drugs. By understanding the method in which substances move along neurons or microtubules it is possible to target specific pathways for disease. Currently, many drug companies are aiming to utilize the trajectory of intracellular transport mechanisms to deliver drugs to localized regions and target cells without harming healthy neighboring cells. The potential for this type of treatment in anti-cancer drugs is an exciting, promising area of research. ==See also== * Transport by multiple-motor proteins * Kinesin * Adaptor protein * Leelamine * Dynactin * MCOLN2 * KIF6, KIF5A, involved in intracellular organelle transport * COG2, COG4, COG5, COG7 * Sterol carrier protein ==References== Category:Cellular processes Category:Cytoskeleton ","title":"Intracellular transport"},{"id":"46319814","text":"Sushi Yoshitake is a Michelin 3-star sushi restaurant in Ginza, Ch≈´≈ç, Tokyo, Japan.

When Metz became German after the Franco-German War, the Putz family applied for French citizenship. Despite they were of German descent, they preferred to be French. Henri studied at the √âcole Polytechnique where he left in 1879 as 6th of his class, and opted for the artillery. He fought against Tunisian insurgents in 1881‚Äì1882. Later he was stationed in Asia, where he participated in the Tonkin Campaign (1885‚Äì1887). He also fought in the Madagascar expedition (1896‚Äì1899) and the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion (1900‚Äì1901). == World War I == At the outbreak of World War I, as a Division general he received command of the 28th Infantry Division, which was part of the First Army under Auguste Dubail. His division saw heavy fighting during August 1914 in the Battle of the Vosges. When the focus of the fighting moved west towards the Marne, Henri Putz was appointed on 7 September as commander of the Groupement des Vosges, later renamed Army Detachment of the Vosges and 34th Army Corps. On 2 April 1915, he was put at the head of the Army Detachment in Belgium, which defended the northern part of the Ypres Salient. It was here that, on 22 April 1915, the Germans launched their surprise gas-attack, starting the Second Battle of Ypres. Between 17 June 1915 and 19 December 1917 he commanded the 4th Army Corps, which fought on the Argonne, Aisne and Somme. From 23 December 1917 to 19 April 1918, he was head of the Commandement sup√©rieur du Nord. After the War, he moved to his hometown Metz again and died here in 1925. He was buried at Les Invalides.

A parent might hire a homework coach when their child is struggling in school not because they have difficulties with the academic material but because of problems with study skills, organization, executive function skills and motivation. The goal of the coach is to teach the child to become a successful student by learning to plan assignments, organize materials, manage time effectively and, in the case of an ADHD student, learn ways to manage the symptoms of their attention deficit disorder. As such, the role of a homework coach is similar to ADHD coaching but is focused specifically on success in school. Some providers use the term \\"homework helper\\" as well as \\"homework coach.\\" ==Applicability== A homework coach is indicated for any student whose poor performance in school or college appears to be more related to organization and study skills rather than difficulty understanding the instructional material. Such students may show signs of ADHD or Executive Function disorder. Current statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control show that as many as 11% of school children 4‚Äì17 years in age had received an ADHD diagnosis. Among ADHD students, about 33% will not graduate high school with their peers, which is about twice the rate of the non-ADHD student population. By hiring a homework coach, parents hope that the added support in building study skills, helping plan assign assignments, test- taking strategies and general homework monitoring will keep their children on track in school and increase their chances of graduating on time. ==Effectiveness== The efficacy of homework coaching is in general measured by parents in terms of higher grades and less discord in the household over their student's homework habits. There are also many anecdotal news stories and case studies relating how a homework coach has helped students improve their grades and self-confidence. The intensity and tempo of homeworkes affect stress resistance and quite emmotsionalny state of the pupil. The correct approach to the implementation of tasks will allow to perform all tasks with maximum efficiency. ==See also== *Tutor *Coaching *Mentorship ==References== Category:Life coaching Category:Educational psychology Category:Teaching ","title":"Homework coach"},{"id":"46320036","text":"Suparawra (the name of an apu,Rodolfo S√°nchez Garrafa, Apus de los Cuatro Suyos: construcci√≥n del mundo en los ciclos mitol√≥gicos de las deidades monta√±a Hispanicized spelling Suparaura) is a mountain in the Andes of Peru.

He was canonized as a saint on 9 August 1613 and his feast falls on the date of his death. ==Biography== Albert de Louvain was born in 1166 as the second of two sons to Duke Godfrey III, Count of Leuven, and his first wife Margareta van Limburg. He was the brother of Henry I, Duke of Brabant. Albert was educated at the cathedral school of Saint-Lambert in Li√®ge. In 1187, when news of the fall of Jerusalem reached Liege, Albert resigned his offices, took the cross, and had himself knighted. The following year Cardinal Henry of Albano, restored his ecclesiastical status. In 1188, he became the Archdeacon of Li√®ge and later received the subdiaconate in 1191. That same year he was elected Bishop of Li√®ge and despite the fact that he had not reached the canonical age of 30, his appointment was widely approved. Gilbert of Mons, chancellor of Count Baldwin V of Hainaut, who attended the election, along with other princes and nobles, described the proceedings as a power struggle between Albert's brother Henry and Baldwin. His crosier. Albert's appointment was opposed by Baldwin, who had a second group of canons elect his own relative, Albert de Rethel. Albert de Rethel was a maternal-uncle of Empress Constance who had planned to support him with the Emperor but had been captured by Sicilians earlier. As the election appeared to be in dispute, the Emperor supported Lothar of Hochstaden, provost of the church of St Cassius in Bonn and brother of Count Dietrich of Hochstaden. Albert took the matter to Rome and appealed to Pope Celestine III. In May 1192, Pope Celestine III made Albert a cardinal, and ordained him in Rome as a deacon on 30 May 1192. He was then ordained to the priesthood on 19 September 1192 by Cardinal Guillaume de Champagne. He received episcopal consecration the next day and celebrated his first mass on 21 September in the Reims Cathedral. Albert met three German knights in 1192 who persuaded him to ride on horseback with them outside of Reims. Outside of the city they attacked Albert with their swords and struck him on the head which crushed his skull and caused him to fall, where they made sure they killed him prior to making an escape. He was buried at the cathedral of Reims.St. Albert‚Äôs Namesake ==Aftermath== The immediate reaction to the murder was an uprising of the princes of Lower Lorraine led by the dukes of Brabant and Limburg, brother and uncle respectively of the slain bishop. They formed a group that eventually came to include the archbishops of Cologne and Mainz and other princes, and laid waste the territory of Dietrich of Hochstaden. Faced with the hostility of the people of Leige, Bishop-elect Lothar fled to the imperial court. He was excommunicated by Pope Celestine. The assassins, including one Otto of Barenste, fled to the imperial court, where Henry seems to have taken no particular action against them. Historians are divided as to the part the Emperor may or may not have played in planning the murder of the Bishop Albert. ==Canonization== The reputation of the holiness of Albert de Louvain soon spread after his death and was hailed as a martyr, thus, leading to the opening of his cause for canonization. Pope Paul V canonized him on 9 August 1613 and instituted his feast day as the date of his death. His body reposed at Rheims until 1921, when it was moved to Brussels. ==Sources== The Vita Alberti episcopi Leodiensis was probably written around 1194 or 1195 by an anonymous monk of Lobbes, from information supplied by Abbot Werrich, who knew Albert well. Although a panegyric for the murdered bishop, Raymond H. Schmandt considers it generally accurate. A different viewpoint is found in the Chronicon Hanoniense of Gislebert of Mons, written shortly after 1196. ==References *Schmandt, Raymond H. \\"The Election and Assassination of Albert of Louvain, Bishop of Li√®ge, 1191-92.\\" Speculum 42.4 (1967): 639-60 Category:1166 births Category:1192 deaths Category:French cardinals Category:12th-century venerated Christians Category:Belgian Roman Catholics Category:Belgian Roman Catholic saints Category:Murdered Roman Catholic priests Category:12th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:12th- century Christian saints Category:Prince-Bishops of Li√®ge Albert Category:Murdered cardinals Category:12th-century Roman Catholic martyrs ","title":"Albert of Louvain"},{"id":"46320063","text":"Mitchell Josef Santner (born 5 February 1992) is a New Zealand international cricketer who plays all forms of the game. Domestically, he plays for Northern Districts cricket team. He is an all-rounder who bats left-handed, and bowls slow left-arm orthodox spin. He has been involved in the highest 7th wicket partnership for New Zealand in Tests. Santner was elevated towards the New Zealand team after a promising 2014‚Äì15 domestic season. He was named in the one-day squad for the tour of England following the retirement of Daniel Vettori after the 2015 World Cup as New Zealand searched for another left-arm spin option. Santner was then drafted into the touring squad at the start of the England tour to cover for the absence of the players at the Indian Premier League and made an immediate impression with a well-crafted 94 against Somerset. He was handed his One Day International debut at Edgbaston having played just 19 List A matches for Northern Districts. ==International career== In April 2015, Santner was named in the New Zealand limited-overs squad for the tour of England. He made his One Day International debut for New Zealand on 9 June 2015. His first international wicket was when he trapped fellow debutant Sam Billings for 3. During the fourth ODI in the same series he hit 28 runs off Adil Rashid in one over, which is the second highest runs off one over ever posted in England. He made his Twenty20 International debut in the same series on 23 June 2015. On 27 November 2015, Santner debuted in his first Test match against Australia. That match was also the first day/night Test. He also became the first player in history to make his test debut in a Day Night Test Match, where he made his debut against Australia.

In March 2018, Santner was out of the Test series against England, after suffering a knee injury, ruling him out of action for six to nine months. The injury meant Santner's planned spell in English county cricket with Derbyshire and Indian Premier League during 2018 had to be cancelled. In May 2018, he was one of twenty players to be awarded a new contract for the 2018‚Äì19 season by New Zealand Cricket.  2019  Santner made the international comeback against Sri Lanka on 11 January, 2019 in the only T20I between the sides before going on to play in four of the five ODIs against India as well as all three T20Is and then two of the three ODIs against Bangladesh later during the same summer.

He was active as a painter of altarpieces and allegorical scenes. He was a prolific draughtsman who made designs for tapestry workshops, publishers and house decorations. His patrons included leading personalities in the Southern Netherlands. ==Life== Godfried Maes was born in Antwerp where he trained with his father and the history painter Pieter van Lint. He became a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1672 and married Josina Baeckelandt in 1675.Godfried Maes at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Divines M√©tamorphoses, par Godfried Maes (Anvers 1649-1700) at F.

His work was very well received throughout the Southern Netherlands. He completed commissions for churches and private clients in Antwerp, Brussels and Li√®ge. He worked for Eugen Alexander Franz, 1st Prince of Thurn and Taxis in Brussels for whom he realized ceiling decorations with allegorical scenes glorifying the family of Thurn and Taxis. Between 1697 and 1700, he worked for Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, at the time the Governor of the Southern Netherlands, on the decoration of the ceiling of his residence, the Palace of Coudenberg, in Brussels. The design represented the figures of Peace and Freedom accompanied by the muses Calliope and Clio. He was the teacher of Willem Ignatius Kerricx, Matheus Neckens, Anthonie du Pr√©, Dominicus Smout, Jacob Sucquet and Gerard Thomas. He died in Antwerp on 30 May 1700 as is testified by the inscription on his grave in the St James Church in Antwerp.p. 294 ==Work== Classicist Godfried Maes painted religious, mythological and allegorical themes on a grand scale. He is therefore often regarded as a representative of the last generation of Flemish artists who practised Baroque painting, before it developed into Rococo. However, his work shows more affinity with the Classicism that had developed in Italy and France in the second half of the 17th century.Leo van Puyvelde, Thierry van Puyvelde, Flemish painting, the age of Rubens and Van Dyck, McGraw-Hill, 1 Jan 1971, p. 172 Metamorphoses Emblem from De ongemaskerde liefde des hemels Maes made 83 preparatory designs for an edition of the Metamorphoses of Ovidius. Maes' widow sold 45 of these drawings to the Dutch art dealer Jacob de Wit in 1717. The drawings remained together until 1762 when they were sold and dispersed. The designs were apparently never used in a publication prior to the sale of the drawings to de Wit. The drawings and drawings after Maes' designs were later engraved by Bernard Picart et Peter van Gunst for the 1732 edition of the French translation of the Metamorphoses by the abbot Antoine Banier.M. l'Abb√© Banie, Ovide : Les M√©tamorphoses at Gallica The design drawings have become split up and some are kept at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (3 drawings), Fondation Custodia (two drawings) and the British Museum while a set of 18 was sold on 13 January 2013 by Christie‚Äôs.Godfried Maes (Antwerp 1649-1700) Godfried Maes, Eighteen illustrations for Ovid's Metamorphoses at Christie'sGodfried Maes, Illustrations to the Metamorphoses of Ovid: Jupiter and Io (.1); Jupiter and Io, disguised as a white heifer (.2); Mercury Rescuing Io from Argus (.3) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Maes' designs for the Metamorphoses show a good knowledge of anatomy and a taste for drawing. These drawings reveal a secure and precise brush, an inclination for idealization and a search for perfection. They reveal the influence of Antique models and Roman examples of the Renaissance and a similarity to the achievements of the French artists of the late 17th century. However, his compositions do not deny his Northern heritage in their interest for minute detail and realism. These drawings show Maes to be one of the most interesting artists of the Flemish classicism at the end of the 17th century. The works of Maes form a kind of link between the Franco-Roman Classicism of Nicolas Poussin and the Flemish classical tradition, just like the works of the painter G√©rard de Lairesse were for Dutch painting. Cartoons He provided cartoons to the Flemish tapestry workshops. He is recorded as a designer for the Brussels tapestry workshop of Urbanus Leyniers.Koenraad Brosens, A contextual study of Brussels tapestry, 1670-1770: the dye works and tapestry workshop of Urbanus Leyniers (1674-1747), Paleis der Academi√´n, 2004, p. 134 A number of Brussels tapestry producers executed suites of The Seasons and Elements and The Four Continents after designs by Godfried Maes.Koenraad Brosens, Christa C.

Vanessa Helder (May 30, 1904 ‚Äì May 1, 1968) was an American watercolor painter who gained national attention in the 1930s and 40s, mainly for her paintings of scenes in Eastern Washington. She painted with a bold, Precisionist style not commonly associated with watercolor, rendering landscapes, industrial scenes, and houses with a Magic Realist touch that gave them a forlorn, isolated quality, somewhat in the manner of Charles Sheeler and Edward Hopper. She spent most of her career in the Pacific Northwest (later moving to California), but was popular in New York art galleries, was a member of the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors, and, in 1943, was included in a major exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art. She continued painting and exhibiting after moving to Los Angeles with her husband, architect Jack Paterson, but her career was slowed by the post-war rise of Abstract Expressionism, and later by the health problems of both her and her husband. They died a few days apart, in 1968. For many years Helder's work was out of vogue and largely forgotten by the public, but the power of her art has gradually been rediscovered, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. The Tacoma Art Museum held an exhibition of her work in 2013, and the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture in Spokane has her twenty-two piece series relating to the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam ‚Äì generally considered her masterwork ‚Äì in its permanent collection. ==Early life== Zama Vanessa Helder was born May 30, 1904, in the town of Lynden, near Bellingham, in Whatcom County, Washington.Bullock, Margaret, and Martin, David F.; Austere Beauty: The Art of Z. Vanessa Helder, University of Washington Press, 2013; The name \\"Zama\\" (which Helder disliked) was taken from the ancient Carthaginian battle site where Hannibal was defeated by the Romans, reputed to be a place of spiritual energy, making it significant to her parents, who were interested in Theosophism and Spiritualism.Who was Z Vanessa Helder (Extended); Tacoma Art Museum video; https://vimeo.com/71129451 retvd 4 8 15 Her father, Rynard, was a businessman; her mother, Anna, was a music and art lover who gave young Vanessa her first painting lessons. She had a brother, R. Wright Helder, who became a professional photographer. Vanessa became proficient in landscape painting with watercolor at an early age. She graduated from Whatcom High School and studied at the University of Washington before winning, in 1934, a scholarship to the Art Students League of New York. There, she studied under well-known artists such as Robert Brackman, Frank DuMond, and George Picken.'Who was Z Vanessa Helder (Extended); video by Tacoma Art Museum; https://vimeo.com/71129451 retvd 4 6 15 ==Career== In New York, Helder quickly attracted notice. She gained membership in both the Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and the American Watercolor Society, which led to inclusion in group shows at prominent galleries, and eventually representation by the Grant Studio, and later the Macbeth Gallery. Although she painted a variety of subjects in a variety of locations, her realist yet unearthly Northwest landscapes proved popular in New York, and she regularly traveled back to Washington to go on painting trips with friends such as Ebba Rapp and Blanche Losey, who were fellow members of the Women Painters of Washington association. Petit Mansion, 1942, Z. Vanessa Helder. In 1937, Helder moved to Seattle to take up a Works Progress Administration (WPA) job offered by Bruce Inverarity, the Federal Art Project director for Washington. This included painting murals at the Washington State Capitol in Olympia and at Sand Point Naval Air Station in Seattle (both now lost). She entered several paintings in the Northwest Annuals, and had a solo exhibition at the Seattle Art Museum. In 1939, at Inverarity's request, she began teaching classes in watercolor, oil painting, and lithography at the Spokane Art Center, working alongside avant-gardists such as Margaret Tomkins, Carl Morris, and Guy Anderson. As an established professional working in a more traditional style, she was somewhat out of place on the faculty, but was able to spend a great deal of time roaming about Eastern Washington, painting landscapes.Archives of American Art; Oral history interview of the board of the Spokane Art Center, 1965 November 18, by Dorothy Bestor; http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-board- spokane-art-center-12298 retvd 4 5 15 It was in this period, from 1939 to 1941, that she painted the Grand Coulee series, often cited of as her best work. Wrote Seattle Times art critic Michael Upchurch in 2013: \\"The contrast in these, between geometric structures (the dam in progress, the outbuildings arrayed around it) and the more organic flow of the dam's natural surroundings (scalloped desert hills, plunging watercourses), continually draws the eye. 'Sand and Gravel Works', for instance, is a whole symphony of interconnected inclines, angles, slopes and shadows. 'Jackhammer Crew' makes the most of the interplay between standing human forms, their drills and coiling drill hoses and the craggy rock beneath them. [...] There's a thrilling dynamism to the way she mixes stone outcrop, flowing water and sky reflection in these paintings.\\" Sand and Gravel Works, ca. 1940, Z. Vanessa Helder. Collection of Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture. After moving back to Seattle in 1941, Helder married industrial architect Robert J.S. \\"Jack\\" Paterson. Following the Pearl Harbor attack, she joined the Washington State Artists Council for Defense. She continued exhibiting locally and nationally, and in 1943 reached a high point in her career when works of hers were selected for inclusion in American Realists and Magic Realists, a major exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. A dozen of her paintings were hung alongside works by John James Audubon, Winslow Homer, Edward Hopper, Charles Sheeler, and Andrew Wyeth. Following the triumph of the MoMA show, Helder moved to Los Angeles to be with her husband, who had moved there for work reasons. With her typical energy and sense of professionalism, she joined the California Watercolor Society, did volunteer work with wounded soldiers, lectured on art, continued to exhibit in New York, and, in 1945, had a solo show at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. From 1952 to 1955 she taught at the Los Angeles Art Institute. ==Later years== Helder made some attempt to keep pace with post-war changes in artistic taste, but was eventually squeezed out of the New York galleries by the popularity of Abstract Expressionism. In the Pacific Northwest she came to be overshadowed by Mark Tobey, Morris Graves, Guy Anderson, and other artists of the \\"Northwest School\\". Nevertheless, she remained a well-respected \\"WPA artist\\" and master of watercolor. Aware of its artistic and cultural value, Helder had resisted selling pieces of the Grand Coulee series individually, finally selling the complete collection to the Eastern Washington State Historical Society (now the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture) in 1954. Both Helder and her husband suffered from poor health, and she spent much of her energy in her last years caring for him. She died on May 1, 1968, a week after her husband, in Los Angeles. ==Legacy== Works by Vanessa Helder have been exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York; the Oakland Museum, the Denver Art Museum, and the Seattle Art Museum; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Cascadia Art Museum in Edmonds, WA and Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA; and numerous other museums and galleries. In 2013 the Tacoma Art Museum presented a major retrospective of her work, and the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture in Spokane, WA has displayed her Grand Coulee series on several occasions. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Seattle Art Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Newark Museum, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, GA, the Portland Art Museum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the St. Louis Art Museum, the American Academy of Arts and Letters, N.Y., IBM Corporation, and the Northwest Museum of Art and Culture in Spokane.

Her friends continually urged her to divorce him but she refused to do so and stated that marriage was a sacred sacrament that could never be broken. Every day, she continually prayed for her husband's conversion. The political situation in the nation altered dramatically in 1883, and Catholic gatherings were outlawed as were churches and other institutions. But some, including Victoire, ignored this and continued to live the faith in a peaceful manner. She helped to lead the movement until peace was restored in 1885. Her husband died on 14 March 1888 asking for forgiveness and being baptized prior to his death. After this, she spent the rest of her years caring for the poor, sick and imprisoned and devoted herself wholly to prayer. She died peacefully on 21 August 1894. Her tomb is located inside the Andohalo Cathedral's chapel.https://en.abouna.org/en/content/madagascar-pope-visits-tomb-blessed- victoire-rasoamanarivo ==Beatification== Chapel The cause for beatification started on 19 February 1956, which allowed for her to be made a Servant of God. Pope John Paul II declared her to have lived a life of heroic virtue and proclaimed her to be Venerable. He also approved a miracle attributed to her intercession on 9 May 1985, paving the way for her to be beatified on 30 April 1989. Another miracle was investigated and led to the validation on 25 November 2005. The medical board of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints approved the miracle on 9 October 2008, and it must pass two more hurdles before papal approval. ==References *Hagiography Circle *Saints SQPN Category:1848 births Category:1894 deaths Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:People from Antananarivo Category:19th-century Malagasy people Category:Malagasy Roman Catholics Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope John Paul II ","title":"Victoire Rasoamanarivo"},{"id":"46320370","text":"View of Notre-Dame church. Note the truncated tower and the triumphal arch that forms the entrance to the close The Lampaul-Guimiliau Parish close (Enclos paroissial) is located at Lampaul-Guimiliau in the arrondissement of Morlaix in Brittany in north-western France. It is a monumental churchyard belonging to the √âglise Notre-Dame in that town. This church was built in the late 16th century to replace an older one. The structures in the parish close date to the 16th and 17th century. It is a listed historical monument since 1910. Eglise Notre-Dame ==Calvary== The calvary in the grounds of the Notre- Dame church at Lampaul-Guimiliau. Note the two angels gathering Jesus' blood in chalices. Under the bad robber on the right is a demon and an angel is carved under the good robber The Lampaul-Guimiliau parish close boasts two calvaries. One, carved from kersanton stone, dates to the 16th century and is placed on top of the triumphal arch, the entrance to the enclosure, which dates to 1668 and comprises the central cross with gibbets on either side bearing the penitent thief and the impenitent thief. The central cross measures 4 metres in height. There is a statue of Mary Magdalene at the base of the cross and on the ornate crosspiece are back to back statues of Saint Peter and Saint John the Evangelist and Saint John with Saint Paul. The second calvary is 5.5 metres high and comprises a single shaft at the top of which is a Jesus is crucified with the two thieves on gibbets on either side. On the reverse of Jesus is a pi√®ta, sadly much mutilated, although it was restored in 1993. Below Jesus are two small angels holding a chalice in which they have collected his Blood and under the bad thief there is a depiction of a demon ready to whisk his soul off to hell. Beneath the good thief, the depiction of an angel promises his soul a better fate.

Kerlezroux. The motto \\"Memento mori\\" is written above the ossuary door, contrasting with the fine carving of the Tree of life on the door itself; the sculptor juxtaposed images of life and death. Inside the ossuary there is an altarpiece depicting the resurrection with a depiction of the \\"Risen Lord\\" with Saint Sebastian to the left and Saint Roch on the right. Also to the left of the altarpiece are statues of Saint Anne and the Virgin Mary and on the right a statue of Saint Pol and the dragon. The \\"Mise au Tombeau\\" or Burial of Jesus, shown in the photographs which appear later, was originally in the ossuary, but was subsequently moved to the church. Above the door there is also a sculpture of a man's head: he gingerly strokes his beard. Thus in its overall imagery, the ossuary deals not just with death but life and resurrection. Carving on ossuary. A man strokes his beard ==Porch== Saint Michael fights the dragon. Sculpture by Bastien Prigent on the south porch exterior at Lampaul-Guimiliau. Beneath the statue is a carving depicting a half demon/half fish creature This large Gothic porch dates to 1533.

The porch leads to a double doored entrance to the church. A statue of the Virgin Mary with child is placed over the doors. The porch also contains a stoup. The porch would have provided an area for merchants to hold discussions. ==Bell tower== The bell tower was built in 1573 and was one of the highest in Finist√®re.

It was declared as one of the eight Architectural Treasures of the Philippines by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. Located in Lingayen, this government building was constructed during the term of the late Governor Daniel Maramba, the \\"Grand Old Man of Pangasinan\\". == History and Architecture == The provincial capitol, designed by Daniel Burnham, was built on April 21, 1917 and was completed in 1918 with a budget of three hundred thousand pesos. Twenty five hectares of land was obtained by the provincial government and the construction was led by the seventh governor of Pangasinan Daniel Maramba; Members Segundo Estaris and Victor Tomelden; Treasurer J.W. Crow; District Engineer Chas Dandors; and Consulting Architect Ralph Harrington Doane. The building was made of poured concrete with limestone on the exterior to display its warm color. Part of the plan was to include a court house, jail, garage, storeroom, hospital and residences for the governor and provincial treasures. The entire building is rectangular in plan with two to three stories in height, and set on a podium with several steps. At the center of the fa√ßade is the entrance with several doors sheltered by a canopy. The exterior has minimum wall surfaces but maximum window openings to bring in cool sea breeze. The entire structure is guarded from the sun and rain by its colonnade and projecting cornices surrounding the buildings. Inside are big rooms that had high ceilings and large windows were lined along wide corridors, giving an impression of an open pavilion. The architecture style is marked by the use of columns, entablatures and pediments. To make it an enhanced capitol building, the plan used two stories with a monumental main floor lobby and court room on the second floor. During World War II it was severely damaged and in 1949, it was reconstructed by the provincial board led by the fourteenth governor of Pangasinan Enrique Braganza; Members Vicente Soliven and Miguel de Vera; Treasurer A.F. Buenaventura and District Engineer V.B. Oledan to its pre-war grandeur. Governor Victor Agbayani, Governor Espino's predecessor, properly restored the building, hiring restoration architect Rene Luis Mata to lead the project. Espino, however, removed several historical elements of the building through misguided renovations. The building underwent a general facelift under Espino from 2007 to 2008 with the help of Architect Chris David of Pampanga, which led to the unfortunate alteration of the historical character of the interior. == Gallery == File:Pangasinan Capitol - back (Lingayen, Pangasinan)(2018-02-25).jpgBack view File:Interior of Pangasinan Capitol Building.jpgInterior File:Side view of Pangasinan Provincial Capitol.jpgSide View File:Lingayen Capitol Building.jpgStaircase File:Capitol Building eagle statue.JPGPediment == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Pangasinan Category:Provincial capitols in the Philippines Category:Government buildings completed in 1918 Category:Cultural Properties of the Philippines Category:Tourist attractions in Pangasinan ","title":"Pangasinan Provincial Capitol"},{"id":"46320578","text":"Luc Govaerts (born 25 January 1959) is a Belgian former professional racing cyclist.

It is a shrub or small tree, often growing in pure stands in poorly drained areas. Its distribution is limited and it has been classified as an endangered species under legislation in both states and the forest as critically endangered under Australian government legislation. ==Description== Melaleuca irbyana is a large shrub or small tree with thick, spongy, papery bark, growing to a height of . It has a dense, rounded canopy and fine, weeping foliage. The leaves are stalkless, but usually less than long and wide, oval or narrowly oval in shape tapering to a point and pressed against the branchlets. The flowers are white and scented and arranged in spikes at, or near the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The spikes are up to in diameter and contain 3 to 12 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing between 6 and 11 stamens. Flowers appear between September and January. The fruit are woody capsules, long, shaped like flattened spheres, arranged in loose clusters along the branches. Unlike many other melaleucas, the seeds are not retained in the capsules for more than a year. ==Taxonomy and naming== Melaleuca irbyana was first formally described in 1912 by Richard Thomas Baker in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. The author noted that \\"This Melaleuca was discovered by Mr L.G. Irby, Museum Collector when collecting on the Lawrence Road, near Casino, where it is not common, in the swamps in that locality.\\" The specific epithet (irbyana) is \\"in honour of a forester, L.G. Irby (1883‚Äì1964), who collected the type specimen\\". ==Distribution and habitat== Melaleuca irbyana is found in only a few places in New South Wales and Queensland. In New South Wales those places include Coraki, Casino and Coutts Crossing. Only two populations are recorded in conservation areas, in Warragai Creek Nature Reserve and Bungawalbin National Park. In Queensland there are populations near Ipswich, Jimboomba and Waterford West. It grow in pure stands and in open eucalypt forest in clay, sandstone or alluvial soils. ==Ecology== Melaleuca irbyana often occurs in association with eucalypt trees including E. crebra, E. melanophloia, E. moluccana or E. tereticornis. The understorey is sparse and comprises grasses, sedges and herbs with few shrubs and vines. Swamp paperbark forest provides habitat for a range of plants and animals including the nationally threatened slender milkvine plant (Marsdenia coronata). It provides shelter and nesting sites for a range of bird species and on the ground, fallen logs provide shelter for reptiles and temporary ponds provide breeding habitat for frogs and other pond life. Koalas, echidnas and wallabies also occur in this forest association. ==Conservation staus== This species is classified as \\"endangered\\" in under the New South Wales Government Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 and the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. Melaleuca irbyana forest is classified as \\"critically endangered\\" by the Australian government. ==References== irbyana Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Plants described in 1912 Category:Taxa named by Richard Thomas Baker ","title":"Melaleuca irbyana"},{"id":"46320604","text":"Marc Somers (born 28 June 1961) is a Belgian former professional racing cyclist.

The monument represents handlers, dogs, and veterinary support, from all military service branches (Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard) that have made up the Military Working Dog program since World War II. The monument grounds include a 3,000 square feet granite plaza, granite pedestals, granite history wall, granite benches and water fountain. The granite pedestals have large bronze statues of dogs and handlers. The monument was dedicated on October 28, 2013.John Burnam Memorial Foundation. Military Working Dog Teams National Monument. 2013. Bronze and marble. Lackland AFB, TX. ==Monument== The Military Working Dog Teams National Monument consists of five bronze sculptures (four dogs and dog handler) seated on a large granite pedestal inscribed, \\"Guardians of America's Freedom.\\" The center sculpture is a highly detailed 9 foot modern day Military Working Dog Handler wearing combat gear and holding a dog leash in his left hand and a M4 rifle in his right hand. The remaining sculptures are four of the more common breeds of Military Working Dogs utilized by the United States Department of Defense since World War II. They include a Doberman Pinscher, German Shepherd, Labrador Retriever, and Belgian Malinois.U.S. military dedicates first national monument to combat dogs, Reuters, October 30, 2013 Behind the main granite pedestal is a large granite wall containing inscriptions about the history of the Military Working Dog program on one side. The other side of the wall contains laser etched images of Military Working Dog Teams in action during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War and the Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Behind the granite wall are five flag poles, one for the five U.S. Armed Services which existed when the monument was built. The \\"Not Forgotten Fountain\\" is a bronze sculpture depicting a Vietnam War dog handler pouring water from his canteen into a helmet.Hero Dogs of the Military Finally Get a National Monument , Pets Advisor Buzz, November 5, 2013 The sculpture represents a Vietnam era dog handler and his working dog. A significant feature is the dog‚Äôs paw resting on the thigh of his hander accentuating their bonding relationship. The water fountain idea was conceived by Burnam and sculpted by artist Paula Slater. The water fountain is fully functional so that a visiting dog may have a drink. The granite pedestal of the \\"Not Forgotten Fountain\\" reads \\"In everlasting memory of all the war dogs who served, died, and were left behind in the Vietnam War\\". ==History== The monument was conceived by John C. Burnam, author and Vietnam veteran infantryman and German shepherd scout dog handler from 1966-1968). In February 2004, Burnam founded the John Burnam Monument Foundation to design, fund, build, and maintain a Military Working Dog Teams National Monument. Joining John Burnam were U.S. Air Force Vietnam veteran security/patrol dog handlers, Richard Deggans and Larry Chilcoat. In 2007, U.S. Representative Walter B. Jones sponsored congressional legislation within H.R. 4986 National Defense Authorizations Act for FY 2008, Section 2877 of authorizing the JBMF the exclusive rights to design, fund, build, and maintain the Military Working Dog Teams National Monument. The bill was signed into public law by the President George W. Bush on January 28, 2008. Over a span of nine years, the JBMF raised $2.1 million from corporate sponsors and public donations to fund the construction and maintenance of the national monument. Arrangements were made with the Department of Defense to accept the monument and have it installed in the southeast corner of the 37th Training Wing Basic Military Training Parade Field at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland. This site was selected by the JBMF due to its historical significance as the training center and headquarters of the Department of Defense Military Working Dog Program since 1958. ==Design== Graphic artist and designer Brian Rich, was tasked to digitally illustrate renderings that would bring their visions to life while telling the story of military working dog teams. The final design creates a visual structure that incorporates the simplicity of the subjects but also details the complexity of military working dogs and their handler's lives on the battlefield. The monument is meant to embody the history of the war dog program from World War II to present-day War on Terror theaters with meaningful purpose and accurate historical representation. It included all four U.S. Armed Services (Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force) and the US Coast Guard. The materials selected to build the national monument were granite and silicone bronze, which could stand the test of weather and time with minimum maintenance for its outdoor location. The concept and design was presented and approved by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The Keith Monument Company procured the entire horde of granite from the Rock of Ages Granite Quarry, Graniteville, Vermont. The granite components were cut to specifications, shipped to JBSA-Lackland and installed on-site. Pieces of the granite were cut-out to allow for lighting. Those pieces were gifted by the JBMF to key contributors and members of the Dedication and Unveiling Ceremony. Artist Jim Smith, Laser Imaging and Design, Inc., created the artistic impression of authentic photos of war dog teams in action scenes since World War II. Authentic photos from World War II to the War on Terror was acquired from public records at the National Archives in Washington DC. The black granite panels were seamlessly mounted on the large gray granite wall. The four large bronze dog sculptures and the 9 foot bronze military dog handler were crafted by artist and bronze sculptor Paula Slater, M.A.. which were based on the initial creative design. The bronze and granite fully functional \\"Not Forgotten Fountain\\" was conceived by John C. Burnam and sketched and sculpted by Artist, Paula B. Slater, M.A. ==Dedication and unveiling ceremony== Lieutenant General Holmes speaks at the dedication ceremony Not Forgotten Fountain The Military Working Dog Teams National Monument was unveiled during a formal dedication ceremony with full military fanfare on October 28, 2013. The event was covered by many local and national news organizations and was open to the American public. The ceremony was organized by the JBMF along with the assistance and under the direction of Lt Col Harris, 341st Training Squadron (TRS) Commander and TSgt Christopher Dion, 341st TRS Military Working Dog Handler Course Team Chief and representative to the JBMF. Speakers included its founder and author, John C. Burnam, retired USMC Handler Ron Aeillo, President US War Dogs Association, USAF Wounded Warrior and K9 Handler cast member of the movie \\"Glory Hounds\\", TSgt Leonard Anderson, and , USMC Handler and author of Sergeant Rex, SGT Mike Dowling. ==Public access== The Military Working Dog Teams National Monument is located on a secure United States Air Force Installation. However, Public Law 110-181 requires the Department of Defense to provide reasonable access to the monument by visitors and their dogs. Therefore, members of the public (and their dogs) who wish to visit the Military Working Dog Teams National Monument can access the installation to see the monument by requesting a base pass at the Lackland Air Force Base visitor control centers. The pass is limited to four hours of base access and can only be used to visit the monument.Memorandum for Record, Commander, 802d Security Forces Squadron, October 31, 2013 All those requesting access should know that they will be vetted for security purposes. ==Current== In 2014 responsibility for the care, upkeep, and promotion of the national monument was officially transferred by the John Burnam Monument Foundation to the Airmen Heritage Foundation. ==References * Airmen Heritage Foundation: Military Working Dogs Category:Dog monuments Category:Monuments and memorials in Texas Category:Buildings and structures in San Antonio Category:Military monuments and memorials in the United States Category:National Monuments in Texas ","title":"Military Working Dog Teams National Monument"},{"id":"46320716","text":"Jean-Fran√ßois Rodriguez (born 19 December 1957) is a French former professional racing cyclist.

Her involvement with criminal activity in Las Vegas, along with that of her husband Frank \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal, was chronicled in Martin Scorsese's film Casino (1995). The screenplay for Casino was written by Nicholas Pileggi and Scorsese, based on Pileggi's biography about McGee and Rosenthal titled Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas. Sharon Stone portrayed McGee in the film, with the character's name changed to \\"Ginger McKenna\\", and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. ==Personal life and career== Geraldine McGee was born in Los Angeles, the daughter of Leona \\"Alice\\" (n√©e Pollock) and Roy McGee. Her parents married in 1931 and later divorced. She had a sister, Barbara. McGee grew up near Sherman Oaks, California, and graduated from Van Nuys High School in 1954. Her aunt Naomi Ingram inherited a large amount of money upon the death of her husband O.W. Ingram, whose family owned land in Georgia. Ingram offered to send McGee to Woodbury Business School, where she had sent McGee's sister Barbara. McGee told her aunt she did not want to attend Woodbury but would rather attend a different school, and her aunt refused to pay for any other school but Woodbury. McGee instead began working in office jobs during the day, and looked for contests and modeling jobs on the side. In high school, McGee met a man named Lenny Marmor, and the two became inseparable. Marmor recognized McGee's talent, and he began entering her in swimsuit and dance contests, where she often took home prizes. After they graduated from high school, the couple had a daughter, Robin Marmor, born in 1958. Soon, Marmor convinced McGee to move to Las Vegas for more opportunities. Marmor stayed in Los Angeles, and McGee and her daughter moved to Vegas. McGee's mother Alice, now separated from Roy McGee, moved to Las Vegas to take care of Robin while McGee was working. Around 1960, McGee started working as a cocktail waitress and Tropicana chorus showgirl, and continued through the 1960s, making enough money to buy a house for herself and her family. She worked her way up the Las Vegas social ladder, meeting various businessmen. One of the men she met was Frank \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal. Her sister Barbara moved in with her after separating from her husband; Barbara had two small children and needed a place to stay. In 1969, McGee married Rosenthal and had two children with him: a son Steven, and later a daughter Stephanie. Rosenthal expected McGee to be a stay-at-home mom while he was out at the casinos working. She began to resent domestic life, and started going out at night and drinking. Rosenthal threatened to divorce McGee and take custody of the children, leaving her with little money. The marriage went through a long series of break ups and reconciliations through the 1970s. McGee's mother Alice died in 1977. There were infidelities on both sides, with McGee secretly having an affair with Anthony Spilotro, a mob enforcer in Las Vegas, and a married friend of Rosenthal. Rosenthal and McGee got in physical altercations, and Rosenthal hired private detectives to track her activities. McGee often left Las Vegas, taking trips with the children to Los Angeles, or shopping with wives of other Las Vegas businessmen. Her divorce from Rosenthal was finalized on January 16, 1981, when McGee was living in Los Angeles. After the divorce, on October 4, 1982, Frank Rosenthal escaped serious injury when a bomb was detonated. The bomb was placed under Rosenthal's car outside the Tony Roma's Restaurant at 600 East Sahara Avenue in Las Vegas. ==Death== McGee died on November 9, 1982, in Los Angeles, aged 46. She was found heavily drugged in the lobby of the Beverly Sunset Hotel on Sunset Boulevard on November 6, and died three days later. Her sister stated she believed McGee had been murdered by the mob who had tried to kill Frank Rosenthal just weeks earlier because perhaps she \\"knew too much\\" about the Las Vegas underworld. The Los Angeles coroner ruled McGee's cause of death was an accidental overdose. The coroner found a lethal combination of cocaine, valium, and whiskey in her system. She was interred at Mount Sinai Memorial Park, a Jewish cemetery. ==Casino== Nicholas Pileggi began working on the script for Casino, based on the Rosenthal family, with Martin Scorsese around 1990. Filming began in the fall of 1994, and the film was released a year later, in November 1995. Sharon Stone was cast to portray Geri McGee and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Lead Actress for her performance. The script made many changes to McGee's story. In the film, the Rosenthals only have one daughter, Amy, and in real life, McGee had three children. The script changed the couple's names from Geri McGee and Frank \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal to Ginger McKenna (played by Sharon Stone) and Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein (played by Robert De Niro), and Lenny Marmor to Lester Diamond (played by James Woods) ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * Category:1936 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Accidental deaths in California Category:Alcohol-related deaths in California Category:American female models Category:American showgirls Category:Burials at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery Category:Cocaine-related deaths in California Category:Drug-related deaths in California Category:Female models from California Category:Van Nuys High School alumni ","title":"Geri McGee"},{"id":"46320978","text":"Wang Jinbo (, born May 15, 1995) is a Chinese curler from Harbin.http://www.curling.ca/2015worldmen-en/files/2015/03/EYE-OPENER-WED- ALL.pdf He competed at the 2015 Ford World Men's Curling Championship in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, as lead for the Chinese team, which placed 8th in the tournament.

He was known as Shah Walliullah because of his piety. He memorized the Qur'an by the age of seven. Soon thereafter, he mastered Arabic and Persian letters. He was married at fourteen. By sixteen he had completed the standard curriculum of Hanafi law, theology, geometry, arithmetic and logic. His father, Shah Abdur Rahim was the founder of the Madrasah-i Rahimiyah. He was on the committee appointed by Aurangzeb for compilation of the code of law, Fatawa-e-Alamgiri. His grandfather, Sheikh Wajihuddin, was an important officer in the army of Shah Jahan. He had a son who was also a famous religious scholar, Shah Abdul Aziz. ==Death== He died on Friday the 29th of Muharram 1186 AH/ 20 August 1762 at Zuhr prayer in Old Delhi, aged 59. == Ideas == On importance of Islamic jurisprudence, he states: > \\"Some people think that there is no usefulness involved in the injunct of > Islamic law and that in actions and rewards as prescribed by God there is no > beneficial purpose. They think that the commandments of Islamic law are > similar to a master ordering his servant to lift a stone or touch a tree in > order to test his obedience and that in this there is no purpose except to > impose a test so that if the servant obeys, he is rewarded, and if he > disobeys, he is punished. This view is completely incorrect. The traditions > of the Prophet and consensus of opinion of those ages, contradict this > view\\". His dislike of Marathas is expressed in one of his dreams that he narrated in ‚ÄúFuyooz-ul Haramain‚Äù: ‚ÄúI saw myself in a dream that I am Qaem al-Zaman (master of the age). Which means that when God Almighty wanted to establish a system of goodness and benevolence, then He made me a tool and medium for the fulfillment of this noble cause. And I saw that the king of the infidels took over the land of the Muslims and looted their property. He arrested their women and children and in the city of Ajmer he declared the rites of disbelief. He eradicated the rites of Islam. Then after that I saw that the Almighty became angry and very angry with the people of the earth. And I witnessed the embodiment of the wrath of the Almighty in the heavens. And then dripping from there, divine wrath descended on me. Then I found myself angry. And this wrath which was filled in me, was blown into me by Almighty. Then I proceeded towards a city, destroying it and killing its inhabitants. other people followed me. Thus, destroying one city after another, we finally reached Ajmer. And there we killed the disbelievers. Then I saw the king of the infidels walking with the king of Islam, surrounded by a group of Muslims. In the meantime, the king of Islam ordered the king of the infidels to be slaughtered. People grabbed him and slaughtered him with knives. When I saw blood gushing out of the veins of his neck, I said: now blessing has descended‚Äù Dr. Mubarak Ali, ‚ÄúAlmiyah-e-Tarikh‚Äù, ch. 9 ‚Äì 10, pp. 95 ‚Äì 105, Fiction House, Lahore, (2012).. In one of his letters available in manuscripts collection at Rampur, he asks Muslim rulers to put a ban on Hindu and Shia rituals: > \\"Strict orders should be issued in all Islamic towns forbidding religious > ceremonies publicly practiced by Hindus such as the performance of Holi and > ritual bathing in the Ganges. On the tenth of Muharram, the Shias should not > be allowed to go beyond the bounds of moderation, neither should they be > rude nor repeat stupid things in the streets or bazars.‚ÄùS. Athar Rizvi, > ‚ÄúShah Waliullah and His Times‚Äù, p. 227, Ma‚Äôrifat Publishing House, Canberra, > (1980). He strongly advocated the segregation between Hindus and Muslims, and commitment to Arab culture. Shah Waliullah believed that: ‚ÄúMuslims, no matter where they live, wherever they spend their youthful days, they should in any case be completely separated from the natives of that country in their culture, traditions and mannerisms. And wherever they are, they must be immersed in their Arabic splendor and Arabic trends‚Äù. On adherence to Arab culture, he insists: > ‚ÄúBeware! The rich intend to adopt the ways of strangers and non-Arabs and > those who deviate from the right path, and tries to mix and be like them‚Äù . ==Works== * (The Sacred Knowledge), ed. D.

Besides these, he is also credited being the first to translate the Quran into Persian in the Indian subcontinent. Shah Walliullah worked hard to ensure that he was a role model for other Muslims. His deep understanding of the Qur'an, Hadith, Fiqah and Tasawwuf made him highly knowledgeable scholar at an early age. Since he believed that an emphasis of the Quranic teachings was made vital to Muslims, he translated Arabic Qur'an into Persian. Few Muslims spoke Arabic and so the Qur'an had not been widely studied previously. Some clerics criticised Shah Walliullah, but his work proved very popular. In addition to translating the Quran, Shah Walliullah wrote 51 books in Persian and Arabic. Amongst the most famous were Hujjat Allah al-Baligha and Izalah al Khifa. His writings bought him great fame and prestige and enabled him to have influence in other areas too. One of his most important contributions to the Muslim community was his organisation of opposition to the Maratha Empire, who had captured large parts of India which were under the control of the Mughal Empire before and had reduced the Mughal emperor to a mere puppet. It was partly his influence which helped to persuade the invader Ahmed Shah Abdali of Afghanistan to intervene. He joined forces with local Muslim leaders which resulted in the defeat the Marathas at The Battle of Panipat in 1761. He felt a debt to the Sufis for spreading Islam throughout India. He also appreciated Sufi spirituality. Waliullah built a bridge between Sufis and the Ulama (Islamic scholars).K.J. Ahmed, Hundred Great Muslims, Library of Islam, 1987. ==References== * K.J.

He was among the best biathletes during the 1980s and he is generally recognised as the greatest male Bulgarian biathlete of all time. ==Life and career== Born in the village of Stambolovo in the southwestern part of Bulgaria, Velichkov started his active sports career in sixth grade, when he joined the local cross-country skiing club. He later switched to biathlon. Velichkov participated in his first Olympics in 1980 and he debuted at the World Championship-level at the World Championships in Minsk in 1982. He also participated in the Olympics in 1984 and 1988 and the World Championships in 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1989 and 1990 for Bulgaria. His best individual finish at the Olympics came in the 20 km individual in 1984, he finished 13th. His best, and only, relay finish came in 1988, an 8th place. His best individual finish at the World Championships came in 1982 in Minsk where Velichkov finished 5th, a feat he copied three years later in Ruhpolding, both in the sprint. His best relay finish at the World Championships was a 10th which came in 1989 in Feistritz, where his best, and only, team event finish also came, a 12th place. In the World Cup, Velichkov debuted in the first round of the 1979‚Äì80 World Cup in Ruhpolding in West Germany. Over his career he finished twice on the podium. Both came in Murmansk in the last round of his debut season, a second place in the 20 km individual and a third in the 10 km sprint. These podium finishes were the first for a Bulgarian biathlete, and, as of the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season, the last by a male Bulgarian biathlete. He also finished in the top ten in multiple other races. These finishes were not matched by any other male Bulgarian biathlete but his contemporary Spas Slatev until the 2014‚Äì15 season, where Krasimir Anev finished 4th in a mass start race in Oberhof, and Vladimir Iliev finished 6th twice during the 2015 World Championships in Kontiolahti. Velichkov was a part of the relay team that finished 6th in the World Cup race in Ruhpolding in 1988, which is still the best relay finish by a male Bulgarian relay team. Velichkov's best overall finish came in the 1981‚Äì82 World Cup where he finished 9th, the best overall finish by any male Bulgarian biathlete. Velichkov retired as an athlete after the 1989‚Äì90 season. After his retirement from professional sports, Velichkov opened his own carpentry workshop. In 2014, he entered the Board of Directors of the Bulgarian Biathlon Federation. ==Biathlon results== All results are sourced from the International Biathlon Union.

He was among the first generation of the Propaganda Movement, the lobby for political and economic reforms spearheaded by educated Filipinos (ilustrados) based in Spain in the second half of the 19th century. Sancianco is considered as the \\"first Filipino economist\\". == Early education and political activities == Sancianco was born in Tonsuya, a district of Malabon Tambobong (now Malabon), to Chinese mestizo (half-native, half-Chinese) parents.Manuel, E. A. [1970] Dictionary of Philippine Biography, Quezon City, Filipiniana Publishing. He studied law at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) and was a founding member of a reformist student organization called Juventud Escolar Liberal. Two other founding members were Paciano Mercado (Jos√© Rizal‚Äôs elder brother) and Felipe Buencamino.Corpuz, O.D. [1989] Roots of the Filipino People, vol. 2, Quezon City, Aklahi Foundation. pp. 5-6 Juventud was part of the broader reform movement in the Philippines and worked under the direction of the Comite de Reformadores, which was led by clergy including Jose Burgos, Mariano Gomez, and Jacinto Zamora, and members of the Manila elite such as the lawyers Joaquin Pardo de Tavera and Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista. After the terror in the wake of the 1872 Cavite Mutiny, which ultimately led to the unjust execution of the priests Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora, Sancianco left for Spain, where he matriculated at the Universidad Central de Madrid. Sancianco completed his doctorate in civil and canonical law and was the first native of the Philippines ever to earn a doctorate. His dissertation, entitled Restituci√≥n in integrum: por qu√© causas tiene lugar. Juicio cr√≠tico de este remedio, was accepted in 1877.de Dios, E. [2013] \\"Gregorio Sancianco: an early advocate of presumptive taxation\\", History of Economic Ideas, 21(3):69-90 In 1881, while still in Spain, Sancianco published El progreso de Filipinas (The progress of the Philippines). This work, the first treatise on economic issues by a Filipino, analyzed economic conditions in the country. In the process, Sancianco debunked certain racist views, notably those revolving around the alleged ‚Äúindolence‚Äù of the natives. The work‚Äôs main purpose however was to propose specific reforms in taxation and revenue-mobilisation for the Philippines as a means of financing physical and social infrastructure. Writing almost a decade later, Jose Rizal explicitly used Sancianco‚Äôs Progreso as the starting point for his own work on the related theme of the ‚ÄúIndolence of the Filipinos‚Äù (1890). Sancianco returned to the Philippines for a short visit in 1882 and returned to the country for good in 1884. He visited San Isidro, Nueva Ecija soon after his return but was falsely implicated in the Novicio Uprising (May 1884) in nearby Pangasinan province and was jailed together with his old student-activist colleague Buencamino. Upon his release, he took up the post of justice of the peace in Nueva Ecija, but left after he came into conflict with the parish priest. He subsequently joined the Manila law firm of Rianzares Bautista. He retired to Nueva Ecija and died there on 17 November 1897. == Work == Sancianco‚Äôs reputation rests entirely on El Progreso de Filipinas (Madrid 1881). A treatise in public finance, the work is written in the liberal tradition of classical economists such as Adam Smith and Jean- Baptiste Say, as well as the Spanish writer-statesman Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, the only economist Sancianco mentions by name. In Progreso, Sancianco attributes Philippine backwardness to the failure of the Spanish colonial regime to provide even the requirements of the Smithian minimal state, namely: defence and security, the administration of justice, public works, and education. He refutes the racist charge that the ‚Äúindolence‚Äù of the natives is the cause of underdevelopment by pointing instead to the disincentives to production and investment caused by insecurity of persons and property, the absence of peace and order in the countryside, the miserable state of transport and communication, and the burdensome regulations imposed by authorities on the commerce and the movement of goods. The lack of provision of public goods is attributed in turn to the lack of revenues and the inefficient and racially biased fiscal system. Sancianco called for the abolition of the tobacco monopoly, the racially discriminatory tribute system, and all customs duties. Instead he proposed a reform of the system of internal taxes that involved the introduction of a small poll tax (cedula) applicable to all regardless of race, and a presumptive tax on urban and rural property, as well as on the practice of the professions. Sancianco was aware that a tax based on ‚Äúnet income‚Äù was a first-best solution, but his proposals were made taking full account of the pragmatic difficulty of accurately determining and assessing net incomes when taxpayers were prone to evasion and tax officials corruptible. Hence he proposed taxes based on observable characteristics, i.e., presumptive taxes.de Dios, ibid. His proposal for a presumptive tax on landed property based on area and location but regardless of actual use was particularly novel. It not only explicitly addressed the problem of tax evasion and misstatement of income but was also meant as an implicit investment incentive. Lands that were more productively cultivated and that received greater investment would be pay proportionately less tax under the scheme. Conversely, presumptive taxation would implicitly penalise idle lands and those held for speculation, stimulating their transfer and sale to more active and conscientious producers. Sancianco opposed taxation based on the type of crops cultivated, citing as a reason the unpredictability of market conditions and hence the need to allow entrepreneurs as much flexibility as possible.de Dios, ibid. Apart from his significance as an early proponent of economic reforms for the Philippines, Sancianco deserves a place in the history of economic thought as an early advocate of presumptive taxation. The Progreso was supposed to be merely the first part (hence the subtitle parte economico) of a two-part work. A second part (parte administrativo) that would have presumably dealt with expenditure was promised but never appeared. ==References== Category:1852 births Category:1897 deaths Category:Filipino lawyers Category:Filipino economists Category:People from Malabon Category:People of Spanish colonial Philippines Category:University of Santo Tomas alumni Category:Complutense University of Madrid alumni ","title":"Gregorio Sancianco"},{"id":"46321069","text":"The following lists events that happened during 1949 in Poland. ==Incumbents== Members of the government * President - Boles≈Çaw Bierut, * Prime Minister - J√≥zef Cyrankiewicz, ==Events== *The Three-Year Plan ends.

Cohen was born in Amsterdam, the oldest daughter of diamond cutter Levie Cohen, a member of the Social-Democrat Jewish community in Amsterdam. Like many other diamond workers Levie Cohen was often out of work. Therefore, the Cohen family moved to Antwerp where there was more work in the diamond business. After the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, the family returned to Amsterdam. == Design == As a child, Fr√© already showed interest in drawing, and wanted to be a cartoonist. In 1921 she found herself in the wire and cable factory Draka, for which she designed ads. Later, she got a job at a socialist publishing firm, Ontwikkeling (=\\"Development\\", tied to the Dutch Social Democratic Party, SDAP), where she did some design next to office work. Through her work for this publishing house she got access to the Social Democrat Party‚Äôs printing office, Vooruitgang (=\\"Progress\\"). As a woman designer who was also well-versed in technical things like typesetting, she was initially viewed with suspicion by her male colleagues. For most of the large number of brochures, magazines and other printed matter issued by the Socialist Party‚Äôs large Youth Organisation, AJC, Fr√© Cohen was responsible for designing the covers and the layout. Initially, as a self-educated artist, she worked in her own personal and easily recognisable style, influenced by art deco and the strong lines and basic colors of De Stijl, used more for decoration than for function, comparable with the Amsterdam School of architecture. Starting in 1924, when she was 21, Cohen started taking part- time lessons at the Quellinus Art School in Amsterdam. From 1927 to 1929, with a grant, she was able to follow lessons on a daily basis. She graduated with a Medal of Honor (the first ever in the Quellinus School's history). After completing her education, her work became more varied and had a lighter tone. From 1929 to 1932 she was employed by the Stadsdrukkerij Amsterdam, the printing firm of the City of Amsterdam. Until 1941 she stayed on as a freelance assistant and she was given the opportunity to design almost all the common printing for municipal services. She was very active and energetic and worked at a high rate. Also, she designed many bookbindings for various firms, often with an idealistic or socialistic signature, like Querido, Wereldbibliotheek and De Arbeiderspers. Her wrapper and binding designs often cover front, spine and back of the publication. Often, but not always, her signature \\"FC\\" may be found. She had a great influence on Dutch graphical design of the 1930s. Cohen had a large output of rather varied printed matter, from window bills to bookplates, diplomas, illustrations, running headers, baby announcements and postcards. There are also some three-dimensional works such as boxes and scale models. She created folders and maps for Schiphol, the airport near Amsterdam, in a modernist style using gold, red and blue. Besides, she made paintings, portraits, drawings, woodcuts and linocuts. == Last years == Under the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands that started in 1940, all Jews were in danger. Fre Cohen went into hiding in 1941 and stayed at friends' houses and remote farm houses consecutively in Amsterdam, Diemen, Rotterdam, Winterswijk and Borne. During that period she continued to work illegally, when she could. On June 12, 1943, she was arrested by the Germans in Borne. In haste, she took the pills she had hoarded for such an emergency. After two days in a coma, she died on June 14, 1943 at the age of 39 in a hospital in Hengelo. Her sister managed to survive the war and afterwards put a simple tombstone on the unmarked grave in the Jewish cemetery in Hengelo, where also her father and brother are remembered, both murdered in the war. Part of Fr√© Cohen's work was destroyed by officers of the Sicherheitsdienst, who raided the places where she worked, but much has been preserved. The Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam houses a large collection of her graphic and original works. == References == *Peter van Dam & Philip van Praag, Fr√© Cohen. Leven en werk van een bewogen kunstenares.

It has since been adopted and performed throughout the rest of the country. Dancers wear novelty horse costumes, and participate in mock fights, while a singer narrates folk tales about local bandits. It is commonly performed during wedding ceremonies to welcome and entertain the bridegroom‚Äôs party, and during other social settings. Performing the dance is also a profession for some individuals. ==Etymology== In Hindi, Kachchhi has many possible meanings, two of which are \\"diaper\\" and \\"of or belonging to the Kutch region\\", while Ghodi means mare. Together, Kachchhi Ghodi refers to the imitation horse costume worn around the waist of the dancer. ==Description== Kachchhi Ghodi includes a combined performance by dancers, singers and musicians. In Rajasthan, the dance is performed by men dressed in a kurta and a turban, along with an imitation horse costume. The shell of the costume is constructed out of papier-m√¢ch√© molded to resemble a horse supported by a bamboo frame. It is then covered with bright colored fabric elaborately designed with mirror-work embroidery known as Shisha. The dummy horse does not have legs. Instead, fabric is draped around the dancer's waist covering the entire length of his legs. Around the ankles, the dancers wear musical bells known as ghungroo, similar to those worn by Indian classical dancers. When performed as a group dance, people stand on opposite sides with swords in their hands and run back and forth quickly which, when viewed from above, resembles the opening and closing of flowers. The dancers move to the rhythm of flute music and the beats of dhol drums. Singers narrate the mock fights with stories of the exploits of Bhanwariya bandits, the Rajasthani equivalent of Robin Hood. ==Geography== A group of Poikkal kuthirai aattam (false-leg horse dance) performers from Ramavaram, Tamil Nadu. The dance originated in the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan. It is prevalent in the Kamdholi, Sarghara, Bhambi and Bhavi communities. It is also performed with the same name in other parts of India, including Maharashtra and Gujarat. In the state of Tamil Nadu, Poikkal kuthirai aattam (Tamil: ‡Æ™‡Øä‡ÆØ‡Øç‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡Øà ‡ÆÜ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡ÆÆ‡Øç, which stands for false-leg horse dance) is a folk dance similar to Kachchhi Ghodi. The differences lie in the props used. It is performed with wooden legs meant to resemble the sounds made by the hooves of a horse during the annual festivals of the Amman Temple in Thanjavur). ==See also== * Folk dance in India * Culture of Rajasthan ==Referenceshttps://wn.com/kachi_ghodi_dance/news ‚Äì A video of the dance performance. * https://web.archive.org/web/20150409190818/http://www.discoveredindia.com/rajasthan/culture- in-rajasthan/dance-in-rajasthan/ * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-bEZlX7u8A - A Dance Video from Chokhi Dhani Pune.

Often exploring complex rhythmic variations beyond the ability of a human pianist, these compositions are some of the best-known and celebrated compositions by Nancarrow, even though they are generally not considered a set of compositions, but rather individual compositions that were given the same title and status. The dates of composition are unknown, but approximate ranges have been given according to best evidence. == Composition == Nancarrow's Studies for Player Piano were started when Nancarrow himself was first experimenting with the possibilities of the player piano. Most of these studies were never given a formal premiere and, given that Nancarrow lived his life in relative isolation, his studies became better known after the 80s. Furthermore, most of his studies were arranged for many different ensembles and instruments, including two pianos, small orchestra, string quartet, xylophone, vibraphone and celesta, synthesizers and computers.  1948: Boogie-Woogie Suite  It is suspected that the Study No. 3 was Nancarrow's first composition for player piano composed between 1948 and 1949. This study was later compiled from the three initial parts into a five movement suite entitled Boogie-Woogie Suite in 1962. Its fourth movement included fragments of the second movement of Nancarrow's Suite for Orchestra, composed in 1945. It was arranged for piano, piano four- hands, chamber orchestra and small orchestra. This study was expanded and finished as Nancarrow's Piece for Ligeti, in an hommage to Gy√∂rgy Ligeti on 17 October 1988, at the Hamburgische Staatsoper. Of the two available versions of the third study, the Boogie-Woogie Suite remains the better known and more recorded one. A photocopy of the first version of the study is available at the Lincoln Center Library. The suite was first performed in Mexico City's Palacio de Bellas Artes on 30 July 1962. The suite consists of five movements featuring different music styles. The first movement features a hasty boogie- woogie in which up to seven layers of melodic and rhythmic structures are superimposed. The second movement features a blues, with a twelve-bar ostinato in the bass line which is repeated ten times. The third movement also has a blues character with canonic passages. The fourth movement features a jazz style, whereas the fifth movement comes back to an even more rushed boogie- woogie.  1949 to 1950  The first study came right after, entitled Rhythm Study No. 1 for Player Piano and finished between 1949 and 1950. It was published in New Music Edition, a quarterly of modern composition, in Los Angeles in October 1951. The study has more than two hundred tempo changes. It was premiered together with Studies Nos. 1 and 2, in Mexico City's Palacio de Bellas Artes on 30 July 1962. Front page of the Study No. 1. The word rhythm was dropped in the rest of the studies. Nancarrow's Study No. 2 was composed circa 1950 and premiered together with Nos. 1 and 2. It is a slow blues with two melodic bass parts in tempo ratio of 3:5. However, Nancarrow also composed three additional version of the same study, entitled by himself Didactical Study No. 2x, Didactical Study No. 2y and Didactical Study No. 2z. These versions are also known as 2b, 2c and 2d, respectively, 2a being the main study. This way, 2x (2b) has a tempo ratio of 5:9, 2y (2c) has a tempo ratio of 4:7 and 2z (2d) has a tempo ratio of 5:7. Some publishers and record companies use the title Study No. 2a in order to differentiate it from Nancarrow's Study No. 2A (sometimes also erroneously entitled Study No. 2b, as it would lead to confusion), an extended version of the fourth movement of his 1945 Suite for Orchestra. This extended version arranged for player piano was also composed in 1950 and was later included in the set decades later as an afterthought.  1951 to 1960  Between 1951 and 1965, Nancarrow wrote the studies nos. 4 to 30. Some of these compositions have been dated according to evidence, but Nancarrow never left a date in any of his originals. In these studies, Nancarrow explored the possibilities of polyrhythm, prolation canons and the usage of irrational numbers, such as the square root of two. However, he still used different musical styles, including jazz or blues. The Study No. 4 is a study with jazzy melody lines which features canonlike elements. However, it is not a strict canon, as the rhythmic patterns are not followed. It was premiered in a performance at Ann Arbor, Michigan, at the ONCE Festival of New Music, on 18 February 1962. It was arranged for the ballet Crises, by Merce Cunningham and John Cage, and again for piano four-hands. The Study No. 5 was premiered in the same festival as the Study No. 4. It is a study of repeated and rapid runs and chordal motifs, superimposed over two ostinato rhythmic and melodic lines in the bass at tempos 5:7. It starts with only two voices but ends up with thirteen. It was also arranged for Crises and, later on, for chamber orchestra. The Study No. 6 has a rather bluesy style, with a tune on top of a quasi-ostinato bass line, which tempo ratios of 4:5:6, shifting back and forth every four notes along the whole movement. It was first performed in Kassel, in Summer 1982, and has since been arranged for a Marantz computer-piano, chamber orchestra, piano four-hands, two pianos and small orchestra. Amongst the arrangers is British composer Thomas Ad√®s. Of all of Nancarrow's early compositions for player piano, Study No. 7 is probably one of the longest. It takes 6 minutes to perform. According to American music scholar Kyle Gann, it is one of the few studies approaching the sonata form. One of the most complex early compositions, the study features striking rhythmic pattern together with melodic lines. The eight-part composition ends with racing arpeggios. It was originally presented with a longer beginning and a shorter ending. It was first performed together with the first three studies in Mexico City, on 30 July 1962 and has been arranged for a Marantz computer- piano, chamber orchestra, piano four-hands, two pianos and two disc-pianos. The Study No. 8 is probably one of the most important early studies, because it features some of the most representative traits of Nancarrow's music: canons and continual tempo changes. These techniques were further developed along his musical career. The study is in three parts and is considered the first acceleration study. It was also the first time Nancarrow used bar lines and conventional notation. The first performance of the work was the one in 1962 in Mexico City. The following studies would continue to explore varied meters and tempos. Among them, the Study No. 9, which can be described as a collage with three repeating loops at different tempos. As his previous studies, the bass line is in ostinato and the ratios used in the study are 3:4:5. It was also premiered in the performance of the studies 7 and 8, in Mexico City and was arranged for chamber orchestra, piano four-hands and two pianos. The last study to feature jazz characteristics is Study No. 10. It has a blues melody and complex rhythmic patterns, given the continually changing time signature. The first version of this study was in ABA form. However, in Nancarrow's circa-1980 revision of the study, the first section was dropped. This later revision is now considered authoritative. The Study No. 11 is an isorhythmic study which uses a technique from the 14th century motets. It uses conventional notation and features a sequence of repeating 120 chords. There are up to thirty tempo changes in the first page alone. The Study No. 12 is the first one to receive an unofficial subtitle: the flamenco study, because of its influence by Spanish flamenco. The study imitates the guitar arpeggios used in flamenco music. This study was arranged for chamber orchestra in 1995. These three studies were first performed at the Mexico City event in which most of his other studies to date were performed.  Seven Canonic Pieces  The studies 13 to 19 constitute a cycle of canons composed before 1960 entitled Siete piezas can√≥nicas (). The whole cycle of canons was first performed in the Mexico City's Palacio de Bellas Artes, on 30 July 1962. All of these canons have at least one characteristic in common: the prolation of the different parts. The Study No. 13 is the preliminary study for the whole set. Nancarrow became displeased with the result and decided to withdraw it and to never publish it. However, he made it available as a recording. The rest of the canons were published, starting with Study No. 14 which is a canon 4/5, in which the first part begins at a tempo of ‚ô© = 88, followed shortly thereafter by the second part, two octaves and a fifth higher at tempo ‚ô© = 110. The Study No. 15 is a canon 3/4, in which the two parts are three octaves apart and the faster meter alternates in a way that both parts begin and end simultaneously. The Study No. 16 explores deeper into the concept of two-part prolation canons. It is a sketch of a canon 3/5. There are two sections, the second 5/3 as fast as the first, and then the two are played simultaneously as a third section. The Study No. 17 is a three-part canon with ratios 12/15/20. The Study No. 18 is, again, a two-part canon with ratios 3/4. The second voice begins when the first has gone 1/3 of its way, but it is played 1/3 faster, so it catches up and finishes together with the first part. It is largely seen as a precursor of Study No. 40b. Finally, the Study No. 19 has the same tempo ratios than Study No. 17. It is a three-part canon with ratios 12/15/20, and its second and third part entries are set in a way that all three parts end up simultaneously.  1961 to 1965  Chronologically, the next composition to be finished was the Study No. 21, the canon X. It is an acceleration study where one voice progressively slows down while the other speeds up. The study starts with a bass line playing a 12-tone row at about 4 notes per second, immediately followed by the other voice, playing thirty-nine notes per second. Then the bass line starts to speed up and the treble line slows down progressively, reaching the same tempo halfway through the piece. The piece ends up with one of the lines playing 120 notes per second. It was presumably written in 1961 and was first performed in the Mexico City performance in 1962. The X alludes to the tempo acceleration and deceleration of both parts in the canon. It was also arranged for synthesizer, Marantz computer-piano, two disc-pianos and two voices. Following, Study No. 22, a canon with ratios of 1%/1¬Ω%/2¬º%; this means that the lowest voice starts at a given tempo and accelerates 1% over time, the second voice does so at 1¬Ω% and the third voice at 2¬º%. The three voices accelerate until the middle of the piece, where they decelerate at the same rate and get to the end of the piece at the same initial speeds. This canon was first performed in Kassel, Germany, in Summer 1982. The Study No. 23 is a two-part composition which turns three-part halfway in the study. As in Study No. 21, Nancarrow also experimented with constant acceleration and deceleration changes. The treble accelerated part is considered to be \\"unplayable\\". The study was also first performed in Kassel in 1982. The Study No. 24 is a three-part canon 14/15/16 which, unlike other pieces by Nancarrow, is predominantly tonal. It features rapid repetitions, chains of trills and glissandi. It has been called a \\"masterpiece\\" by American scholar Kyle Gann. It was first performed on 30 May 1964, in Ojai, California. Study No. 25 is one of Nancarrow's most elaborate studies. It features many \\"idiomatic\\" traits of the player piano: glissandos, arpeggios, lightning-fast zagged patterns and rapid sequences. Its ending is a 12-second section in which 1028 notes are player with the sustain pedal held down, sometimes even getting to two hundred notes per second. However, even though it has canonic elements, it is mostly a rhapsodic piece. It was premiered at the Pro Musica Nova festival in Bremen, on 15 May 1976. The Study No. 26 is actually the only study where all voices have no rhythmic differentiation. The canon is 1/1, which means that all the notes have the same tempo. It starts with one voice and ends up with seven. The study has been arranged for 7 hands on two to four pianos, piano four-hands, small orchestra and chamber ensemble. It was first performed at the Kassel event in 1982. In the Study No. 27, Nancarrow came back to the acceleration canons. This study is a canon 5%/6%/8%/11%/, and consists of an ostinato bass line at a constant speed, with up to eight voices accelerating and decelerating at different speeds. Nancarrow himself saw the study as \\"the ticking of an ontological clock (world clock) with events running along beside it at different speeds\\". This study was premiered at the Pro Musica Nova festival in Bremen, on 15 May 1976, just like Study No. 25. The Study No. 28 is another one of those complex pieces by Nancarrow. It is one of the few pieces which have actual rules and correlations between tempo and pitch. To serve as a guide for listeners, Nancarrow also added chords at regular intervals to provide a temporal orientation. It was first performed in the National Autonomous University of Mexico, in Mexico City, on 23 October 1990. The Study No. 29 is the first piece in which Nancarrow tried to work on a prepared piano, in the style of John Cage. However, Nancarrow dismissed the idea of putting preparations in a piano for this study. It has up to eight parts and resembles the ticking of clocks at different speeds. The study is in ABABABABABABAB form with different acceleration ratios interacting with each other. Nancarrow never liked the piece and was initially willing to withdraw it. He commented: \\"I should have thrown it away a long time ago, but I never had the heart.\\" The study was first performed in K√∂ln, on 15 October 1988. Finally, the Study No. 20 was among the last studies from this period to be composed. With this study, Nancarrow started to use characteristics in notation other than the traditional ones. Sometimes unofficially subtitled Cloud, it features a style that is very closely related to that of Iannis Xenakis and Gy√∂rgy Ligeti. This study is a study on note durations, with eight voices being very close together. It was presumably composed around 1965, and is strikingly similar to Ligeti's Monument for two pianos, written in 1976. This study was first performed in Aptos, California, on 27 August 1977 and has been arranged for two pianos and for piano four-hands. The last study from 1965 is Study No. 30, which was rejected by the composer for him having problems with the preparations, because the preparations did not stay with the strings of an upright piano. After this study, Nancarrow decided to go back to the unprepared piano. Nancarrow recorded the piece, but never published the score and discarded it, for he was not pleased with the result. This study was first performed in public in the same even as Study No. 28, in the National Autonomous University of Mexico, in Mexico City, on 23 October 1990.  1966 to 1969  The Study No. 31 is a canon 21/24/25. It has three differentiated parts, called \\"movements\\" by Kyle Gann, which follow a sequence of \\"fast-slow- fast\\". However, these movements are not marked in any way in the original score. This study was arranged for string quartet in 2003. The Study No. 32 is a canon 5/6/7/8, in which all the different voices are not assigned a particular speed for the whole movement, but rather each voice is played at different speeds. This study was arranged for piano four-hands and chamber ensemble. From Study No. 33 on, Nancarrow became more and more fascinated by irrational tempos. This is a canon /2, which means that the different layers have no common denominator. As in the previous study, the different speeds are alternated between the parts of the composition. Considered one of the most important studies by Nancarrow himself, this study was completed circa 1968 and was arranged for string quartet in 2003. All of these three studies were given a first performance at the Kassel event, in Summer 1982. Nancarrow's tempo ratios compared to 12-tet frequency ratios The longest and most important study by Nancarrow, Study No. 37 was initially conceived in 1965 and was finished in 1969. It takes up to 10 minutes to perform. It is a complex canon 150/160/168/180/187/200/210/225/240/250/262/281, that is, a twelve-part canon. These twelve different speeds correspond to the ratios of the vibrations in the notes of a 7-limit just chromatic scale. It was first performed in Graz on 31 October 1982 and has since been arranged at least four times: for twelve synthesizers, for computer, xylophone and vibraphone, for computer and xylophone installation and for 12 spatially distributed stereo channels. The other three studies were begun between 1966 and 1969, but were completed between 1969 and 1976. The Study No. 34, which was completed circa 1969, is a canon \\\\tfrac{9}{4/5/6}/\\\\tfrac{10}{4/5/6}/\\\\tfrac{11}{4/5/6}. This means that it is a 9/10/11; however, each part is also subdivided into 4/5/6. It was premiered in Mexico City on 23 October 1990 and was arranged for string trio in 2004. The Study No. 36 is a canon 17/18/19/20 in which all of its four voices have exactly the same score with different fixed speeds: its first voice plays at tempo 85, its second at 90, its third at 95 and its fourth at 100. The four parts meet in the middle of the composition. Therefore, the fourth voice ends first, then the third, then the second and, finally, the first. It was finished in 1970. Finally, the Study No. 35 is a comeback by Nancarrow to a rather jazzy style. It was finished between 1975 and 1978, even though it was performed before it was finished. These two studies were first performed in the Bremen event, on 15 May 1976.  1970 to 1982  Front page of the Study No. 41. Here, Nancarrow gives broad indications regarding how 41c must be played. From here, Nancarrow started to work on other creative ways to develop his compositions. The Study No. 40 is a study for two player pianos. It is divided into two parts: 40a and 40b. The study a is a canon e/œÄ for only one player piano, which makes a profuse use of glissandi. The study b, however, is a canon \\\\tfrac{^e/_\\\\pi}{^e/_\\\\pi}, for two synchronized player pianos. This means that the two pianos play the same score, but the second piano starts approximately 20 seconds away from the first, but a bit faster, in a way that both pianos end up simultaneously. It has been unofficially subtitled Transcendental. It was completed in 1975 and was first performed in the Pro Musica Nova event, in 1976. The Study No. 41, again for two player pianos, is divided into three parts: 41a, 41b and 41c. The first canon is \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt\\\\pi}/\\\\sqrt{^2/_3} for the first piano, the second canon is \\\\tfrac{1}{3\\\\sqrt\\\\pi}/\\\\sqrt[3]{^{13}/_{16}} for the second piano, and the third is \\\\tfrac{\\\\tfrac{1}{3\\\\sqrt\\\\pi}/\\\\sqrt[3]{^{13}/_{16}}}{\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt\\\\pi}/\\\\sqrt{^{2}/_{3}}} for both pianos, in the proportions marked in the first page of the score. A complete version of the piece was first performed at Kassel in Summer 1982. From now on, Nancarrow started to fulfill commissions. This is the case of the Study No. 42, commissioned by Betty Freeman. It is a study with ten different tempos, in which 12/8/9/10/7 predominate. It was first performed in Los Angeles, on 2 November 1981. The Study No. 43, which was initially entitled Study No. 38, was commissioned by Sterischer Herbst, for the ISCM World Music Days in Graz, on 31 October 1982, where it was indeed first performed. The study is a simple two-part canon 24/25 and was completed in 1975. The Study No. 44 was again commissioned by Betty Freeman. It is unofficially subtitled Aleatoric Canon or Aleatoric Round, given that it is a composition for two player pianos, but the voices in the canon can be player at any tempo relationship. It was completed in 1981 and first premiered on 6 December 1982, in Los Angeles.  Betty Freeman Suite (or Second Boogie-Woogie Suite)  The last commission from Betty Freeman was the Study No. 45, sometimes also called Betty Freeman Suite or, unofficially, the Second Boogie-Woogie Suite, in allusion to the Study No. 3. It was initially thought to be a five-movement suite, which would take up to 20 minutes to perform. However, Nancarrow thought it was too long and decided to discard three of the five movements and write another one. The final composition is a three-movement composition: 45a, 45b and 45c. All of them were composed between 1982 and 1983, and were first premiered on 30 January 1984, in Los Angeles, even though the shortened version was finished in 1986. The first movement is a boogie-woogie which what Nancarrow called a \\"spastic rhythm\\". The second movement is a complicated canon of 3/4/5/7 with bluesy styles. In the third movement, Nancarrow uses a technique first known to have been used by Henry Cowell, in which the piano makes a very fast glissando only sustaining a few notes of a chord. Two of the other three discarded parts were finished and assigned the numbers 46 and 47. An abandoned part of the study, later entitled 45d or Discard, is now under the protection of the Paul Sacher Stiftung.  1983 to 1992  The Study No. 46 is the first part of the discarded version of the Betty Freeman Suite. It is a complex study with tempo ratios 3/4/6, finished between 1984 and 1987. It was first performed in Boulogne-Billancourt, on 21 October 1991. The Study No. 47 is, in turn, a Canon 5/7 and the discarded finale from the Betty Freeman Suite, which was first performed as an individual study on 14 June 1997. The Study No. 48 is actually the Study No. 39, only it was given a new title to fulfill a commission by the European Broadcasting Union. It is a complex canon 60/61 for two player pianos, divided into three sections, one for each piano and the final one for the two of them playing simultaneously. The final two- piano version was finished between 1975 and 1977 and was premiered on 17 October 1997, in Donaueschingen. The Study No. 49 was first conceived as a three-movement suite composed by Nancarrow for the application for the Grawemeyer Grant. It was composed in 1987. The tempo ratios for the three movements of this composition (49a, 49b and 49c) are relatively simple, which is why Nancarrow first planned to arrange it into a Concerto for Pianola and Orchestra planned for Rex Lawson, but he never realized it. The whole suite as a jazz influence, and the structure falls into the scheme of \\"fast-slow-fast\\". The three canons in the suite are 4/5/6. Finally, the Study No. 50 is a canon 5/7 which introduces a third voice later into the piece. It is a transcription for player piano of the second movement of the Piece for Small Orchestra No. 2, completed between 1987 and 1988. The final study was jokingly entitled Study No. 3750 by Nancarrow, but is now known as the Study No. 51. It is a pseudo-canon with tempos 12/16/20, punctured by Carlos Sandoval.  Other related compositions  Nancarrow also created other similar compositions for player piano, including Para Yoko (), a pseudo-canon 4/5/6 dedicated to his wife, For Ligeti, dedicated to Gy√∂rgy Ligeti on his 65th birthday, and Contraption No. 1, a composition for Trimpin's IPP, \\"Instant Prepared Piano\\". Among Nancarrow's papers, up to five abandoned studies were found, all being reductions of other works for ensemble or orchestra. == Structure == The whole list of studies were not numbered in chronological order. All the studies were initially titled Rhythm Study. However, after Study No. 35, Nancarrow decided to drop the word \\"Rhythm\\" in the titles. Nevertheless, the first study was published with the original title. Studies 38 and 39 were later numbered as 43 and 48 in order to fulfill commissions.

It takes big breaths and proceeds in long phrases. It is full of 'parody quotes' ‚Äî that is, things that you can easily trace to another composer but not note-for- note.\\" Schwartz nevertheless opined, \\"...the symphony doesn't really grab me, although I can certainly see why so many admire it.

Tsatsarov allegedly owes his appointment to Delyan Peevski, a media mogul and member of Bulgaria's Parliament, and Prime Minister Boyko Borisov. His time in office has been overshadowed by controversial investigations of political opposition leaders, famous businessmen, and independent media. Prominent Bulgarian jurists, including the heads of Bulgaria's main appellate courts, have asked for his resignation. == Biography == Tsatsarov graduated from a language high school in his hometown of Plovdiv and was subsequently enrolled as a student at the juridical faculty of Sofia University. On 20 December 2012, he was elected as the chief prosecutor of Bulgaria, with 18 \\"yes\\" votes, 3 in opposition and 3 abstaining. == Role in Corporate Commercial Bank corporate raid ==  Background  Corporate Commercial Bank (Bulgarian: –ö–æ—Ä–ø–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∞ —Ç—ä—Ä–≥–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞ –±–∞–Ω–∫–∞ –ê–î), commonly called Corpbank, was a Bulgarian bank. The bank's majority shareholder was Bulgarian businessman Tzvetan Vassilev.  Accusations against Vassilev  According to The Economist, at another point in time Tsatsarov ordered Bulgaria's national revenue agency to run at a tax audit on Vassilev, after a local activist group called \\"Protest Network\\" sent an alert to the Prosecutor General's office, making allegations about a connection between Vassilev, Peevski, and a Bulgarian newcomer politician named Barekov. In response to the ‚Äúalert‚Äù, Tsatsarov ordered a magistrate to investigate all three. The audit of Vassilev's taxes covered ten years of history and was completed in 2012. Peevski and Barekov were both ‚Äúcleared‚Äù. Another tax audit was initiated in 2014, following the attack on the bank and embezzlement charges. It has yet to be completed.  Bank investigation follow-up  In September 2014, Tsatsarov gave an interview with the media saying, ‚ÄúThe financial demise of the bank is no solution for the people who deposited their money there.‚Äù According to the Sofia Globe, \\"He went on to suggest that the existing legal provisions that guarantee deposits of up to 196 000 leva, or 100 000 euro, should be ‚Äòoverleapt‚Äô and the bank should be bailed out in full.\\" == Kostinbrod illegal ballot case == In May 2013, approximately 350,000 fake, or illegal ballot papers, were found by the State Agency for National Security (DANS) in a raid ordered by Tsatsarov in the town of Kostinbrod. The extra ballots were found the day before parliamentary election in Bulgaria, and the Multiprint printing house facility where the ballots were discovered was coincidentally owned by the Municipal Councilor of the GERB party, Yordan Bonchev. The scandal was believed to have influenced the results of the 2013 elections by allowing GERB party leader Boyko Borisov to manipulate the vote. Balkan Insight reported that ‚Äúthe case polarized public opinion, raising serious concerns about whether the election was fair.‚Äù Two years later, the court rejected all of the prosecutor's charges in the case. Balkan Insight declared that the Kostinbrod scandal was \\"the investigation that has raised most concerns about Tsatsarov‚Äôs independence.\\" The same article stated that \\"Bulgaria‚Äôs state prosecution has been involved in numerous controversial investigations, which have casted doubts that under the control of Sotir Tsatsarov, it is being used to serve political interests.\\" == Investigation into Hristo Biserov == Tsatsarov was involved in a November 2013 case in which Hristo Biserov, Deputy Parliament Speaker and senior leader of the Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms party (DPS), was accused of money laundering, tax crimes and document fraud. Biserov was forced to step down because of the charges and a two-year investigation was launched. Prosecutors subsequently demanded a four-year jail term. After Biserov's resignation, new protests broke out. In April 2015, Chief Prosecutor Tsatsarov announced that Biserov would be indicted before the Orthodox Easter holidays, and he was a few days later. Two years after the start of the ordeal, a Sofia City Court officially cleared Biserov in December 2015 after failing to find evidence to support any of the allegations, Reuters stated. == Bogomil Manchev accusations == Bogomil Manchev was the CEO and main shareholder of Risk Engineering, characterized by the Sofia Globe as \\"one of the most powerful figures in the energy industry in Bulgaria\\" when DANS and the Interior Ministry conducted a raid of the company due to \\"suspected fraud in the energy sector.\\" Tsatsarov had mandated the investigation in a campaign to expose \\"the energy mafia.\\" Immediately after learning news of the investigation, Manchev was amenable and agreed to cooperate with the investigation, However, he maintained the raid of his offices was a \\"farce\\" and was firm in his convictions that his business and \\"every penny he earned from it were legal.\\" In October 2015 ‚Äì similarly to the Biserov case ‚Äì the investigation ended in failure for the prosecution due to the lack of evidence against Manchev. == Accusation against Grisha Ganchev == Prominent businessman and entrepreneur, Grisha Ganchev, was indicted in December 2014, following a 2012 arrest, on charges of tax evasion, partaking in an ‚Äúorganized criminal gang‚Äù and for ‚Äúthreatening murder‚Äù of former head of the National Revenue Agency, Krasimir Stefanov. Stefanov told journalists that he had not been threatened at any point by Ganchev and would be unwilling to participate in the trial, as reported by Novinite. The Specialized Prosecutor's Office, under Tsatsarov, submitted a second indictment in May 2015 against Ganchev, along with nine others, for tax fraud, alleging that Ganchev ‚Äúmasterminded‚Äù the group. Ganchev was an entrepreneur and owner of many businesses in Bulgaria, including oil distributor Petrol AD and petro company Litex Commerce ASD. He was also a member of Bulgaria's Olympic Committee and of the Bulgarian Football Union. Through his business ventures, Ganchev was credited with providing employment for thousands of Bulgarians \\"in one of the country‚Äôs areas that were hit the worst by changing economic realities\\" during the country's transition away from communism in the 1990s. == Other scandals ==  Raid of the Fund for the Treatment of Children Abroad  In May 2016, Bulgaria's prosecution arrested five officials from the Fund for the Treatment of Children Abroad for corruption and allegedly participating in an organized crime group. Anti-Corruption Digest speculated that political motives underpinned the arrest, as Vladimir Pilosov was appointed new director of the organization in mere hours following the raid, which took place \\"minutes before the regular session of the council of the fund [‚Ä¶] was due to decide on the treatment of 70 ill children abroad.\\" Pilosov had just met with Borisov prior to his appointment as head of the Fund. Previous head, Pavel Aleksandrov, who was arrested in the raid, had been described by Krassimira Velichkova, director of the Bulgaria Charity Forum, as \\"the only director under whose management this fund has been working.\\" Balkan Insight characterized the investigation as ‚Äúthe most recent controversial case‚Äù and set the record straight that ‚Äúlater the prosecution rescinded some of its serious allegations against the fund‚Äôs officials,‚Äù but the Fund's reputation was already tainted.  Bulgaria Holding case  In the summer of 2012, Tsatsarov and the Prosecutor's office charged Ognyan Donev and Lyubomir Pavlolv of the Media Group Bulgaria Holding ‚Äì which publishes Trud and 24 Chasa ‚Äì with money laundering. The scandal ultimately resulted in the sale of Trud and 24 Chasa \\"to new owners\\" by the end of 2012. The identities of the new owners were not disclosed, according to independent watchdog organization, Freedom House.  Protests and Donchev controversy  Bulgarian citizens organized protests in Sofia, Plovdiv, and Varna to demand the resignation of Tsatsarov. One of the protest organizers said, ‚ÄúThe credit of trust in the Prosecutor General has been exhausted. The reasons for his remaining in his post are [purely] political.‚Äù A new controversy emerged when Sasho Donchev‚Äîowner of Overgaz (a Bulgarian gas company), the newspaper Sega, and head of the Bulgarian Chamber of Industry‚Äîwas filmed complaining of ‚Äúthe alleged pressure applied to him by Tsatsarov.‚Äù According to Balkan Insight, ‚ÄúHe claimed Tsatsarov had told him that his behaviour had become ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù, allegedly referring to his ownership of the traditionally critically minded daily paper and alleged links to a newly formed anti- corruption party ‚ÄúYes, Bulgaria‚Äù.‚Äù Tsatsarov denied Donchev‚Äôs claims and accused Donchev of ‚Äútrying to influence a probe by the state energy regulator into the gas and petrol trade.‚Äù Boyko Borisov, the former Prime Minister of Bulgaria and likely next Prime Minister, ‚Äúexonerated Tsatsarov‚Äôs role . . . saying that the prosecutor had likely fallen into a trap set by ‚Äúred oligarchs‚Äù.‚Äù In Bulgaria public opinion polls, distrust in the prosecutor's office is at 94 percent.  Cigarette smuggling controversy  In November 2017, Turkish state authorities sent a report to Interpol about cigarette smuggling by the Bulgarian company Bulgartabac. It appears the proceeds are used to finance terrorism. Although Bulgartabac's ownership was restructured several times, Bulgarian journalists claim its beneficial owner is controversial media mogul Delyan Peevski. It has been suggested that Tsatsarov has purposefully avoided investigating Bulgartabac's smuggling due to his good relations with Peevski. == References  Category:Bulgarian jurists Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:People from Plovdiv Category:Sofia University alumni Category:General Prosecutors of Bulgaria ","title":"Sotir Tsatsarov"},{"id":"46321709","text":"Zhu Xuzhi (; 1912-8 November 2000) was a general in the People's Liberation Army of China. ==Biography== Zhu was born Zhu Wenlin () in Linhai, Zhejiang in 1912, son of Zhu Zhikang ().

George Wickham is introduced as a militia officer who has a shared history with Mr. Darcy. Wickham's charming demeanour and his story of being badly treated by Darcy attracts the sympathy of the heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, to the point that she is warned by her aunt not to fall in love and marry him. It is revealed through the course of the story that George Wickham's true nature is that of a manipulative unprincipled layabout, a ne'er-do-well wastrel, compulsive liar (talking out of both sides of mouth, and using the truth to make his falsehoods very believable) and a degenerate, compulsive gambler, a seducer and a libertine, living the lifestyle of a rake. Lacking the finances to pay for his lifestyle, he gambles regularly (not just because he is a degenerate compulsive gambler and has no sense of economy) and cons credit from tradesmen and shopkeepers and skips out on paying-up. Jane Austen's inspiration for the plot developed around the character of George Wickham was Tom Jones, a novel by Henry Fielding, where two boys ‚Äì one rich, one poor ‚Äì grow up together and have a confrontational relationship when they are adults. A minor character, barely sketched out by the narrator to encourage the reader to share Elizabeth's first impression of him, he nonetheless plays a crucial role in the unfolding of the plot, as the actantial scheme opponent, and as a foil to Darcy. == Genesis of the character == Original title page of Tom Jones. Henry Fielding's Tom Jones influenced the development of Wickham's character. He has traits of the main protagonists of The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling: the hero, Tom Jones, and his half- brother, Blifil.Margaret Anne Doody, \\"Reading\\", The Jane Austen companion, Macmillan, 1986 , There is a deliberate resemblance between the confrontational relationship between the two characters in Fielding's novel and in the one created by Jane Austen between Wickham and Darcy. Finally, the Pemberley estate, under the authority of Mr. Darcy, Senior, recalls the property of the wise Squire Allworthy of Paradise Hall. At the beginning of her novel, Jane Austen gives Wickham the appearance of a hero by his good looks and distinguished manners: he is reminiscent of Tom Jones, the foundling, unfairly banned from the squire's estate by the severe and pretentious Blifil, son of Bridget, the squire's sister. Master Blifil and the bastard Tom grew up in the same estate, and have received the same education and the same affection from the squire. Blifil is rather strict and reserved; Tom, a jolly lad who pleases the ladies (both young and old), generous but impulsive and not strictly honourable, is too easily moved by a pretty face and has a tendency to put himself in difficult or scabrous situations. But while Tom Jones, who has an upright soul, overcomes his misfortunes and shows nobility of character, Wickham does not correct himself because he hides a corrupt soul under his beautiful appearance. Like the treacherous Blifil, Wickham is permanently banned from the \\"paradise\\" of his childhood. It is also possible that Jane Austen was influenced, for the relationship between Wickham and Darcy, by Proteus and Valentine, The Two Gentlemen of Verona, created by Shakespeare; at least, that is the opinion of Laurie Kaplan, who recalls how subtly Jane Austen borrows from the Shakespearean comedy. Proteus, though a son of a gentleman, is intoxicated by the facilities and the luxury of the Court of Milan, where he has been sent by his father, and behaves very badly towards his childhood friend, Valentine, betraying and slandering him, causing his exile, while Valentine never stops, even in adversity, behaving nobly. Another parallel of Wickham and Darcy's younger days is with the Biblical figures Jacob and Esau. Another inspiration is Joseph Surface from The School for Scandal, who, like Wickham, \\"seems to be charming and upright but in fact is a thorough going villain\\". Henry Austen is regarded as an obvious inspiration for the character of George Wickham by Claire Tomalin, who cites Henry and Wickham's inability to settle on a career or a bride, and as Wickham, like Henry, \\"shows himself to be more agreeable than reliable\\". == Plot ==  First impressions  Mr Wickham was more personable than the other officers. (C. E. Brock, 1895) Once he appears at Meryton, Wickham is noticed, especially by the Bennet sisters: his youth, his manly beauty, his distinguished look and bearing speak immediately in favour of this handsome stranger seen in the street. He has all the appearance of the ideal romantic hero.Lydia Martin 2007, p. 70 The uniform, the red coat of Colonel Forster's militia, adds to his prestige among the women. Once he is introduced by Lieutenant Denny, the friend he accompanied, he displays friendly manners and \\"a happy readiness of conversation ‚Äì a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming\\". Susan Morgan notes that in contrast to Austen's introductions of other characters, Wickham's introduction \\"tells us nothing of Mr. Wickham's qualities or nature, but only of his looks and manners\\". Elizabeth Bennet, in particular, is \\"delighted\\": she finds him well above the captains of the militia in elegance and manners. That is why, when her aunt, Mrs Philips, invited some officers and her nieces to her home the following evening, she is flattered to be \\"the happy woman\\" with whom Wickham spends most of the first evening. He seems to her much more worthy of interest when he appears to be an innocent victim of the cruelty and jealousy of Mr. Darcy, whom she finds so unpleasant. As the narrator reveals nothing of the new officer's past, he is seen exclusively through the positive image that Elizabeth and other characters form of Wickham ‚Äì in particular Mrs. Gardiner, her aunt. A native of Derbyshire, where she had lived \\"ten or twelve years before her marriage\\", he gave her the opportunity to evoke pleasant memories of youth, so she was inclined towards him. And if she puts Elizabeth on guard when she sees the interest her niece has in him, it is not that she does not trust him, but, as he has no money, it would be very \\"imprudent\\" on the part of her niece to fall in love and marry him. According to David Shapard, the only reason why Wickham and Elizabeth do not seriously consider marriage is that they are both without funds. The Bennets, who were offended by the snobbery of Darcy and of Bingley's sisters, welcome him and listen to the story of his grievances with sympathy and without mistrust. Mr. Bennet himself has a certain weakness for him. Jennifer Preston Wilson asserts that Wickham relies upon making a very good first impression and carefully reading his audience to find out their sympathies. Mr Denny asks for permission to introduce his friend, Mr Wickham. (C. E. Brock, 1895.)  An \\"interesting\\" young man  The first appearance of Wickham in Meryton is when Darcy and Elizabeth meet again after Elizabeth and Jane's stay in Netherfield, when the latter was sick. The scene takes place in the street where the Bennet ladies, accompanied by the ridiculous and pompous Mr. Collins, come to make the acquaintance of Wickham, when they are joined by Darcy and Bingley who are just crossing the city on horseback. Only Elizabeth, burning to know the explanation, notices the brief exchange between Wickham and Darcy: one turned red, the other pale. As all the focus is on Elizabeth noticing this exchange between the men, Burns suggests that we are not told that Wickham is observing Darcy and Elizabeth as well. Wickham profits from the sympathy enjoyed in the city by Colonel Forster and his regiment choosing Meryton as its winter quarters. It is one of the local militias raised to reinforce the army against the threat of French invasion. The presence of officers, generally young people from good families, disrupts the routine of local social life: they participate in community life, inviting gentlemen to the mess, and being invited themselves to balls, evening socials, and receptions. As some came with their spouses, teas and visits between women increased the occasions for marriageable young ladies to meet these dashing idle officers in red coats. England was at war, the population feared an invasion, the army was recruiting and the prestige of the regimental uniform was therefore total.Deirdre Le Faye 2002, p. 153 It was possible for a new militia officer to make a fresh start in life, as Wickham's rank could be obtained without having to live in the local area. In addition, according to the Cambridge Chronicle of 3 January 1795, the Derbyshire Militia, which Deidre Le Faye suggests inspired Jane Austen, was very well behaved in the two towns of Hertfordshire where it was stationed, as well as in church.Deirdre Le Faye 2003, p. 189 Only Mr. Bingley and his sisters, Mr. Darcy's friends, consider he is not respectable and he behaved in an undignified way towards the latter, but they ignore the details of the story. They only know that Darcy \\"cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned.\\" In any case, they quickly leave Hertfordshire, leaving the field free to Wickham.  Wickham confides  Burning to know the reasons for his and Darcy's attitude when they were face to face, and blinded by her prejudice against Darcy, Elizabeth is not alerted by the impropriety that Wickham demonstrated by using the first opportunity to address the subject himself; she does not realize the skill with which he manipulates her through his hesitation and reticence. On the contrary she looks forward to his sparkling conversation, not realising her imprudence in believing a man who is a tricky conversationalist. Relying totally on his good looks, she accepts without question, without even considering to check it, his version of the story. She sympathises fully with his misfortunes, when he obligingly describes the unfair treatment to which he was subjected: Darcy had, through pure jealousy, refused to respect the will of his late father who had promised him the enjoyment of ecclesiastical property belonging to the family, forcing him to enlist in the militia to live. Although Wickham states that out of respect to his godfather, he cannot denounce Darcy, he does so, feeding into Elizabeth's prejudices about Darcy. A militiaman who serves in the Derbyshire militia, like Wickham does. Watercolour by an unknown artist, 1780. He lies with skill, especially by omission, taking care not to mention his own faults, and remains close enough to the truth to deceive Elizabeth: nothing he says about the behaviour of Darcy is fundamentally wrong, but it is a warped presentation, \\"pure verbal invention\\" according to Tony Tanner.Tony Tanner 1975, p. 112 Darcy's generosity, attention to his farmers, and affection for his sister, are presented as the work of a calculating mind with a terrible aristocratic pride. Thus, in the context of Meryton, without his past and his family being known, Wickham's lies are readily believed, and he is left to indulge in his weakness for gambling and debauchery. He is protected by the mask of his fine manners and the certainty that Darcy, anxious to preserve the reputation of his younger sister, would not stoop to denounce him.  Revelations of Darcy  In the long letter that Darcy presents to her in Rosings Park Elizabeth discovers the true past of Wickham and can begin to sort out the truth from the lies. She thus recognises that she failed in judgment, \\"because his attitude, his voice, his manners had established him straightaway as in possession of all qualities\\". She admits to being at first mistaken by the appearance of righteousness and an air of distinction. She notices an \\"affectation\\" and an \\"idle and frivolous gallantry\\" in Wickham's manners after being informed by Darcy's letter. George Wickham was the son of an estate manager for Mr. Darcy Senior, and George Wickham was the godson of Mr. Darcy Senior, who raised him practically like a second son, both in recognition of his father's work and loyalty and by affection for this boy with \\"charming manners\\". Because he wanted to secure Wickham's future, his godfather paid for his studies in college and then at Cambridge. By giving him the ability to enter religious orders and by granting him the valuable living of a curacy dependent on Pemberley (Kympton), he would have guaranteed Wickham a most honourable social position. Not at all attracted by the clerical profession, to the great relief of Darcy, Wickham preferred to claim a final settlement of ¬£3,000 at the death of his godfather, in-leu of the Living, on-top-of an inheritance of an additional ¬£1,000 also left to him by Darcy Sr.--an amount of ¬£4,000 in-total‚Äîwhich would have provided Wickham with a living allowance of ¬£200 per-annum, IF he hadn't squandered it. Once this money was squandered Darcy refused him further help, so Darcy supposed that he sought revenge and financial-enrichment by taking advantage of Georgiana Darcy's stay in Ramsgate to seduce her, hoping to steal her away and marry her, getting his hands on the young girl's ¬£30,000 dowry. His attempt to seduce Georgiana was facilitated by their childhood friendship (to which Darcy alluded when he described Wickham to Elizabeth) and the relative isolation of the shy adolescent (she was only fifteen years old) without a mother to chaperone her at the seaside town, and by having her companion, Mrs. Young, helping him.  Several scandals  Elizabeth forgives Wickham, gently saying that they are \\"now brother and sister\\". (C. E. Brock, 1895). He is a good-for-nothing and a scoundrel who shows two forms of evil. He is \\"imprudent and extravagant\\" as Colonel Forster finally discovered, which meant, in less diplomatic language, that he had love affairs and piled up debts, especially gambling debts. It is discovered at the time of his elopement with Lydia that Wickham has not maintained any long friendships before he entered the militia at the urging of Denny. This is presented in the novel as having been a sign of his bad character, and Fulford states that Wickham uses the prestige of the militia and the anonymity it provides to run away from his debts. He searched desperately for a financially advantageous marriage: in Meryton, Wickham openly courted Mary King from the moment she inherited 10,000 pounds, but her uncle took her to Liverpool. Tongues loosened to reveal other misadventures once Lydia's absence became known: \\"He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family\\". Lydia, at fifteen, Georgiana's age when he tried to take her away, falls madly in love while they are in Brighton, to the point of agreeing to accompany him when he flees the regiment for not paying his debts of honour. She refuses to leave him, insensitive to the collateral damage the scandal will cause to her family, but he only marries her in desperation, negotiating the terms with Darcy who uses his connections and his fortune to procure Wickham a position, and save Lydia's respectability, allying himself with Mr Gardiner for the occasion.Vivien Jones, Pride and Prejudice (introduction), Penguin Classics, 2003, p. xxxiv. The reactions of the Bennet family are mixed: Mrs Bennet, relieved to see a first daughter duly married, and delighted that it is her favourite daughter, welcomes the young couple with affection after the wedding, sorry to see them go to rejoin the Garrison at Newcastle. Jane blushed in confusion and Mr Bennet ironically claims to be \\"enormously proud\\" of a son-in-law so shameless and cynical: \\"He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.\\" Elizabeth is \\"disgusted\\" to see Lydia and him so comfortable and \\"promises, in the future, never to set limits on the impudence of an impudent man\\". According to Claire Tomalin, this is partially due to a lingering jealousy of Elizabeth towards Lydia for marrying Wickham. Wickham's final scene in the novel is \\"presented as an interruption\\" ‚Äì Woloch notes that Elizabeth tries to walk to the house quickly in order to get rid of him, and that she \\"hoped she had silenced him\\". According to Woloch, the narrator suggests that Wickham and Elizabeth \\"never speak seriously again\\" after this conversation. In this conversation, Wickham tries to discern what Elizabeth now knows about him with some \\"careful probing\\", and she responds with \\"some gentle teasing\\", which Mai interprets as showing the value of forgiveness. Elizabeth is no longer fooled, not by his beautiful rhetoric nor by his engaging ways. Elizabeth and Jane, who are the only ones to know the whole truth of Wickham's character, continue their financial support of their sister, and Darcy helps Wickham in his career (as he had promised his father, and for the sake of his wife), but the doors of Pemberley remain definitely closed to him.Vivien Jones, Pride and Prejudice (introduction), Penguin Classics, 2003, p. xxx == Analysis ==  An image of a rake  Wickham is the traditional rakehell of which Lovelace (Clarissa) is the archetype. In the actantial scheme Wickham plays the role of the opponent. He represents the traditional figure of the debauched and depraved libertine from novels of the eighteenth century. The figure of the bad boy, who is dangerous and a bit too enticing, from whom the heroine must learn to stay away, is presented with more vivacity than the hero who is honest and a real gentleman.Lydia Martin 2007, p. 56 Wickham is no exception to the rule: he has charm and immediately captivates by his apparent frankness and friendly ease.Pierre Goubert 1975, p. 128 But he is the most dissolute and the most cynical of all the seducers described by Jane Austen, and he uses his good looks and good education to create an illusion.Massei-Chamayou (p.329) He has defects that are much more serious than those of the bad boys in the other novels:Massei-Chamayou (p.345) a formidable manipulator of language, he is also the only one who recklessly plays a big game,Massei-Chamayou (p.346) the only one who slanders with such impudence; and things go much worse for him than for them who, on the contrary, do not end up banished from good society. He is also the only one of lower social status. In this regard, Jane Austen contrasts the judgement of Elizabeth Bennet to that of Caroline Bingley, imbued with rank and fortune. Miss Bingley's prejudice against Wickham, in her ignorance of the inside story, leans mainly on the fact that he is a commoner (\\"Considering where he comes from, you cannot expect much better\\"), when Elizabeth shows a greatness of spirit in refusing to tie the value of a person to his social position: \\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same (...) for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr, Darcy's steward\\". Darcy himself refuses to tie Wickham's origin to his conduct, since he considers, in his letter to Elizabeth, that Wickham's father was \\"a very respectable man, who had the responsibility of the entire Pemberley estate for years\\" and admirably performed his duties.Pierre Goubert 1975, p. 311 By using the snobbish Miss Bingley to warn Elizabeth, and the naive Jane in Darcy's defense, Austen subtly prejudices the reader's mind in favour of Wickham. Robert Markley argues that Wickham's seduction spree is a way to revenge himself on the gentlemanly society that he has the education, but not the funds, to access. The narrator uses Wickham to argue against the idea of love at first sight, and Hall states that this allows Elizabeth to consider the attractive reliability of the \\"boy next door\\", Darcy. Alex Woloch discusses Wickham as a foil to Mr. Collins in terms of their being unworthy suitors for Elizabeth ‚Äì while Mr. Collins offers financial security without love, Wickham offers sexual fulfilment without stability.  A hidden character  Asked about her stay at Rosings Park, Elizabeth hinted that Wickham is unmasked. (C. E. Brock, 1895). The omniscient narrator reveals nothing of the youth or the true nature of Wickham. The reader knows him only through what he says about himself and what is said about him, but only later in the story, by characters who knew him before: Darcy (at Rosings Park), and Mrs. Reynolds (at Pemberley). It is therefore difficult to get a fair idea of a character so difficult to define. If the Bingley family (who had never met him before their arrival in Hertfordshire) are only aware of the little Darcy has told them, Mrs. Reynolds, the housekeeper of Pemberley, has known Darcy and Wickham from infancy.Tony Tanner 1975, p. 119 She can confirm that he was raised at Pemberley at the expense of Mr. Darcy Senior, and knows that he is in the army, but fears that he has turned out badly: \\"I am afraid he has turned out very wild\\". At most, the narrator gives the reader a subtle warning by some facial expressions, some slight pauses (marked by dashes) some hesitations in his conversation. In this way, on the evening of their first meeting, Wickham asks Elizabeth, in a slightly hesitating manner, how long Darcy has been in Hertfordshire, then, \\"after a short pause\\", Elizabeth vividly assures him that all Meryton is \\"disgusted by his pride\\" and that no one has anything good to say about him, he begins to disclose his confidences to a partner who is all ears. Later, hearing Collins quote Lady Catherine, and \\"after having observed her for a moment,\\" he asks Elizabeth if she is closely linked to the De Bourgh family. She is convinced that what he says is true because he looks so honest, and that is what justifies and reinforces her dislike for Darcy.Tony Tanner 1975, p. 116 For Matt Brumit, when Wickham avoids the whist card game and sits with Elizabeth and Lydia to play lotteries, Wickham may be attempting to hide his gambling, rather than the sign of interest Elizabeth sees it as. It is only after the revelations of Darcy that Wickham's true character is \\"unmasked\\" for Elizabeth. The reader, going back and forth with her, becomes aware of his prudent way of \\"testing the waters\\" and gauging the feelings of others, addressing himself to a cynical manipulation of his interlocutors, subtly hiding the truth by deliberate omissions and practicing safe slander (he confides only to Elizabeth while Darcy is at Netherfield, but makes his version of the facts public as soon as Darcy is gone). It is only \\"a posteriori\\" that the irony in the vocabulary of emotion he uses is discovered: \\"I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections\\".Pierre Goubert 1975, p. 73 Darcy evokes, in him, \\"his resentment in proportion to the distress of his financial situation and the violence of his reproaches\\". For Richard Jenkyns, Wickham's deceptiveness is the \\"pivot upon which the entire plot turns\\". Jenkyns discusses how Claire Tomalin regards Wickham as frivolous rather than a true villain, but Jenkyns regards this as being further evidence of Wickham being a great conman. Jenkyns points out, in defending Austen's characterisation of Wickham, that the only account of the seduction of Georgiana is given by Darcy. Susan Morgan regards Wickham as being designed by Austen to be a stock villain in both his \\"false face as a charming young man and in his true face as the fortune hunter\\" ‚Äì even the kind-hearted Jane cannot fail to understand that Wickham's intentions towards Lydia are dishonourable when she discovers Wickham is \\"a gamester!\\". Lord Chesterfield's Letters to His Son, published in 1774 and frequently republished, was a true best-seller in the time of Jane Austen. Wickham, whose speech is full of duplicity and is skilled at making white look black Tony Tanner 1975, p.112 has certainly read with profit Lord Chesterfield's Letters to His Son, full of pragmatic, but also quite Machiavellian advice, to appear a true gentleman in society.  Appearance and reality  Jane Austen uses nearly the same words to describe Charles Bingley and George Wickham: both are likable, charming, cheerful, have easy manners, and above all, have the air of a gentleman. But Wickham, to whom Austen gives more engaging manners if it is possible than to Bingley, only has the appearance of a gentleman ‚Äì not the behaviour ‚Äì as Elizabeth will point out bitterly afterward. Bingley is impressionable, weak even, without much knowledge of himself,Reeta Sahney 1990, p. 36 but he is simple and honest, while Wickham is a hypocrite and a true villain who hides his \\"lack of principles\\" and his \\"vicious tendencies\\" under his likable airs. The character defect that the narrator attacks most strongly in Pride and Prejudice is reliance on first impressions and judging only on the face and general appearance.Pride and Prejudice, classic folio presented by Pierre Goubert, p. 11 Jane Austen frequently used the word \\"appearance\\" when describing Wickham so as to emphasize that Elizabeth can see only the surface of the character. Wickham is assumed to be honest because he is handsome and his manners are charming. Elizabeth, who told Jane that \\"sincerity can be read on his face\\", and Mrs. Gardiner that he is \\"beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw,\\" which implies she is relying on his appearance to show his character,Auerbach, p.153 acknowledges, after having read what Darcy reveals of Wickham, that she had never thought of going beyond the appearance and to analyse his \\"real character\\". Thus, the narrator reveals Elizabeth has been taken in by the surface appearance of Wickham. As to the opinion of the inhabitants of Meryton, the narrator shows with some irony that it is unreliable and unpredictable:Tony Tanner 1975, p. 111 if Wickham is \\"universally appreciated\\" at the beginning, he is then considered, with the same exaggeration, as the most evil (wickedest) man in the world, and each one openly affirms that they were always highly suspicious of his apparent virtue: \\"had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness\\".  Two young people of Derbyshire   Two foils  Jane Austen invites the reader to compare the evolution of the \\"two gentlemen of Derbyshire\\", Darcy and Wickham, who are \\"born in the same parish, within the same park\\" and are \\"nearly the same age\\". They are therefore childhood companions (\\"the companion of my youth\\" wrote Darcy), that the behaviour of Wickham towards Georgiana has transformed into enemies and at the meeting of Elizabeth into rivals. Wickham acts as a foil to Darcy ‚Äì Austen uses the comparison between the two characters to contrast them and provide insights into each of the men. Raised at Pemberley (an almost perfect and ideal place) and pampered by his godfather, the former owner, Wickham knew Darcy very well. George Wickham was the son of the steward, he probably always felt envy and jealousy towards the heir. Taking after his spendthrift mother, Wickham, instead of taking the virtuous and honorable way offered to him, rejected the moral rules that governed the estate and the behaviour of its successive owners, keeping only the exterior of a gentleman, not the behaviour. Winter life in Meryton, in the midst of idle officers, generally sons of good families who relieved their boredom by breaking the hearts of romantic young girls, and incurring debts that frequent trips allowed them to avoid paying;Pride and Prejudice, classic folio, presented by Pierre Goubert, p. 22 the opportunities to participate in balls, assemblies, and evening soir√©es organized by the \\"four-and-twenty families\\" who were relatively rich, was better suited to his libertine tastes. Wickham's irresponsible elopement with Lydia inspires Elizabeth to confide in Darcy, setting the stage for Darcy to demonstrate that he now feels responsible for Wickham's continued bad behaviour by his silence ‚Äì if he had made Wickham's bad character known, Lydia would have been safe. Darcy chooses to involve himself in arranging Lydia's marriage, despite the risk to his own reputation. Lydia and Wickham, freshly married, do not show embarrassment but an insolent impudence. (Hugh Thomson, 1894). As Lydia Bennet, wasteful and morally uncontrollable, embodies the dark side of Elizabeth, so Wickham appears as the double negative of Darcy: he takes liberties with the truth (Darcy claims to have a horror of lying), he has sentimental adventures, accumulates a dark slate of debts with the merchants, and, most importantly, is an unrepentant gambler.Massei-Chamayou 2012, p. 146-147 The couple that is formed in the outcome with Lydia, writes Marie-Laure-Massei Chamayou, \\"therefore represents the opposite sulfurous and Dionysian side\\" to the solar couple who are Darcy and Elizabeth.Massei-Chamayou 2012, p. 147  A moral outcome  The fact that Wickham and Darcy are both attracted to Elizabeth is important for the moral sensibility of the Bildungsroman: Elizabeth must not be wrong and choose the wrong suitor. The parallels between the journey of the two young men from Derbyshire and the two Bennet daughters who are both lively and cheerful, who love to laugh and find themselves attracted by Wickham end in a very moral fashion: Darcy, the honest man, weds Elizabeth and takes her to Pemberley. Wickham, the rakehell and unlucky gambler, after having courted Elizabeth for a time, is forced to marry the foolish Lydia and sees himself exiled far from Pemberley. In trying to seduce Georgiana and by fleeing with Lydia, he defied a moral edict and social convention,Reeta Sahney 1990, p. 35 that Jane Austen whose \\"view of the world was through the Rectory window\\"Reeta Sahney 1990, p. xiii neither could nor would excuse: while she offers her heroes a happy future based on affection, mutual esteem, and a controlled sexuality; Austen forces Wickham to marry Lydia,Reeta Sahney 1990, p. 9 who he quickly ceases to love. Although he had almost seduced Georgiana Darcy, and then paid attention to Mary King with her 10,000 pounds a year, Wickham runs off with Lydia and is bribed to marry her. It seems that he often runs away from his marriage to \\"enjoy himself in London or Bath\\", which critic Susannah Fullerton regards as being what Wickham deserves. But he does not have the stature of his predecessor, Lovelace,Tony Tanner 1975, p. 95. nor is he as thorough a villain. His rank of ensign in the regular army was the lowest and could be held by boys of 15, which Breihan and Caplan see as a sign of Darcy feeling that \\"enough was enough!\\" Wickham's career path in the North, where he might at any point be drawn into war, may reflect a desire for atonement and honest service. == Portrayal in adaptations ==  Pride and Prejudice, 1940  In the film of 1940, as in screwball comedies in general, the psychology of the characters is not investigated,Sue Parrill 2002, p. 54 and Wickham is a very minor and superficial character. Elizabeth has learned that Darcy has initially refused to invite her to dance because she is not in his social class, and that he has committed an injustice towards Wickham: consequently she refused to dance with him at the Meryton Ball when he finally came to invite her, accepting, rather, to waltz with Wickham (Edward Ashley- Cooper), but there is no later relationship between Wickham and Elizabeth. She is persuaded that Darcy has rejected the friendship of Wickham only because he is \\"a poor man of little importance\\".Lydia Martin 2007, p. 101 Shortly after having been spurned by Elizabeth at Rosings, Darcy comes to Longbourn to explain his attitude towards Wickham and tell her of the attempted abduction of his sister. Then learning of Lydia's flight, he offers his help and disappears. It is a letter which puts an end to the scandal by informing the Bennets that Lydia and Wickham are married. It is followed by the rapid return of the two lovebirds in a beautiful horse-drawn carriage, and Lydia speaks with assurance about the rich inheritance her husband has received.Lydia Martin 2007, p. 103  Television adaptations for the BBC (1980 and 1995)  They give much more attention to Wickham. In both, Elizabeth has a lot of sympathy for Wickham, perhaps more in the 1980 version where he is played by the blond Peter Settelen. He is shown playing croquet with Elizabeth who speaks fondly of Jane, who has just received a letter from Caroline, expressing the hope that her brother will marry Miss Darcy. Wickham says that being loved by Elizabeth would be a privilege because of her loyalty towards those for whom she cares. A mutual attraction is more clearly seen in this adaptation than the 1995 adaptation.Sue Parrill 2002, p. 71 When Mrs. Gardiner warns against reckless commitments, as in the novel, her niece reassures her that she is not in love with Wickham, but adds, nonetheless, that the lack of money rarely prevents young people from falling in love. She calms her sisters, much more affected than herself by Wickham's courtship of Mary King, pointing out to them that young people must also have enough money to live on. Lydia, by contrast, seems to be already very interested in Wickham and tries to get his attention.Sue Parrill 2002, p. 72 The Pride and Prejudice of 1995 further highlights the two-faced nature of the character, played by Adrian Lukis, a tall dark haired actor who was by turns smiling, insolent, or menacing. He appears as a much darker character than in the previous version, which may explain why the attraction he exerts over Elizabeth is less emphasized than in the 1980 series.Lydia Martin 2007, p. 106 Elizabeth takes a cheerful tone in congratulating him on his forthcoming marriage to Mary King, noting that, \\"handsome young men must also have enough to live on\\". The lack of principles and greed which Darcy's letter accuses him of are subject to short scenes with Darcy's letter read in a voiceover, which has the effect of emphasising Wickham's \\"flawed character\\". Wickham prudently asks Mrs. Gardiner if she personally knows the Darcy family, and his distress at the knowledge that Elizabeth has met Colonel Fitzwilliam at Rosings, and that her opinion on Darcy has changed is visible to the audience. Later, Mrs. Philips relates to Mrs. Bennet his gambling debts, his seductions, and his unpaid bills with merchants. Closely monitored by Darcy, and under the stern gaze of Gardiner during the wedding ceremony, he then cuts a fine figure at Longbourn, where his conversation with Elizabeth (who has just read the letter from her aunt revealing the key role played by Darcy in bringing about the marriage) is repeated almost word for word, showing him silenced finally. His life with Lydia is revealed in only a short montage shown during the double wedding of Jane and Elizabeth. When the officiating minister says that marriage is a remedy against sin and fornication,Lydia Martin 2007, p. 110 Lydia basks on the conjugal bed while Wickham looks on with boredom.  Pride and Prejudice, 2005  Rupert Friend in July 2006. In the 2005 film, Wickham plays a very small role, but Rupert Friend plays a dark and disturbing Wickham, even brutal when he pushes Lydia into the carriage as she bids a tearful farewell on permanently leaving Longbourn. He has the \\"reptilian charm of a handsome sociopath\\", which suggests an unhappy marriage. Meetings with Elizabeth are reduced to two short scenes, a brief discussion in a shop about ribbons, and another, near the river, which, however, is sufficient for him to give Darcy a bad name. But if the complex relationships that existed with Elizabeth in the novel have been removed, the strong physical presence of Rupert Friend has sexual connotations and Wickham plays the role of a stumbling block in the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth. First, at the Netherfield Ball when Elizabeth accuses Darcy of having maltreated Wickham, and especially during the scene of the first marriage proposal where Darcy has a strong jealous reaction when Elizabeth again brings up Wickham's name. This creates a strong sexual tension between the two young people and leads them to almost kiss.  Remakes  In Lost in Austen, however, the entire plot of Pride and Prejudice evolves in a different direction. Wickham (Tom Riley) is depicted as an ambiguous character, but very positive and charming, who initiates Amanda Price into the customs of Georgian society. He also saves her from being engaged to Mr. Collins by spreading the rumour that Mr. Price was a fishmonger. He does not attempt to take Georgiana and helps to find Lydia with Mr. Bingley. In the 1996 novel Bridget Jones's Diary, and its film adaptation released in 2001, Helen Fielding was inspired by Wickham to create Daniel Cleaver, the womanising, cowardly boss of Bridget Jones, the rival of Mark Darcy. In the modernised American web series of 2012‚Äì2013, The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, Wickham is the coach of a university swim team and played by Wes Aderhold. In this version, Wickham is depicted as being abusive towards Lydia, manipulating her into recording a sex tape. ==See also== * Mr. John Willoughby * Mr. Henry Crawford * Mr. William Elliot == Notes  References  Bibliography ==  Primary source bibliography  * Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice, R.

The gene she isolated encoded for an opioid receptor that can reduce pain, generate pleasure, and help cope with stress. The receptors can be activated by drugs, which can cause addictions. Better knowledge of the way that these receptors function can help scientists understand addictions, mood disorders, and mental illness. Her research discoveries have led to development of new analgesic medicines and new treatments for addiction. Opioid system disorders are involved in emotional problems such as anxiety and severe depression. Her research involves many studies regarding opiate addiction. In mice she has researched how the effects of heroin withdrawal can yield depressive behaviors. Her research has shown that after periods of heroin exposure, once mice become abstinent they exhibit depressive-like behaviors that persist weeks after heroin exposure was halted. This information helps explain the severity and chronicity of addiction in certain individuals.Ayranci, G., et al. \\"Dissociation of heroin-induced emotional dysfunction from psychomotor activation and physical dependence among inbred mouse strains.\\" Psychopharmacology 232.11 (2015): 1957-1971. Dr. Kieffer's research also deals with how findings can be translated to humans. Study of brain opioid receptors that deal with depression and happiness are often a focus of her research. In many post-mortem studies of suicide victims it was discovered that mu (¬µ) opioid receptors (MOR) are present in higher density of the frontal and temporal cortex of the human brain when compared with controls of post-mortem studies of patients with no history of psychiatric disorder. This suggests that depression and suicide may be associated with higher MOR density.

In 2016, FIFA officially endorsed GSAS as the sustainability assessment system for Qatar's eight stadiums set to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The primary objective of GSAS is to create a sustainable built environment that minimizes ecological impact and reduces resources consumption while addressing the local needs and environmental conditions specific to the region. GSAS adopts an integrated lifecycle approach for the assessment of the built environment including design, construction and operation phases. Developed in 2007 by the Gulf Organisation for Research and Development (GORD) in collaboration with the TC Chan Center at the University of Pennsylvania, the School of Architecture at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, and other reputed houses of expertise, GSAS announced its fourth edition in 2019. GSAS manuals are revised on a regular basis to reflect all technical changes and provide relevant information to stay conversant based on best practices, GSAS Trust experience and GSAS users feedback. With GSAS at its core, GORD has built a comprehensive continuum of sustainability that encompasses everything from assessing and rating built-environments to educating and certifying professionals. GSAS framework is comprehensive and designed to follow an integrated life cycle approach to improve the sustainability performance of the built environment. GSAS addresses the sustainability impacts during the design, construction and operation stages of buildings and infrastructure projects. The framework addresses eight categories of macro and micro level aspects for a multidimensional focus on sustainability. These categories are Urban Connectivity; Site; Energy; Water; Materials; Indoor/Outdoor Environment; Cultural & Economic Value; and Management & Operations. Each GSAS Category is associated with a direct impact on environmental sustainability and/or human well-being and provides indicators to measure different associated aspects. These categories are then sub-divided into specific criteria that measure and define the individual issues. Categories, criteria, and measurements are defined to be performance based and quantifiable, as far as possible. GSAS identifies several sustainability challenges in the built environment. The challenges include air pollution, land use contamination, fossil fuel depletion, water depletion, water pollution, materials depletion, human discomfort and sickness and climate change. These challenges were used to guide the identified framework to ensure robustness in mitigating the adverse environmental impacts of the built environment. == GSAS Framework Development == The groundwork of GSAS began with a comprehensive review of best practices from established international and regional sustainability rating systems. 2007 marked the start of the development of GSAS Framework. It then went through four stages of the development process up until 2009. The development process conducted a rigorous technical analysis by deploying a rule-based process of analysis and feedback based on technology developments and market feedback. Stage (I) of the development process involved the examination of more than 140 building rating systems, tools, guidelines and standards around the globe. The applicability of the sustainability rating systems, tools, and guidelines to the context of the region were evaluated in terms of four parameters: Ecology & Climate, Materials & Resources, Policies & Laws and Culture & Heritage. Stage (II) of the development process focused on narrowing down the choice to 40 whole building rating systems which were further analyzed based on their scope, applicability, adaptability, transparency and relevance. The main outcome of this stage indicated that several systems were not original and could be considered customized versions of well-established systems. Hence, this resulted in narrowing down the list to 6 well-established rating systems and 2 Energy standards. The six rating systems were BREEAM from the UK, CASBEE from Japan, CEPAS from Hong Kong, Green Globes from Canada, LEED from the USA, and the International SBTool, where the Energy standards were CEN-ISO developed in Europe and ASHRAE from the USA. Stage (III) of the development process began with a thorough review analysis of the selected frameworks. Criteria were established to rate the credibility and effectiveness of the 6 chosen systems methods and structures. Using the Pacific Northwest Laboratory‚Äôs Sustainable Building Rating Systems Summary as a guideline, each of the 6 systems were reviewed using the criteria of Development, Usability, System Maturity, Technical Content, Measurability & Verification, and Communicability. Stage (IV) of the development process evaluated the achievements and limitations of the rating systems. The result of the evaluations yielded the unique GSAS framework, evaluation methodologies, weightings and scoring, translated in GSAS categories and criteria. == Categories and Weights == GSAS framework addresses eight categories of macro and micro level aspects for a multidimensional focus on sustainability. These categories include Urban Connectivity, Site, Energy, Water, Materials, Indoor/Outdoor Environment, Cultural & Economic Value and Management & Operations. Each GSAS Category is associated with a direct impact on environmental sustainability and/or human well-being and provides indicators to measure different associated aspects. These categories are then sub-divided into specific criteria that measure and define the individual issues. Categories, criteria, and measurements are defined to be performance based and quantifiable, as far as possible. Best practices pertaining to the implementation of measures under each criterion are provided as guidelines in GSAS Guidelines manuals. Each criterion in GSAS is provided with explanations of the measurement principle and method that can be found in the guidelines and assessment manuals. For each of GSAS assessment manuals, each criterion is provided with explanations of the submittal requirements. The text on each criterion specifies a process for measuring the individual aspect that has an environmental impact and supporting it with the required documentation. A level is then awarded to each criterion based on the achievement as per the pre-defined rating mechanism. Incentive weights are allocated for certain GSAS criteria in different GSAS certification schemes to encourage additional effort to implement best practice in sustainability. == Application and Rating Mechanism == To be GSAS certified, a project is required to submit the documents (including drawings, schematics, sketches, design reports, simulation reports and vendor‚Äôs data) required for each criterion to demonstrate compliance. GSAS scoring sheets are useful sensitivity analysis tools to enable projects to compute the anticipated criteria levels, project score and corresponding certification rating under multiple scenarios. The tool provides the user with the opportunity to target, adjust and amend the level of each individual criterion to predict the final rating. GSAS scoring sheets are used for all certification types and their different schemes. The scoring sheet lists all categories, the criteria under each category, their weight and target level. Criteria levels are input in GSAS scoring sheet, allowing the user to conduct a sensitivity analysis to predict the overall rating of the project. GSAS Rating indicates the overall achievement of the project and is determined by summing up the individual scores of all criteria. Each certification type has a unique rating nomenclature. The rating is allocated based on the level of project compliance against different categories with varying weights. The eight categories are weighted based on their impact toward sustainability: Energy (24%),Water (16%), Indoor Environment (19%), Site (17%), Urban Connectivity (6%), Materials (9%), Management & Operations (5%), and Cultural & Economic Value (4%). Furthermore, GSAS Level indicates the degree of compliance with the requirements of the criterion and ranges from lowest -1 to highest 3. The level is confirmed for a criterion by GSAS Trust after verification. Each criterion has a score of numeric value which is calculated by multiplying the percentage weight by the criterion level. The score is automatically calculated by GSAS scoring sheet provided by GSAS Trust. It is used to calculate the overall score for the project. The criterion level is generated by GSAS calculators. ==References== Category:Building energy rating Category:Sustainable building rating systems Category:Sustainability ","title":"Global Sustainability Assessment System"},{"id":"46321771","text":"Archibald Campbell K.

The owner of PYM Music, he released his first single and EP in 2013, and his full-length debut album The Limestone Kid was released on February 24, 2015. The Austin Chronicle gave the release 3.5/5 stars, writing that \\"it's too early to declare The Limestone Kid debut of the year, but it's already one to beat,\\" and comparing McCollum's music to that of Charlie Robison. McCollum and his backing band announced a 2015 tour of Texas in support of the album, performing at events such as RedGorilla Music Fest. McCollum released the EP Probably Wrong: Session One on July 7, 2017, and followed it with Probably Wrong: Session Two on September 8, 2017. The full Probably Wrong album was released on November 10, 2017. ==Early life== Parker McCollum was born in 1992 and raised in Conroe, Texas near Houston. Early in his life he listened to classic country musicians such as Willie Nelson, Buck Owens and Porter Wagoner, and his family introduced him to red dirt musicians such as Cross Canadian Ragweed, Pat Green and Chris Knight. Working summers on a cattle ranch with his grandfather, McCollum was further exposed to artists such as Bob Dylan, Townes Van Zandt, and Steve Earle. In elementary school McCollum learned violin and played in the school orchestra, and he started learning guitar at age thirteen. At thirteen he also began writing his own music, mixing genres such as Texas country music, Americana, and indie rock. According to McCollum, he was greatly influenced by his older brother Tyler's lyrics and songwriting. After performing at a number of local open mics with his guitar, he started learning harmonica at age fifteen. By sixteen he was securing gigs at local venues, and he continued to work on his material through high school. After graduation he moved to Austin, Texas, where he began attending college. ==Music career== Singles and A Red Town View (2013‚Äì2014) McCollum continued to perform as a singer-songwriter while living in Austin, and he also went on his first tour with the Texas band Six Market Blvd. The tour inspired the lyrics for his first single, \\"Highway\\", which was released on June 5, 2013, and later included on his debut EP A Red Town View. Released on November 19, 2013, the EP was produced by Corby Schaub, who is also known as the former guitarist for Ryan Bingham. The Limestone Kid (2015) McCollum's debut album The Limestone Kid was recorded at Cedar Creek Recording in Austin, and includes styles such as Americana, Texas country, and folk-rock. McCollum handles vocals, acoustic guitar and harmonica, and his Austin-based backing band includes Kurt Grien on lead guitar, Jason Newberry on bass, Will Hoback on drums, and Charlie Magnone on keyboards and piano. Multi-instrumentalist Corby Schaub produced the album. Lloyd Maines contributed pedal steel guitar. McCollum wrote or co-wrote nine of the eleven tracks, and two of the songs were written by McCollum's family members. Many of the lyrics are about his experiences growing up in Limestone County, Texas, and the album's title is a reference to the nickname he earned working summers at a Limestone County ranch. The first single on the album, McCollum's original track \\"Meet You in the Middle,\\" was released to Texas radio prior to the album. The full-length debut album The Limestone Kid was released on February 24, 2015. The Austin Chronicle gave it 3.5/5 stars, writing that \\"it's too early to declare The Limestone Kid debut of the year, but it's already one to beat,\\" and comparing McCollum's music to that of Charlie Robison. Texas Music Pickers wrote that \\"[McCollum's] stories are not all happy, or sad, or even have resolution; they‚Äôre just straight-forward accounts of life. It‚Äôs like Todd Snider meets Whiskeytown.\\" \\"High Above The Water\\" reached the top 50 of the Texas Regional Radio Report. McCollum and his backing band announced a tour of Texas in support of the album, with February and March dates set for venues in Houston, Austin, and Fort Worth. The band performed at the RedGorilla Music Fest, and Texas Crawfish and Music Festival in Spring, Texas. He won the T-Birds Songwriter Award, and in 2015 performed at Larry Joe Taylor's Texas Music Festival, Probably Wrong (2017) McCollum released an EP titled Probably Wrong: Session One on July 7, 2017. It was his first release to appear on the Billboard charts, debuting at No. 6 on Heatseekers Albums, No. 14 on Independent Albums chart, and No. 15 on Country Album Sales chart, with 2,000 copies sold in the US in its first week. Probably Wrong Session Two was released shortly after on September 8, 2017. The full 10-track Probably Wrong album was released on November 10, 2017, and includes all the previous sessions which features the singles \\"I Can't Breathe\\" and \\"Misunderstood\\", plus two new tracks, including \\"Hell of a Year\\".

On October 16, 2020, McCollum released the EP, Hollywood Gold. ==Musical style and influences== Parker McCollum's music incorporates genres as diverse as blues, roots rock, soul and folk rock, though his albums have primarily been described as country and Americana. His music has received rotation on Americana radio stations in particular, and he has referenced Americana singer-songwriter Ryan Bingham as a significant influence. Other stylistic influences include alternative country musician Ryan Adams and blues and folk artist Townes Van Zant, and blues/pop artist John Mayer. ==Discography== Albums { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" + !

The storm also caused forestry and property damage, power outages, and led to the loss of several lives. ==Meteorological history== Air pressure development of Mike and Niklas storms Preceding the development of the Niklas storm on 28‚Äì29 March strong rainfall was reported in the southern Germany. The 24-hour rainfall of 29‚Äì30 March in the Black Forest saw more than fall. The Niklas storm was preceded by the low pressure named Mike by the Free University of Berlin, which brought hurricane strength winds to Germany on 30 March. Gust reports from this low pressure at the high- altitude stations of Brocken were of (force 12) and Zugspitze . The Niklas storm began to develop on 29 March off the Newfoundland coast. Powerful air temperature differences across Europe led to a strong upper air flow at 2.5 km altitude. Embedded in this was a shortwave trough, which promoted the intensification of the surface low Niklas as it came across Scotland. A plume of colder air from area of Iceland and Greenland also formed a strong temperature gradient with warmer air masses from the Atlantic circulating around high pressure centred to the west of Iberia which helped intensify the storm. Together with an area of low pressure over Scandinavia, which formed a strong air pressure gradient across north-west Europe, The approach of the low pressure saw a tightening of the air pressure gradient especially in the German Bight and north west Germany. The pressure difference being between in the high pressure situated to the west of Iberia, to a low of recorded at the Ekofisk platform in the North Sea. This situation was coupled with a powerful jet stream above the developing storm. Niklas developed as it crossed the UK reaching a low pressure as it crossed the North Sea, and in the course of a day moved to southern Denmark before continuing to the southern Baltic Sea and on towards the Baltic States. The storm field drew across Western Europe on 30 and 31 March 2015, reaching the Netherlands and large areas of Germany on 31 March 2015. Hurricane-force winds were reported in Germany, according to the German Weather service (DWD) with a peak gust at altitude on the mountains of Zugspitze (), the Brocken (), Feldberg in the Black Forest () and on Weinbiet in Neustadt (). At lower elevations on the North Sea coast peak gusts of were reported. The storm was absorbed by windstorm Oskar on 6 April. ==Storm context== The Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute, KNMI ranked the storm at 27th place in the Netherlands since 1971, displacing Cyclone Xaver to 28th place which was of comparable strength in the country. The wind speeds encountered in Germany from the Niklas storm were comparable to the strongest wind speeds (in both the peak gusts and in the highest 10-minute average wind speeds) recorded during March over the 1981-2010 reference period. The Niklas storm is thus one of the most violent storms encountered in Germany during March. which is particularly noteworthy as the storm occurred so late in March and after the beginning of meteorological spring. According to the German Weather Service, DWD the Niklas storm is akin to Cyclone Emma (1 March 2008), which was one of the strongest storms witnessed in Germany during March, and was especially damaging in Bavaria, which reported winds up to on the Wendelstein Mountain and rainfall totals up to . In comparison with other recent storms in Germany, the St. Jude storm of October 2013 and the Kyrill storm of January 2007 affected the northern half of Germany, with the St. Jude storm particularly affecting the far north of Germany, where it was stronger than Niklas. In the southern half of Germany the Niklas storm was stronger than either of these two winter storms. Cyclone Niklas is regarded as being not quite as strong in Germany as the Kyrill storm which had a slightly higher peak gust speed and longer duration. MeteoSwiss reported that in March winds over would be expected to recur on the Swiss Plateau approximately once every four years. Between the mid 1980s and 2001 the return period for these winds was approximately one in three years, but has been less commonly observed in recent years. Considered throughout the year (not just for the month of March) the wind gusts measured on 31 March 2015 were not exceptional. In the Swiss lowlands such a wind event occurs about once in every two years, though locally, there were gusts which only occur at that location once every 5 to 6 years, for example at Affoltern, Z√ºrich. In the Swiss mountains a gust of was measured on S√§ntis, which occurs approximately every 1 to 2 years, and on Mount Pilatus a gust of was recorded, which is expected about every 4 to 5 years. Niklas was not thought to represent an insurance loss in the league of that seen following the catastrophic damages of Cyclone Lothar and Martin in France 1999, where peak gusts of over were measured. ==Impact== Lightning across Europe 31 March 2015 United Kingdom In the United Kingdom the Met Office gave out a yellow \\"be aware\\" warning for wind. The hashtag #windy was trending on UK social media on the morning of 31 March. Wales saw maximum wind gusts of at Capel Curig, Conwy. Around Wales both bridges of the Severn crossing were closed, along with temporary closures of the Cleddau Bridge in Pembrokeshire and the Britannia Bridge across the Menai Strait. Structural damage was also reported to property in the capital Cardiff and Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taf. In the North East of England a lorry overturned in the wind on the A1(M) motorway near Sedgefield. The A66 road from Scotch Corner to Cumbria was closed to high sided vehicles in both directions for several hours, while the A19 road was brought to a standstill in Teesside after a lorry was blown over on the Leven viaduct near Kirklevington. In Middlesbrough the Tees Transporter Bridge was closed due to high winds. The Ouse Bridge on the M62 motorway saw a portable building blow off the lorry transporting it, and led to tailbacks lasting for several hours on the M62. This was compounded in the City of Hull when a lorry overturned on to the central barriers from the southbound carriageway of the Humber Bridge blocking the two major arteries in and out of Hull and East Riding, Humberside police and Highways agency investigating incidents to identify potential driving offences, as the bridges were closed to high-sided vehicles at the time. Wind gusts of reported on the Norfolk coast as the storm moved towards continental Europe. In London a woman received head injuries from a window panel which was blown out of the fifth floor of the London Bridge Hospital. 14 people were left homeless after high winds blew over half the roof off a block of flats in South Ockendon, Essex. Also in London the Old Father Time weathervane of Lord's Cricket Ground was bent over 90 degrees by the wind. Netherlands The Smit Elbe tug on the Nieuwe Waterweg during storm Niklas KNMI issued orange alerts for Groningen, Friesland, the northern part of Drenthe and the Wadden Sea. In the Netherlands the storm brought serious handicaps in aviation and shipping. At Amsterdam's Schiphol airport 80 flights were cancelled. In Europe's largest port of Rotterdam two container terminals closed with ships remaining at sea waiting until the weather calmed down. The Maersk container ship MV Sea-Land Meteor ran aground near to Vlissingen during the storm before being refloated on the next high tide. Authorities later attributed the grounding to navigational error and low tides. On the roads the A6 road was closed for some time near Sint Nicolaasga after a truck was blown over, this was repeated on the A1 motorway where traffic between Hengelo and Apeldoorn was restricted to the hard shoulder. The Dutch Traffic Information Service (Verkeersinformatiedienst) reported that some 25 trucks and trailers overturned on the main roads across the Netherlands, the most in one day since 2007, when the Kyrill (storm) saw 30 blown over in significantly stronger winds, though conditions were not as bad as during the Burns Day storm 25 January 1990 when 130 articulated lorries, caravans and trailers were blown over on major roads. Germany Many areas of Germany saw severe wind gusts A regional express Bayreuth-Nuernberg was severely damaged after hitting a fallen tree on the rail tracks near Pegnitz, Germany. The roof of a school in Halberstadt was torn off in the high winds. The roof of the Lingner School sports hall in Jessen, Saxony-Anhalt was torn down by the storm. Switzerland In Switzerland preventative closure of railway lines, cable cars and upland areas taken out in preparation for the storm. Crap Masegn, Graub√ºnden, with a peak of in the Alps, though even at lower elevations with gusts of gusts of were recorded in Z√ºrich. Z√ºrich Airport was severely affected. One death related to the storm occurred in Switzerland. Elsewhere In Austria the storm brought more damage than was expected. In the Czech Republic the storm impacted transport particularly, on the railways a fallen tree derailed a train travelling between Olomouc and Opava.Brunt√°lsk√Ω den√≠k: Mezi Miloticemi nad Opavou a Branticemi vykolejil vlak Numerous power outages occurred in the Czech Republic, and the fire brigade reported 14 times as more callouts than on an average day.Unwetter: Chaos auf Schienen und Stra√üen, Haushalte ohne Strom auf Radio Praha vom 1. April 2014 abgerufen am 1. April 2014. Poland also saw some significant disruption, with the wind overturning trucks on major roads (near Magnice on National road 8 and the Wroclaw bypass). In Belgium only 39 of the 200 participants of the Gent‚ÄìWevelgem cycle race finished the course as the peloton was disrupted by the wind. ==Casualties== As to Germany, nine deaths caused by the cyclone have been reported. Three persons where killed by trees falling on their cars, blown down by the storm. One man was killed by a concrete wall blown down by the storm, another one by a barn door that the storm tore off its hinges. Due to snow or hail accompanying the cyclone, four men where killed when drivers lost control over their cars. Two more victims have been reported for Austria and Switzerland. ==Aftermath== The passage of the storm led to record production of renewable energy in several nations. In Germany Wind and solar power systems delivered on Monday afternoon for peak load time together nearly 44,000 This corresponds to an output of around 40 average large power plants. Wind turbines delivered 30,000 MW and solar 13,000 MW according to preliminary results released by breaking the previous record. The four German transmission system operators (Amprion, 50Hertz, TransnetBW and TenneT) published provisional figures of the cost to stabilise the German electricity grid were in the \\"lower to mid double-digit millions\\" range due to the storm. In Austria, Austrian Power Grid AG (a 100% subsidiary of Verbund) reported that wind power of a capacity of 2001 MW was recorded on 31 March, the first time that the 2000 MW generation mark has been exceeded in the country. Turbines across the country were operating at about their maximum capacity due to the passage of the Niklas storm. Initial estimates from insurers put the total economic loss from the storm as likely to range ‚Ç¨1‚Äì2 billion. ==References *DWD satellite video of windstorm Niklas *FUB Adopt a vortex Category:2015 natural disasters Niklas Niklas Niklas Niklas Niklas Category:2015 meteorology Category:2015 disasters in the United Kingdom Category:2015 in England Category:2015 in Wales Category:2015 in Germany Category:2015 in the Netherlands Category:2015 in Austria Niklas Category:March 2015 events in Europe Category:April 2015 events in Europe ","title":"Cyclone Niklas"},{"id":"46322088","text":"Ecbolium viride is a species of Ecbolium of the family Acanthaceae.

The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) ‚Äì 1. Shyampukur, 2.

A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government. With the implementation of the Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation was enlarged. Certain areas were already there but more parts of them were added (current spellings) - Entally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watganj and Ekbalpur, and Garden Reach and Tollygunj.

Writing hypermedia fiction under the pen name M.D. Coverley, she is best known for her epic hypertext novels Califia and Egypt: The Book of Going Forth by Day. Her works incorporate text, image, animation, sound, and structure to create spatial, visual story worlds. A pioneer born-digital writer, she is part of the first generation of electronic literature authors that arose in the 1987‚Äì1997 period. Her career includes novels and short stories, scholarship, curating, editing, teaching, and publishing. She is a founding board member and past president of the Electronic Literature Organization and the first winner of the Electronic Literature Organization Career Achievement Award, which was named in her honor. ==Biography==  Early life  Marjorie Coverley Luesebrink (born August 4, 1943) is the daughter of Jack Coverley and Alice Wilcox. Her father was an engineer at Lockheed Aircraft in Southern California; her mother was active in several educational and charity organizations. A fourth-generation Californian, Coverley spent much of her youth exploring Southern California history and landscapes. The family spent summers in Balboa, where she raced sailboats and surfed. In winter, they went on trips (to buy \\"worthless land\\") in the deserts. She started writing poetry and short stories at age 8.  Education  She received her B.A. in English from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1965 and her M.F.A. in fiction from the University of California, Irvine, in 1975.  Career  After graduating from UC Berkeley, Marjorie married Richard Wayne Luesebrink. They settled in Newport Beach. He practiced law, and they began a family with the birth of Eric in 1967 and Marc in 1969. Coverley began writing articles for local magazines such as Los Angeles Magazine and Orange Coast Magazine. She started her first book-length fiction, Love and the Dragonfly ‚Äì a multivoiced, mixed-text work - in 1973. In the early 70‚Äôs she returned to school in the UC Irvine Writing Program. After graduating from the U.C. Irvine M.F.A. program, Coverley began teaching, first at Orange Coast College and then at the new Irvine Valley College in Irvine. She bought her first computer in 1981 and began experimenting with narratives that used the affordances of electronic digital media.  Teacher  In 1979 Luesebrink began teaching full-time at Irvine Valley College. She was one of the original 13 faculty members. At IVC, she started exploring the intersections between computers and writing ‚Äì experimenting with computer-generated poetry and initiating a program in CompuEnglish. Later she developed the first online courses in literature and writing for the college. These courses appeared both online and on television. She has taught in the UC Irvine writing program, UC Irvine Extension, and Orange Coast College and is currently professor emeritus, School of Humanities and Languages, Irvine Valley College.  Author  Coverley has published two multimedia hypertext novels, Califia (Eastgate Systems, 2000) and Egypt: The Book of Going Forth by Day (Artist‚Äôs Book, Horizon Insight, 2006), a collection of short stories, Fingerprints on Digital Glass (2002), as well as other short fiction, poetry, interviews, and articles on electronic literature and born-digital writing. Califia is a multimedia, interactive, hypertext fiction for CD-ROM. Califia allows the reader to wander and play in the landscape of historic/magic California. It is a computer-only creation of interactive stories, photos, graphics, maps, music, and movement. It has Three Narrating Characters, Four Directions of the Compass, Star Charts, Map Case, Archives Files, 500 Megabytes, 800 Screens, 2400 Images, 30 Songs, and 500 Words. One scholar has written of Califia that it is designed to lead the reader \\"to discover the lost cache of California through her wanderings within the story space\\".Bakioglu, Burcu S. \\"Construction of Spatial Narratives in M.D. Coverley‚Äôs Califia\\". MIT Papers, 2005. Another writer calls it \\"a metaphysical quest rather than a conventional mystery\\", noting that the central question of the treasure remains unresolved. It has been termed a classic of hypermedia, and literary critic and hypertext scholar Katherine Hayles has cited it as one of the establishing texts for electronic literature. Egypt: The Book of Going Forth by Day is an artist‚Äôs book published by Horizon Insight. The ‚Äúfirst edition‚Äù consists of 100 individualized copies ‚Äì each one bearing a named ‚Äúspell‚Äù for the owner. Thereafter, ‚Äúreader‚Äù versions have been available on flash drives. Egypt is a story of death and rebirth set in both contemporary and ancient Egypt. It explores the ways in which narrative can be distributed between both text and other media, including images, music, animations, and the navigational structure and interface. Katherine Hayles writes of Egypt: The Book of Going Forth by Day (2006) that its layers \\"are instrumental in creating a visual/verbal/sonic narrative in which the deep past and the present, modern skepticism and ancient rituals, hieroglyphs and electronic writing merge and blend with one another. Fingerprints on Digital Glass is a collection of short web pieces published between 1999 and 2002. It includes Afterimage, Default Lives, Tide-Land, Universal Resource Locator, Eclipse Louisiana, Endless Suburbs, Life in the Chocolate Mountains, and Fibonacci's Daughter. Fibonacci's Daughter is a complexly plotted hypertext centered on protagonist Annabelle Thompson, who runs a business called Bet Your Life out of a California mall. The daughter of gamblers, Thompson sells insurance policies that allow people to bet on their own future prospects. Bet Your Life is both successful and controversial, leading Thompson to be accused of witchcraft (among other things), especially after two teenage clients disappear and are later found dead. The narrative of Fibonacci's Daughter is told through a number of different voices, including excerpts from news stories. Coverley originally created Fibonacci's Daughter with the trAce Archive of online writing at Nottingham Trent University in the U.K. Jane Yellowlees Douglas has suggested that Fibonacci's Daughter owes a debt to Nathanial Hawthorne's story \\"Rappaccini's Daughter\\" in that both are meditations on all the ways that attempting to make the world more orderly can go wrong. Coverley‚Äôs recent work includes Pacific Surfliner: San Juan Capistrano (2017), Hours of the Night. (with Stephanie Strickland, 2016), The 2015 Fukushima Pinup Calendar (2014).  Editor  Luesebrink has worked as an editor for several publications, including The Blue Moon Review, Inflect, Riding the Meridian, and Word Circuits. ==Publications/Works==  Fiction/Creative   Hypertexts  *Egypt: The Book of Going Forth by Day Horizon Insight (2006) *Califia Eastgate Systems (CD, 2000)  Web Literature  *Pacific Surfliner: San Juan Capistrano (2017) *Tin Towns and Other Excel Fictions (2011‚Äìpresent, in progress) *Hours of the Night.

It has rich natural and cultural value. Because of its ecological significance, it is anticipated that a nature park will be established there and that it will be included in the Natura 2000 program.Jogan Polak, Lara et al. 2005. Natura 2000 na Radenskem polju. Grosuplje: In≈°titut za fizikalno biologijo. ==Name== The Raƒçna Karst Field is named after the settlements of Velika Raƒçna and Mala Raƒçna. The local adjective form radenski (as well as the demonym Radenc) are based on the older form of the settlements' name.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 340. ==Research== Researchers started studying the Raƒçna Karst Field during construction of the railroad to Koƒçevje in 1893. During this period, several karst caves in the Ribnica‚ÄìKoƒçevje karst region were discovered and explored. One of the pioneers of such research was Pavel Kunaver, who wrote about the area in 1922, as well as the photographers Bogumil Brin≈°ek, Josip Kunaver, and Ivan Tavƒçar. The geographers Drago Meze and Ivan Gams wrote more detailed studies of the area in 1977Meze, Drago. 1977. Prispevek k hidrologiji Radenskega polja. Geografski vestnik 49: 157‚Äì164. and 1986. The botanical features of the karst field were explored by Luka Pintar in 1991. The last major study was carried out in 2000 by the Fauna and Flora Cartography Center (), commissioned by the local municipality. == Geography== The Raƒçna Karst Field lies in an area with Dinaric-oriented ridges; it is approximately long and wide, and has a total area of . It lies at an elevation of . The karst field has a bowl-like shape with a level floor and a distinctly higher margin, and water enters it from the karst underground. Many other karst features are present in the karst field, such as springs, sinkholes, and estavelles. The karst field has three different watercourses; the Dobravka River flows from a non-karst area, whereas Zelenka Creek and ≈†ica Creek are true karst streams. Kopanj Hill, an isolated dolomite hill high, rises in the middle of the karst field and is a unique example of such a feature in a Slovene karst area.ƒåelik, Tatjana et al. 2005. Natura 2000 v Sloveniji: Metulji. Lepidoptera. Ljubljana: Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 237. The floor of the karst field is covered in alluvial clay to deep, deposited on relatively pure Jurassic limestone. Only a few patches of the surface are composed of Triassic dolomite, which is more or less impermeable. During the Pleistocene, the Raƒçna Karst Field was a lake and water drained from it into the karst underground through what are now dry inflow caves higher on the slopes at the edge of the area. At that time, Kopanj Hill was an island in the lake. An estavelle in the Raƒçna Karst Field The hydrology of the area consists mainly of three rivers. The Dobravka River is a continuation of two non-karst streams: Grosupelj≈°ƒçica Creek and Podlom≈°ƒçica Creek.Komac, Bla≈æ et al. 2008. Geografski vidiki poplav v Sloveniji (= Geografija Slovenije 20). Ljubljana; Zalo≈æba ZRC, pp. 114‚Äì115. It meanders for nearly through the karst field and then disappears into the ground. Both of the true karst streams, Zelenka Creek and ≈†ica Creek, originate at karst springs on the edge of the karst field and then flow across it from the west toward the east. Zelenka Creek meanders through the karst field for and is dry during periods of drought. ≈†ica Creek is fed by two springs at its source and meanders for . During flooding all three watercourses flow together and flow into Inlet Cave () at the southeast end of the karst field. Sometimes, when the water does not drain quickly enough, a karst lake forms, reaching as far as the first houses in Velika Raƒçna. The road connecting the region to Grosuplje also often floods, and on 24 October 1993 a flood lasting three weeks flooded the fire station in Velika Raƒçna. All of the water that drains on the east edge of the karst field flows underground to Krka Cave, the source of the Krka River, which is about away as the crow flies. Because water covers potential farmland for part of the year, barriers have been built at both sinkholes into Inlet Cave to catch branches and other debris and allow the water to drain faster. Karst hydrology studies have shown that narrow areas in the depths of the cave that are inaccessible to human exploration are a significant factor in the speed of drainage through the sinkholes. The Raƒçna Karst Field has several estavelles (locally known as a retje, derived from vretje 'gushing spring'). The largest of these are the Srednjice and Kote estavelles. Another characteristic feature of this karst field is depressions (locally known as a moƒçilo, literally 'pond, puddle') that retain water throughout the entire year. They are important for aquatic flora and fauna, and also function as a water resource for other animals in the karst field during droughts. ==Flora and fauna== The Raƒçna Karst Field has several habitats, some of which are significant at the European level. The land is predominantly grassland, with patches of woods and brush here and there. Brush is especially present along the river channels, along with areas covered in sedge or rushes. Spring flowers include the bog violet (Viola uliginosa), snake's head fritillary (Fritillaria meleagris), summer snowflake (Leucojum aestivum), spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza spp.), and marsh orchid (Orchis palustris). Specimens of marsh lousewort (Pedicularis palustris) and march gentian (Gentiana pneumonanthe) are still present but in decline, and due to fertilizer use the oblong-leaved sundew (Drosera intermedia) and white beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba) have disappeared in the last decade. The area is also a habitat for the swamp cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris) and bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), and in some drier areas there are also less hygrophilous plants. Experts from the Fauna and Flora Mapping Center () have extensively studied the area's fauna. They recorded 27 species of dragonflies, five of which are threatened. Dragonflies can especially be found in areas with slowly flowing water. There are 68 species of butterflies, of which 14 are threatened. The ecological significance of the Raƒçna Karst Field is highlighted by the fact that 12 of the total 19 species of amphibians in Slovenia are also found here. Some of these are killed in large numbers by cars every spring when they cross the local road to their spawning area. Seventy-eight species of birds nesting here have also been inventoried, as well as two species that only pass through; 24 of these species are on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The threatened European otter (Lutra lutra) can be found in places on the northern edge of the karst field. ==Cultural heritage== The ruins of medieval Bo≈°tanj Castle stand immediately before entering the Raƒçna Karst Field. It was plundered and burned by the Partisans on 12 September 1943.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, p. 159.Maƒçek, Janko. 2011. \\"Usodna jesen 1943.\\" Zaveza 80 (19 July) St. Martin's Church, a chapel of ease, stands at the foot of the hill below the castle. Kopanj Hill, an isolated elevation that commands a strategic position and served as a refuge for the locals in prehistory and during Ottoman incursions, is a popular excursion destination and a cultural site. Assumption Church at the top of the hill was first mentioned in written sources in 1433. During the 19th century Jo≈æef Pre≈°eren, uncle of the Slovene poet France Pre≈°eren, served as a curate at the church. A branch school of the Grosuplje Primary School also stands on the hill and has operated since 1865. The northern slope of Kopanj Hill is the site of Mary's Spring (), which folk belief has endowed with supernatural power. The spring is said to go dry only during times of great catastrophes (e.g., during the Second World War). The village at the foot of the hill, Velika Raƒçna, also has cultural historical value, and features a large Baroque chapel that was created under the administration of ƒåu≈°perk Castle. == References  *Raƒçna Karst Field on Geopedia * Category:Municipality of Grosuplje Category:Karst fields of Slovenia ","title":"Raƒçna Karst Field"},{"id":"46322347","text":"Radensko polje may refer to multiple places in Slovenia: *Raƒçna Karst Field (Slovene: Radensko polje), a karst field near Grosuplje *Radenci Basin (Slovene: Radensko polje), a floodplain near Radenci ","title":"Radensko polje"},{"id":"46322348","text":"Phillyrea latifolia, commonly known as green olive tree or mock privet, is a species of tree in the family Oleaceae. ==References== Category:Oleeae Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Phillyrea latifolia"},{"id":"46322364","text":"Sium bin Diau (13 October 1935) represented North Borneo in the triple jump at the 1956 Summer Olympics, he finished 28th.Sports-Reference Profile ==References== Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1956 Summer Olympics Category:1935 births Category:Olympic athletes of North Borneo Category:Living people Category:Malaysian male triple jumpers Category:People from Sabah ","title":"Sium Bin Diau"},{"id":"46322372","text":"De Alchemia is an early collection of alchemical writings first published by Johannes Petreius in Nuremberg in 1541.

The real perpetrators are a trio of angry ghosts who want the cabin all to themselves. When the mortal family refuses to move, the ghostly trio (two women and a man) sink two boats belonging to the couples' wealthy uncle. Once again the poor boy is blamed and this nearly drives him insane for he can see the ghosts. More trouble follows when one of the lady spirits falls in love with the uncle. ==Cast== *Sid Caesar as Ben Powell *Vera Miles as Kate Powell *Barry Gordon as Steve Powell *John McGiver as Uncle George *Cass Daley as Felicity Twitchell *Ricky Cordell as Miles Thorpe *Mary Wickes as Gloria Tritt *Jesse White as Fess Dorple *Robert Donner as Ebenezer Twitchell *Mickey Deems as Rabbit Warren *Nestor Paiva as Felicity's Father *Doodles Weaver as Booper Mellish *Jay C.

Unlike the experts, the viewers know the celebrity's name from the start of each episode. Six experts represent sciences and paranormal fields. These experts are a forensic scientist, psychologist, shaman, fortuneteller, magician, and palm reader. They stay and work in a TV studio. The experts try to identify the celebrity's features, character, occupation and even his name. Since the experts cannot see or communicate with the celebrity, they must use their unique skills and general knowledge to identify him or her. They examine materials received from the celebrity: hair, nail pieces, photos of palm lines, scent examples, teeth marks, fingerprints, blood and saliva samples, drawings, completed psychological tests, and dreams. This show is structured as three phases and a closing round. == The show‚Äôs slogan == You will have enough time to think how well you do know yourself! == Show rounds and rules == Throughout each episode, the celebrity and his/her support team of friends and relatives stay offstage in two separate studious. They watch everything going on via monitors and can comment on anything at any time. In the first round, each expert describes the celebrity's appearance: gender, age, height, figure, and hair and eye color. The experts receive the materials they need for their descriptions in advance, so they can study them on their own before studio shooting. In the second round, each expert works with materials and data he receives in the studio; and has just two minutes to make his conclusions. In this round the experts reveal the celebrity's secrets, especially about his/her health and life. The experts also talk about the celebrity's character, hidden inclinations and vices. They talk about the guest's past, his present unrealized talents, and future. In the third round, the experts receive photos of eleven different celebrities who are similar to the guest plus one of the celebrity. Each expert has one minute to choose and show his choice of the celebrity's photo. In the closing round, the celebrity appears in front of the experts, enabling them to clarify any controversial and outstanding points. == The Expert Panel == Victor Kolkutin, Doctor of Medical Science, professor, forensic scientist Maria Pugacheva, psychologist Dardo Kusto, shaman Aida Martirosyan, fortuneteller Roman Fad, magician and medium Boris Akimov, palm reader == Season overview == {  !Release number !Season 1 !Season 2 !Season 3 !Season 4 !Season 5 !Season 6 !Season 7 !Season 8 !Season 9 !Season 10 !Season 11 !Season 12 !Season 13 - !1 Nikita Dzhigurda Alexander Peskov Nikolay Valuev Kirill Kozakov Alexander Revva Mikhail Galustyan Ekaterina Varnava Maria Rasputina Aziza Olga Shelest Sergey Pakhomov Irina Bezrukova Dariya Voskoboeva - !2 Larisa Dolina Masha Malinovskaya Irina Khakamada Natalya Bestemyanova Kostya Tszyu Maksim Vitorgan Fatima Khadueva Kirill Safonov Irina Saltykova Dmitry Maryanov ‚Ä† Alyona Vodonaeva Prokhor Chaliapin Dmitry Khrustalyov - !3 Alexey Panin Alexander Buinov Vyacheslav Malafeev Lolita Milyavskaya Anastasia Volochkova Anastasia Stotskaya Angelica Agurbash Olga Buzova Victor Saltykov Avraam Russo Elena Lenina Yana Troyanova Roman Popov - !4 Stanislav Sadalskiy Alika Smekhova Darya Dontsova Anzhelika Varum Pavel Derevyanko Mitya Fomin Vera Sotnikova Linda Roman Zhukov Artyom Mikhalkov Alexander Nosik Ilya Safronov Natali - !5 Lera Kudryavtseva Emmanuil Vitorgan Victoria Lopyreva Maria Butyrskaya Yana Poplavskaya Tatiana Volosozhar Mikhail Politseymako Ekaterina Volkova Margarita Suhankina Olga Orlova Anastasia Makeeva Darya Pynzar Natalya Andrejchenko - !6 Jasmin Natasha Koroleva Alyona Sviridova Igor Nikolaev Yegor Konchalovsky Anatoly Wasserman Rosa Syabitova Valery Garkalin Arkady Ukupnik Vladimir Lyovkin Alexey Vorobyov Timur Rodriguez Victor Vasilyev - !7 Boris Moiseev Alexey Yagudin Sergey Penkin Victor Drobysh Olga Budina Anastasia Zavorotnyuk Alexander Inshakov Tatiana Vedeneyeva !

Found in Angola, Benin, Burkina, Cameroon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Nigeria, R√©union, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe, and naturalised in Madagascar. Its genus is derived from 'raphis' = needle, probably in reference to the 4 mm long yellowish spines on the margins and main veins of the leaflets. The specific name refers to a type of starchy flour obtained from the trunk pith ‚Äì 'farina' = starch, 'fera' = bearing. margins and main veins with yellowish spines up to 4 mm long It is one of 26 species currently recognised, all endemic to Africa and Madagascar, with one species, R. taedigera found in Central and South America. Their fronds ‚Äì botanically a single leaf ‚Äì are among the longest in the plant kingdom, those of R. regalis reaching a length of 25 m. The trunk of this species is up to 10 m tall and about 1 m in diameter ‚Äì the topmost fronds reach up a further 10 m ‚Äì and sheathed in persistent leaf bases. Trees occur singly or, because of suckering, in dense clumps. The pendant inflorescences are massive and some 3 m in length, bearing unisexual flowers ‚Äì male flowers at the distal end, female flowers at proximal ‚Äì with first order branches of 13‚Äì32 rachillae very close-packed in almost one plane (see illustration). Raphia spp are monocarpic or hapaxanthic, flowering and fruiting only once, followed by death. Raphia farinifera flowers when the tree is some 20‚Äì25 years old, and it takes a further 5‚Äì6 years from flowering to ripe fruit, all fruits ripening together. Fruit is oblong to ovoid, 5‚Äì10 cm in length, with imbricate, glossy, golden- brown scales. ==Properties== This species is strongly associated with human migration throughout the tropics, leaves being used for thatching, the leaflets for plaiting, and the midribs being a useful material for hut construction, furniture, fences, sweeping-brushes, floats for fishing nets, ladders and poles. The epidermis on the upper surfaces of young leaflets yields raffia, a strong, commercially important fiber, used as cordage in horticulture and handicrafts, and in weaving hats, baskets, mats, shoes, bags, fishing nets, hammocks, curtains and textiles. The midveins of the leaflets are used to construct fishing nets and articles for domestic use. The terminal portion of the core is eaten as a vegetable. The young inflorescences are tapped for a sugary sap which lessens flowering and hastens death. The sap is turned into palm wine, and either further distilled into strong alcohol or used as baking yeast. Fruit pulp is also turned into an alcoholic beverage. Oil extracted from the mesocarp (24%) and seed (1%), and sometimes marketed as 'bamboo oil', produces raphia butter, and soap and stearin. The hard outer shell of the fruit is used for making snuffboxes and buttons, or simply for ornamentation. Wax derived from the lower surfaces of the leaflets is turned into floor and shoe polish, and candles.'Mansfeld's Encyclopedia of Agricultural and Horticultural Crops' ‚Äì Peter Hanelt (editor) (Berlin, 2001) It is frequently cultivated, as in Nigeria, Madagascar, Seychelles, R√©union, India, United States and Lesser Antilles, and as a consequence often becomes naturalised. Medicinal Preparations of the root are used against toothache. Fibers taken from the leaf sheath are taken against digestive disorders, and fermented sap from the inflorescence serves as a laxative. A decoction of the fruit pulp is used as a treatment for dysentery, and an infusion of fruit staunches haemorrhaging. Physical Raffia fibres have proved to be supple and strong, making them well-suited as a binding material in the horticulture trade. Since it is easily split it may readily be prepared in standard widths. Its readiness to absorb dyes makes it ideal for use in fancy items. The fibres have a high tensile strength of 500 N/mm2. Chemical The most important fatty acids in seed oil are palmitic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid, while the main sterol is Œ≤-sitosterol. An extract of the stem bark proved to be toxic to microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus, the cause of river blindness. ==GalleryReferences *Gallery of Raphia farinifera *Flora of Mozambique *Flora of Zambia farinifera ","title":"Raphia farinifera"},{"id":"46322652","text":"The Prospects Group provides education, employment, training and care products and services.

Historically, the role of the firstborn child has been socially significant, particularly for a firstborn son in patriarchal societies. In law, many systems have incorporated the concept of primogeniture, wherein the firstborn child inherits their parent's property. The firstborn in Judaism, the bechor, is also accorded a special position. While an only child will by definition also always be the \\"firstborn\\", in larger families the firstborn often perceives himself or herself to be treated differently from later children. Alfred Adler (1870-1937), an Austrian psychiatrist, and a contemporary of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, was one of the first theorists to suggest that birth order influences personality in the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century. He argued that birth order can leave an indelible impression on an individual's style of life, which is one's habitual way of dealing with the tasks of friendship, love, and work. According to Adler, firstborns are \\"dethroned\\" when a second child comes along, and this may have a lasting influence on them. Younger and only children may be pampered and spoiled, which can also affect their later personalities.Adler, A. (1964). Problems of neurosis. New York: Harper and Row. When examining answers from organized studies, personality and attitude traits are repeated when comparing different children born into the same birth order. These findings have been criticized. == Nurture == It has been observed that the first born is often raised with more attention than the following child or children, which causes the first born child to develop certain characteristics. This is because a couple, which decides to have their first child, is inexperienced and new to raising a child which causes them to be extra aware and concerned for the child. The treatment of a parent to a firstborn cause the child to become jealous or bitter towards the next child or children to come. The way siblings of a firstborn act towards them and the expectations from the people around them are also factors of the way their character develops. Although firstborns are different genders, there are qualities that surpass the difference due to the child's environment. Studies showed an effect on both personality and IQ of a child when comparing the order of birth. When conducting these studies, parents are interviewed and give examples on the type of personality each child expresses. == Roles == In specified cases, the firstborn child that was studied on was observed again as an adult and continued to demonstrate the identical traits as seen when they were a child. When studying famous and historic geniuses in the artistic field, recurrence has demonstrated firstborns to be the children with a creative side as well as being the productive ones. This study also ties together with being an only child. One study indicates that people surround themselves with others associated with their own birth order. \\"Firstborns are more likely to associate with firstborns, middle-borns with middle-borns, lastborns with lastborns, and only children with only children.\\" It is also common to have traits that show a strong personality which is capable of leading or acting more mature. This study was related to the U.S presidents when it was discovered that more than half were firstborn, the rest were middle and four were lastborn. After investigating the birth order of the U.S presidents, important leaders were also looked at and showed the same outcome; a large number of every type of leader was firstborn rather than last. Birth order, and the role of the firstborn, can become complicated in non-nuclear families, with situations such as parents of one child or set of children separating from each other and entering relationships with other people, and then having children with their new partners. In such instances, the first child born in the new relationship may be considered the firstborn for that couple, even though it may not be the first child born to either partner in the couple. == Criticism == The effects of birth order have been repeatedly challenged; the largest multi-study research suggests zero or near-zero effects. Birth-order theory has been asserted to have the characteristics of a \\"zombie theory\\". ==References== Category:Family ","title":"Firstborn"},{"id":"46322705","text":"Alfonsas Dargis (12 May 1909, in Reivyƒçiai, Ma≈æeikiai parish ‚Äì 13 January 1996, in Friedrichshafen, Baden-Wurttemberg land, buried in Friedrichshafen cemetery) was a Lithuanian painter, graphic artist, set designer and poet. == References == Category:1909 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Lithuanian painters ","title":"Alfonsas Dargis"},{"id":"46322757","text":"Emani is a village in Guntur district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

Elected colonel of the 38th Tennessee Regiment, Looney served in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, fighting in the battle of Shiloh. After the war, Looney worked on the preservation commission for the Shiloh National Military Park, which had been established by Congress in December 1894. ==Early life and prewar career== One of the twelve children of Abram and Elizabeth Looney, Robert Fain Looney was born in Maury County, Tennessee in 1824. In 1845, Looney was admitted to the bar and began practicing law in Columbia, Tennessee. Looney married Louisa M. Crofford in 1847 and the couple remained in Columbia until 1852, when they moved to Memphis. This marriage produced nine children.William S. Speer, Sketches of Prominent Tennesseans (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing, 2003), 121-123. ==Civil War== Despite his antebellum position as a Henry Clay Whig opposed to secession, Looney raised the 38th Tennessee regiment and led it through two years of campaigns in Tennessee and Georgia. Looney's service at the battle of Shiloh was especially notable. Raging in southwestern Tennessee from the dawn of April 6 through April 7, 1862, the battle of Shiloh christened the Western theater and resulted in more battle mortalities in two days than in all previous American wars combined.Steven E. Woodworth, The Shiloh Campaign (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2009), 1.

Looney and his regiment fought in numerous other engagements, including Perrysville, Murfreesboro, Farmington, and Corinth. On April 10, 1863, Looney was captured by Union troops outside of Wythe, Tennessee, where he was on an apparent Confederate recruiting mission. Looney returned to active combat until he surrendered at Oxford, Mississippi in 1865. ==Postwar life and the Shiloh National Military Park== After the war, Looney returned to his Memphis law office, where he practiced until 1870. During the last few decades of the nineteenth century, Robert F. Looney was an active member of the Democratic Party, delivering endorsement speeches on behalf of party candidates. Although Looney himself never ran for public office, he was a delegate to the Chicago National Democratic Convention in 1884, which nominated Cleveland for the presidency.Patrick W.

She is thought to be the first opera singer from Brazil to have had an international career. ==Biography== Malvina Pereira was born in Florian√≥polis in 1883 and probably studied singing in Italy with maestro Bellucci. She must have made her debut in 1901 at the Teatro Odeon in Mendoza La Voce Antica. Pereira, Malvina\\" and kept appearing in various small opera houses of Latin America till 1910. Her Italian debut happened in 1911 at the Teatro Morlacchi in Perugia, where she performed Violetta in Giuseppe Verdi's La traviata. From that point Pereira's career was almost entirely based in Italy, where she was enormously successful in small provincial theatres but almost never appeared on any important stages. Probably the greatest achievement Pereira made in Italy was in 1917, when she sang in Gaetano Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor at the Teatro Carcano in Milan. She is also known to have appeared at the Teatro Bellini di Napoli (as Violetta, Mim√¨ in Giacomo Puccini's La boh√®me and Elvira in Vincenzo Bellini's I puritani) and the Teatro Filarmonico in Verona (as Violetta). Apart from Italy, Pereira toured Spain, where in 1914 she sang Rosina in Gioacchino Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia, Violetta and Gilda in Verdi's Rigoletto at the Teatro Arriaga in Bilbao, and the United States, where she performed at the Tivoli Theatre in San Francisco as a member of Lambardi Pacific Coast Company. Pereira apparently left the stage in 1920 and subsequently fell into obscurity. ==Discography== Pereira must have had a beautifully-timbered coloratura soprano with a perfect technique, as La Prensa wrote about her in 1912: No one can resist the fascination of Mme. Pereira's voice after a few minutes of her singing. What wins the public above all is the sweetness and sympathetic quality of her voice and the perfection of her phrasing. This probably explains the fact that Pereira made quite a few recordings for HMV, Odeon Records and Victor Talking Machine Company, amongst which are several duets from La traviata and Carlos Gomes Il Guarany with the famous tenor Giovanni Zenatello. Moreover, Pereira participated in one of the earliest complete recordings of Gioacchino Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia with Ernesto Badini and Edoardo Taliani as partners, made by HMV in 1919 in Milan with the orchestra and chorus of La Scala under the direction of Carlo Sabajno, where she sang the role of Rosina. { !Title !Role !Cast !Company !Reference - Lucia di Lammermoor: Splendon le sacri faci Lucia  - La voce del padrone 053314 - Rigoletto: √à il sol dell'anima Gilda Franco de Gregorio (Il Duca) La voce del padrone 54481 - Rigoletto: Deh!

The panel shows an enthroned Virgin holding the Child. St Catherine of Alexandria and St Barbara are seated alongside. Angels playing instruments flank the throne, while the male figure to left is presumably the person who commissioned it as a devotional donor portrait. The scene is set before a landscape and combines elements of a hortus conclusus, sacra conversazione and Virgo inter Virgines ‚Äì the latter of which always presents Mary with Saints Catherine and Barbara. The work is characteristic of Memling's serene style, exhibiting visual harmony in its structure and color. The painting reflects techniques and synthesizes elements seen in Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden's works ‚Äì the latter to whom Memling apprenticed. The composition is almost an exact copy of the central panel in Memling's St John Altarpiece.Ainsworth (1998), 116 It is unknown when he painted the Mystic Marriage; 1480 seems a probable date according to tree ring analysis. The arbor arching over the Virgin's throne was added at a later date, possibly in the 16th century.\\"Virgin and Child with Saints\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved April 19, 2015. ==Description== The painting depicts the Virgin and Child flanked by saints and angels, with the donor kneeling to the left of the holy figures. Mary sits on her throne beneath a rich brocade canopy of honor, holding the child Jesus on her lap. Two angels dressed in liturgical garments, holding musical instruments, stand to either side of the throne slightly behind the two saints. The angel to the left plays a portable organ; the other on the opposite side has a harp. The martyr virgin saint, St Catherine of Alexandria kneels in front of Mary to the left; opposite is St Barbara reading a missal. The donor kneels behind St Catherine holding a set of rosary beads in his hands. Attached to his hip, barely visible, is either a small purse or a coat-of-arms.Ridderbos (2005), 136 Robert Campin, Virgin and Child with Saints in an Enclosed Garden, c. late 14th century ‚Äì early 15th century St Catherine was highly venerated in the Middle Ages, second only in popularity to the Magdelen.Snyder (1987), 35 Emperor Maxentius tortured Catherine on an iron-spiked wheel and later, when she proclaimed herself married to Christ, cut off her head. According to her legend the mystic marriage occurred in a dream from which she awoke with a ring on her finger. Her emblems are the breaking wheel and sword, seen in the foreground, peeking out from beneath the voluminous folds of her ermine-lined skirt. To denote her royal birth, Catherine wears a crown on her head and is dressed in rich clothing ‚Äì a white tabard, red velvet sleeves, and a richly patterned brocade skirt. She extends her left hand to the Christ Child who places the ring on her finger, symbolizing their spiritual or mystical betrothal. James Snyder writes that typical of Memling's art, \\"the drama of the moment is in no way reflected by the expressions on the faces of the participants.\\" Another bride, St Barbara, sits across from Catherine, in front of the tower, the emblem of where her father had her imprisoned and where she was secretly baptized. It is shaped of a monstrance for the sacramental bread; its three windows symbolize the Trinity.Ridderbos (2005), 136 In 1910 James Weale identified Catherine as probably an early portrait of Mary of Burgundy and Barbara as the earliest likeness of Margaret of York,Weale (1910), 177 which medieval art historian Thomas Kren thinks is plausible. Both women belonged to the Guild of St Barbara at Ghent; Margaret of York was an avid bibliophile who commissioned a number of illuminated manuscripts, one of which was a Life of St Catherine.Kren (1992), 43 The features of the female faces show Memling's development, according to Ainsworth, who writes that by this period he had \\"settled on a certain successful female type\\" of a graceful oval face, wide eyes and narrow chins, and expressions reflecting \\"a state of gentle, beatific acceptance.\\" ==Iconography== Master of the Virgo inter Virgines, Virgin and Child with female martyr saints, c. late 1480s A common Marian presentation in Late Gothic art was the hortus conclusus, depicting the Virgin and Child in an enclosed garden. Memling extends the theme by positioning the group against an open sweeping background landscape. Mary's emblem the iris is visible in the garden behind her throne. The enclosed garden motif symbolizes the Virgin's purity, as evoked in the Song of Songs.Pearson (2017), 125 The painting also contains elements of a sacra conversazione and the more specific Virgo inter Virgines.Blum (1969), 93 In a sacra conversazione, Virgin and Child are grouped with saints and donors, whereas a Virgo inter Virgines presents the Virgin and Child only with virgin martyr saints and more often without the donor. The latter gained popularity in the Low Countries during the late 15th century; the setting was almost always in an enclosed garden, the grouping always included Virgin and Child with Saints Catherine and Barbara. Frequently St Catherine's mystical marriage is depicted. Depending on the wishes of the donor or the purpose of a work, other virgin saints such as Dorothy or Cecilia were added to the grouping. Paula Pumplin writes the subgenre might have originated with Hugo van der Goes or with Memling.Pumplin (2010), 317‚Äì18 The grape arbor arching over the canopy is a later addition, perhaps requested by the donor or a subsequent owner. Technical examination reveals significant differences between Memling's style and the hand that executed the arbor: the green pigments differ from the pigments used for the green background landscape; and the brushstrokes \\"are broader and more descriptive of nature than are the schematic strokes that characterize the stylized trees and bushes of the background landscape\\". The grape arbor is absent from the extensive underdrawings.Ainsworth (2005), 55 An early 16th century copy of the painting at the Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence contains a similar motif, suggesting the arbor was added either during Memling's lifetime or so soon after he died. The arbor's paint is similar in age to the painting's original paint layer, adding credence to the theory it was probably added soon after its execution, probably at the request of the donor. It was not unusual for owners to request alterations to a paintings, often to keep them up-to-date. The iconography of the grape arbor was at that time a common means to signify the blood of Christ, particularly significant in Memling's city of Bruges where the Basilica of the Holy Blood was thought to house a relic of Christ's blood.Ainsworth (2005), 56 Such 15th-century paintings were typically devotional pieces, commissioned by donors seeking spiritual salvation after death.Bauman (1986), 17 Art historian Guy Bauman considers Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele (1434‚Äì36) by Jan van Eyck (1434‚Äì36) the most evocative and realistic of these. He writes van Eyck perfectly captures an encounter [of] mortal and divine beings in another world\\".Bauman (1986), 24 The function of Memling's Mystic Marriage is unknown; other than the prayer beads held in the donor's hand, which signify his devotion to the cult of the Virgin, nothing is known about him. Bauman speculates the work could have been an epigraph, or a commemorative piece, because Memling's positioning of the donor behind the saints bears a slight similarity to van Eyck's Canon van der Paele.Bauman (1986), 30 ==Style and composition== Memling was almost certainly apprenticed to Rogier van der Weyden whose style influenced the younger painter.Friedl√¶nder (1956), 42 By the end of the 1460s Memling's style was developed; according to Max Friedl√§nder he is best characterized as \\"an assured pictorial interpreter of quiet mood, at his best when presenting the Virgin in a circle of female saints or as a portraitist.\\"Friedl√¶nder (1956), 44 He is known for a style that captures a sense of serenity and grace, which garnered a great amount of admiration during the late-19th century, when he was thought to be was thought to be a painter who saw with his soul. In the early-20th century, however, he was criticized as lacking innovation. Bernhard Ridderbros writes that neither analysis credits Memling \\"with the significance of his work, which was considerable\\", nor credits the extent to which he synthesized the techniques and motifs of his predecessors, van der Weyden and van Eyck.Ridderbos (2005), 140 Center panel, St John Altarpiece Memling's Madonna Enthroned with Child and Two Angels, c. 1490 The composition of the Mystic Marriage of St Catherine is almost identical to the central panel of Memling's St John Altarpiece, except that the former is set in a columned space. According to Ainsworth, aside from differences in the folds of the saints' dresses the figures are \\"virtually identical in type, costume and gesture\\". The altarpiece has the two St Johns flanking the heavenly figures, whereas here the single donor is shown to the left of St Catherine. Guy Bauman suggests the donor's presence on the left is intrusive, writing that Memling's proclivity for symmetry \\"has resulted in a curious compositional solution that balances the donor with Saint Barbara's tower\\".Bauman (1986), 25 Ainsworth explains the panel \\"reveals spontaneous and rather detailed underdrawing\\", which is typical for Memling. She speculates he used preliminary workshop studies as a basis for this panel and other similar renditions of the same scene. The nature of the black chalk underdrawings, visible via technical analyses, suggests he drew them freely before applying layers of paint to achieve a smooth surface. Almost certainly the two paintings, despite their similarities, were not the product of a template or other mechanical means of copying. Memling was unique in repeating his work; according to Shirley Blum he \\"duplicated scenes and motifs to an extent never before witnessed in Netherlandish painting.\\" She writes he failed to achieve a sense of unity across the panels of the St John Altarpiece,Blum (1969), 94 which he solved by simplifying imagery and by depicting a single idea on a single panel. Unlike van Eyck, whose overwhelmingly large Madonnas symbolize the church in which they stand, hidden or disguised symbolism is absent in Memling's work. His straightforward and literal details function as nothing other than as ornamentation and background for the Virgin. In his later work, the ornamentation became increasingly elaborate and Italianesque.Blum (1969), 97 Friedl√§nder likened him to Fra Angelico in that Memling not so much copied or repeated his work, but rather \\"he pictured the Madonna as she took form in his imagination, depicting therefore always the same body and the same soul.\\"Friedl√§nder (1920), 116 ==Attribution and provenance== Only two of Memling's works are definitively attributed and dated; both are at Old St. John's Hospital (Sint-Janshospitaal). The St John Altarpiece is inscribed with a date of 1479, almost certainly the date it was installed; Triptych of Jan Floreins is inscribed and probably commissioned by a prelate or brother at the hospital. Attributions and dating depend on stylistic analysis, but because Memling repeated compositions such as this, dating is more problematic. Generally art historians agree he executed St. Catherine at about the same time as the altarpiece, probably around 1480.Hand (1987), 184 Friedl√§nder first suggested the 1480 date in 1916; a date that since has been substantiated with tree ring analysis. There is no record of the painting's owners until its purchased by Sir Joshua Reynolds of London, who may have acquired it on a trip to Bruges, or from Dr. John Taylor of Ashbourne, who is recorded as an owner. It was bequeathed to a Mrs Davenport in London, who showed it Burlington House. At an unknown date it was acquired by architect G. F. Bodley and later sold to an London art dealer who had it cleaned and passed it to Parisian dealer, Leopold Goldschmidt. He had it exhibited in the 1902 Bruges exposition.Friedl√§nder (1916), 188, 193 Benjamin Altman bought it in 1911 for $200,000 and bequeathed it on his death in 1913 to the Altman Collection at New York's Metropolitan museum. == References ==  Citations   Sources  * Ainsworth, Maryan. \\"Hans Memling\\".

The eldest son of the 3rd Marmion feudal baron of Tamworth acquired the manor of Winteringham in North Lincolnshire. ==Welsh feudal barony of Llanstephan== A second barony was obtained by Roger Marmion, lord of the manor of Fontenay-le-Marmion during the Norman invasion of Wales when he was rewarded with the Barony of Llanstephan, whose caput at Llansteffan Castle played a central role in the Welsh wars. ==Barony of Torrington, purported barony by writ (1264)== The third barony was a barony by writ of summons for William Marmion (as \\"Baron of Torrington\\") to Simon de Montfort's Parliament in 1264, but the summons was not continued after the rebels' defeat at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Under modern law, this summons did not create a peerage. ==Barony of Winteringham, barony by writ== Created for John Marmion (d.1322). ==Ancestry== According to Cokayne \\"the earliest known occurrence of the Marmion name seems to be that of a William Marmion who exchanged 12 acres of land with Ralf Taisson, son of Ralf the Angevin, which were granted by the latter to the abbey of Fontenay before Oct 1049 and who acted as a witness to a confirmation charter by William Duke of Normandy in 1060. Due to similarities between the coats of arms of the Taisson and Marmion families there is some speculation that they were related. ==King's Champion== Legend has it that the Marmions were Champions of Normandy before moving to England during the Anarchy. Robert Marmion's defence of King Stephen's castle at Falaise (birthplace of William the Conqueror and former seat of the Dukes of Normandy) in 1140 against Geoffrey of Anjou, is possibly an indication that the title originally had more than symbolic meaning. In addition, as Normandy was still the homeland of the Kings of England at this time, it makes sense that, if one existed, the King's Champion would be known as \\"Champion of Normandy and England\\". Philip Marmion (d.1291) used the \\"3 Swords\\" badge, later used by the Dymokes to denote being hereditary Champions of England, as a seal as early as 1265, and in 1328 Tamworth Castle was held by the service of \\"appearing armed in the Royal Arms and mounted on the King's best charger to make proof for the king against any who opposed his coronation\\". The duty passed to the Dymokes through Philip's granddaughter Margaret Ludlow, due to his having no legitimate male heirs. ==Baron Marmion of Tamworth (c.1110-14)== By Tenure (feudal barony) *Robert Marmion (died 1144) *Robert Marmion, 2nd Baron Marmion of Tamworth (d.bef Oct 1181), son and heir.

Their fight for safer working conditions was chronicled in the 1983 film Silkwood, in which Ellis was portrayed by Cher, who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Ellis. After Karen Silkwood's death in 1974, Ellis continued to protest and was involved in a series of legal battles against Kerr-McGee and the state of Oklahoma.Silkwood's real-life characters accessed 4/5/2015 ==Personal life== She was born Sherri Lou Ellis in Guthrie, Oklahoma, the daughter of LouAnn (n√©e Harman 19342007) and Benjamin Ellis (19291987). Her mother was a champion dog breeder and her father was a professional bull rider. She had a sister, Linda, and a brother, Brett. She got the nickname Dusty from competing in rodeo competitions as a barrel racer, where she won many prizes. Her whole family was involved in the rodeo, and her family owned farm land in Oklahoma near the Kerr-McGee plant. Ellis identified as a lesbian. She graduated from Guthrie High School in 1971.LouAnn Ellis obituary accessed 4/5/2015 Ellis began working at the Kerr-McGee plant in Crescent, Oklahoma as a laboratory analyst when she was 21. She lived with Karen Silkwood in an apartment in Edmond, Oklahoma for around six months prior to Silkwood's death, along with Silkwood's boyfriend Drew Stephens. On November 10, 1974, Silkwood, Ellis, and Stephens were flown to Los Alamos, New Mexico for two days of intense testing. Silkwood's testing revealed that her body was contaminated much worse than Ellis' and Stephens'. The last time she saw Karen Silkwood was at work on the day of November 13, 1974, hours before Silkwood died in a car accident. In 1975, Ellis climbed the exterior wall of the Kerr- McGee plant with a shotgun. She was arrested and given one year of probation after pleading guilty to forcible entry. Initially, Ellis was not worried about being contaminated with plutonium, even after Silkwood began her investigations. Only once Ellis tested positive for plutonium within her own body did she begin worrying about her own health and joined Silkwood as an activist against Kerr-McGee. The plant offered her money in exchange for any complaints she might have against them, but she refused payment. She also claimed that someone had tried to break into her apartment twice and failed. In the years following the death of Karen Silkwood, Ellis was known for not cooperating with authorities, declining interviews, and refusing to testify in court proceedings. In 1980, Ellis made national news after being reported as a missing person and was feared to have been murdered, because she was writing a tell-all book about her experiences of working in the Kerr-McGee plant. She was found days later in New York City, and told reporters she was meeting with publishers. The book was never published.Ex-Roommate of Karen Silkwood reported missing accessed 4/5/2015 In 1982, Ellis walked into a nursing home in Santa Fe, New Mexico with a shotgun and took 170 people hostage. She was ambushed by a worker at the home and arrested. She told police she was protesting against the nursing home after learning a resident there was being treated poorly and being denied food. In 1985, Ellis protested against New York City mayor Ed Koch after the water in New York City was contaminated with higher than usual levels of plutonium.Friend of Silkwood warns against drinking water accessed 4/5/2015 In 1995 Ellis was charged for domestic abuse by her girlfriend Viola le Marr. The case was dismissed. In 2002, she was charged with vandalizing and trespassing at a local church and was shot by police after aiming her gun at an officer. In 2009, she was involved in a car accident and charged with auto negligence. In 2010, Ellis was caught stealing from a local grocery store and assaulted a police officer, and she was charged with larceny and obstruction. Often Ellis claimed she knew who really killed Karen Silkwood, and that the reason for her actions was because of the mental and physical duress the Silkwood case caused her.Guthrie woman jailed in hostage case accessed 4/5/2015The Karen Silkwood Story accessed 4/5/2015State of Oklahoma court records accessed 4/5/2015 Silkwood's roommate calls friends accessed 4/5/2015The Life and Death of Karen Silkwood accessed 4/5/2015 ==Silkwood== Director Mike Nichols began filming for Silkwood in 1982, with a script written by Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen. Cher was cast to portray Ellis in the film. The producers of the film paid Ellis $67,500 for her likeness, even though they changed her name in the film from Dusty Ellis to Dolly Pelliker. Karen Silkwood was portrayed by Meryl Streep, and both Streep and Cher were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances as Silkwood and Ellis.The Nuclear Industry's Terrible Power accessed 4/5/2015TCM Silkwood Trivia accessed 4/5/2015 ==Death== Ellis died on November 2, 2012 after having been diagnosed with cancer a few months prior.

The whole council was up for election. Turnout was substantially up across the city due to the election being held on the same day as the general election and other local elections in England. Since the previous election in 2011 a review of ward boundaries had affected some wards, although the total number of councillors remained at 47. The following wards remained unchanged from 2011: Acomb, Bishopthorpe, Dringhouses and Woodthorpe, Haxby and Wigginton, Holgate, Huntington and New Earswick, Micklegate, Strensall, Westfield and Wheldrake. All other wards saw boundary changes and a new ward, Copmanthorpe, was created from the former Rural West York Ward. The election saw heavy losses for the ruling Labour Party, which had won overall control of the council in 2011, losing more than 40% of the 26 seats won at the previous election. Several senior Labour councillors were defeated including the party's deputy leader Tracey Simpson- Laing and Cabinet members Dave Merrett and Linsay Cunningham. The Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Greens all made gains and two Independent councillors were also elected. A record number of new councillors were elected, almost half of the entire Council, with the York Press reporting that \\"of the 47 seats contested, 25 were won by candidates with council experience while 22 were won by debutants.\\" Following talks between the political groups after the election, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats agreed to run the Council as a joint administration. ==Election result== : There were boundary changes in 13 wards, which elected 28 city councillors.

Over the last 25 years, 1,900 Venture and Rover Scouts have gone on Explorer Belt Expeditions. Ireland's Explorer Belt is recognised as being one of the most challenging yet ultimately rewarding activities in Scouting. The Explorer Belt was traditionally linked to the Venture Scout Section but since the introduction of ONE Programme, and the standardisation of age ranges the Explorer Belt is now a Rover Scout event and participants must be over the age of 18. A similar award is available in other Scout associations around the world. ==Location== Over the last 26 years locations have been widely varied. The Locations for belts run by CBSI/CSI/SI-CSI are: * 1980 - Normandy, France * 1981 - No event * 1982 - Vermont, New Hampshire, and New York, United States * 1983 - Wales * 1984 - Sweden (first female team and first team to get a second Belt) * 1985 - No event * 1986 - Scotland * 1987 - Bavaria (Cancelled) * 1988 - Italy and Wales (The Welsh event was a joint CBSI/SAI event) * 1989 - Le Conquet, France * 1990 - Denmark * 1991 - Scotland * 1992 - England * 1993 - Wales * 1994 - Scotland * 1995 - Hungary * 1996 - Wales * 1997 - Slovenia * 1998 - Belgium * 1999 - Northern France * 2000 - Brno, Czech Republic * 2001 - Italy * 2002 - Lithuania * 2003 - Spain (intended to be Canada, changed due to SARS outbreak, nicknamed the \\"Spanada\\" Belt) The Belts run (every second year) by SAI/SI-SAI are: * 1988 - Wales (The Welsh event was a joint CBSI/SAI event) * 1990 - Northumberland * 1992 - Scotland * 1994 - no event run * 1996 - Wales * 1998 - Spain * 2000 - France * 2002 - Spain Events run by Scouting Ireland are: * 2004 - Germany * 2005 - United States * 2006 - Portugal * 2007 - Poland * 2008 - Croatia and Slovenia * 2009 - Sweden and Denmark * 2010 - Benelux Region * 2011 - Austria and Czech Republic * 2012 - Brittany, France * 2013 - Basque Region, Spain * 2014 - Slovakia and Hungary * 2015 - Germany * 2016 - Italy * 2017 - Poland * 2018 - Netherlands * 2019 - Scandinavia (specifically Denmark and Sweden) * 2020 - event cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic ==Format== Rover Scouts, in teams of two, must travel a distance of at least 200 km on foot, and 100km in public transport, over 10 days, completing various tasks along the way. These tasks include maintaining a log of the journey, consisting of a daily route, menu, budget and account of the day's activities. Each team must also complete a number of prescribed challenges, which encourage the participants to engage with the local populace and to learn about the local culture. In the past, participants also had to complete two self-chosen challenges in form of special interest badges, but this was phased out with the addition of the public transport requirement in 2019. Each team must find its own way back to a base camp where the expedition leaders are waiting for them. Teams are dropped off in an unknown location with just a map, the location of base camp and a small amount of money on which to survive - typically ‚Ç¨3 per person, per day of the event. ==Aims== The aim of the event is to test skills of communication, physical endurance and teamwork. Complete immersion in a foreign culture necessitates an ability to adapt to the norms of a different society with different customs and values, usually also a different language. ==The Belt== Not all participants are successfully awarded the Belt.

Her uncle Charles Pigott had published scandalous accounts of his life under the titles of The Jockey Club and The Female Jockey Club. Her uncle Robert Pigott had been on the Grand Tour and he wrote about his views on food and dress which influenced some parts of French society during the French revolution.J. G.

In 1832 she would have come to notice when she wrote The Private Correspondence of a Woman of Fashion but it was published anonymously. This biographical book tells her story via the letters she wrote during travels abroad and back in England. Her letters say that she was \\"dazzled\\" when she saw Napoleon after he returned from the Battle of Waterloo to Paris and how she and her friends visited the battlefield within a fortnight to picnic and pick up souvenirs. She would describe her life in England in 1816. She describes anecdotes in her letters such as seeing the scandalous Ladies of Llangollen, the celebrity Sarah Siddons acting and a visit by the young Princess Charlotte and Prince Leopold to the theatre. Whilst she was preparing her next publication she met the aging John Galt who she persuaded to edit Records of Real Life in the Palace and the Cottage. She received some criticism for this as it was suspected that she was just taking advantage of Galt who died in the same year the book was published. However her unfinished biography of him which is in the Bodleian library implies that it was more of a mutual respects than her critics allowed. Records of Real Life in the Palace and the Cottage had an introduction by Galt and this three volume work was published with her as prime author in 1839. This book was again in letter form and it documented her long visits to Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland and France.Pam Perkins, ‚ÄòPigott, Harriet (1775‚Äì1846)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 5 April 2015 Her final work was a fairy story titled The Three Springs of Beauty.

The film stars Naomi Watts, Jaeden Martell (then known as Jaeden Lieberher), Jacob Tremblay, Sarah Silverman, Lee Pace, Maddie Ziegler, and Dean Norris. The story concerns a plan hatched by a young genius, dying of cancer, to save the girl next door from abuse. The film premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 14, 2017. It was released in theaters by Focus Features on June 16, 2017, and received generally negative reviews from critics, mostly focused on the film's plot twists and tonal shifts, and Trevorrow's direction, although the cast received some praise. == Plot == In a small suburban town in the Hudson Valley, eleven-year-old boy genius Henry Carpenter and his younger brother Peter are being raised by their single mother Susan, a waitress who is working on writing children's picture books. Henry has used his intellect to invest successfully in the stock market, building up a very substantial nest egg for his family. Henry also protects Peter from a school bully and builds Rube Goldberg machines in their tree house. Henry and Susan are both fond of their next-door neighbor and Henry's classmate, Christina Sickleman, who has recently become glum. Henry sees Christina being abused by her stepfather, Glenn, the local police commissioner. Henry reports the abuse to social services and the school principal, Janice Wilder, but Glenn has connections throughout the local government, and Wilder is reluctant to challenge the commissioner without \\"conclusive evidence\\". Henry is unable to get the authorities to launch a serious investigation that would protect Christina. Henry tells his mother that when someone is in trouble, those who can help must take action. He develops a detailed plan to rescue Christina that he memorializes in a notebook. After a violent seizure, Henry is taken to the hospital, where he is diagnosed with a brain tumor and undergoes surgery. Anticipating his death, he tells Peter to give Susan the notebook. Days later, Henry dies in Susan's arms in the hospital. Susan is distraught at Henry's death and has difficulty functioning, but when Peter gives her the notebook, she focuses on Henry's plan. Susan tries, but fails, to interest a nearby social services agency in opening an investigation. One night, from the window in Peter's bedroom, she sees Glenn in Christina's room and decides to carry out the plan. The notebook and an accompanying cassette tape describe Henry's step-by-step plan to kill Glenn with a sniper rifle while covering Susan's tracks so that it will be impossible to trace the murder back to her. Susan's alibi is to be provided by executing the murder while both Christina and Peter are performing at a school talent show. Susan slips away from the talent show and puts the plan into motion. As she is about to pull the trigger, she realizes that Henry's plan, though ingenious, is the construct of a child, and that she must act as an adult. She immediately confronts Glenn and tells him that she is going to expose him for what he has done to Christina. Glenn replies that everyone will believe him, not her, and he tells her that he is going to call his police chief to come and bring her in. At the same time, affected by Christina's dance performance at the talent show, Principal Wilder decides to follow through on the abuse accusation and contacts the authorities. Glenn returns home, calls his relative at Social Services, and learns that an investigation is being opened into his abuse of Christina. As the police arrive at his house, Glenn kills himself. Susan legally adopts Christina as her daughter. She also finishes writing one of her children's books, as Henry had urged her to do. == Cast == * Naomi Watts as Susan Carpenter, the mother of Henry and Peter * Jaeden Martell as Henry Carpenter, the title character and Susan's older son * Jacob Tremblay as Peter Carpenter, Henry's brother and Susan's younger son * Sarah Silverman as Sheila, a waitress and Susan's best friend * Dean Norris as Glenn Sickleman, the police commissioner and Christina's abusive stepfather * Lee Pace as David Daniels, a neurosurgeon who operates on Henry * Maddie Ziegler as Christina Sickleman, Glenn's stepdaughter * Tonya Pinkins as Janice Wilder, the school principal * Bobby Moynihan as John, Susan's and Sheila's boss at the diner * Geraldine Hughes as Mrs. Evans, Henry's and Christina's teacher * Jackson Nicoll as Morris, a boy who bullies Peter == Production == Hurwitz wrote the first draft of the screenplay by 1998. The film was eventually optioned by Jenette Kahn, and Sidney Kimmel Entertainment joined as a producer. An executive at Kimmel Entertainment thought that Colin Trevorrow would be right to direct The Book of Henry. Trevorrow and Hurwitz found each other to be congenial, but then Trevorrow was hired to direct Jurassic World. Another director was considered. By early 2015, after Trevorrow finished Jurassic World, he returned to The Book of Henry. Kimmel Entertainment and Double Nickel Entertainment financed and co- produced the film; producers are Sidney Kimmel, Kahn and Adam Richman. Focus Features obtained worldwide distribution rights. Principal photography on the film began in September 2015 in and around New York City, and concluded in November. The music was composed by Michael Giacchino. Stevie Nicks sang a new song in the film. == Release == The Book of Henry was scheduled to be released on September 16, 2016, but Focus rescheduled the film's release to June 16, 2017, concluding that during the summer, the film release schedule would offer fewer adult-oriented films that might compete against The Book of Henry for older viewers. The film premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 14, 2017. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $1.4 million from 579 theaters (an average of $2,460 per theater), finishing 13th at the box office, and making it \\"by far the biggest start among the new Specialties\\" opening that weekend. The film was featured at the July 2017 Ischia Film Festival, where Trevorrow was honored with the Breakout Director award for the film. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 22% based on 134 reviews, with an average rating of 4.02/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The Book of Henry deserves a few points for ambition, but its tonal juggling act ‚Äì and a deeply maudlin twist ‚Äì may leave viewers gaping in disbelief rather than choking back tears.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". PostTrak reported audiences gave the film an 86% overall positive score and a 65% \\"definite recommend\\". Caroline McVitty commented in The Island Packet that the film was one \\"that critics hate and audiences love.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: \\"There‚Äôs the kind of bad movie that just sits there, unfolding with grimly predictable monotony. Then there‚Äôs the kind where the badness expands and metastasizes, taking on a jaw-dropping life of its own, pushing through to ever-higher levels of garishness. The Book of Henry ... is of the latter, you‚Äôve-got-to- see-it-to-disbelieve-it variety.\\" The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, in a critical review, said that, \\"in its pure misjudged ickiness, bad-acting ropiness, and its quirksy, smirksy passive-aggressive tweeness, this insidiously terrible film could hardly get any more skin-crawling.\\" Writing for Vulture, Emily Yoshida opined, \\"It does not suffice to call The Book of Henry bad; it‚Äôs nonfunctional, so poorly conceived from the ground up as to slip out of the grasp of the usual standards one applies to narrative film. It might be admirable if it wasn‚Äôt such torture to watch.\\" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club wrote: \\"Director Colin Trevorrow ... lacks any of the eccentricities that might make this quirky and contrived material work, even at face value,\\" though he added, \\"its above-average performances and insistence on following through on an off-beat premise give it a hint of battiness.\\" Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave it 1.5 stars out of 4, saying: \\"The Book of Henry starts well, begins flirting with absurdity in the middle ‚Äì and ends in crashing disaster. But the feeling persists that director Colin Treverrow believes every word in the shambles of a 20-year-old screenplay by crime novelist Gregg Hurwitz.\\" Stephen Schaefer of the Boston Herald was one of the minority of critics who praised the film, as was Colin Covert of the Chicago Tribune, who concluded: \\"This is a poignant, frequently funny film that moves into unexpected dark subjects.\\" == References  External links == * * * Trailer No. 1 * Feature on the young stars of the film in Vanity Fair Category:2017 drama films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:English-language films Category:Fictional child prodigies Category:Films about cancer Category:Films about child abuse Category:Films directed by Colin Trevorrow Category:Films produced by Sidney Kimmel Category:Films scored by Michael Giacchino Category:Films set in New York (state) Category:Films shot in New York (state) Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Focus Features films Category:Sidney Kimmel Entertainment films Category:Books by Gregg Hurwitz ","title":"The Book of Henry"},{"id":"46323518","text":"The 2015 Ashford Borough Council election took place on 7 May 2015 to elect members of Ashford Borough Council in England.

After graduating in 2004, he attended the College of William & Mary where he earned a bachelor's degree in finance and economics and a master's degree in accounting. ==Running career== High school Landry was coached by Matt Ryan at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology which competed in the AAA division of the Virginia High School League. While there, he led the team to the 2002 State Championship in Cross Country and a runner-up finish the following year in 2003. In 2004 he won both the 1600 meter and the 3200 meter at the outdoor state meet in times of 4:13.39 and 9:13.74. Collegiate At William and Mary, Landry earned three All-American awards in cross country with a highest placing of 13th (2007) at the NCAA Division I Cross Country Championships and placed 46th in the 2005 IAAF World Cross Country Championships Junior Race for the United States. On the track Landry qualified for NCAA Outdoor Championship Meet in his freshman and sophomore years in the 5,000m. Post-collegiate After finishing his NCAA eligibility at William and Mary, Landry moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan and became a volunteer assistant coach for the cross country team at the University of Michigan for two years while he pursued a professional running career. His first post-collegiate breakthrough was a 28:30.07 showing in 2011 at the Payton Jordan Invitational 10,000m, his debut in the event. This success continued onto the USARC (USA Running Circuit) where he racked up four top five finishes in the next year, including a runner-up finish at the 2012 15 km Championships that would later be upgraded to a first-place finish as a result of a drug conviction of the previous winner. After the 2012 Olympic Trials, where he finished 17th following a fall in the 10,000m, Landry signed with MizunoUSA. By the end of the year he had accumulated enough points in USARC races to become the 2012 overall champion. In 2013, Landry continued to improve in the 10,000m and dipped under the 28 minute barrier for the first time. For Landry 2014 was a breakout year as he won three USA Road Championships in a row (10 mile, 25 kilometer, and 10 kilometer), including setting the American record at 25 kilometers, and finished second in two others. This led to Landry winning the USARC overall championship for a second time. In 2015 Landry was second place in the USATF 15 km Championships behind Ben True. Landry ran the Mt SAC Relays 5000 meter in 13:36.69 in Walnut, California on April 17, 2015 as a tune up to Payton Jordan Invite where he ran the Olympics standard for 10,000 meters with his time of 27:55.19 at Stanford University on May 2, 2015.http://www.all- athletics.com/node/90007 ==Competition record== National championships and international competition Road { - rowspan=62011 USA 8 km Road Championships Carmel, Indiana 4th 8 km 23:16 - USA 10 km Championships Atlanta, Georgia 5th 10 km 28:52 - USA 20 km Road Championships New Haven, Connecticut 4th 20 km 61:17 - USA 5 km Road Championships Providence, Rhode Island 8th 5 km 14:07 - Izumo University Ekiden Izumo, Japan 9th 8 km 23:33 - Chiba Ekiden Chiba, Japan 7th 10 km 30:00 - rowspan=52012 USA 15km Road Championships Jacksonville, Florida bgcolor=gold1st 15 km 44:37 - USA 25 km Road Championships Grand Rapids, Michigan bgcolor=silver2nd 25 km 1:15:47 - USA 20 km Road Championships New Haven, Connecticut 7th 20 km 60:04 - USA 5 km Road Championships Providence, Rhode Island 10th 5 km 14:12 - USA 10 mi Road Championships St. Paul, Minnesota 8th 10 mi 47:52 - rowspan=42013 USA 15km Road Championships Jacksonville, Florida 5th 15 km 43:46 - USA 25 km Road Championships Grand Rapids, Michigan bgcolor=cc99003rd 25 km 1:15:00 - USA Marathon Championships St. Paul, Minnesota 5th Marathon 2:14:44 - USA 12 km Road Championships Alexandria, Virginia 4th 12 km 34:40 - rowspan=82014 USA 15km Road Championships Jacksonville, Florida 4th 15 km 43:58 - USA 10mi Road Championships Washington, D.C. bgcolor=gold1st 10 mi 46:41 - USA 25 km Road Championships Grand Rapids, Michigan bgcolor=gold1st 25 km bgcolor=#F7BE811:14:18 - USA 10km Road Championships Atlanta, Georgia bgcolor=gold1st 10 km 28:25 - USA 7 mile Championships Davenport, Iowa bgcolor=silver2nd 7 mi 33:32 - USA 20 km Road Championships New Haven, Connecticut bgcolor=silver2nd 20 km 61:27 - USA 12 km Road Championships Alexandria, Virginia 8th 12 km 34:42 - Chiba Ekiden Chiba, Japan 5th 10 km 28:55 - rowspan=22015 USA 15km Road Championships Jacksonville, Florida bgcolor=silver2nd 15 km 44:14 - USA 25 km Road Championships Grand Rapids, Michigan bgcolor=silver2nd 25 km 1:15:01 - rowspan=32016 USA 15km Road Championships Jacksonville, Florida bgcolor=cc99003rd 15 km 44:42 - USA 1/2 Marathon Road Championships Columbus, Ohio bgcolor=gold1st 1/2 Marathon 62:52 - USA 25 km Road Championships Grand Rapids, Michigan bgcolor=gold1st 25 km 1:15:32 - rowspan=32017 USA 1/2 Marathon Road Championships Columbus, Ohio bgcolor=cc99003rd 1/2 Marathon 63:13 - USA 25 km Road Championships Grand Rapids, Michigan bgcolor=silver2nd 25 km 1:14:51 - USA 20 km Road Championships New Haven, Connecticut 4th 20 km 60:36 } Key: Track and field { - 2011 2011 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships Eugene, Oregon 12th 10,000 m 28:54.94 - 2012 USA Olympic Trials Eugene, Oregon 17th 10,000 m 28:35.46 - 2013 2013 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships Des Moines, Iowa 12th 10,000 m 29:38.82 - 2015 2015 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships Eugene, Oregon 20th 10,000 m 29:40.49 - 2016 2016 United States Olympic Trials (track and field) Eugene, Oregon 15th 10,000 m 29:27.15 - } Cross country { - rowspan=22012 USA Cross Country Championships St. Louis, Missouri 7th 12 km 36:28 - NACAC Cross Country Championships Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago bgcolor=silver2nd 8 km 24:10 - 2014 USA Cross Country Championships Boulder, Colorado 16th 12 km 38:07 - 2016 USA Cross Country Championships Bend, Oregon 10th 10 km 32:45 } ==ReferencesChristoLandry.com Category:1986 births Category:American male long-distance runners Category:American male marathon runners Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Madison, Wisconsin Category:William & Mary Tribe men's track and field athletes ","title":"Christo Landry"},{"id":"46323534","text":"Ehab Fuad Ahmed Nagi (17 September 1968) is a former South Yemen athlete, who competed at the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in the men's 100m, he finished 8th in his heat and failed to advance.Sports-Reference Profile ==References== Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:1968 births Category:Yemeni male sprinters Category:Living people Category:Olympic athletes of South Yemen ","title":"Ehab Fuad Ahmed Nagi"},{"id":"46323538","text":"Conservatives in blue, Liberal Democrats in yellow, UK Independence Party in purple, Labour in red and Independents in grey.

It is a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1998 animated film of the same name, based on the Chinese folklore \\"The Ballad of Mulan\\". The film stars Yifei Liu in the title role, alongside Donnie Yen, Tzi Ma, Jason Scott Lee, Yoson An, Ron Yuan, Gong Li, and Jet Li in supporting roles. It is directed by Niki Caro, with screenplay by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Lauren Hynek, and Elizabeth Martin. Plans for a live-action remake began in 2010 but the project stalled in development hell before filming took place in New Zealand and China from August to November of 2018. Over the course of production the film was the subject of several controversies, including changes to the source material and filming in Xinjiang in light of the Uyghur genocide and Xinjiang re- education camps. Mulans Hollywood premiere was held on March 9, 2020. Originally scheduled to be a wide theatrical release, it was ultimately cancelled in the United States after being delayed multiple times due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Disney instead premiered the film on September 4, 2020, on Disney+ for a premium fee in countries where the service had launched. The film had a traditional theatrical release in countries without Disney+, where theaters have re-opened. With a production budget of $200 million the film has grossed $69.6 million at the box office, not including digital earnings from Disney+. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the action sequences, visuals, and performances, but criticized the screenplay. It received less favorable reviews from Chinese audiences, who criticized the character development and mishandling of cultural elements. ==Plot== In Imperial China, Hua Mulan is an adventurous and active girl, to the disappointment of her parents, who hope that one day she will be wed to a good husband. As a young woman, Mulan is forced to meet with a matchmaker to demonstrate her fitness as a future wife. Mulan, flustered, attempts to pour tea in front of the matchmaker, but a spider causes a panic that destroys the kettle, and the matchmaker calls her a disgrace in front of her family. To the north, an imperial outpost is invaded by Rouran warriors, under the leadership of B√∂ri Khan. They are assisted by the witch Xianniang, who uses her magic to pose as a surviving soldier and report the attack to the Emperor of China; he then issues a conscription decree ordering every family to contribute one man to fight Khan's forces. Imperial soldiers arrive in Mulan's village to enlist recruits and her elderly and frail father Hua Zhou is forced to pledge his service as he has no sons. Realizing that her father has no chance of survival, Mulan flees with his armor, horse, and sword to join in his place. Mulan arrives at the training camp, which is run by Commander Tung, an old comrade of Hua Zhou. Alongside dozens of other inexperienced recruits, she ultimately becomes a trained soldier under his tutelage without exposing her true identity. The Khan's army continues to advance, forcing Tung to end training early and send his battalion to fight. Mulan chases some troops on her own, but is confronted by Xianniang, who mocks her for pretending to be a man. She attempts to kill Mulan, but her attacks are stopped by the leather with which Mulan's chest had been bound to hide her identity. Mulan removes her male disguise, returning to the battle just as the Rourans begin attacking her fellow troops with a trebuchet. Mulan uses discarded helmets and her archery skills to maneuver the trebuchet into firing on a snowy mountain, triggering an avalanche that buries the Rourans. Mulan rides back to camp and rescues Chen Honghui, a soldier she befriended in camp. Unable to hide her true gender any longer, she is expelled from the army and begins her return home. On her way, she is confronted by Xianniang, who reveals that she was also shunned by her people and fights for B√∂ri Khan only because he treats her as an equal. Additionally, she reveals that the attacks on the outposts have been a diversion, as Khan's true plan is to capture and execute the Emperor for having his father killed. Risking execution, Mulan returns to her battalion to warn them of the impending capture. Tung decides to believe her, and allows her to accompany a unit to the Emperor's palace. Xianniang, posing as the Imperial Chancellor, persuades the Emperor to accept B√∂ri Khan's challenge to single combat, while removing the city guards from their posts. The guards are murdered, and the Rourans prepare to burn the Emperor alive. Mulan's unit distracts the Rourans while Mulan goes to save the Emperor. Khan tries to snipe her with an arrow, but Xianniang, sympathetic to Mulan and disenchanted with Khan, transforms into a bird and sacrifices herself by catching the arrow. Mulan kills Khan, but not before he disarms her and destroys her father's sword. She frees the Emperor, who offers to let her join his personal guard. She declines the offer and returns to her village. Mulan is reunited with her family. An emissary from the Emperor, under the leadership of Commander Tung, arrives to present Mulan with a new sword, while making a personal request that she join the Emperor's Guard. ==Cast== * Yifei Liu as Mulan, the eldest daughter of Hua Zhou who defies both tradition and the law by disguising herself as a man by the name of Hua Jun in order to enlist herself in the Imperial Army in place of her ailing father. ** Liu reprised her role in the Mandarin-language dubbing of the movie. ** Crystal Rao portrays a young Mulan. * Donnie Yen as Commander Tung, the high ranking leader of the Imperial Army and mentor to Mulan.

Plans for a live- action Mulan remake began in 2010, but the project never came to fruition. On March 30, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Disney had restarted development of the live-action adaptation with Chris Bender and J. C. Spink producing, while Elizabeth Martin and Lauren Hynek would be writing the screenplay. On October 4, 2016, it was announced that Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver would rewrite the script, combining the Chinese ballad and the 1998 animated film, while Jason T. Reed would be producing the film along with Chris Bender and Jake Weiner. On February 27, 2020, Reed said that Mulan's sidekick from the original film, Mushu, was removed due to the character's negative reception in China. Reed also said, aside from both the original ballad and the animated film, the filmmakers drew inspiration from different Chinese adaptations of the ballad while writing the film, stating that, since \\"[t]he traditional Disney audience and the diaspora Asian audience viewed the movie in one way, and the traditional Chinese in China audience viewed a slightly different way\\", the filmmakers \\"dug in to try and make sure that [they are] addressing both of those audiences in a thoughtful way\\". Casting Yifei Liu plays Mulan in the remake. Since several recent Hollywood films were accused of whitewashing, Mulan has been under intense scrutiny since The Hollywood Reporter reported that Disney was making a live- action adaptation of Mulan. An online petition titled \\"Tell Disney You Don't Want A Whitewashed Mulan!\\" received more than 100,000 signatures. On October 4, 2016, Disney announced that a global search for a Chinese actress to portray the title role was underway. A team of casting directors visited five continents and saw nearly 1,000 candidates for the role with criteria that required credible martial arts skills, the ability to speak clear English, and star quality. On November 29, 2017, Chinese-American actress Yifei Liu was cast in the film to portray the titular role of Mulan. Many celebrated this as a win for diversity in Disney films. Further cast announcements for Donnie Yen, Gong Li, Jet Li, and Xana Tang were made in April 2018, Utkarsh Ambudkar and Ron Yuan in May, Yoson An and Chum Ehelepola in June, Jason Scott Lee in July, Tzi Ma, Rosalind Chao, Cheng Pei-Pei, Nelson Lee, Jimmy Wong and Doua Moua in August, and Chen Tang in September. Director Disney originally sought an Asian director. Disney first considered Ang Lee, Taiwanese film director and two-time Academy Award winner for Best Director. The Hollywood Reporter mentioned that Lee was approached but declined on October 12, 2016. According to the report, published on November 22, 2016, he said that he would like to see an Asian director leading the film, but he himself had to decline because he was still obliged to promote his film Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk. Next, Disney met with Jiang Wen for the position; finally on February 14, 2017, New Zealander Niki Caro was hired as the director of the film, which made Mulan the second Disney film with a female director and a budget above $100 million following A Wrinkle in Time. Filming Principal photography began on August 13, 2018, at locations in New Zealand and China and wrapped on November 25, 2018. According to actress Gong Li, the film's production budget was $290‚Äì300 million due to the \\"massive and...unprecedented scale\\" of the sets, although the actual figure was later reported to be $200 million. The budget makes Mulan the most expensive film ever directed by a woman. Post- production The visual effects are provided by Sony Pictures Imageworks, Weta Digital, Framestore, and Image Engine, with Seth Maury and Andres Langlands serving as visual effects supervisors and Sean Andrew Faden serving as production supervisor. Music The remake does not feature any songs from the original film and instead features instrumental versions of the original film's songs. Caro later explained that the songs were deleted because she felt it didn't fit with her realistic vision of the film; she believes that since people do not break out into song as they enter war, the film should not either. Though she still tried to \\"honour the music from the animation in a very significant way\\", she did not want to disrespect the original film in any way; however, she claimed she could not find a place to squeeze in the original music. Producer Jason T. Reed clarified Caro's previous statement by saying that the songs will be featured \\"in a slightly different way\\" in the remake. Harry Gregson-Williams, who previously worked with Caro on The Zookeeper's Wife, composed the film's score. Matthew Wilder, who co-wrote the songs for the original film, said the remake will feature a new version of the song \\"Reflection\\", and that the song \\"thematically plays a large part in the new movie throughout the score\\". Christina Aguilera, who previously performed an end-credits version of \\"Reflection\\" for the original film, confirmed during a performance in The Xperience that she had recorded a new version of \\"Reflection\\", as well as new material for the remake's soundtrack. On March 6, 2020, she released a new single for the film's soundtrack, titled \\"Loyal Brave True\\". The song was written by Jamie Hartman, Harry Gregson-Williams, Rosi Golan and Billy Crabtree, and produced by Jamie Hartman. The song was also released in Spanish, as \\"El Mejor Guerrero\\". Additionally, the singer confirmed that she would also release a re-recorded version of \\"Reflection\\". On March 8, a Mandarin-version of the song, titled \\"Ëá™Â∑±\\" (\\"Z√¨j«ê\\"), performed by Yifei Liu was released, while Aguilera's English version was issued later the same year, on August 28. The soundtrack album was released by Walt Disney Records on September 4, 2020.  Soundtrack  Credits adapted from Tidal. = International versions = As usual with songs played over the end credits, most of international dubbings left the song \\"Loyal Brave True\\" and \\"Reflection\\" in their original version, while only a few dubbings adapted one or both songs into their respective languages. When the song \\"Reflection\\" was adapted, it was never Aguilera's version, but only Liu's: all versions kept Aguilera's English version, while a few redubbed Liu's Mandarin version. In the three Indian dubbings, both songs were adapted into Hindi, Tamil and Telugu, with singer Nithayashree Venkataramanan performing the songs both in Tamil and Telugu. While the Hindi version reprises the title used for the animated movie, Aguilera's English version was originally played over the credits, so the Hindi version featured new lyrics, written solely for the remake. On the other hand, no Tamil or Telugu version has yet been released for the original movie. In the Hebrew, Italian, Kazakh, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian version), Russian and Spanish versions, only the song \\"Loyal Brave True\\" was dubbed, with Aguilera performing the song again in Spanish, which was used both for the European and Latin American dubbings, and Brazilian singer Sandy returning for the remake, after she had sung Aguilera's version of \\"Reflection\\" in the animated movie. Finally, in the Japanese and Korean dubbings, only Liu's version of \\"Reflection\\" was replaced with two brand-new versions of the song: while no Japanese version was originally made for the animated movie, the song was originally performed in Korean by Lena Park for the animated movie with the title \\"ÎÇ¥ ÏïàÏùò ÎÇòÎ•º\\" (\\"Nae ane naleul\\"), but it was fully rewritten for the live-action, with the title changed to \\"Ïà®Í≤®ÏßÑ ÎÇ¥ Î™®Ïäµ\\" (\\"Sumgyeojin nae moseub\\"). The Mandarin Chinese soundtrack also features another rendition of the song performed by singer Coco Lee, who had voiced Mulan in the original animated movie in the Mandarin dubbing distributed in Taiwan, and also sang Aguilera's original song. But her version was only featured in the soundtrack: it was Liu's version to play in the movie. Lyricists: * Italian: * Portuguese (Brazil): Mariana Elisabetsky ==Release== Mulans world premiere was held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on March 9, 2020. The film was originally scheduled for a November 2, 2018 theatrical release, but was delayed, with The Nutcracker and the Four Realms taking its slot. It was rescheduled for March 27, 2020 before being removed from the release calendar due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film later rescheduled for July 24, 2020, taking the former slot of Jungle Cruise, and then was delayed again to August 21, 2020. On July 23, the film was removed from the release calendar once again. On August 4, 2020, Disney announced that it was cancelling the film's wide theatrical release in the United States, and would instead premiere the film for a premium fee on Disney+ on September 4, 2020. Mulan will be available for the purchase until November 2, 2020, before becoming available for all subscribers on December 4.} The film will not be offered in France as a premium offering, instead releasing to Disney+ subscribers in the country for free at a later date. Speaking about the price point for the film in the United States, Disney CEO Bob Chapek said, \\"We're trying to establish a new premiere access window to capture [the] investment we got [in the film]... From our research under a premiere access offering, not only does it get us revenue from our original transaction of PVOD, but it‚Äôs a fairly large stimulus to sign up for Disney+.\\" The premium fee will be approximately in other countries when considering conversion rates for their native currencies. Unlike other premium VOD releases that feature a 48-hour viewing window, Mulan will remain available to renters for as long as they stay subscribed to Disney+. The film was still released theatrically in countries where theaters had re-opened, as well as in other countries that do not have Disney+. In China, the film was released on September 11, 2020. Mulan received a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association, the first Disney live-action remake to be given such a rating. Marketing On July 7, 2019, the official teaser trailer and the official teaser poster were released during the broadcast of the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Final. The teaser trailer was viewed 175.1 million times in its first 24 hours, including 52 million from China, making it the seventh most viewed trailer in that time period. On September 30, an exclusive photo featuring Liu as a soldier in the Imperial Army was released on Empire's upcoming Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker issue. On October 24, a prequel novel written by writer Grace Lin was announced along with a preview being made available online. Entitled Mulan: Before the Sword, the novel was released on February 11, 2020. On November 4, a video clip filmed during a Toho cinema preview was leaked online, featuring new shots of Mulan as a warrior battling fiercely and taking off her hair band. On November 6, Liu was featured as one of the 25 stars of Next Gen Talent 2019 nominated by The Hollywood Reporter with two new studio stills released concurrently. On November 20, the Japanese theatrical poster was released online. On December 5, the official trailer was released. On January 26, 2020, 6 individual character posters were released. On February 2, 2020, the final trailer was released. As a result of delaying its original March 2020 release, film executives estimated that each time the film was delayed it cost Disney between $200,000 and $400,000 in marketing fees, a figure that could reach $5 million if it was moved out of the summer season altogether. Variety estimated that Disney spent around $50 million on global advertisement for the film, with Deadline Hollywood attributing $35 million of the marketing budget to TV ads. == Controversies == The film was marked by several controversies, relating to both production decisions as well as comments by individuals involved in the movie. Disney CFO Christine McCarthy has stated that the controversies the film has caused have created \\"a lot of issues for [Disney].\\" Yifei Liu's comments on Hong Kong A call to boycott the film began when Yifei Liu reshared an image posted by the People's Daily, an official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. The image included a quote from Chinese reporter Fu Guohao who worked for the state- owned tabloid Global Times and was subsequently assaulted by protesters during the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests: \\"I support Hong Kong police. You can beat me now. What a shame for Hong Kong.\\" This sparked international controversy, with Liu being accused of supporting police brutality in Hong Kong. The hashtag, #BoycottMulan, has since started trending supporting a boycott of the film. In response to the controversy, Liu was not present at the 2019 D23 Expo, which gave fans an exclusive sneak peek of the film. Removal of Li Shang On February 27, 2020, film producer Jason T. Reed said that Mulan's love interest Captain Li Shang was dropped in response to the Me Too movement. In his statement, he explained that \\"having a commanding officer that is also the sexual love interest was very uncomfortable and we didn't think it was appropriate\\". The reasoning behind the removal was met with social media backlash from fans of the original film and members of the LGBTQ community, who deemed Shang's relationship with Mulan's male alter ego Ping to be bisexual. Reed was initially surprised by criticism of Shang's removal, but acknowledged that the character had become a \\"LGBTQ icon\\", and clarified that Shang's role would be served by two new characters, Commander Tung and Chen Honghui. In September 2020, Cynthia Vinney of CBR wrote that Honghui's interactions with Mulan were \\"more homoerotic\\" than Li Shang's in the animated version and likewise \\"can be read as bisexual\\". Lauren Puckett of Harper's Bazaar wrote \\"Some fans understood and agreed with the #MeToo argument. Others found it offensive, arguing that Shang would never use his commanding position to coerce a woman into romance. He waited until after she was no longer under his command to pursue any sort of romantic relationship. And anyway, it was Mulan who had the crush on him! [‚Ä¶] Despite [Honghui's] attraction, he hardly has the same respect for her that brave and beautiful Li Shang did.\\" Lack of diversity in production team There was criticism over having a production team largely composed of white people, such as for the roles of director, costume designer, and screenwriter. Disney received some criticism for hiring a white director for the film, rather than an Asian director. In a February 2020 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, director Niki Caro responded to the criticism by saying \\"Although it's a critically important Chinese story and it's set in Chinese culture and history, there is another culture at play here, which is the culture of Disney, and that the director, whoever they were, needed to be able to handle both ‚Äî and here I am.\\" In an August 2020 interview with Film School Rejects, Caro responded further to the criticism, saying \\"Firstly, I resist the idea that you tell somebody who can tell what story. That sounds a little bit like censorship to me. An artist will express themselves, and the burden of responsibility is on the art. That will be judged ‚Äî and should be judged. The other side of it is that more diverse people need to be allowed to tell stories. That‚Äôs what it comes down to. The people who are hired for all kinds of stories need to be more diverse. It can‚Äôt just be white people being hired to make movies, no matter what the subject matter is. Our culture is going to be richer for the more diversity there is, and the art, the movies, the television, it will be better. The more this conversation is being had, the more that diverse artists are given opportunities.\\"  Filming in Xinjiang  Criticism has also been directed at the fact that filming took place in the province of Xinjiang, where internment camps containing up to a million ethnically Turkic citizens are located. At the end of the credits, the film gives special thanks to several government entities in Xinjiang, including the now-sanctioned Xinjiang Public Security Bureau in Turpan, which operates the internment camps, and several local committees of the Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party. The public security bureau in Turpan was added to the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security's \\"Entity List\\" in October 2019. According to Reuters, after the controversy about the film's links with the Xinjiang erupted overseas, the Chinese government ordered media outlets not to cover the release of Mulan. At a September 10 conference, Disney CFO Christine McCarthy said in response to the controversy that \\"almost the entirety\\" of the film had been shot in New Zealand, but that 20 Chinese locations were used to \\"accurately depict some of the unique landscape and geography of the country\\". US Senator Josh Hawley sent a letter to Disney CEO Bob Chapek asking, among other things, for clarification on Chinese government involvement in the film. The Human Rights Foundation also sent a letter to Chapek asking Disney to condemn human rights violations and consider donating some of the film's earnings to promote human rights in Xinjiang.https://variety.com/2020/film/news/disney-mulan-credits- xinjiang-explanation-1234798833/https://ew.com/movies/disney-defends-mulan- filming-in-china/ On October 7, 2020 Iain Duncan Smith sent the email to Disney criticize the filming in Xinjiang with Disney defending it by saying ‚ÄúIt is standard practice across the film industry worldwide to acknowledge in a film‚Äôs credits the cooperation, approvals, and assistance provided by various entities and individuals over the course of a film‚Äôs production.\\" Which lead towards backlashed by Iain saying that \\"Disney's corporate policy does not appear to care about the human rights issues.\\" on Twitter. == Reception ==  PVOD sales  Variety estimated Mulan would need to be rented by about 8.4 million subscribers (13.8%) in order to break-even. On the weekend of the film's release, the Disney+ app was downloaded 68% more than the past weeks' total, similar to the 72% spike upon Hamiltons release that July. Deadline Hollywood reported that industry sources with knowledge of the situation \\"are figuring that Disney may not have earned great presales\\" and that they could put Mulan on a third party service before the December release. However, following the film's opening weekend, Business Insider reported it had been viewed by 1.12 million households (only including users renting with TV-connected devices), which would result in $33.5 million in sales for Disney. Yahoo! Finance then reported that, according to analytics research firm 7Park Data, nearly 29% of U.S. Disney+ subscribers that accessed the app from September 1 to 12 purchased Mulan, which in the best-case scenario would result in $261 million for Disney. However, IndieWire estimated the $261 million figure was unlikely, since Disney would have likely touted it. 7Park Data co-founder Brian Lichtenberger stated Yahoo! Finance overestimated Mulan's revenue, as their figures were for accounts active during that period and not the total subscriber base, and clarified that 10.3% of all accounts purchased the film, with U.S. revenue estimated to be $62‚Äì93 million; Yahoo! Finance amended their article to reflect this. According to Nielsen ratings, Mulan was one of the top ten most-watched streams in the United States between August 31 and September 6, 2020. During its opening weekend between September 4‚Äì6, Mulan drew streaming minutes in the United States. In its first weekend of being available on other digital platforms, Mulan was the top-rented film on FandangoNow, and third on both Apple TV and Google Play. In its second weekend in the open market, the film placed second at Fandango, fourth on GooglePlay, and fifth at AppleTV.  Box office  Mulan grossed $5.9 million from nine countries in its international opening weekend, including $1.2 million in Thailand and $700,000 in Singapore, both of which were the highest debuts of 2020 in the respective countries. It also made $800,000 in both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. In its second weekend the film made $29.1 million from 17 countries, including $1.8 million in Russia and finishing first in Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and South Africa. Through three weekends the film had grossed $57 million internationally. The film made $23.2 million on its opening weekend in China, a low figure but a 23% improvement upon Aladdins debut the year before. Several factors, such as the film only receiving an official Chinese release date days before, giving little chance to build a strong marketing campaign, the film's Disney+ digital release resulting in pirated copies online, a lack of local press coverage due to the film being partially shot in the controversial Xinjiang region and to avoid drawing attention to the political controversies surrounding the film, as well as low reception from fans on sites such as Maoyan and Douban, were cited as contributing to the film's muted performance. The film fell 72% in its second weekend in the country to $6.5 million.  Critical response  , on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film had an approval rating of 74% based on 284 reviews, with an average rating of 6.80/10. The site's critical consensus read, \\"It could have told its classic story with greater depth, but the live-action Mulan is a visual marvel that serves as a stirring update to its animated predecessor.\\" , on Metacritic, the film had a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a- half out of four stars, praising the \\"fine cast, exciting action and spectacular visuals\\" and writing, \\"This is such a great-looking film, with amazing set pieces and dazzling action and colors so vibrant they would dazzle a Crayola factory, it will still play well on your home monitor. There are so many gorgeous shades of orange and magenta, blue and yellow, it‚Äôs as if we‚Äôre seeing these colors for the first time.\\" Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave the film a \\"B+\\", calling it a \\"remarkable action epic that carves its own path\\" and wrote, \\"Mulan is perhaps the best example of how to marry the original with something fresh. 'The Ballad of Mulan' has always been an epic-scale story about the power of being yourself in a world not ready to accept that, a tale that will likely always have resonance.\\" Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+ and described it as \\"a classic hero(ine)'s tale, exhilarating in its elaborate set pieces and large-scale ambitions even when the smaller human story within it sometimes falls short.\\" Writing for Variety, Peter Debruge said, \\"On one hand, the result isn't immediately recognizable as 'a Disney movie,' but neither does it establish its own narrative or visual signature, the way Tarantino did when remixing Asian influences for Kill Bill. This is pure pastiche, as Caro and her crew shamelessly pilfer from kung fu, Fifth Generation and Hong Kong action movies, incorporating anime and Bollywood touches as well.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \\"Mulan is a spirit lifter, and though it doesn‚Äôt arrive as planned, it could not arrive at a better time\\", saying \\"Throughout Mulan, there are shots of such visual splendor that viewers will catch their breath. In one, the morning mist clears and reveals an army in the distance, with its flags and colors, a frightening yet strangely beautiful sight.\\" Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Mulan is a heroic muddle, one that elicits both a disappointed sigh and an appreciative nod. It lays down a marker of progress achieved and progress to come.\\"  Chinese audiences' criticism  Mulan has been met with bad press and poor reviews from Chinese audiences. The film scored 4.7 out of 10 on the rating site Douban. Reviewers on Douban contended that the film had flat characters and a bland story with details that do not make sense. Many people also appeared unsatisfied with how the film handles certain Chinese cultural elements. One of the more common complaints about the film is its treatment of qi. Qi is a traditional idea in martial arts and Chinese medicine concerning a person's energy flow. But in Mulan, qi becomes a magical power that the eponymous heroine possesses. That power is limited by dishonesty, though, keeping Mulan from realising her full potential until she strips away her disguise as a man. Other Chinese viewers complained about some of the characters' make-up, saying that it reflects Western stereotypes of China, rather than being a reflection of actual Chinese culture. Yanni Chow and Carol Mang of Reuters wrote that the film had \\"a lacklustre reception in Hong Kong\\" amidst calls from pro-democracy activists for a boycott. ==References* Category:2020s action drama films Category:2020s fantasy films Category:2020s feminist films Category:2019 controversies Category:2020 controversies Category:American action adventure films Category:American action films Category:American adventure films Category:American fantasy adventure films Category:American film remakes Category:American films Category:American martial arts films Category:American war films Category:Cross-dressing in American films Category:Disney film remakes Category:Disney+ original films Category:English-language films Category:Film remakes Category:Films about sexism Category:Films about witchcraft Category:Films based on adaptations Category:Films based on multiple works Category:Films directed by Niki Caro Category:Films postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Films scored by Harry Gregson-Williams Category:Films set in Imperial China Category:Films shot in China Category:Films shot in New Zealand Category:Films with screenplays by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver Category:Mulan (franchise) Category:Period action films Category:Walt Disney Pictures films Category:War adventure films ","title":"Mulan (2020 film)"},{"id":"46323582","text":"Actors (original title: Les Acteurs) is a 2000 French comedy film directed by Bertrand Blier. ==Plot== A collection of portraits of actors (exclusively men, with the exception of Josiane Balasko interpreting Andr√© Dussollier) who meet and tell their stories in a more or less structured manner.

The festival was founded in 2010 by Jeff Monser, an artist and screen printing shop owner. It is held at the Monterey County Fairgrounds in Monterey, California which was previously home of the Monterey Pop Festival where Jimi Hendrix set his guitar on fire in 1967. In its first year, the festival began as a one-day event headlining the Dirty Heads and Tribal Seeds. Today, The California Roots Festival has grown enormously in both size and attendance. It is organized over three full days with more than 11,000 attendees each day. It is described as the largest reggae-rock festival in the world and claims to one of the largest reggae festivals in the United States. ==History== Jeff Monser created the California Roots Music and Arts Festival with the idea of integrating reggae style music with live art experiences. The first versions were small one-day live music events with local attendance and mostly limited to bands drawn from a limited geographic area. Three years later, Dan Sheehan joined as a co-founder of the festival when Monser realized he needed a business partner experienced in both management and production in order for the festival to grow. Sheenan was able to lay the groundwork for managing logistics and securing major reggae acts in order to play at the festival. These changes enabled this one-day music event to evolve into its current three-day form. Together, Monser and Sheenan were able to merge their music and business backgrounds to work together to construct one of the largest reggae and reggae-rock music festival in the world. ==Festival Organization== The current festival involves curated lineups of live music, interactive art on stage, and engagement of a variety of events related to the practice and celebration of reggae culture over three days. The festival also works closely with pairs with non-profit organizations to raise funds for causes that align with the brand of Cali Roots.

The antennular plate bears two large, widely separated spines. The maximum length of this spiny lobster is about but a more normal length is . The body color is purplish-black, heavily marked with conspicuous round white spots. The main leg segments are dark and spotted with white, but the penultimate leg segments have dark, longitudinal stripes on a pale background. ==Distribution and habitat== Panulirus guttatus is native to the tropical western Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea but it also extends into the Gulf of Mexico. Its range extends from Bermuda, the Bahamas, southern Florida and the West Indies, to Cura√ßao, Bonaire, Los Roques and Suriname. It is found on rocky reefs in shallow water, at depths down to about , often hiding in crevices or under large coral heads. During the daylight hours they are in the coral reefs and while at nighttime the animals move away from the protective sites to feed on food along the ocean floor. ==Ecology== Panulirus guttatus is nocturnal and feeds on bivalve molluscs, gastropod molluscs, crustaceans and chitons which it finds by touch and with chemical cues. In Bermuda, breeding takes place from May to October, but in the warmer parts of its range, Panulirus guttatus breeds throughout the year. After mating, the female carries the eggs on her abdomen held under her tail. When ready to release the eggs, she migrates to the reef crest and their release is usually followed by moulting. The larvae have a very long developmental period and are planktonic at first, before becoming \\"pueruli\\" larvae, a transitional phase between planktonic larvae and benthic juveniles. They settle on the outermost shallow reef edges where there is vigorous water movement. ==Uses== There is no specific fishery for this species although it is caught incidentally when targeting other species, either by hand, with a spear or in traps. It is mostly marketed locally and eaten fresh. ==Status== Panulirus guttatus is a common species and has a wide range. It is not currently the subject of commercial fishing on any great scale but may become so as the Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) populations decline. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". ==References * Category:Achelata Category:Arthropods of the Dominican Republic Category:Crustaceans of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Edible crustaceans Category:Crustaceans described in 1804 ","title":"Panulirus guttatus"},{"id":"46323877","text":"Edward Moss (born 9 June 1988) is an international footballer from the British Virgin Islands, who plays as a midfielder for the British Virgin Islands national football team and the L.A.

The workfare scheme whereby unemployed people must work in return for state unemployment benefits was introduced during a time of particularly high youth unemployed in the United Kingdom. As a mandatory scheme, claimants were sanctioned if they failed to meet the requirements of the scheme. The scheme differed from other workfare schemes which are generally aimed at the long term unemployed as claimants were forced onto the scheme immediately or soon after making a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance if they \\"had not previously completed six months of paid employment since leaving full time education\\".

The two episodes focus on the group of Twilight Sparkle and her friends as they visit a village controlled by Starlight Glimmer, a unicorn who strives to achieve \\"equality\\" amongst all ponies by removing their cutie marks. Both episodes were written by Scott Sonneborn and M.A. Larson from a story by Meghan McCarthy. It is directed by Jayson Thiessen and co-directed by Jim Miller with Stephen Davis, Kirsten Newlands, and Sarah Wall as executive producers alongside Devon Cody as producer. It was first broadcast on Discovery Family on April 4, 2015, with both parts airing as an hour-long event. ==Plot== Part one At Twilight Sparkle's new castle, she and her friends sit on their respective thrones and unwittingly activate a holographic map of Equestria, with floating images of their cutie marks pointing to a remote location on it. Deciding to investigate, the six friends follow the map to find a utopian village of ponies who share the same cutie mark, a black equals sign. The six become wary of the villagers' exaggerated smiles and overly welcoming nature, except for Fluttershy, who is charmed by their courtesy. The six meet the village's leader, Starlight Glimmer, who explains that all the villagers have given up their cutie marks under her philosophy that differing talents and opinions cause strife between friends. Starlight encourages the six to remain and experience the village life, expecting for the rest of Equestria to follow her example. The six friends later argue over their purpose for coming to the village, which attracts the attention of Sugar Belle, a baker who regrets giving up her baking talent. Sugar Belle is perplexed when the six are able to set their argument aside, and asks to see them in private. The six meet with her alongside two other villagers, Party Favor and Night Glider, who express eager curiosity over the six's cutie marks and friendship. Desiring to have their original marks again, the villagers inform the six of a cavern vault where their marks are stored alongside a mystical staff called the Staff of Sameness that, according to Starlight, grants her the ability to remove a pony's mark. Starlight leads the six to the vault, where the six become surrounded by the other villagers as Starlight forcibly removes their cutie marks with the staff. Part two Without their cutie marks, the six are trapped in a village prison chamber to be resocialized. Realizing they can escape by convincing Starlight they have conformed to her ways, the group sends Fluttershy to act the part. Fluttershy is successfully welcomed into the community, while Starlight punishes Party Favor to be imprisoned with the other five after he \\"confesses\\" to helping them alone, protecting Sugar Belle and Night Glider. Fluttershy later spies on Starlight to find she has sent Double Diamond to collect the six friends' cutie marks, with larger plans for Twilight's mark. She then sees Starlight accidentally splashing water over herself, washing off her own equal mark to reveal her real, unremoved mark. When Starlight releases the five friends and Party Favor the next day, Fluttershy splashes water on Starlight to reveal her real mark to the villagers. Starlight confesses that she removed the ponies' marks with her own magic, and that the Staff of Sameness is worthless. The villagers revolt and reclaim their original cutie marks from the vault, while Starlight flees into the mountains with the six friends' marks. With the six hindered by their equalized abilities, Double Diamond, Party Favor, Sugar Belle, and Night Glider pursue Starlight and are able to recover the six marks using their own unique abilities. Starlight vanishes into the mountain caves while the villagers thank the six friends for helping them regain their individuality. The six later sense the map calling them through their cutie marks, determining that they have completed their work to bring friendship to the village. ==Production and promotion== An animatic for this episode was first shown at San Diego Comic-Con International on July 25, 2014, and was later released as part of the \\"2014 San Diego Comic-Con My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic Panel\\" bonus feature on the Season Four Disc 4 DVD. Some scenes from this episode were teased in Rainbow Dash's and Rarity's season 5 recap videos. On March 14, 2015, Discovery Family's \\"Pony Day\\" was announced; it included a six back-to-back season 4 episode marathon leading up to the two-part season five premiere, followed by the premiere of the 1986 film My Little Pony: The Movie. Under the approval of Discovery Family and Hasbro, BABSCon showed the entire two-part season five premiere commercial-free on the same day as it premiered on the east coast of the United States on April 4, 2015. The map was designed by Rebecca Dart. Directors Jayson Thiessen and Jim Miller along with art director Rebecca Dart and prop designer Charmaine Verhagen came up with the design for the Staff of Sameness; Miller denied that it was inspired by the Spear of Longinus from the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. ==Broadcast and reception== Both parts of \\"The Cutie Map\\" aired back-to-back on Discovery Family as an hour long event on April 4, 2015. Part 1 of the premiere was viewed by 509,000 viewers and Part 2 was viewed by 574,000 viewers. According to the Nielsen household ratings, both parts were watched by approximately 0.3 percent of American households. Daniel Alvarez on Unleash the Fanboy gave the premiere a 9 out of 10, praising the general writing of the episodes, the moral, and Princess Twilight. He also considered Starlight Glimmer a \\"great antagonist\\". Brandon Morse of The Federalist stated that the episode was a counter argument to the equality movement. In 2016, the episodes were jointly nominated for the Hugo Award for \\"Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form)\\". Actor Billy Bob Thornton praised the episode during an interview with GQ: ==Home media release== Under the title \\"Cutie Markless\\", the two-part season five premiere was part of the \\"Cutie Mark Quests\\" DVD which was released on June 30, 2015, release alongside \\"The Show Stoppers\\" (Season 1, Episode 18) and the two-part season two premiere episode \\"The Return of Harmony\\" (Season 2, Episode 1 and 2).

Miniature from Psalter of Bonne de Luxembourg, Jean le Noir, c. 1348‚Äì49, New York, The Cloisters, Inv. 69. 86. (12.5 x 8.4 x 3.9 cm) 280px The Psalter of Bonne de Luxembourg is a small 14th-century illuminated manuscript in tempera, grisaille, ink and gold leaf on vellum.\\"Psalter and Hours of Bonne of Luxembourg, Duchess of Normandy\\". Metropolitan Museum, New York. Retrieved 5 April 2105. It is held in the collection of The Cloisters, New York, where it is usually on display. The book was probably commissioned for Bonne de Luxembourg, Duchess of Normandy, daughter of John the Blind and the wife of John II of France, probably at the end of her husband's life, c 1348-49. At the time illuminated manuscripts could compete with monastic scriptoria and panel painting as commercially attractive donor portraits. Bonne de Luxembourg died of plague in 1349. It consists of 333 pages of parchment, each measuring 126 x 88 mm. The illustrations are attributed to the miniaturist Jean Le Noir, and include graphic representations of astrological predictions by the roman writer Manilius. ==Commission== Bonne of Luxembourg with her husband Jean The book was commissioned for Jutta of Luxembourg, the second daughter of John the Blind, king of Bohemia, and his first wife, Elisabeth of Bohemia, the intended first wife of King John II of France. Bonne died young, before she assumed position as Queen of France. However she was mother to Charles V and his brother Jean, duc de Berry. Her arms, showing Luxembourg impaled with Valois, decorate the lower border of the pages. The ornate linings contain a variety of flora and bird species. Jean Le Noir is credited with executing the best- known pages; a crucifixion scene, a double page Memento mori, The Three Living and the Three Dead, and a representation of a highly placed courtier held back by a fool. The work as a whole is noted for its preoccupation with death and its implications thereof. The artist most associated with the manuscript is Jean Le Noir, active in Paris between 1335 and 1375. Other hands include members of his workshop and possibly his daughter, Bourgot.Walther, 218 The style seems influenced by Jean Pucelle.\\"Psalter and Hours of Bonne de Luxembourg, Duchess of Normandy, before 1349\\". Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. Retrieved 05 April 2015 ==Description== The Fool Hath said in his heart, There is no God, folio 83v The illustrations are characterised by unusually skilled handling of line, silhouette, and the realistic modeling of the figures. It begins ordinarily enough with a calendar showing traditional scenes of farm labourers and zodiac signs. The main body of the book consists of illustrations of the Psalms. The final pages include unusual miniatures illustrating prayers, including folio 315, a representation of Divine Love Enthroned. The choice of iconographical elements and themes are unusually dark, specific, and thought to have originated by request from Jutta, who died thereafter. Crucifixion A crucifixion scene shows two kneeling figures before the crucified Christ. He lays his hands directly on His wounds, described in the accompanying text. In this way he is depicted as a self-sacrificing God, and is painted in a very naturalistic, human manner. It is on this basis dated to just before her death in 1349, a period when the Black Death was beginning to ravage Europe. The passages in the manuscript depict the suffering caused by this new plague, and have been described as of \\"incredible intensity\\". The most acclaimed two leaves illustrate the Two Fools and the Three Living and the Three Dead, an allegory of transience and reminder to the viewer of their mortality. This double miniature is one of the first such allegories to appear in northern European art, and seems influenced by the French poets Baudouin de Cond√© and Nicolas de Margival. The first page depicts three young courtiers who happen across a cemetery, to find three corpses at varying degrees of decomposition. The dead mock the young men's superficial outlook, and in what was to become a classic motif of Memento mori, the accompanying text urges reflection by asking \\"What you are, we once were; what we are, you will be.\\"Walther, 219 The page margins contain at least two hundred birds of around forty species, mostly depicted three-eights of an inch or less in size. Most were well and minutely described from life and identifiable; the leaves feature miniature depictions sparrows, finches, larks, among others; some depictions are either fanciful or to badly drawn or indistinct to believe as from life.Vauri, 279 The treatment of the birds is so consistent it has been suggested that they were designed by a single hand, although with the weaker examples, he had perhaps been accompanied by a less familiar assistant.Vauri, 280 The page illustrating Psalm 53, The Fool Hath said in his heart, There is no God, shows a man drinking from a chalice, a typical attribute of the fool, signifying drunkenness. He is held back by another man who holds his long hood and beats him. This second character probably comes from the tradition of depicting the fool as a yokel or madman clutching a cudgel.Gifford, D. J. \\"Iconographical Notes towards a Definition of the Medieval Fool,\\" Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 37 (1974): pp. 336‚Äì42 The first fool has variously been identified as a drunkard, a monk, and Archbishop Baldwin of Luxembourg. A contemporary viewer would have likely recognised him as a Jew.The fool as a monk is found in the J√©rome Pichon sales catalog of 1897. W.G. Land's \\"The Prayer Book of Bonne of Luxembourg: A Personal Document\\" (1980) proposed Archbishop Baldwin. He is identified as a Jew in Mellinkoff (Outcasts, vol. 1). Avril (Manuscript Painting at the Court of France: The Fourteenth Century (1978)) and Sterling (La Peinture m√©di√©vale √† Paris, 1300‚Äì1500, vol. 2 (1990)) also see him as a Jew, or an \\"expression of anti- Judaism\\". Both men contain elements of the grotesque, and are executed in grisaille against a deep blue background. The bas-de-page contains two lions gnawing at the Bonne of Luxembourg coat-of-arms.Walther, 219 Psalter of Bonne de Luxembourg.jpgThe Three Living and the Three Dead, folio 322r File:Psalter of Bonne de Luxembourg6.jpgFolio File:Psalter of Bonne de Luxembourg4.jpgFolio ==References== Notes Bibliography * Deuchler, Florens. \\"Looking at Bonne of Luxembourg's Prayer Book\\".

It was contested over eight rounds, starting on 12 April at Motorland Arag√≥n and ending on 4 October at Magny Cours. Starting in 2015 there was a \\"Women's European Cup\\" for female riders aged between 14 and 23 years. The upper age limit was also increased to 21 for males. With five victories, Spanish rider Javier Orellana claimed the championship title with a round to spare, ultimately finishing fifty-six points clear of his next closest competitor, Paolo Grassia of Italy. Grassia prevailed in a three-rider contest for the runner-up position at the final round at Magny-Cours; his fifth-place finish saw him take the position by three points from France's Guillaume Raymond. Both riders finished on the podium three times, but did not claim a victory. Italian duo Emanuele Pusceddu and Giuseppe De Gruttola each won on home soil at Imola and Misano, while Spain's Xavi Pinsach won on a one-off appearance at Jerez. Six wins from the eight races was enough for New Zealand's Avalon Biddle to win the Women's European Cup ‚Äì again with a round to spare ‚Äì by fifty-four points ahead of Anastassia Kovalenko. The only other rider to win was Hungarian rider Vikt√≥ria Kis, who won back-to-back races at Assen and Imola. ==Entry list== {  style=\\"font-size: 85%\\" - ! No. ! Rider !

Case was the son of Walter and Ethel Case. His father was a newspaperman, and his mother was a driving force in the Long Beach Community Players. He attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School and first worked as an announcer on the school's radio station. One of his early ventures into entertainment came when \\"as a youngster in Long Beach, he sang and played the uke for a band called the Sunset Symphonic Six.\\" He was a graduate of the College of William & Mary, in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he met his future wife. Although Case was best known for being an announcer on popular radio and television programs (in 1953, he was \\"on radio 20 times a week, on TV three\\" ), a 1941 newspaper article noted that he \\"covered everything from news and special events to sports.\\" His assignments included \\"Miss America pageants ... Davis Cup tennis matches and presidential inaugurations.\\" One of his more unusual assignments came February 6, 1936, when he described a simulated air attack on New York City. With United States Army planes in the roles of bombers and defenders, Case flew in a plane to \\"describe the combat from the air. He [was] attached to the 'defense' squadron ...\\" ==Career== Early years Case's career as a professional entertainer began when, at 15, he was a pianist at radio station KFON in Long Beach, California. At 16, he started an orchestra and performed with it over KFON. In 1927, he moved to KGER (also in Long Beach) as an announcer and singer.Sies, Luther F. (2014). Encyclopedia of American Radio, 1920‚Äì1960, 2nd Edition, Volume 1. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 120. He also worked at KFI, KFWB, and KGFJ in Los Angeles. Even after taking a position at a network, Case had a weekly program \\"for his baritone solo work\\" on KGO in San Francisco. In 1931, Case was listed as \\"announcer and singer with the Pacific vagabonds\\" on an afternoon program on WJZ-NBC. Network radio Case joined NBC in 1931 as an announcer in San Francisco. In 1934, he moved to New York City to be on the NBC staff there. During his years on network radio the programs he announced for included Criminal Casebook, The Story of Mary Marlin, Marriage Club, Inc., The Lanny Ross Show, Against The Storm, Lone Journey, Charlie and Jessie, Crime Doctor, Great Moments From Great Plays, N.T.G. and His Girls, Ask-It- Basket, Wheatenaville, Johnny Presents, Hercule Poirot, Lowell Thomas Show, The Ford Theater,Alicoate, Jack, Ed.

Later years In 1962, Case was one of six people forming Metroscope, a service that furnished recorded commentaries to local radio stations. Style Case became was what he called \\"a soft sell announcer,\\" using a natural, conversational delivery that he said was \\"the opposite of the shouting, hammering type.\\" Early in his career, he responded to a newspaper's questionnaire by writing, in part: > The days when a program was introduced by stentorian blasts from the > announcer are over. Nowadays he tries to be pleasant, cordial and friendly > with his chatter .. both in introducing musical numbers and in giving > commercial announcements. A newspaper columnist wrote, \\"[H]e broadcasts a feeling of sincerity unlike anyone else and his personality is broadcast to the listener and viewer who gets a feeling, 'Now, there's a guy I can trust.'\\" Military Case was active in the Civil Air Patrol, being promoted to Flight commander in 1942. At one point he filled in for a sick colleague on a radio broadcast, hurried to Roosevelt Field to practice maneuvers with the CAP, then dashed back to the studio for a rehearsal and broadcast. During World War II, Case was an aviator in the United States Navy for three years. He later was a Lieutenant Commander in the United States Navy Reserve. ==Professional organizations== In 1932, Case was elected president of a group of announcers \\"within the NBC headquarters in San Francisco.\\" A news brief noted, \\"Association officials say that they are not organized as a union but are merely grouped together to ask the network for a raise in salaries when they are given spot announcements to make.\\" Later, in New York, organization became more official and Case became more involved. In 1947, he was elected to a one-year term on the board of directors of the American Federation of Radio Artists' New York local. In 1948, he was elected president of the New York local and a vice-president of AFRA at the national level. For 1949, he was re-elected to the New York local board and re-elected president of the local. ==Hobbies== Case enjoyed writing fiction and composing music. He also was described as \\"a great record fan.\\" When he bought a high fidelity sound system, he bought 130 LP records to play on it. He accumulated \\"such a tremendous collection of jazz records that record companies, compiling albums of old-time jazz, often do their research in his library.\\" He was also a writer. In 1952, he wrote a book, History of the Brooklyn Dodgers. In 1953, his article, \\"Can TV Commercials Be Improved?,\\" was published in Academy Magazine. In the 1960s, Case and his wife lived on an 84-acre farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where he raised Angus cattle as a hobby. ==Family== Case married Sarah Lee, a descendant of Robert E. Lee and Ethan Allen. They had a daughter, Virginia Lee, and a son, Nelson, Jr. They were divorced in 1947. His second marriage, on September 5, 1947, was to Nondas Metcalfe, an actress and writer. They moved to New Hope, Pennsylvania, in 1958 and still made their home there when he died. ==Death== Case died of a heart attack March 23, 1976, in Doylestown Hospital in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.

The military classification was Grandes Raids (G.R.) (English: major flights). It was a wooden single bay sesquiplane with strongly outward leaning interplane struts. A tandem pair of inverse V-form cabane struts supported the upper wing over the fuselage. In plan both upper and lower fabric covered wings were rectangular apart from angled tips and a semi-circular cut-out in the upper trailing edge to improve the pilot's upward view. The lower wings were almost a 63% scaled copy of the upper ones, with the same aspect ratio. There were ailerons on the upper wings only. The four different versions had engines of three different configurations, two water- cooled V-12 engines and two radial engines, one a single row nine cylinder, air-cooled unit and the other an eighteen-cylinder, water-cooled in-line radial engine. Although they were all in the power range, their layouts required very different cowlings and resulted in a range of lengths. Otherwise the C.101-7 variants all had the same dimensions, though the weights varied. They all were fitted with two way radio and had generous fuel capacity for a good range; the tank of the C.103 at least could be released in an emergency to prevent it catching fire. The pilot's open cockpit was under the wing cut- out; the observer sat close behind in a cockpit equipped with twin machine guns on a Scarff ring type mounting. The fin of the C.101 was triangular and broad chord and the rudder had a straight, vertical edge which extended down to the keel. As the rectangular plan tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage, the balanced, overhung elevators had a cut-out for rudder movement. The C.101 had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, with its mainwheels on a single axle which was sprung from V-form struts. The Caudron C.101 was probably first flown in the first half of 1925 as test pilot B√©cheler completed its official testing in that August. Even though the output of the Salmson engine, the most powerful of the set, was 19% more than that of the Gnome-Rh√¥ne, the maximum speed at ground level of the C.107 was only 4% more than that of the C.104. The two V-12 engines in the C.101 and C.103 produced speeds of and respectively, the former faster than the more powerful C.107 and the latter only slightly faster than the lowest powered C.104. The Caudron C.104 was displayed at the 10th Paris Salon in December 1926. As well as the observer's guns, visible in images of the C.101, C.104 and drawings of the C.107, two more machine gun positions were noted: one fixed, forward firing synchronised pair controlled by the pilot and another single gun aimed by the observer through his cockpit floor. There was internal provision for twelve bombs. Since these arms were required by the military specification, they were probably shared by the other variants. The number of airframes built is not certain; there is only photographic evidence of the C.101 and C.104 and these may have shared the same airframe. Only the C.101 appeared, as F-ESAI, on the French civil aircraft register. ==Variants== Caudron C.107 photo from L'A√©ronautique December,1926 Data from Hauet (2001) pp. 194‚Äì5 ;Caudron C.101: Hispano-Suiza 12H upright water-cooled V-12.

The building would have surpassed all other skyscrapers on the island by floor-count. Upon completion, it would either have been the fifth or sixth tallest building in New York City. ==History== The development was one of many allowed by rezoning of the Special Hudson Yards District in 2005. Other projects include the Hudson Yards redevelopment by Related. Early reports indicated the site would host two distinct towers of differing heights. Later, the plans for the site were changed to two sixty-story towers connected horizontally at the roof, designed by Oppenheimer Architecture. Current plans, first released in July 2014, call for a single tower. Silverstein reportedly paid $100 million for the construction site, and entered into contract with a Mercedes Benz dealership, then the owner, in 2011. As of July 2015, work appears to have begun on the project site, with the dealership undergoing demolition. However, despite the activity at the site, no plans for the building have been filed with the city. Construction was tentatively scheduled to begin in 2017, and was expected to conclude in 2020. Although the development neighbors other structures such as the Silver Towers and Sky, the building faced some opposition from residents in the community, who requested the building's height be reduced. New plans were filed for the site in 2017. The new plans include a residential tower and a commercial tower, with a total of 1.6 million square feet between the two. ==Usage== The building will include of ground-level retail space, of office space. It will also include hotel rooms and 1400 apartments. Of the 1400 planned apartments, 280 will be designated as affordable. If completed as planned, the building will contain more apartments than all other super tall buildings in New York City combined, as most super tall developments, such as One57, 111 West 57th Street, and 432 Park Avenue, tend to contain relatively few expensive apartments. ==See also== *List of tallest buildings in New York City ==References * Developer's Site * 520 West 41st Street at NY Yimby Category:Skyscrapers in Manhattan Category:Proposed buildings and structures in New York City Category:Hudson Yards, Manhattan ","title":"520 West 41st Street"},{"id":"46324189","text":"Jovan A.

Jugoviƒá remained in charge of the balloon squadron until 1 March 1916, when he was transferred to the newly formed Serbian Air Force. Over the next two years, he flew combat missions over Bulgarian-occupied Macedonia in a French-made biplane. By the end of World War I, he had recorded three kills and earned the rank of captain. After the war, he held several senior positions in the newly formed Royal Yugoslav Air Force. In September 1926, Jugoviƒá accompanied a Yugoslav delegation on a good-will mission to Czechoslovakia.

B., Jenkins, F. A., & Shubin, N. H. (2008). The cranial endoskeleton of Tiktaalik roseae. Nature, 455(7215), 925-929. The complete transition occurred over a period of 25 million years beginning with the tetrapodomorph diversification in the Middle Devonian (380 myr).Long, J. A., & Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‚ÄêTetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719. By the Upper Devonian period, the fin-limb transition as well as other skeletal changes such as gill arch reduction, opercular series loss, mid-line fin loss, and scale reduction were already completed in many aquatic organisms.Coates, M.I., Jeffery, J.E., & Ruta, M. (2002). Fins to limbs:what the fossils say. Evolution and Development 4(5), 390‚Äì396. doi:10.1046/j.1525-142X.2002.02026.x As aquatic tetrapods began their transition to land, several skeletal changes are thought to have occurred to allow for movement and respiration on land. Some adaptations required to adjust to non-aquatic life include the movement and use of alternating limbs, the use of pelvic appendages as sturdy propulsors, and the use of a solid surface at the organism's base to generate propulsive force required for walking.King, H.M., Shubin, N.H., Coates, M.I., & Hale, M.E. (2011). Behavioral evidence for the evolution of walking and bounding before terrestriality in sarcopterygian fishes. PNAS 108(52), 21146-21151. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1118669109 ==Head==  Head changes in Osteichthyes  Restoration of Osteolepis The Osteolepiformes and Elpistostegalia are two crown groups of rhipidistians with respect to the tetrapods. The development of skull roof and cheekbone patterns in these organisms match those found in the first tetrapods. Palatal and nasal skeletal features like choanae are present in these groups and are also observed in modern amphibians. This indicates that incipient air breathing was developed, as well as modification of the hyoid arch towards stapes development.Clack, J. A. (2002). A revised reconstruction of the dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(02), 163-165. These characteristics account for why osteichthyans are accepted as the sister group of tetrapods. The elpistostegalid fish are considered the most apomorphic of fish in comparison to tetrapods. From well-preserved fossils, it is observed that they share a paltybasic skull with eye ridges, and external nares situated on the margin of the mouth. Development of eye ridges and flatting of the skull are also observed in primitive fossil amphibians and reptiles. The most likely reason for the traits to be adaptive was for their use in aerial vision above the waterline. The traits enabled animals to check area on land for safe spots if being chased by a predator in water, as well as being useful for searching for prey items above the water. The water-based lateral line system was used substantially by these aquatic tetrapods to detect danger from predators. Within the Osteichthyan diversification, there were no changes related to respiration in the transition as can be seen by the nasal region and palatal morphology in elpistostegalid fishes. The primary change from basic ostelepiform ancestors to the first elpistostegalid in the middle Devonian was to the pre-existing roof skulls.LONG, J. A. (1990). Heterochrony and the origin of tetrapods. Lethaia, 23(2), 157-166.  Head changes in prototetrapod  Restoration of Elginerpeton In Elginerpeton pancheni, a prototetrapod from the late Frasnian, basic tetrapod characteristics in the lower jaw and the cranium are observed. The taxon is believed to fill the gap between elpistostegalid fishes and well-preserved Devonian tetrapods. The Elginerpeton is considered more derived than the elpistostegalid fishes due to presence of paired fangs on the parasymphysial toothplate, a slender shaped anterior coronoid, and in the loss of the intracranial joint and coronoid fossa.Ahlberg, P. E., & Clack, J. A. (1998). Lower jaws, lower tetrapods‚Äìa review based on the Devonian genus Acanthostega. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Earth Sciences, 89(01), 11-46. The loss of the intercranial joint was a direct functional necessity to strengthen the broad and long platybasic skull when the animal was out of the water. The tubular lower jaw of the Elginerpeton, compared to the flat-lamina jaw shape of fishes gave it superior cross-sectional force, required when not supported in an aquatic setting ‚Äì allowing for opening of the mouth outside of water. The adaptation may also be interpreted as a specialization for buccopharyngeal breathing. It is speculated to be the first step towards aerial respiration in the transition from fish to tetrapod.  Head changes in aquatic tetrapods  Restoration of Acanthostega In the tetrapod and higher clades from the lower-middle Famennian there are several defining changes on the basis of anatomy of Ichthyostega, Tulerpeton, and Acanthostega. In the cranium, there is a stapes derived from the hyomandibular of fishes; a single bilateral pair of nasal bones, and a fenestra ovalis in the otic capsule of the braincase.Lebedev, O. A., & Coates, M. I. (1995). The postcranial skeleton of the Devonian tetrapod Tulerpeton curtum Lebedev. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 114(3), 307-348. The opening of the otic wall of the braincase can be considered a paedomorphic feature for tetrapods and is linked to the stapes functionally.Clack, J. A. (1994). Earliest known tetrapod braincase and the evolution of the stapes and fenestra ovalis. The stapes was thought to be just a structural support between the palate and the stapedial plate of the braincase. In the Acanthostega, it is likely that due to the otic capsule of the brain case being mesial to the stapedial plate, sound was picked up from the palate or the otic notch to allow for rudimentary hearing. It was able to perceive vibrations by opening its mouth by way of the palate. Other factors that caused aquatic tetrapods to spend more time on land caused the development of terrestrial hearing with the development of a tympanum within an otic notch and developed by convergent evolution at least three times.Laurin, M. (1998, March). The importance of global parsimony and historical bias in understanding tetrapod evolution. Part I. Systematics, middle ear evolution and jaw suspension. In Annales des Sciences Naturelles- Zoologie et Biologie Animale (Vol. 19, No. 1, pp. 1-42). Elsevier Masson. There was also a change in the dermal bones of the skull in the aquatic tetrapods. It involved the enlargement of the jugal, ceasing the contact of the maxilla with the squamosal and the single bilateral pair of nasal bones. The feature allows for a stronger bite as well as increasing the strength of the skull.  Teeth and feeding mechanisms  Feeding on land is a completely different task than feeding in water. Water is much more dense and viscous compared to air, causing hunting techniques adapted in water to be less successful when applied on land.Lauder, G. V. (1985). Aquatic feeding in lower vertebrates. Functional vertebrate morphology, 210-229. The main technique used in water is suction feeding and is used by most aquatic vertebrates. This technique does not function in air so animals use methods of overtaking prey with jaws followed by biting down.Bramble, D. M., Liem, K. F., & Wake, D. B. (1985). Functional vertebrate morphology (pp. 38-57). Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Transitional forms prior to fully developed terrestrial tetrapods such as Acanthostega, are thought to have captured prey in the water.Clack, J. A. (2002). The dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(01), 17-33. Large coronoid fangs are present in the fishes Eusthenopteron, Panderichthys, and Tiktaalik, and the early tetrapod, Ventasega. In Acanthostega, which is more derived, the large teeth are absent. In Eusthenopetron and Panderichthys, an ossified operculum is exhibited unlike in the Tiktaalik, Ventastega, and Acanthostega. These differences as well as reductions of the gill chamber and changes in the nature of the lower jaw are hypothesized to indicate a reduced reliance on suction feeding in early tetrapods in comparison to osteolepiform fish. This morphological data is not enough however to prove that suction feeding was less used as the morphological changes have been found in fish that use the suction feeding mechanism. Cranial sutures are indicators of skull function and morphologies can be linked to specific feeding modes.Herring, S. W., & Mucci, R. J. (1991). In vivo strain in cranial sutures: the zygomatic arch. Journal of morphology, 207(3), 225-239. Transitional feeding changes can be observed by examining cross sectional morphology of a suture in taxa of the fish-tetrapod transition.Markey, M. J., & Marshall, C. R. (2007). Terrestrial-style feeding in a very early aquatic tetrapod is supported by evidence from experimental analysis of suture morphology. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(17), 7134-7138. Comparing positionally comparable sutures in extant fish allows for the creation of a sutural morphospace.Markey, M. J., Main, R. P., & Marshall, C. R. (2006). In vivo cranial suture function and suture morphology in the extant fish Polypterus: implications for inferring skull function in living and fossil fish. Journal of Experimental Biology, 209(11), 2085‚Äì2102. The main cause of sutural deformation is caused by strain during feeding activity, most prominent with feeding mechanisms involving sucking a prey into the mouth.Markey, M. J., Main, R. P., & Marshall, C. R. (2006). In vivo cranial suture function and suture morphology in the extant fish Polypterus: implications for inferring skull function in living and fossil fish. Journal of Experimental Biology, 209(11), 2085‚Äì2102. There is a tension anteriorly, and compression posteriorly strain patterns are observed in Polypterus, a prey-sucking predator. In terrestrial tetrapod Phonerpeton, there is compression between the frontals and parietals and a complex loading between the post parietals. There is no evidence of tensile strain in any sutures. Acanthostega fossil records demonstrate that no strain pattern was exhibited that relate to prey capture by means of suction. The load compression is similar to extant tetrapods. It is most likely that the organism captured prey by biting in the water or near the edge of the water. This finding indicates that the terrestrial mode of feeding first emerged in an aquatic environment. == Neck == The cranial endoskeleton of T. roseae shares derived features with tetrapods. There was a loss of opercular and extrascapular elements, enhancing head mobility in T. roseae compared to other tetrapodomorph fish. The formation of the neck allowed for locomotion in shallow waters. This environment allows for less motility compared to the three-dimensional space that fish are able to orient themselves in. The body of the organism in these environments would be fixed in the shallow pools with appendages planted on a substrate. In the Acanthostega and Ichthyostega, which are considered to be more derived than other basal aquatic tetrapods, the pectoral girdle is decoupled from the skull. There is also a loss of the dorsal pectoral girdle bones, which permits a large degree of movement for the shoulder. This allowed for a greater degree of movement, and is a necessity for improving aquatic maneuveurs and terrestrial locomotion.Johanson, Z., Ahlberg, P., & Ritchie, A. (2003). The braincase and palate of the tetrapodomorph sarcopterygian Mandageria fairfaxi: morphological variability near the fish‚Äìtetrapod transition. Palaeontology, 46(2), 271-293. This could have been driven by the need to lift the head to aid aerial respiration by using nostrils and choanae. == Limbs == Limbs in vertebrates are occasionally organized into stylopod (relating to the humerus and femur), zeugopod (relating to the radius and tibia, along with associated structures) and autopod (relating to digits) categories, although anatomically, the evolutionary differences between these groups in early tetrapods tends to be vague.Gilbert, S.F. (2000). Development of the tetrapod limb. Developmental Biology 6. Retrieved from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9975/ The transition from fins to limbs occurred once an endoskeleton entered the base of the fin, as seen in today's lungfish.Hinchliffe, R.J. (1994). Evolutionary developmental biology of the tetrapod limb. Developmental 1994 Supplement, 163-168. This is thought to have originated in the group Sarcopterygians, including osteolipiforms like Eusthenopteron, due to the homology of the tetrapod forelimb and the osteolepiform fin endoskeleton. Acanthostega is a partially aquatic tetrapod with developed limbs that shares features common with the earlier tetrapods, Panderichthys and Eusthenopteron. Like Panderichthys, the humerus of Acanthostega is flattened dorso-ventrally, the intermedium terminates level with the radius, and the endoskeleton can be divided into stylopodium, zeugopodium and autopodium segments. Similar to Eusthenopteron, the radials do not articulate with the radius on the distal end. Acanthostega also has a 1:2 ratio of humerus to radius and ulna, a feature seen in all tetrapods higher than Acanthostega on the phylogeny. Unlike Panderichthys, Acanthostega hind limbs are at least the size of its fore limbs, if not larger. This development of larger limbs is required to physically support the organism during emergence from an aquatic setting to land. The humerus and femur of Acanthostega also contain evidence of greater development of the appendicular muscles compared to more aquatic tetrapods, hinting at the presence of digits. Similarly, Ossinodus has two hindlimbs located bilaterally and proximodistally aymmetrical. Due to the presence of a small femur during juvenile development, this Carboniferous- period tetrapod is thought to be aquatic during juvenile development; only emerging onto land once it reaches adulthood. Ossinodus also has a broad, flat tibia, akin to Acanthostega, and is thought to be only partially terrestrial. == Pelvis == The development of the pelvic region was crucial for the adaptation from water to land, yet some features of tetrapod locomotion are thought to have arose before the origin of digited limbs or the transition from water to land. The fossil record of early tetrapods shows evidence of distinct pelvic development occurring in osteolepiforms, further supporting osteolepiform ancestry of terrestrial tetrapods. Acanthostega has a large pelvis, with the iliac region articulating with the axial skeleton and a broad ischial plate. It has a sacrum; a fundamental skeletal feature that allows the organism to transfer force produced in its hindlimbs to its axial skeleton, and move in a terrestrial environment. A pubo-ischiadic symphysis is also observed, uniting the two pelvic halves. In contrast, Protopterus annectens (a member of lungfish, thought to be a sister group to tetrapods) has a small, anatomically simpler pelvis, a derived limb endoskeleton and a lack of digits. Yet, it shares the ability to lift itself using a solid surface as a base with its pelvic region with Acanthostega and is also observed to move with tetrapod-like locomotion in an aquatic environment. This illustrates that a fundamental innovation in tetrapods is also found in a lower, sister taxon, in which members lack a sacrum. == Digits and Limb Joints == Acanthostega is the earliest example of a digitized tetrapod. The humerus and femur of Acanthostega contain evidence of greater development of the appendicular muscles compared to more aquatic tetrapods. Acanthostega has a total lack of dermal fin rays and displays the presence of two or more spool- shaped bones or cartilages articulating individually in antero-posterial sets on the distal end of its limbs. This feature can now be distinguished as digits instead of the endoskeletal radials seen in earlier tetrapods. Pederpes, a tetrapod from the Early Carboniferous period, also has hindlimbs containing 5 digits that are rotated to face anteriorly. Unlike previous tetrapods, who have been only partially adapted to land, Pederpes has the novel ability to bend its limbs and propel itself forwards in a terrestrial setting. This is attributed to the symmetry of the digits and limbs in Pederpes, allowing it to rotate its hindlimbs to an anteriorly facing position and propel itself from the edge of the foot when moving forward. This morphological development of bendable wrists and ankles can distinguish Pederpes the first true terrestrial tetrapod. == References  External links == Category:Evolution ","title":"Skeletal changes of organisms transitioning from water to land"},{"id":"46324251","text":"Beate Habetz (born 16 January 1961) is a German former professional racing cyclist.

Tom is a pilot who works as a spotter to locate schools of fish for the local fishermen to catch, but recently fish have been scarce, causing economic hardship for the local fishermen and Tom. Young Mark loves animals of all kinds. One day Mark is exploring the reserve when he encounters a black bear cub, and starts to make friends with it, only to have the protective mother bear appear and chase Mark up a tree. While still hidden in the tree, Mark watches, horrified, as a gang of poachers, led by local fisherman and bully Fog Hanson (Ralph Meeker), illegally shoot the mother bear and capture the cub. Mark reports the poaching to the local wildlife officer, who fines Fog. The angry Fog and his buddies try to beat up Tom in retaliation for Mark's reporting and because they blame Tom for not spotting any fish for them lately, but Tom and his friend (the local justice of the peace) win the fight and throw Fog and his gang off the pier. Fog inhumanely chains the captured cub in a dark shack with inadequate food or exercise. Despite his parents' warnings to stay away from Fog's property, Mark sneaks onto Fog's property repeatedly to feed and exercise the cub, whom he names Ben. As Ben grows bigger, he and Mark become close friends. Eventually, Fog catches Mark trespassing. Tom forbids Mark from ever visiting Ben again, while Fog plans to kill Ben and sell him for meat. Mark disregards his father's warning to rescue Ben, taking him into the wilderness to set him free. However, Ben refuses to leave Mark, and the pair are caught. Tom finally buys Ben from Fog to save Ben's life. Mark and Ben are happy for a time, but when walking with Ben one day, Fog and his gang show up and threaten Mark and Ben. Ben finally fights back and mauls Fog. Because Ben has now attacked a person, even though Mark argues it was justified, the Wedloes are forced to give Ben away to a zoo. Mark sadly says goodbye to Ben as his cage is loaded onto a boat for the trip to the zoo. En route to the zoo, Ben breaks out of his cage and swims ashore, escaping into the woods. Meanwhile, Tom's plane crashes, leading him to accept a job as a wildlife officer in the Everglades. While searching for poachers, Tom is charged by a large bear and recognizes the bear as Ben. Mark is excited to hear that Ben is nearby and insists Ben wouldn't do any harm, but Tom disagrees, stating that Ben has become dangerous and must be killed. Tom hunts for Ben with his rifle, and Mark follows, trying to save Ben. Tom finally spots Ben and is about to fire when a tree suddenly falls on Tom and pins him to the ground. At Mark's direction, Ben gently rolls the tree off Tom. Ben then leads Tom and Mark to his new \\"family\\" ‚Äî a female bear and newborn cubs that he was protecting when he first charged Tom. In view of circumstances, Tom spares Ben's life, and Ben and Mark renew their friendship. ==Cast== *Clint Howard as Mark Wedloe *Dennis Weaver as Tom Wedloe *Vera Miles as Ellen Wedloe *Ralph Meeker as Fog Hanson *Huntz Hall as Dink Smith *Charles Martin as Mike McDonaugh *Rance Howard as Tater Coughlin *Frank Schuller as Charlie Mason *Robertson White as Swenson *Richard O'Barry as Mate *James Riddle as Skipper *Jerry Newby as 1st Townsman *Frank Logan as 2nd Townsman *Alfred Metz as Fisherman *Levirne DeBord as Fisherman *Bruno the Bear as Adult Ben ==Production== Gentle Giant was another in a line of animal films for family audiences made by Ivan Tors during the 1960s, several of which spawned television series. His previous animal films had included Flipper (1963) (the basis for the TV series of the same name), Zebra in the Kitchen (1965), and Clarence, the Cross-Eyed Lion (1965) (the basis for the TV series Daktari). Gentle Giant likewise provided the basis for the TV series Gentle Ben.Windeler, Robert, \\"Filling the Vacuum: Ivan Tors Solves Problem of Finding Motion Pictures For His Young Son,\\" The Journal Standard (Freeport, Illinois), Aug. 10, 1967, p. 26. The film was also originally titled Gentle Ben. In an arrangement unusual at the time, CBS provided funding for the film in exchange for the rights to show the film on television after it had finished its United States movie theater run.Foster, Bob, \\"Screenings\\", San Mateo County Times, May 5, 1966, p. 32. The original Walt Morey novel was set in Alaska and involved a brown bear native to that state.\\"Students Hear Tales of Adventure From Author of Children's Books\\", Standard-Examiner (Ogden, Utah), Mar. 7, 1974, p. 5B. For the film, the setting was changed to Florida, which was also the location of the Miami-based film studio established by Tors, and the bear was changed to an American black bear indigenous to the Everglades. Filming was done at Ivan Tors' studio, in Miami, in the fishing town of Port Salerno, Florida (P.O.

According to Clint's father Rance Howard (who also appeared in the film as one of Fog Hanson's gang), to audition for the role Clint, then aged 6, was required to do a screen test with Bruno the Bear, who knocked Clint down in the middle of the audition. Bruno then swung his head from side to side in a behavior that shows impatience in bears. Clint responded by getting back up, yanking Bruno's neck chain while ordering him to listen, and continuing the audition; Bruno settled down.Howard, Rance. \\"Clint Howard Tames a Gentle Giant\\", in Tales from the Casting Couch (ed. Michael Viner and Terri Maxine Frankel). Phoenix Books, 1995, p. 215-216. .

In addition to Bruno, the film included several other black bears that portrayed Ben's mother, Ben's mate, Ben's cubs and/or Ben at different stages in his life. According to trainer Derrick Rosaire Sr. and his son Derrick Rosaire II, Rosaire Sr. owned a trained female black bear that played Ben's mother and also played Ben in some scenes of the film. Rosaire Sr. named the bear \\"Gentle Ben\\" and exhibited it for years after the film at circuses, talk shows and other events.\\"'Gentle Ben' To Perform At Circus\\", Cumberland News (Cumberland, Maryland), Mar. 14, 1975, p. 26.Wyman, Sandy, \\"They Are Trained, Not Tamed: Bear Show 'Roars' Success\\", Gouverneur Tribune Press (Gouverneur, New York), Aug. 14, 2008, p. 7. ==See also== * The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams (1974) * List of American films of 1967 ==References* Category:1967 films Category:1967 drama films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films about bears Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on children's books Category:Films directed by James Neilson Category:Films set in Florida Category:Films shot in Florida Category:Paramount Pictures films ","title":"Gentle Giant (film)"},{"id":"46324318","text":"Yevhen Nemtinov (; born 3 October 1995) is a professional Ukrainian football midfielder who plays for Ahrobiznes Volochysk. ==Career== Nemtinov is a product of the Youth Sportive Schools in Illichivsk and Chernivtsi, then he spent his career playing for different Ukrainian club and in January 2015 signed a contract with FC Illichivets Mariupol.

Also called squalea, or squalean sharks. There are about 163 living species in 11 families. Squalean sharks are divided into four orders: the Hexanchiformes, Squaliformes, Squatiniformes, and Pristiophoriformes. ==Classification== Order Hexanchiformes The order Hexanchiformes is a very small and primitive order consisting of cow sharks and frilled sharks. These sharks have only 1 dorsal fin, 6-7 gill slits, and no nictitating membrane on the eyes. Cow sharks are fairly large and stocky, while frilled sharks are smaller and have eel-like bodies. The oldest fossils from this order can be dated back to the mid-Jurassic.Compagno, Leonard. Sharks of the World. Princeton: Princeton UP, 2005. Print. There are six living species in 4 genera, and 2 families. * Family Hexanchidae (Cow sharks) * Family Chlamydoselachidae (Frilled sharks) Order Squaliformes The order Squaliformes is a large, ancient order of sharks. Sharks from this order have two dorsal fins -usually with spines-, no anal fin, and no nictitating membrane on the eyes. Squaliform sharks are extremely variable in size and shape, and can be found in most marine habitats throughout the world. Like Hexanchiformes, members of Squaliformes can be found as early as the Jurassic period.Compagno, Leonard. Sharks of the World. Princeton: Princeton UP, 2005. Print.

The angel sharks have flattened bodies and broad pectoral fins, as well as camouflaged coloration. These characteristics allow angel sharks to blend in with their benthic environments. Members of Squatiniformes have been found since the late Jurassic period.Froese, Rainer, and Daniel Pauly, eds. (2009). \\"Squatinidae\\" in FishBase. January 2009 version. There are 23 species in 1 genus, and 1 family. * Family Squatinidae (Angel sharks) Order Pristiophoriformes The order Pristiophoriformes is a small order of unique sharks called sawsharks. Sawsharks have a long snout covered in teeth, between 5-6 gill slits, and no anal fin. They also have a pair of barbels usually located halfway down the snout. Sawsharks are frequently confused with sawfish, which are members of the ray order Pristiformes. Sawsharks can be discerned from sawfish thanks to their lateral gill slits, which differ from the sawfish's ventral gill slits. These sharks can mostly be found in deep benthic environments. Fossils of members of this order have been found since the late Jurassic period.Froese, Rainer, and Daniel Pauly, eds. (2013). \\"Pristiophoridae\\" in FishBase. October 2013 version.

It is the earliest true map of London (as opposed to panoramic views, such as those of Anton van den Wyngaerde). The original map was probably designed for hanging on a wall, and is believed to have measured approximately high by wide.Marks 1964, p. 14. No copies of the printed map itself are known to have survived; but between 1962 and 1997 three of the original engraved copper printing-plates ‚Äì from a probable total of 15 ‚Äì were identified. Although only a fragmentary portion of the map is known, the three plates cover the greater part of the built-up heart of the City of London. The map takes the form of a \\"bird's-flight view\\": that is to say, the street layout and other ground features are shown in plan, as if viewed directly from above; while buildings, people and other standing features are shown as if viewed from a great height to the south of the City, but without the foreshortening of more distant features that would be necessary for a true perspective view. The map is clearly the source for the slightly smaller-scale and cruder \\"Woodcut\\" map, formerly attributed to Ralph Agas, which dates from shortly after 1561; and also, directly or indirectly, for the greatly reduced map of London included in Georg Braun and Frans Hogenberg's Civitates Orbis Terrarum, published in Cologne and Amsterdam in 1572. These two derivative maps allow the original extent and size of the Copperplate map to be estimated. ==Production== The Copperplate map may have been engraved by mapmakers from the Low Countries, an important centre of surveying and printing at the time: this is suggested by some of its inscriptions and other details.Peter Barber, \\"The Copperplate Map in context\\", in Saunders and Scofield 2001, pp. 16‚Äì32 (20, 26). Its date coincides approximately with the joint reign of Queen Mary I and her husband Philip of Spain (i.e. 1554‚Äì58). Philip, whose realms also included the Spanish Netherlands, was known as a keen collector of town and city plans, and may have commissioned or patronised the Copperplate map. It has also been suggested that Hanseatic merchants in London, and the humanist scholar George Lily, played some part in its production.Barber 2001, pp. 21‚Äì26. All three surviving plates are heavily worn, suggesting that they were used for printing many times. ==Surviving plates== The Moorfields plate Moorfields The first plate was discovered in 1962, when an art-dealer contacted the London Museum.Holmes 1963. It depicts part of the northern perimeter of the City of London, including a length of the city wall, the gates of Moorgate and Bishopsgate, and the suburbs of Moorfields and Spitalfields. The reverse of the plate had been used for a painting of the Tower of Babel, dated to c.1600 and attributed to Marten van Valckenborch or a member of his circle. The plate was acquired by the London Museum, and is now in its successor institution, the Museum of London. The eastern City plate Eastern City The second plate was identified shortly afterwards in private ownership.Holmes 1966. The map section shows much of the eastern part of the City (immediately to the south of the area covered by the first plate, and extending south to the banks of the Thames), including Guildhall and the northern end of London Bridge. The reverse of the plate had been used for a painting of the Coronation and Assumption of the Virgin, painted in c.1600 and attributed to Hieronymus Francken I. This plate was also purchased by the Museum of London in 1985.John Schofield, \\"An introduction to the three known sheets of the Copperplate Map\\", in Saunders and Schofield 2001, pp. 1‚Äì6. The western City plate Western City The third plate was identified in 1997 in the collections of the Anhaltische Gem√§ldegalerie, housed in the Georgium, Dessau, Germany. This map section shows much of the western part of the City (immediately to the west of the area covered by the second plate, again extending south to the Thames, and west to the church of St Dunstan-in-the-West), with St Paul's Cathedral and the River Fleet appearing prominently. Like the first plate, the reverse had been used for a painting of the Tower of Babel, in this case dated to c.1630 but again attributed to a member of the circle of Marten van Valckenborch. ==Dating evidence== The Copperplate map is not explicitly dated, but the original survey can be dated with some precision to between 1553 and 1559 from internal evidence.Stephen Powys Marks, \\"Dating the Copperplate Map and its first derivatives\\", in Saunders and Schofield 2001, pp. 7‚Äì15. Key points include the following: *Shrewsbury Place, on the riverfront (eastern City plate), is named as such. Previously known as Coldharbour House, this house was given to the Earl of Shrewsbury and renamed in 1553. *A free-standing cross in the churchyard of St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate (Moorfields plate) is shown: this was removed in 1559. *All Hallows, Bread Street (western City plate) is shown with its spire. The spire was struck by lightning in 1559, and taken down shortly afterwards. *St Paul's Cathedral (western City plate) is shown with its spire. The spire was lost in a fire in 1561. *The Royal Exchange does not appear (its location is on the eastern City plate). This major City landmark was erected between 1566 and 1570 and opened in 1571. What is thought to be the Copperplate map is mentioned in a letter from the cartographer Nicholas Reynolds to Abraham Ortelius, dated 1562‚Äì3.Barber 2001, p. 20. ==Gallery== File:Copperplate Map, Museum of London 1.jpgMoorfields plate: printing surface File:Copperplate Map, Museum of London 2.jpgMoorfields plate, reverse: The Tower of Babel, c.1600 File:Copperplate Map, Museum of London.jpgEastern City plate: printing surface File:Copperplate Map, Museum of London 3.jpgEastern City plate, reverse: The Coronation and Assumption of the Virgin, c.1600 ==ReferencesBibliography== * (Includes reproduction of the first plate.) * * (Includes reproduction of the first plate.) * (Includes reproductions of the first two plates.) * (Includes reproductions of all three plates.) ==External links== * * Category:Elizabethan era Category:History of the built environment of London Category:History of the City of London Category:Maps of London Category:16th century in London Category:16th-century maps and globes ","title":"Copperplate map of London"},{"id":"46324504","text":"Un grand cri d'amour (A great cry of love) is a 1998 French comedy film directed by Josiane Balasko.

His father was a patrilineal grandson of the 4th Earl of Dunmore, who was descended from a younger son of the first Marquess of Atholl, of the Clan Murray. ==Military career== Murray was commissioned a Second lieutenant in the Seaforth Highlanders on 29 February 1888. He was promoted to Lieutenant on 4 September 1889, and to Captain on 1 February 1895. At the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899, Murray was sent with his battalion to South Africa, where he fought in the Transvaal. After his return to the United Kingdom, he was in February 1902 seconded for service on the Staff, and appointed Aide-de-camp to Major-General Ronald Lane, Commanding the Infantry Brigade at Malta. The following year, Murray was appointed Aide-de-camp to Field Marshal the Duke of Connaught, and served as such during his remaining years as Commander-in-Chief Ireland (until 1904), and from 1904-06 when he was Inspector-General to the Forces. He rejoined his regiment on the outbreak of the First World War, and retired as Lieutenant- Colonel after serving on the Staff. ==Courtier== Murray was Extra Equerry to Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn from 1903 to 1907, when he was appointed Equerry and Comptroller of the Household to His Royal Highness. He served as Deputy Ranger of Windsor Great Park from 1929 to 1937. ==Honours== Murray was appointed a Member (4th class) of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) in 1905, promoted to a Commander (CVO) of the order in the 1909 Birthday Honours list, knighted as a Knight Commander (KCVO) of the order in 1916, and promoted to Knight Grand Cross (GCVO) in the 1936 Birthday Honours list. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1911 Coronation Honours, and later appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE).

He illustrated national magazines, and was art director for Atlanta Journal and Good Housekeeping. Carter was inducted into the Society of Illustrator's Hall of Fame in 1988. ==Early life and education== Carter was born in 1891 in Missouri. He grew up in Wyoming on an Indian Reservation. He graduated from the Los Angeles High School, then studied art at the Art Students League of Los Angeles. After completing his education in California, Carter studied in New York under Robert Henri. His and Rex Slinkard's works were exhibited at the League in 1910. A critic for the Los Angeles Times stated, \\"For the present, instructors of the ASL of LA are pupils of Robert Henri of NY - and you know what that means! You know, at once, that they are strictly up-to-date in their artistic ideas, that they are the most modern of the moderns, and that they are smashing academic traditions with every vigorous stroke of charcoal stick or paintbrush.\\" ==Career== Carter taught illustration at the Grand Central School of Art in New York City, with N. C. Wyeth and Harvey Dunn. His students included Lawrence Nelson Wilbur and Perle Fine. He also taught at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles, and was head of the Illustration department. His illustrations appeared in Life, Good Housekeeping, McCall's , Ladies' Home Journal, The American Magazine, and Woman's Home Companion. He was art director at Atlanta Journal and Good Housekeeping. Carter was an adept illustrator at the magazine publishing industry, including women's magazines, and anticipated and adjusted his approach as the market changed. Initially, Carter made Impressionist works, like that of Walter Biggs. He stated, \\"The illustrator's first function is a problem of composition, of pattern, of design - including the rich contrast of the illustration itself with the type matter and headlines of the story... the illustrator may be likened to the director of a motion picture...He must live the part of each actor. He must do the scenery, design the costumes, and handle the lighting effects.\\" He had adapted a modern style that focused on decoration and page design by the 1950s. He exhibited his works in California. In 1988, Carter was inducted into the Society of Illustrators' Hall of Fame. ==Personal life== Carter married a woman named Theresa, and about 1920 they had a son named Deal. He and his family lived on the East Coast of the United States until about 1930, when they moved to California. They were living in Studio City, Los Angeles in the mid-1950s. About December 1, 1955, Carter killed his wife and his son, who had been handicapped from birth, while they were sleeping, and then killed himself.

He began his career with Enk√∂pings SK, and moved on to for IK Sirius and Djurg√•rdens IF, with whom he won the 2017‚Äì18 Svenska Cupen. In January 2019, he joined English EFL Championship (second-tier) club Birmingham City on an 18-month contract, and signed for KV Mechelen in August 2020. He made his senior international debut for Sweden in 2016. ==Career== Mrabti was born in Stockholm and moved to Enk√∂ping as a five-year-old. He started out playing for the local club Enk√∂pings SK. At 17 he played a big part in Enk√∂ping winning their fourth tier league and getting promoted. After the following season had ended in November 2012 he trialed with Uppsala based club IK Sirius and impressed enough to be signed on a two-year deal. After two seasons with IK Sirius, one in the third tier and the next in the second-tier Superettan, Mrabti was sold to Allsvenskan club Djurg√•rdens IF in early 2015 for 600,000‚Äì700,000 SEK. On 25 May Mrabti scored his first two goals for Djurg√•rden in the Tvillingderby against local rival AIK in front of 27,137 people at the Tele2 Arena in a game which ended 2‚Äì2. At the end of the 2015 Allsvenskan season he received the player of the year award by the club's supporter group J√§rnkaminerna as well as the award for best newcomer of the year in the entire league. Ahead of the new season in 2017 Mrabti was handed the number 10 shirt. On 10 May 2018 he scored as Djurg√•rden beat Malm√∂ FF 3‚Äì0 in the Swedish Cup Final. He left the club at the end of the season, and on 18 January 2019, signed an 18-month contract on a free deal with Birmingham City of the EFL Championship, the second tier of football in England. Always in or around the first team but never a regular in the starting eleven, Mrabti made 27 appearances in all competitions (18 league starts) and scored three goals. The arrival of Scott Hogan in January 2020 and the season interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic further restricted his opportunities, and he left the club when his contract expired in June 2020. After training with his former club, Djurg√•rden, Mrabti signed a three-year contract with KV Mechelen of the Belgian First Division A. ==International career== Mrabti has represented both the Sweden national under-19 football team and the Sweden national under-21 football team. In January 2016 he suffered an ACL injury only 25 minutes into his senior debut for Sweden against Estonia. Mrabti was expected to back in full training in September later that year. He was included in Sweden's squad in December 2017.https://www.expressen.se/sport/fotboll/landslaget/har-ar-skrallarna-till- januariturnen/ Despite playing for Sweden in friendly matches, Tunisia were keen to add him to their 2018 World Cup squad.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44085775 On 13 May 2018 Mrabti announced he had turned down the opportunity.https://www.fotbollskanalen.se/allsvenskan/inget-vm-for-mrabti- har-tackat-nej/ He was called into Sweden's squad in December 2018.https://www.fotbollskanalen.se/bloggar/lundh/2018/12/03/ratt-spelare-pa- vinterturne-men-helt-fel-resmal/ ==Personal life== Mrabti's father is Tunisian while his mother is half Swedish and half Finnish. He first became a Djurg√•rdens IF supporter after attending the 2003‚Äì04 UEFA Champions League qualifier against FK Partizan and he also visited the Djurg√•rden training grounds to collect autographs from the players.

Anton Spiteri, and a group of other Gozitan people, wanted to highlight the dilapidated state of the Citadel and put an aim to protect it. Initially, the conservation work was concentrated to the Citadel and the name of the organization was initially Il-Belt il-Qadima (). The first project was the restoration of the old St Joseph‚Äôs Chapel, which was ready just before St Joseph‚Äôs feast in 1974. The work was managed by T. Mercieca, and a plaque commemorates the restoration and re-inauguration. Other projects included the cleaning of the old clock, clearing weeds from the fortifications, maintenance of the cannons on the defensive parapets, and the renovation of the Old Prison. Later, the organization expanded their interest to works beyond the Citadel, covering Gozo and Comino. At a committee meeting, on 6 July 1981, the decision was made to broaden the scope of work, and to change the official name to reflect the changes.

Her work is associated with the New Objectivity and Symbolism movements. She is best known for her depictions of strong, sensual women and Berlin city life. ==Life and career== Jeanne Mammen was born in Berlin, the daughter of a successful German merchant. She and her family moved to Paris when she was five years old. She studied art in Paris, Brussels and Rome from 1906-1911. Her early work, influenced by Symbolism, Art Nouveau, and the Decadent movement, was exhibited in Brussels and Paris in 1912 and 1913.Sykora (1988), p. 28. In 1916 she and her family fled Paris to avoid internment during World War I. While her parents moved to Amsterdam, Mammen chose instead to return to Berlin. She was now financially on her own for the first time, as the French government had confiscated all of her family's property. For several years Mammen struggled to make ends meet, taking any work she could find, and spending time with people from different class backgrounds. These experiences and newfound sympathies are reflected in her artwork from the period. In time she was able to find work as a commercial artist, producing fashion plates, movie posters, and caricatures for satirical journals such as Simplicissimus, Ulk, and Jugend. In the mid-1920s she became known for her illustrations evoking the urban atmosphere of Berlin. Much of her artwork depicted women. These women subjects often included haughty socialites, fashionable middle-class shop girls, street singers, and prostitutes. Her drawings were often compared to those of George Grosz and Otto Dix.Sykora (1988), p. 29. Throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s she worked mainly in pencil with watercolor washes, and in pen and ink. In 1921, Mammen moved into an apartment with her sister in Berlin. This apartment was a former photographer's studio which she lived in until her death. Aside from Art throughout her life Mammen also was interested in science. She was close friends with Max Delbr√ºck who left Europe and took some of her artwork with him and exhibited them in California. In addition to bringing these art works to be exhibited he also sent Mammen care packages from the United States with art supplies. In 1930 she had a major exhibition in the Fritz Gurlitt gallery. Over the next two years, at Gurlitt's suggestion, she created one of her most important works: a series of eight lithographs illustrating Les Chansons de Bilitis, a collection of lesbian love poems by Pierre Lou√øs. In 1933, following her inclusion in an exhibition of female artists in Berlin, the Nazi authorities denounced her motifs and subjects as \\"Jewish\\", and banned her lithographs for Les Chansons de Bilitis. The Nazis were also opposed to her blatant disregard to for apparent 'appropriate' female submissiveness in her expressions of her subjects. Much of her work also includes imagery of lesbians. The Nazis shut down most of the journals she had worked for,Sykora (1988), p. 30. and she refused to work for those that complied with their cultural policies. Until the end of the war she practiced a kind of \\"inner emigration\\". She stopped exhibiting her work and focused on advertising. For a time she also peddled second-hand books from a handcart. In the 1940s, in a show of solidarity, she began experimenting with Cubism and expressionism, a risky move given the Nazis' condemnation of abstract art as \\"degenerate\\". After the war she took to collecting wires, string, and other materials from the streets of bombed-out Berlin to create reliefs. In the late 1940s she began exhibiting her work again, as well as designing sets for the Die Badewanne cabaret. She created abstract collages from various materials, including candy wrappers. In the 1950s she adopted a new style, combining thick layers of oil paint with a few fine marks on the surface.Sykora (1988), p. 31. In the 1970s there was a resurgence of interest in Mammen's early work as German art historians, as well as art historians of the women's movement, rediscovered her paintings and illustrations from the Weimar period. In 2013 her later, more abstract work was featured in \\"Painting Forever!\\", a large- scale exhibition held during Berlin Art Week. In 2017‚Äì18, the Berlinische Galerie mounted a major exhibition of Mammen's work, titled, \\"Jeanne Mammen: Die Beobachterin: Retrospektive 1910‚Äì1975\\" (Jeanne Mammen: The Observer: Retrospective 1910‚Äì1975), which included more than 170 works in various media, covering the period from the 1920s to her late work in the 1960s and beyond. The show was conceived as an update to a show mounted by the Galerie at the Martin Gropius Bau in 1997, which featured primarily works from the 1920s. In 2010 the Des Moines Art Center exhibited 13 water color paintings done by Mammen which were inspired by Berlin in the Weimer era. ==Public collections== *Berlinische Galerie *Harvard Art Museums *Des Moines Art Center *Museum of Modern Art *Metropolitan Museum of Art *Morgan Library & Museum ==ReferencesBibliography== *F√∂rderverein der Jeanne-Mammen-Stiftung e.

Perillyl alcohol can be found in the essential oils of various plants, such as lavender, lemongrass, sage, and peppermint. It has a number of manufacturing, household, and medical applications. For example, perillyl alcohol may be used as an ingredient in cleaning products and cosmetics. Perillyl alcohol has shown some antitumor activity in laboratory and animal studies, but clinical trials in humans have shown no evidence of benefit, and have noted adverse side effects. Perillyl alcohol is a metabolite of limonene, which itself is formed from geranyl pyrophosphate in the mevalonate pathway. Conversion of limonene to perillyl alcohol is accomplished via hydroxylation by enzymes that belong to the superfamily of cytochrome P450 proteins. Perillyl alcohol can be metabolized further to perillaldehyde (perillyl aldehyde) and perillic acid.

Al Nuaimi and his firm assembled a legal defense team to represent more than 70 prisoners in Guantanamo Bay in 2002. He was a lead lawyer on Saddam Hussein's final legal defense team. He also served as the defense lawyer for imprisoned Qatari poet Mohammed al-Ajami in 2013. ==Personal life== In 2001, his cousin, a 22-year-old Bahraini citizen named Abdulla Majid Al Naimi, was detained in Pakistan and later sent to Guantanamo Bay. Al Nuaimi obtained degrees in law in Egypt and the United Kingdom. ==Career== From 1995 to 1997, he served as Minister of Justice for Qatar. In 1997, he established his legal firm, Law Offices of Dr Najeeb Al Nauimi. In 2002, he and his firm assembled a legal team to represent alleged Al-Qaeda and Taliban members held at Guantanamo Bay. He represented between 70 and 100 prisoners. He argued that the majority of prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay were wrongly accused of being terrorists by the Pakistani police force and the Afghan Northern Alliance. He was one of the three foreign lawyers on Saddam Hussein's legal defense team. He took part in the Dujail and Anfal trials, arguing that the trials were held unlawfully because the U.S. invasion contravened international law. He claims he was contacted by Saddam's family and colleagues to take up the job. He later described Saddam's trial as a \\"trial of ethnicity, not an international trial\\". Al Nuaimi did not request payment for his services. He represented Qatari poet Mohammed al-Ajami, who had been imprisoned by the Qatari government for reciting a poem which was deemed to be critical to the emir. Al-Ajami was handed down a life sentence in 2012, which Al Nuaimi appealed. In February 2013, the court reduced his sentence to 15-years. After the trial, Al Nuaimi announced that he would file another appeal, this time to Qatar's highest court, the Court of Cassation. Speaking on the second appeal, he said \\"we know at the end of the day he will be pardoned\\". In October, the Court of Cassation ruled against the poet, upholding the 15-year sentence. Al Nuaimi responded to the ruling by proclaiming ‚Äúour judicial system cannot be trusted‚Äù. In 2012, Nuaimi claimed that he would defend Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir in court if it was requested of him. However, he declined an offer to represent former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak in court. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Qatari lawyers Category:Qatari writers Category:Qatari activists Category:Government ministers of Qatar Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Najeeb Al Nuaimi"},{"id":"46324924","text":"The Fruit of Grisaia is a 13-episode anime television series based on the visual novel of the same name by Front Wing.

The plateau is only seasonally habitable due to aridity and was once home to fauna otherwise rare in Turkana. Loriu is west of and adjacent to the Barrier Volcano at the southernmost portion of Lake Turkana. ==Location== Loriu is bounded by Lake Turkana to the east, Kapedo to the south, the Kerio River to the west, and Kerio River delta to the north. The plateau is 64 kilometers running from north to south, approximately 8 kilometers wide, and is capped by Tertiary volcanic lava flows. The western margin of Loriu rises gradually while the eastern margin is defined by a fault scarp more than 366 meters high in some locations. The maximum altitude of the plateau is 1,463 meters. ==Animal and plant life== The Turkana basin was previously home to a great diversity and number of animal species, many of which became the basis for names of both places and people in the region. A number of wild animals no longer found in the wider Turkana Basin, including oryx, greater kudu and ostrich, were found in the Loriu Plateau during early expeditions by outsiders. Loriu includes a heterogeneous plant community with acacia trees, bush and sparse grassland. Portions of the plateau are too steep for vegetation. ==Geology== The Precambrian basement rock biotite-gniesses that form the underlying structure of Loriu were exposed during the plateau's formation through up faulting and tilting of the basement rock. These layers are clearly visible and form a major part of the stratigraphy of the Mugor scarp on the eastern edge of the plateau. Because of the gradual slope of the western plateau, Loriu is most likely not a horst. Lavas capping Loriu are dated to the Pliocene, according to the East African Geological Research Unit. These lavas are primarily aphyric basalts, are grayish in color, trachytic in texture and composed of olivine. Other basalts contain olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts. To the west are a few mafic porphyritic basalts and possibly older Miocene basalts cut by dykes and faults. Olivine nephelinite has been collected near these basalts. The southern margin of Loriu is also bounded by a major volcanic group around the Lomi caldera. ==See also== *Lake Turkana *Turkana Basin *East African Rift Valley ==References== Category:Great Rift Valley ","title":"Loriu Plateau"},{"id":"46325083","text":"Mikkel Duelund (born 29 June 1997) is a Danish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Dynamo Kyiv in the Ukrainian Premier League and the Denmark U21 national team. ==Club career== Midtjylland Born in Aarhus, Denmark, Duelund began his playing career with Danish Superliga side FC Midtjylland.

It was filmed in June 2011 at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C. during his Dangerously Delicious Tour. == Synopsis == The stand-up material included commentary such as Southern culture, racism, wasting time Googling obscure subjects (such as the box office numbers for Home Alone vs Home Alone 2 and Joe Pesci trivia) and online pornography. He also revisited subjects from his previous stand-up special, Intimate Moments for a Sensual Evening, including sharing stories about his young cousin Harris. == Release == Unlike his previous special, which aired on Comedy Central, Ansari released the special directly on his website for a $5 download. He wrote, \\"I wanted to release it online because I saw how many people viewed clips from my last special online on sites like YouTube. I also like releasing it myself because there are no commercials, bleeps, or any of that stuff.\\" The download package also included bonus material such as photos, posters for the Dangerously Delicious Tour, a list of places he ate while on the road, and methods to create a unique own DVD cover. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club commented: \\"It‚Äôs a testament to Ansari‚Äôs exploding popularity that, like Louis C.K. and Jim Gaffigan before him, he‚Äôs able to cut out once- powerful middlemen like Comedy Central and HBO and release his latest special directly to fans through his website.\\" == Reception == Dangerously Delicious was well received by critics. Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post praised Ansari's energetic delivery, writing, \\"Though Ansari takes on common standup topics ‚Äî travel, fame, women, etc. ‚Äî there's a freshness and winning curiosity to his approach: He's honestly amused or annoyed by the things that he's talking about. He's never less than fully engaged by the goofy experiences he's describing, and that keeps the special humming with energy.\\" A reviewer for the comedy website Laugh Button called the special \\"hilarious\\" and \\"another step in the right direction for the comedian as he continues to refine and improve the brand that is Aziz Ansari.\\" In his review for The A.V. Club, Rabin writes of Ansari's increasing prominence as the comedic voice of his generation. == References  * Category:2012 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Stand-up comedy concert films Category:Films shot in Washington, D.C.

As a result, these countries received significant economic and military support.Trenin, Dmitri (2011). Post-Imperium: A Eurasian Story. Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. p. 144. In Soviet press, these states were also called \\"countries on the path of the construction of socialism\\" () and \\"countries on the path of the socialist development\\" (). All these terms meant to draw a distinction from the true socialist states (in Marxist‚ÄìLeninist understanding).\\"Sotsialisticheskaya oriyentatsiya\\" (in Russian). An article from the 1986‚Äì1987 Soviet reference book Afrika. Entsiklopedicheskiy spravochnik. The use of the term was partly a result of a reassessment of national liberation movements in the Third World following World War II, widespread decolonization and the emergence of the Non-Aligned Movement as well as Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the de-Stalinization of Soviet Marxism.Tareq, Ismael (2005). The Communist Movement in the Arab World. London: Rutledge. Print. pp. 24‚Äì25. The discussion of anti-colonial struggle at the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern in 1920 had been formulated in terms of a debate between those for an alliance with the anti-imperialist national bourgeoisie (initially advocated by Vladimir Lenin) and those for a pure class line of socialist, anti-feudal as well as anti-imperialist struggle (such as M. N. Roy).Lenin, Vladimir (1965) [19 July‚Äì7 August 1920). \\"Report of the Commission on the National and the Colonial Question\\". Collected Works. 31. Moscow: Progress Publishers. pp. 213‚Äì263. The revolutions of the post-war decolonization era (excepting those led by explicitly proletarian forces such as the Vietnamese Revolution), e.g. the rise of Nasserism, were initially seen by many communists as a new form of bourgeois nationalism and there were often sharp conflicts between communists and nationalists.Tareq, Ismael (2005). The Communist Movement in the Arab World. London: Rutledge. Print. p. 21. However, the adoption of leftist economic programs (such as nationalization and/or land reform) by many of these movements and governments as well as the international alliances between the revolutionary nationalists and the Soviet Union obliged communists to reassess their nature. These movements were now seen as neither classical bourgeois nationalists nor socialist per se, but rather offering the possibility of \\"non-capitalist development\\" as a path of \\"transition to socialism\\".Tareq, Ismael (2005). The Communist Movement in the Arab World. London: Rutledge. Print. p. 24. At various times, these states included Algeria, Angola, Central African Republic, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Libya, Mozambique, South Yemen and many others. In Soviet political science, \\"socialist orientation\\" was defined to be an initial period of the development in countries which rejected capitalism, but did not yet have the prerequisites for the socialist revolution or development. Along these lines, a more cautious synonym was used, namely \\"countries on the path of non-capitalist development\\". A 1986 Soviet reference book on Africa claimed that about one third of African states followed this path. In some countries designated as socialist-leaning by the Soviet Union such as India, this formulation was sharply criticized by emerging Maoist or Chinese-leaning groups such as the Communist Party of India (Marxist), who considered the doctrine class collaborationist as part of the larger Sino-Soviet split and the Maoist struggle against so-called Soviet revisionism. == List of socialist-leaning states == States that had communist governments in red, states that the Soviet Union believed at one point to be moving toward socialism in orange and other socialist states in yellow (note that not all of the bright red states remained Soviet allies) Some of these countries had communist governments while others (italicized) did not. * (1954‚Äì1973) * (1955‚Äì1991) * (1958‚Äì1963, 1968‚Äì1991) * (1960‚Äì1978) * (1960‚Äì1968) * Somali Democratic Republic (1969‚Äì1977) * (1962‚Äì1988) * (1962‚Äì1990) * (1964‚Äì1966) * (1968‚Äì1975) * ' (1969‚Äì1971) * ' (1968‚Äì1979) * (1969‚Äì1991) * People's Republic of the Congo (1969‚Äì1991) * (1970‚Äì1973) * (1975‚Äì1991) * (1975‚Äì1991) * South Yemen (1967‚Äì1990) * (1972‚Äì1979) * (1960‚Äì1965) * (1955‚Äì1989) * People's Republic of Bangladesh (1971‚Äì1975) * Democratic Republic of Madagascar (1972‚Äì1991) * Guinea Bissau (1973‚Äì1991) * Derg (1974‚Äì1987) * People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (1987‚Äì1991) * (1975‚Äì1991) * People's Republic of Benin (1975‚Äì1990) * People's Republic of Mozambique (1975‚Äì1990) * People's Republic of Angola (1975‚Äì1991) * Seychelles (1977‚Äì1991) * Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (1978‚Äì1991) * People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada (1979‚Äì1983) * (1979‚Äì1990) * People's Republic of Kampuchea (1979‚Äì1989) * (1983‚Äì1987)'' == See also == * African socialism * Arab socialism * Bureaucratic collectivism * Communist state * Congress of the Peoples of the East * Deformed workers' state * Degenerated workers' state * Developmentalism * List of socialist states * Marxism‚ÄìLeninism * New class * Nomenklatura * People's republic * Politics of the Soviet Union * Socialist state * Soviet Bloc * Soviet Empire * State capitalism * State socialism == Notes  References == Category:Communism Category:Marxism‚ÄìLeninism Category:Politics of the Soviet Union Category:Socialism Category:Socialist states ","title":"Socialist-leaning countries"},{"id":"46325201","text":"Kristine Davanger (born 13 January 1993) is a Norwegian curler.

It is approximately long and flows through Covington Township, Madison Township, Moscow, Roaring Brook Township, Elmhurst Township, Dunmore, and Scranton. The watershed of the stream has an area of . Its named tributaries include Little Roaring Brook, Rock Bottom Creek, White Oak Run, Van Brunt Creek, Bear Brook, and East Branch Roaring Brook. It has a high level of water quality for much of its length. However, it is affected by abandoned mining land, stormwater, and other impacts in its lower reaches. Reservoirs in the watershed include the Hollister Reservoir, the Elmhurst Reservoir, and others. The stream also flows through the Nay Aug Gorge and passes over the Nay Aug Falls, which are on the National Register of Geologic Landmarks. It flows through a concrete channel in its lower reaches. The topography of the watershed contains rolling hills in its upper reaches and the mountainous land of the Moosic Mountains in its lower reaches. Land uses in the watershed of Roaring Brook include forested land, agricultural land, and developed land such as high-density residential land and downtown commercial land. Abandoned mine land also occurs in the watershed and wetlands occur in some areas. Major roads in the stream's drainage basin include Interstate 380, Interstate 84, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. Mills and forges were built along the stream in the late 1700s and early 1800s. During the 19th century, there was a substantial coal and iron industry in the watershed. Several railroads were also built in the stream's vicinity. Numerous bridges, including the Harrison Avenue Bridge (which is on the National Register of Historic Places) have been built across the stream as well. Additionally, sites such as the Scranton Iron Furnaces are in its watershed. Roaring Brook is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery for part of its length and a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery for the other part of its length. It is also Class A Wild Trout Waters from the Hollister Dam to the Elmhurst Reservoir. Numerous macroinvertebrate taxa have been observed in the stream and boreal forest trees inhabit wetlands in the watershed. A 12-mile (19-kilometer) rail trail connecting the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail to the Poconos via the Roaring Brook Corridor has been proposed. ==Course== Roaring Brook begins in a small wetland in Covington Township, a few tenths of a mile from the border between Lackawanna County and Wayne County. It flows west for a few tenths of a mile before turning west- northwest for several tenths of a mile. The stream then turns northwest for several tenths of a mile before receiving Lake Run, its first named tributary, from the left. It then enters the Hollister Reservoir, where it receives the tributary East Branch Roaring Brook from the right. After passing through the reservoir, the stream turns north-northwest. It soon begins flowing along the border between Covington Township and Madison Township and begins to flow alongside Pennsylvania Route 435. The stream enters Moscow and receives the tributary Bear Brook from the right and the tributary Van Brunt Creek from the left. It continues flowing north-northwest and receives the tributary Kellum Creek after several tenths of a mile. Roaring Brook then enters the Elmhurst Reservoir, where it briefly enters Roaring Brook Township before entering Elmhurst Township and receiving the tributary White Oak Run from the right. The stream continues flowing north-northwest, crossing Pennsylvania Route 435 and reentering Roaring Brook Township several tenths of a mile further downstream. It then crosses Interstate 84 and receives the tributary Rock Bottom Creek from the right as its valley becomes much deeper and narrower. It continues flowing north-northwest for more than a mile alongside Pennsylvania Route 435 before turning south-southwest and briefly entering Dunmore before reentering Roaring Brook Township. After several tenths of a mile, the stream turns northwest for a few miles, crossing Interstate 84 and reentering Dunmore. It passes through the Scranton Water Company Reservoir and receives the tributary Little Roaring Brook from the right before turning south and then west. It then turns northwest and crosses Interstate 81 before turning southwest and passing through the Nay Aug Gorge. The stream turns northwest for several tenths of a mile before turning west-southwest and crossing US Route 11. After a few tenths of a mile, it reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River. Roaring Brook is approximately long. It joins the Lackawanna River upriver of its mouth. Tributaries Roaring Brook has eight named tributaries: Lake Run, East Branch Roaring Brook, Bear Brook, Van Brunt Creek, Kellum Creek, White Oak Run, Rock Bottom Creek, and Little Roaring Brook. Lake Run joins Roaring Brook upstream of its mouth and its watershed has an area of . East Branch Roaring Brook joins Roaring Brook upstream of its mouth and its watershed has an area of . Bear Brook joins Roaring Brook upstream of its mouth and its watershed has an area of . White Oak Run joins Roaring Brook upstream of its mouth and its watershed has an area of . Rock Bottom Creek joins Roaring Brook upstream of its mouth and its watershed has an area of . Little Roaring Brook joins Roaring Brook upstream of its mouth and its watershed has an area of . ==Hydrology== Roaring Brook has a high level of water quality downstream as far as Cobbs Gap. However, in its lower reaches, it is impacted by urban storm impacts and abandoned mining land. Silt from the DeNaples Auto Parts property washed into the stream in 1991. There are also stormwater impacts and combined sewer overflows in its lower reaches. Most of the stormwater flowing into the stream is associated with a combined sewer system in Scranton and Dunmore. Some highways in the watershed contribute stormwater as well. It is also affected by stormwater from the Daleville Shopping area, the village of Elmhurst, the borough of Moscow, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. There are 12 stormwater detention facilities in the watershed's lower reaches. The concentration of alkalinity in Roaring Brook between its headwaters and the Hollister Dam is 12 milligrams per liter. From the Hollister Dam to the Elmhurst Reservoir, the alkalinity concentration is 15 milligrams per liter. In the early 1900s, the stream was polluted by waste from coal mines upstream of its mouth. The stream experiences measurable flow loss, reaching up to 20 to 30 percent of its total flow in dry weather. In the 1970s, its turbidity ranged from 1 to 35 Jackson Turbidity Units at Scranton. In the 1960s and 1970s, several measurements of the concentration of manganese in Roaring Brook at Scranton ranged from 0.7 to 21 milligrams per liter and measurements of the calcium concentration ranged from 0.8 to 31.2 milligrams per liter. The concentration of sodium ranged from 6 to 20 milligrams per liter in two measurements and the potassium concentration ranged from 1 to 3.5 milligrams per liter. Two measurements of the concentration of recoverable chromium ranged from less than 20 to 30 micrograms per liter. The concentration of recoverable copper (in unfiltered water only) ranged from 30 to 200 micrograms per liter. The concentration of recoverable iron (in unfiltered water only) ranged from 0 to 444,000 micrograms per liter. The concentration of recoverable lead in the stream's unfiltered waters was found twice to be 50 micrograms per liter. The concentration of recoverable manganese in the stream's unfiltered waters ranged from 20 to 1600 micrograms per liter. The concentration of recoverable zinc in the stream's unfiltered waters ranged from 160 to 380 micrograms per liter. Trace amounts of nickel and silver have been found in the stream. The concentration of recoverable zinc in the stream's unfiltered waters ranged between 100 and 70,000 micrograms per liter. The concentration of recoverable mercury in the stream (with unfiltered water) was once found to be less than 0.5 micrograms per liter. In the 1960s and 1970s, several measurements of the concentration of dissolved oxygen in Roaring Brook at Scranton ranged from 10.0 to 12.6 milligrams per liter. The concentration of hydrogen ions in the stream had values ranging from 0.00004 to 0.04022 milligrams per liter. The carbon dioxide concentration was found to range from 0.3 to 252 milligrams per liter. Between 1928 and 1968, the bicarbonate concentration ranged from 22 to 141 milligrams per liter during three measurements. Between 1928 and the 1970s, the concentration of ammonia was found to range from 0 to 43.1 milligrams per liter and the nitrate concentration ranged from 0.1 to 18 milligrams per liter in three measurements in 1928 and 1968. The phosphorus concentration ranged from 0.040 to 13.6 milligrams per liter in the 1970s and the phosphate concentration ranged between 0 and 0.644 milligrams per liter. The concentration of fluoride in Roaring Brook at Scranton was once measured to be 0.2 milligrams per liter (in unfiltered water only). The chloride concentration ranged from 2 to 214 milligrams per liter during several measurements in the 20th century. The sulfate concentration ranged from 8 to 4700 milligrams per liter. During two measurements, the silica concentration ranged from 5.20 to 8.30 milligrams per liter. In two measurements in 1968, the specific conductance of Roaring Brook at Scranton ranged from 199 to 288 micro-siemens per centimeter at . The pH was measured to range from 4.4 to 8.8 and the acidity concentration ranged from 0 to 260 milligrams per liter in the 1960s and 1970s. The concentration of suspended solids ranged from 0 to 250 milligrams per liter and the concentration of settleable solids ranged between 0 and 4 milligrams per liter. The concentration of water hardness ranged from 12 to 160 milligrams per liter. The peak annual discharge at the mouth of Roaring Brook has a 10 percent chance of reaching 5260 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 10,500 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 13,800 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 26,000 cubic feet per second. Upstream of the tributary Little Roaring Brook, the peak annual discharge of Roaring Brook has a 10 percent chance of reaching 4520 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 9100 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 12,000 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 23,000 cubic feet per second. ==Geography, geology, and climate== Nay Aug Falls The elevation near the mouth of Roaring Brook is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. In its lower , the stream's gradient is per mile. Horace Hollister's 1885 History of the Lackawanna Valley noted that the stream was shallow at that time. According to Hollister, the stream appears to have been much larger in ancient times. His book also described Roaring Brook as being \\"the noisiest tributary of the Lackawanna\\". Roaring Brook begins on the Pocono Plateau. It flows through a water gap known as Cobbs Gap in the Moosic Mountains and there are numerous waterfalls and rapids along it. A waterfall known as the Nay Aug Falls is on Roaring Brook and the stream flows through the a gorge or canyon Nay Aug Gorge, which is listed on the National Register of Geologic Landmarks. The waterfall is a cascade with a height of and cuts through a soft siltstone formation and flows over conglomerate. A spring known as Chico's Spring is in the stream's watershed in Dunmore, as is a feature known as Barneys Ledge. The Madisonville Cliffs and Glen are located in the watershed in Madison Township and Covington Township. Additionally, numerous ponds, reservoirs, and water works are in the watershed. The upper reaches of the watershed of Roaring Brook contain rolling hills. However, the lower reaches are mountainous, with steep, high hills and a narrow valley from Elmhurst downstream to Dunmore. The stream's channel is sinuous, but has retaining walls in its lower reaches. The stream flows past rock formations consisting of sandstone, shale, and conglomerate, along with some coal. However, all of its tributaries begin outside of the coal measures. In the Nay Aug Gorge, the stream flows through conglomerate of the Pocono Formation and sandstone of the Llwellyn Formation. A hard white conglomerate known as the Pottsville or Pocono Conglomerate occurs along the stream near the Nay Aug Falls. Erosion by the stream in the Nay Aug Gorge has caused some areas to be undercut. There are also cliffs in the gorge, some over high. Roaring Brook flows through a concrete U-channel from Cedar Avenue to its mouth. Both the manmade and the natural parts of the channel have steep banks, with heights on the order of . An abandoned water power dam known as Step Falls is located on the stream in the Nay Aug Gorge. Much of the stream's channel and riparian area have been developed for flood control purposes. The stream is dammed by the Elmhurst Dam, which is in good condition as of May 1978. Upstream of Nay Aug, the channel of Roaring Brook is mainly natural and ranges in width from . It flows past some steep slopes and rock ledges in this reach. In its lower reaches, the stream flows through 30 pipes with diameters ranging from . A wide gravel and sand bar and some dumped trash occurs along the stream. The average annual rate of precipitation in the watershed of Roaring Brook ranges from . In the 1960s and 1970s, several measurements of the water temperature of the stream ranged from . The temperature near the stream during several measurements in May 2013 ranged from . ==Watershed== The watershed of Roaring Brook has an area of . It is in the Lower North Branch Susquehanna drainage basin. The watershed mainly occupies the southeastern part of Lackawanna County. However, a small area of its watershed is in Sterling Township, in Wayne County. Upstream of the tributary Little Roaring Brook, the watershed has an area of . The mouth of the stream is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Scranton. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Sterling. The stream also passes through the quadrangles of Olyphant and Moscow. Roaring Brook is the largest tributary of the Lackawanna River.The watershed of Spring Brook is slightly larger, but Roaring Brook is a few miles longer. It is a third-order stream. Its headwaters are situated immediately to the west of the watershed of the Lehigh River. Forested land comprises 70 percent of the watershed's upper reaches. 20 percent is agricultural land and 10 percent is developed. Some abandoned mine land occurs in the watershed as well. Other land uses include high-density residential land and downtown commercial land. Major roads in the watershed include Interstate 380, Interstate 84, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. South Washington Avenue is located near the stream's mouth. The University of Scranton is located near the stream. Wetlands in the watershed of Roaring Brook include the Freytown and Hollister swamps, which are located near the stream's headwaters. Between its headwaters and the Hollister Dam, the entire length of Roaring Brook is on private land. From the Hollister Dam to the Elmhurst Reservoir, 86 percent of its length is on private land. The remaining 14 percent is on private land that is open to access. Roaring Brook is one of the sources of flooding in Dunmore and Elmhurst Township. ==History== Harrison Avenue Bridge over Roaring Brook Roaring Brook was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1199947. The stream is also known as Roaring Creek or Roaring Branch Creek. The former variant name appears in United States Geological Survey topographical maps while the latter appears in Israel C. White's 1881 book The geology of Susquehanna County and Wayne County, Pennsylvania. The stream was historically known as Nay-aug. Nay-aug is a name derived from a Native American language meaning \\"roaring\\". The ancient Native American village of Capoose used to be within a mile of the mouth of Roaring Brook. An Indian war path used to cross the stream near what is now Scranton. The Slocum family constructed a gristmill on the stream in 1780 and Philip Abbott constructed a gristmill on the stream in 1788. Ebenezer Slocum and Benjamin Slocum built a forge along the stream in 1799 or 1800. Rolling mills also operated along it in the 19th century. The first bridge in Madison Township was constructed over the stream in 1830 by Nathaniel Carter. A Mr. Rupert constructed the first sawmill in Moscow on Roaring Brook in 1831. An iron works industry known as the Slocum Brothers Mill was constructed on Roaring Brook upstream of its mouth in 1838. It struggled at first, but by 1846 managed to get a contract to produce iron T rails for the New York and Lake Erie Railroad. The furnaces of the Lackawanna Coal and Iron Company once stood near the stream. A sawmill was constructed over the stream in Covington Township in 1840 and the first gristmill in that township was built on Roaring Brook in the northeastern part of that township in 1864. The first bridge over the stream was built in 1859. In 1870, the Scranton family constructed a mansion on the stream. In the early 1900s, the main industries in the watershed of Roaring Brook included agriculture, brick making, and coal mining. Around this time, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad followed the stream throughout much of its length and the Erie Railroad followed the stream from Elmhurst to its mouth. The former was created by an 1852 merger of the Cobbs Gap and Delaware Railroad and the Lackawanna and Western Railroad, which were previously in the stream's watershed. The main stem was used as a water supply for Scranton by the Scranton Gas and Water Company. It was also used as an industrial water supply by the Spencer Coal Company. The watershed continues to supply water to the Lackawanna Valley in the 21st century. In the early 1900s, major communities in the watershed included Scranton, Dunmore, Moscow, and Elmhurst. At the time, their populations were 129,867, 17,615, 650, and 379, respectively. A steel truss bridge with a length of was constructed over Roaring Brook in 1907 and is closed. A concrete arch bridge with a length of was built over the stream in 1917 and another bridge of the same type, but with a length of , was constructed in 1935. A steel girder and floorbeam system bridge with a length of was also constructed over the stream in that year and was repaired in 2006. A concrete culvert bridge with a length of was built across the stream in 1948 and three prestressed box beam or girders bridges carrying Ash Street, State Route 2005/Market Street, and State Route 3023/Cedar Ave were built in 1958. Another bridge of that type, with a length of , was built over the creek in 1961. A bridge carrying US Route 11 over the creek was built in 1969, as was a prestressed box beam or girders bridge. Their lengths are and , respectively. A seven-span bridge carrying Interstate 84 over Roaring Brook was constructed in 1974. In 1979, a two-span prestressed box beam or girders bridge with a length of was constructed across the stream. I 1996 two ten-span bridges carrying Interstate 81 over the stream were built in Dunmore. The last major flood in Dunmore occurred during Hurricane Diane in 1955. In this flood, floodwaters from Roaring Brook and another nearby stream damaged large areas in the lower-lying parts of Dunmore. The Pennsylvania Gas and Water Company's distribution system was severely damaged by the flood and a railroad car repair facility in the borough was so badly damaged that it was permanently abandoned. In 1960, the United States Army Corps of Engineers channelized of Roaring Brook. The stream is on the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Abandoned Mine Restoration's priority list for restoration. The stream is described in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan as being \\"significant natural and cultural resources\\". The stream has been studied several times. It was studied for the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission by Daniels in 1979, Copeland in 1990, and Moase in 1996. In 1985, Rider and Blacksmith studied the stream for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. In the early 2000s, Popps and McGurl studied the stream for the Lackawanna River Corridor Association. Large tracts of land in the watershed were once owned by the Pennsylvania Gas and Water Company, but later came to be owned by the Theta Corporation. There are numerous historic sites in the watershed of Roaring Brook. These include the Scranton Iron Furnaces (a state historic site) in Scranton, the Erie Arch in Dunmore, a Pennsylvania Coal Company building in Dunmore, the Pennsylvania Gravity Railroad in Dunmore and other locations, and the Mill Street Tubs and the Nay Aug tubs in Dunmore. Additionally, the Harrison Avenue Bridge, which crosses Roaring Brook in Scranton, is on the National Register of Historic Places and the Historic American Buildings Survey. The bridge is \\"a symbol of the city's [Scranton's] progressive era in the early 20th century\\". ==Biology== Wild trout naturally reproduce in Roaring Brook from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. The stream's drainage basin is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its headwaters downstream to the Elmhurst Reservoir. From the Elmhurst Reservoir downstream to its mouth, it is a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. The stream is also considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters for both brook trout and brown trout from its headwaters to the Hollister Dam, a distance of . From the Hollister Dam to the Elmhurst Reservoir (a distance of ), it is Class A Wild Trout Waters for brook trout. The tributary Lake Run is also Class A Wild Trout Waters for brook trout and brown trout and the tributary Kellum Creek is Class A Wild Trout Waters for brook trout. Upstream of the Hollister Reservoir, Roaring Brook meets the criteria for an Exceptional Value designation. Wolves, bears, wildcats, and panthers historically inhabited the area in the vicinity of Roaring Brook. Numerous macroinvertebrate taxa have been observed in Roaring Brook upstream of the Hollister Reservoir, including 16 genera from the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera. In a 212-individual sample, 2 individuals from the family Baetidae, 25 individuals from the family Ephemerellidae, 35 from the family Heptageniidae, 2 from the family Leptophlebiidae, 1 from the family Leuctridae, and 11 from the family Perlidae were observed. Additionally, the sample included 5 individuals from the family Glossosomatidae, 61 from the family Hydropsychidae, 5 from the family Philopotamidae, 1 from the family Polycentropodidae, 4 from the family Rhyacophilidae, and 2 from the family Uenoidae. Additionally, there was 1 individual from the family Elmidae, 5 from the family Psephenidae, 3 from the family Corydalidae, 1 from the family Aeshnidae, 42 from the family Chironomidae, 5 from the family Tipulidae, and 1 from the family Cambaridae. Boreal forest trees such as black spruce, paper birch, and tamarack inhabit wetlands in the watershed of Roaring Brook. Plants such as mountain laurel, leather leaf, pitcher plant, rhododendron, huckleberry, and lady's slipper inhabit bogs in these wetlands. Old-growth forests containing oak, pine, and hemlock trees are also present in the Nay Aug Gorge. Upstream of Ridge Row, the stream's riparian buffer is wooded with some rock outcrops. Upstream of Nay Aug, the riparian canopy is mostly intact. Some hemlock trees in the Nay Aug Gorge have been affected by hemlock wooly adelgid. The modified Hilsenhoff Biotic Index value of Roaring Brook upstream of the Hollister Reservoir is 3.25 and the modified EPT Index value is 12. The total taxa richness is 26. Downstream of the reservoir, the modified Hilsenhoff Biotic Index value is 3.1 and the modified EPT Index value is 17. The total taxa richness is 26. ==Recreation== In the early 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan recommended constructing a greenway and connecting trail along Roaring Brook. Planned trails in the greenway include the North Pocono rail trail and a link to the Nay Aug Park. The conservation plan recommended linking such a trail to the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail. A proposed pedestrian loop trail would have a footbridge over the stream. Tourism opportunities in the watershed of Roaring Brook include the Steamtown excursion line, the Lackawanna Trolley line. A city park known as Oakmont Park is in the vicinity of the stream. There are extensive areas of asphalt in the park, but adding green infrastructure has been proposed. A 142-acre public park known as the Nay Aug Park is also in the watershed. It was founded and 1893 and was popular until the 1950s, when the area entered an economic decline. The park once had a wooden roller coaster and a small zoo, the latter of which was reopened in 2003. There is a ball field at the mouth of the stream. ==See also== *Stafford Meadow Brook, next tributary of the Lackawanna River going downriver *Meadow Brook (Lackawanna River), next tributary of the Lackawanna River going upriver *List of rivers of Pennsylvania *List of tributaries of the Lackawanna River ==NotesReferences== Category:Rivers of Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of the Lackawanna River Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania ","title":"Roaring Brook (Lackawanna River tributary)"},{"id":"46325217","text":"Mamadou Sylla Diallo (born 20 March 1994) is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays for Segunda Divisi√≥n club Girona as a forward. ==Football career== Born in K√©dougou,‚ÄúNo se puede decir que no a un club hist√≥rico como el Racing‚Äù, Mamadou Sylla (\\"You cannot say no to a historical club like Racing\\", Mamadou Sylla); Racing Santander, 31 March 2015 Sylla moved to Spain in 2004, aged ten, and joined FC Barcelona's youth setup in 2009.Mamadou Sylla, presentado con el Racing de Santander (Mamadou Sylla, presented with Racing de Santander); Sport, 31 March 2015 He subsequently represented CE Matar√≥ and RCD Espanyol, and made his senior debuts with the latter's reserve team in 2013, in Segunda Divisi√≥n B.

He gained great renownedness in the German-speaking area by numerous Kasperle, Pumuckl and fairytale-radio plays records and also adapted plays for the Swiss German language. == Life == Born in Z√ºrich, canton of Z√ºrich, in Switzerland, J√∂rg Schneider lived in the municipality of Wetzikon. For three years he attended the teacher training college, before he completed a commercial apprenticeship.

In plant spores it is also referred to as the exine. Some bacteria also produce endospores with an exosporium, of which the most commonly studied are Bacillus species, particularly Bacillus cereus and the anthrax-causing bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The exosporium is the portion of the spore that interacts with the environment or host organism, and may contain spore antigens. Exosporium proteins, such as Cot protein, are also discovered related to strains of B. anthracis and B.cereus. This Cot protein share similar sequences with other spore coat proteins, and their putative determinants are believed to include bxpC, lunA, exsA, etc. In Bacillus anthraces, salt and detergent washing of exosporium fragments can identify proteins that are likely to represent structural or integral exosporium proteins. Seven proteins have been identified in washed exosporium: alanine racemase, inosine hydrolase, ExsF, CotY, ExsY, CotB, and a novel protein, ExsK. CotY, ExsY and CotB are homologues of Bacillus subtilis outer spore coat proteins, but ExsF and ExsK are specific to B. anthracis and other members of the Bacillus cereus group. The protein ywdL has been identified in B. cereus as important for exosporium formation. In the absence of the ywdL gene, a fragile and easily damaged exosporium is formed, which can be damaged by mechanical disruption such as freeze-thaw cycles. However, ywdL is not required to maintain the internal organization of the exosporium. ŒîywdL spores have abnormal germination properties, such as the inability to respond to standard chemical means of inducing germination by treatment with calcium dipicolinate. ==References== Category:Microbiology ","title":"Exosporium"},{"id":"46325366","text":"The New Sidewalk is the second studio album by American punk rock band Such Gold.

It was released on January 19, 2005 and runs for 120 minutes. The name of the film comes from one of the main characters, Hassan Aabu Ali. ==Plot== The movie is about a young man, Hassan, who struggles to provide for his family. Hassan works for car smugglers in a garage where they collect cars that are illegally transported. One day, his sister had a fight with her husband for cheating on her and because he brought his girlfriend into their house. As he also hit her, she and her children went back to her family's house. When her brother, Hassan Abu Ali, was woken up by his sister's cries, he heard of what had happened to her and went to avenge his sister. When Hassan is taken to the police station, he acted smart in front of the police general and told him that he was being beaten by the other police officers. As a result of that, the dean let him go and gave him a card, so he could call him whenever he had any problem. He comes back to find his little brother, who was beaten by his sister's husband, in a critical condition. He finds out that his brother suffers from a congenital heart defect and needs surgery. Hassan tries to get money from his boss, but he gave him so little that he refused to take it. Hassan then thinks of stealing money from his boss‚Äô garage. When he runs away after stealing the money, Hassan meets a woman called Salma. Hassan pushes his friend, Amin, in front of her car so that they could both get a ride to escape. Salma does not know what was happening, but Hassan uses her to help him escape from the police. As they are escaping from the police, the policeman shot his colleague and dies. The policeman later blames Hassan for killing him. He then escapes with Salma. In the beginning Salma did not agree with their plan of running away. Instead, she wanted to tell the police what had happened, and that she had nothing to do with their run. However, she changes her mind and agrees on helping Hassan when she sees him with his younger brother, who needs surgery. During their runaway they fall in love. They have been close to getting caught both by the smugglers and the police. Later, Hassan decides to call the dean of the police, and agreed about a plan to catch the police officer. At the end of the movie, they all gather in the amusement park where they all struggle to get the money. The officer plans to kill Hassan and the smugglers, so he could get the entire bag of money for himself. However, his plan does not succeed, and the general catches him. They all get sent to jail, including Hassan. Salma promises Hassan that she would be waiting for him after he gets out of jail in 9 months. ==Cast== *Karim Abdel Aziz as Hassan Abu Ali *Mona Zaki as Salma *Talaat Zakaria as Amin (Hassan's friend) *Khaled Al Sawy as Saied Aleraky (police officer) *Ahmed Fouad Selim as police general (inspector) *Magdi Idris as the smuggler's leader *Entisaar as Hassan's friend who's a dancer *Enaam Salousa as Hassan's mother *Hadi Khafajah as Hassan's injured brother ==References * Category:2005 films Category:Egyptian films Category:2005 romantic comedy films Category:2005 comedy films Category:Egyptian romantic comedy films ","title":"Aabu Ali"},{"id":"46325413","text":"Benezette, also known as Benezett, is an unincorporated community in Elk County, Pennsylvania, United States.

Amazon Dash consists of multiple components, which include: * the Amazon Dash Wand, a Wi-Fi connected barcode scanner and voice command device, used to reorder consumer goods around the house, integrating with AmazonFresh; * the Amazon Dash Button, a small consumer electronic device that can be placed around the house and programmed to order a consumer good such as disinfectant wipes or paper towels; and * the Amazon Dash Replenishment Service, which allows manufacturers to add a physical button or auto-detection capability to their devices to reorder supplies from Amazon when necessary. * Amazon Virtual Dash Buttons, which mimic the appearance and function of physical Dash Buttons, but are displayed on Amazon's website and some smart devices with displays. == Barcode scanner == The Amazon Dash Wand (originally branded simply Amazon Dash) was announced in April 2014. It is a Wi-Fi connected device that allows users to build a shopping list by scanning bar codes and saying product names out loud. It connects directly with AmazonFresh, the company's online grocery delivery service. The website for Amazon Dash highlights benefits such as \\"never forget an item again\\" and suggests users keep the device on the kitchen counter or refrigerator so that every member of the family can add items to its grocery list. The Amazon Dash Wand is Amazon's first Internet of Things (IoT) device. The second-generation Amazon Dash Barcode Scanner was announced in October 2016; it replaces the two buttons on the previous model with a single button used for both scanning barcodes and activating the microphone. The new model is also about an inch shorter and magnetic so it can be stuck to a metallic surface, like a refrigerator. On June 15, 2017, a new version of the scanner was announced by Amazon. The new version has Alexa built in, allowing users to ask for recipes and order from Amazon Prime Now. == Replenishment service == The Dash Button and Dash Replenishment Service (DRS) were introduced by Amazon.com on March 31, 2015. Due to the timing of the announcement, there were a number of news stories questioning whether the Dash Button was an early April Fools joke. The Amazon Dash Button is a small electronic device designed to make ordering products easy and fast. The Dash buttons come in packs; each device contains an embedded button emblazoned with the name of a frequently ordered product. Users can configure each button to order a specific product and quantity, via the user's Amazon.com account, and mount the buttons, using adhesive tape or a plastic clip, to locations where they use the products. Pressing the button sends a Wi-Fi signal to the Amazon Shopping app, and orders new stock of whatever product the button is configured to order; the click also sends a message to the user's mobile phone, giving the user a half-hour to cancel. ==Roll-out and response== Initially, the Dash buttons were made available by invitation to Amazon Prime members who were invited to request the devices. The devices received mixed reviews from critics and reporters upon release, and have been parodied online. In Germany, the product was deemed illegal due to insufficient information about the price of the product being given at the time of purchase. It is part of a larger issue between Amazon and Germany, where Amazon battles with unions and is under investigation for attempting to monopolize the country. Amazon Dash Buttons initially partnered with more than 100 brands. The most popular Dash Buttons are the Tide, Bounty, and Cottonelle buttons. ==Alternative use== In May 2016, Consumers' Research pointed out that Amazon Dash may be reprogrammed to use for other purposes such as ordering pizza, tracking time, and controlling lights and outlets in households configured to respond to such commands. In response, Amazon introduced a programmer-friendly, but more expensive button in the form of an \\"Internet of Things Dash Button\\" which allows programmers to make programming modifications to the device. == End of service == On March 1, 2019, Amazon discontinued the series, claiming that it was made unnecessary due to automatic reordering and product subscriptions. Additionally, Amazon claimed that voice-activated shopping on Alexa products would succeed the buttons.\\"Amazon scraps Dash buttons\\". BBC News. March 1, 2019. Retrieved March 2, 2019. On June 22, 2020, Amazon sent an email to owners of the Dash Wand stating that they would be disconnected in a month on July 21, 2020 with no recourse other than to use other Amazon devices, and directed owners to simply recycle their devices.\\"Amazon Dash Wand No More ‚Äì Alexa Shopping Device Discontinued\\". voicebot.ai.

She is known for linking adverse childhood experiences and toxic stress with harmful effects to health later in life. Hailed as a pioneer in the treatment of toxic stress, she is an advisory council member for Hillary Rodham Clinton's Clinton Foundation's Too Small to Fail campaign, and the founder and former chief executive officer of the Center for Youth Wellness. Her work was also featured in Paul Tough's book How Children Succeed. == Early life and education == Burke Harris was born in 1975 in Vancouver, British Columbia. She received her bachelor's degree in integrative biology from the University of California, Berkeley in 1996 and her medical degree from the University of California, Davis. She completed her residency in pediatrics at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, within Stanford University School of Medicine. After earning her master's degree in public health from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, she went on to serve a residency at Stanford in pediatrics. Her graduate studies were supported by The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans. == Early career == In 2005, Burke Harris joined the California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC) staff, where she was tasked with the goal of developing programs to end health disparities in San Francisco. While at Harvard, Burke Harris identified access to health care as a key component of health disparities in San Francisco. In 2007, with support from CPMC, she became the founding physician of the Bayview Child Health Center and medical director of the new clinic. == Career == In 2008, after reading \\"The Relationship of Adverse Childhood Experiences to Adult Health: Turning Gold Into Lead,\\" by Vincent J. Felitti, Burke Harris realized that her patients' traumatic experiences were having a negative impact on their present and future health. In 2011, she was appointed by the American Academy of Pediatrics to the Project Advisory Committee for the Resilience Project. From 2010 to 2012, Burke Harris co-founded the Adverse Childhood Experiences project in the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood in San Francisco, with colleagues Daniel Lurie from Tipping Point Foundation, Kamala Harris, Victor G. Carrion, Lenore Anderson, Lisa Pritzker, and Katie Albright. From this effort, the Center for Youth Wellness was created in 2012 to create a clinical model that recognizes the impact of adverse experiences on health and effectively treats toxic stress in children. The multidisciplinary approach focuses on preventing and undoing the chemical, physiological and neurodevelopmental results of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). The Center integrates primary health care, mental health and wellness, research, policy, education, and community and family support services to children and families. In 2014, she spoke at a TED event titled TEDMED in San Francisco. Her talk, \\"How Childhood Trauma Affects Health Across a Lifetime,\\" had reached over 7.2 million viewers on TED.com as of June 2020. Nadine Burke Harris presents a COVID-19 educational video during her role as California Surgeon General in 2020. In 2018, Burke Harris released her first book The Deepest Well: Healing the Long-Term Effects of Childhood Adversity, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. On January 21, 2019, California Governor Gavin Newsom appointed her as the state's first surgeon general. She was sworn in on February 11, 2019. == The Center for Youth Wellness == Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are defined as preventable and traumatic early experiences; they can range from exposure to violence, poverty and neglect, to physical, emotional and sexual abuse. As a result, it may increase the likelihood for \\"risky health behaviors, chronic health conditions, low life potential, and early death\\" in adulthood. Exposure to ACEs may lead to toxic stress, which varies from typical stress in that it is chronic and excessive, and results in antagonistic physiological responses that can lead to poor health outcomes in life. The Center for Youth Wellness (CYW) aims to improve child and adolescent health by targeting the effects of Adverse Childhood Experiences. A main goal of the CYW is that \\"every pediatrician in the United States will screen for Adverse Childhood Experiences by 2028.\\" More specifically, they target ACEs in San Francisco's Bayview/Hunter's Point neighborhood, a generally underserved area that had a poverty rate of 39% in 2010. The CYW identified that exposure to ACEs, along with high violence, increases the likelihood for detrimental health outcomes in this neighborhood. They use a combination of ACEs risk screening (via questionnaire), care coordination, and multidisciplinary treatment (primary care, psychotherapy, psychiatry and biofeedback). == Personal == Nadine married Arno Lockheart Harris in 2011 at Dawn Ranch Lodge in Guerneville, California. == Committee appointments == * 2002‚Äì2003, Graduate Medical Education Committee, Stanford University Medical Center * 2003‚Äì2004, Post-Doctoral Education Committee, Stanford University Medical Center * 2004‚Äì2005, Liaison Committee on Medical Education Task Force, Stanford University School of Medicine * 2004‚Äì2007, board of directors, San Francisco Urban Service Project * 2005‚Äì2009, Citizen's Committee for Community Development (Appt by: Mayor Gavin Newsom) * 2008‚Äì2013, Asthma Resource Council, board of directors * 2011‚Äìpresent, American Academy of Pediatrics' The Resilience Project * 2012‚Äìpresent, California Health and Human Services Agency' Jerry Brown' Let's Get Healthy California Task Force, Expert Advisor == Awards == * 1999, The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans * 2013, Humanism in Medicine award, Gold Humanism Honor Societyhttp://humanism- in-medicine.org/programs/awards/specialty-society-awards-for-practicing- doctors/2013-specialty-society-awards/ * 2014, Leadership award, James Irvine Foundation * 2016, 21st Annual Heinz Award in Human Condition == Selected works == * 2002 Shaping America's Health Care Professions: The Dramatic Rise of Multiculturalism.

Leopoldine Eleonora of Neuburg (Leopoldine Eleonora Josepha; 27 May 1679 - 8 March 1693), was by birth Countess Palatine of Neuburg and member of the House of Wittelsbach. Born in Neuburg an der Donau, she was the youngest of seventeen children of Philip William, Duke of Neuburg, Berg and J√ºlich, Elector Palatine of Neuburg and his wife Landgravine Elisabeth Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt. ==Life== Leopoldine's oldest sister, Eleanor Magdalene, became the Holy Roman Empress in 1676, as the third wife of Leopold I; this even helped her numerous siblings to secure brilliant careers and marriages. After her father's death in 1690, Leopoldine was under the legal guardianship of her older brother Johann Wilhelm, who also supervised her education. In addition to language, religion, and handicrafts, the young princess learned music from the Kapellmeister Sebastiano Moratelli. In the summer of 1691, Leopoldine became ill after a difficult trip from Neuburg to D√ºsseldorf. It was there that, thanks to the care and affection of her sister-in-law, Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, her condition improved again. In March 1693, she was formally betrothed to Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria,Gustav Pr√ºmm: Ein Gewinn f√ºrs ganze Leben, Books on Demand, 2009, p. 40. whose first wife, Maria Antonia of Austria, had died in December 1692. However, shortly after, Leopoldine died in D√ºsseldorf, aged 13, after seven days of fever. She was buried in the Church of St. Andreas in D√ºsseldorf; however, her heart was placed in the Electoral crypt of Neuburg, and with the heart of her brother Philip William August (who died just one month later, on 5 April), were later placed in the coffin of their mother when she died in 1709. Today, Leopoldine's coffin is in the Mausoleum of St. Andreas. In 2007, the coffin was opened for decontamination; the mummified remains of the princess were buried in silk stockings, a fact that suggests that she died of tuberculosis. ==ReferencesBibliography== *Linda Maria Koldau: Frauen-Musik-Kultur: ein Handbuch zum deutschen Sprachgebiet der Fr√ºhen Neuzeit, B√∂hlau Verlag K√∂ln Weimar, 2005, p. 181\\\\. ==External links== *Wolfgang Kaps: Leopoldine Eleonore (Josepha) von Pfalz-Neuburg (1679 ‚Äì 1693) in: pfalzneuburg.de [retrieved 5 March 2015].

After graduating from Lanier High School in 1957, Sosa served in the United States Marine Corps. Sosa had long dreamed of being an artist and tried to join the Walt Disney Animation Studios while living in San Clemente, California. He mailed a portfolio of his work to Disney but ran low on funds and had to return to San Antonio after two months. The portfolio was mailed back with a letter stating that the company was \\"adequately staffed.\\" His first real job after the Marines was for O. P. Schabel; he spent four years emptying and repainting litter cans around San Antonio and was paid $1.75 for each can. During his time with Schnabel, Sosa landed a job with Texas Neon designing neon signs, continuing his work on the litter cans on nights and weekends. Sosa opened his graphic design studio, SosArt, in 1967. Sosa entered political advertising by supporting John Tower. With Sosa's support, Tower won 37% of the Hispanic vote. The previous Hispanic best vote percent for a statewide republican candidate had been below 8%. The success of Sosa's agency in the Tower campaign led several national companies, including Bacardi, Coors, and Dr Pepper to seek his advice for reaching the Hispanic audience. In 1980 Sosa created a new Agency, Sosa and Associates (now Bromley Communications), which eventually became the largest Hispanic advertising agency in the United States. Sosa's experience with Tower led him to become active in presidential politics, serving as an adviser Republican campaigns, such as those of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. Sosa was named one of the twenty five most influential Hispanics in America by Time Magazine. Sosa has also been named to the Texas Business Hall of fame. In June 2016, Sosa wrote an op-ed in his hometown newspaper calling on the Republican presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump to apologize for his comments on Mexican immigrants. Sosa stated that it was likely that he would leave the Republican party if Trump won the nomination at the 2016 Republican National Convention. In late August 2016, Sosa joined Gary Johnson's presidential campaign as co-chair of Hispanic outreach. Thereafter, in October 2016, Sosa changed his voting intentions to supporting Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, as to \\"make a statement that Donald Trump cannot win.\\" ==References== Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:American advertising executives Category:American people of Mexican descent Category:Hispanic and Latino American businesspeople Category:People from San Antonio Category:Texas Republicans ","title":"Lionel Sosa"},{"id":"46325662","text":"The Way Out () () is a German-Russian 2015 short film directed, written and produced by Mikhail Uchitelev.

Edith (Elina Amromina) is a Jewish opera diva that has been hidden away from the Nazis by Gustav (Alexander Alexeyev), who puts her in the theater's cellar during the occupation. Despite his reassurances that she will not be found, Edith knows that Gustav's help puts his own life at risk and decides that she must leave the theater to avoid this. Gustav tries to convince her that there must be a different option, but Edith is too terrified to listen and tries to escape. She's brought back by Gustav but is unfortunately seen by Nazis in the process. The Nazi commandant (Artur Kharitonenko) storms into the theater and demands that Gustav hands over Edith or he will be killed. Viewing all of this from a corner of the theater, Edith decides that she must leave for the commandant's office and surrender. Aware that this is her intention, Gustav tries to intercept her and in the process witnesses a murder of someone that he believes to be Edith. However unbeknownst to him this was not Edith, who instead locked herself in the cellar while she tries to find another way out. The next day she decides to go to the commandant's office and save Gustav's life. As the theater is completely cordoned off she sees only one way out. ==Cast== * Elina Amromina as Edith Goldschmidt * Alexander Alexeyev as Gustav, a theater director * Alexey Morozov as Tenor * Tatiana Ryabokon as Make-up artist * Artur Kharitonenko as SS commandant ==Reception== The Way Out received generally positive reviews and the Saint Petersburg Evening Post praised the work for effectively using its 33-minute length to its advantage.

He immigrated to the United States in 1929, enrolling at San Mateo Junior College before briefly attending New York University. In 1937 he began studying direct carving at under Chaim Gross at the American Artists School. His pieces were included in the 1939 New York World's Fair alongside those of Isamu Noguchi. Another influence was sculptor Henry Moore, whose work Amino encountered on a trip to England in 1938. Amino's artistic career was briefly halted by World War II, during which he served in the US Navy as a translator. After the war concluded, he noticed the increased availability of synthetic resin due to its use as a substitute for materials that were needed for the war effort. He became the first artist to experiment with and use synthetic resin as an artistic medium, alternating between resin and wood in his sculptures. In the summers of 1946 and 1950, he taught at Black Mountain College, and from 1952 until 1977 taught at Cooper Union. Amino died on December 1, 1989, in New York City. His work is held at institutions including the Asheville Art Museum, Carnegie Museum of Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Montclair Art Museum, The Museum of Modern Art, Newark Museum, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University. == Group Exhibitions == * Carvers- Modelers-Welders, Museum of Modern Art, New York (1950) * American Sculpture, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (1951) * The New Decade: 35 American Painters and Sculptors, Whitney Museum of American Art (1955) * Plastics, John Daniels Gallery (1965) * A Plastic Presence, The Jewish Museum, New York (1970; also traveled to the Milwaukee Art Center and the San Francisco Museum of Art) * Vital Forms: American Art and Design in the Atomic Age, Brooklyn Museum, New York (2001; also traveled to the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Frist Center for the Visual Arts, Nashville; San Diego Museum of Art; and Phoenix Art Museum) * Black Mountain College: Una aventura americana, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a, Madrid (2003) * Leap Before You Look: Black Mountain College 1933‚Äì1957, Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2015‚Äì2016; also traveled to Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, 2016; and Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, 2016‚Äì2017) == Solo Exhibitions == * Polymorphic Sculpture: Leo Amino‚Äôs Experiments in Three Dimensions, Zimmerli Art Museum, Rutgers State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick (October 20, 2018‚ÄîApril 12, 2020) * Leo Amino: The Visible and the Invisible, David Zwirner Gallery, New York (March 19‚ÄîApril 25, 2020) * Leo Amino: Black Mountain College Sculptor, Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center, Asheville (September 11, 2020‚ÄîJanuary 11, 2021) == References  Bibliography == * Category:College of San Mateo alumni Category:American artists of Japanese descent Category:Japanese emigrants to the United States Category:American military personnel of Japanese descent Category:Black Mountain College faculty Category:Cooper Union faculty Category:1911 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Abstract expressionist artists Category:Japanese sculptors Category:American sculptors ","title":"Leo Amino"},{"id":"46325725","text":"Tencent Maps is a desktop and web mapping service application and technology provided by Tencent, offering satellite imagery, street maps, street view and historical view perspectives, as well as functions such as a route planner for traveling by foot, car, or with public transportation.

The actual medcouple is the median of the bottom distribution, marked at 0.188994 with a yellow line. In statistics, the medcouple is a robust statistic that measures the skewness of a univariate distribution. It is defined as a scaled median difference of the left and right half of a distribution. Its robustness makes it suitable for identifying outliers in adjusted boxplots. Ordinary box plots do not fare well with skew distributions, since they label the longer unsymmetrical tails as outliers. Using the medcouple, the whiskers of a boxplot can be adjusted for skew distributions and thus have a more accurate identification of outliers for non-symmetrical distributions. As a kind of order statistic, the medcouple belongs to the class of incomplete generalised L-statistics. Like the ordinary median or mean, the medcouple is a nonparametric statistic, thus it can be computed for any distribution. == Definition == In order to harmonise with zero-based indexing in many programming languages, we will index from zero in all that follows. Let X := \\\\\\\\{x_0 \\\\geq x_1 \\\\geq \\\\ldots \\\\geq x_{n-1}\\\\\\\\} be an ordered sample of size n, and let x_m be the median of X. Define the sets ::X^+ := \\\\\\\\{x_i ~~ x_i \\\\geq x_m \\\\\\\\}, ::X^- := \\\\\\\\{x_j ~~ x_j \\\\leq x_m \\\\\\\\}, of sizes p := X^+ and q := X^- respectively. For x_i^+ \\\\in X^+ and x_j^- \\\\in X^-, we define the kernel function :h(x_i^+, x_j^-) := \\\\begin{cases} \\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{(x_i^+ - x_m) - (x_m - x_j^-)}{x_i^+ - x_j^-} & \\\\text { if } x_i^+ > x_j^-, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{signum} (p - 1 - i - j) & \\\\text{ if } x_i^+ = x_m = x_j^-, \\\\end{cases} where \\\\operatorname{signum} is the sign function.

In other words, we split the distribution into all values greater or equal to the median and all values less than or equal to the median. We define a kernel function whose first variable is over the p greater values and whose second variable is over the q lesser values. For the special case of values tied to the median, we define the kernel by the signum function. The medcouple is then the median over all pq values of h(x_i^+, x_j^-). Since the medcouple is not a median applied to all (x_i, x_j) couples, but only to those for which x_i^+ \\\\geq x_m \\\\geq x_j^-, it belongs to the class of incomplete generalised L-statistics. == Properties of the medcouple == The medcouple has a number of desirable properties. A few of them are directly inherited from the kernel function.  The medcouple kernel  We make the following observations about the kernel function h(x_i^+, x_j^-): # The kernel function is location-invariant. If we add or subtract any value to each element of the sample X, the corresponding values of the kernel function do not change. # The kernel function is scale- invariant. Equally scaling all elements of the sample X does not alter the values of the kernel function. These properties are in turn inherited by the medcouple. Thus, the medcouple is independent of the mean and standard deviation of a distribution, a desirable property for measuring skewness. For ease of computation, these properties enable us to define the two sets ::Z^+ := \\\\left.\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{x_i^+ - x_m}{r} ~\\\\right~ x_i^+ \\\\in X^+\\\\right\\\\\\\\} ::Z^- := \\\\left.\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{x_j^- - x_m}{r} ~\\\\right~ x_j^- \\\\in X^-\\\\right\\\\\\\\} where r = 2 \\\\max_{0 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n-1} x_i . This makes the set Z := Z^+ \\\\cup Z^- have range of at most 1, median 0, and keep the same medcouple as X. For Z, the medcouple kernel reduces to ::h(z_i^+, z_j^-) := \\\\begin{cases} \\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{z_i^+ + z_j^-}{z_i^+ - z_j^-} & \\\\text { if } z_i^+ > z_j^- \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{signum} (p - 1 - i - j) & \\\\text{ if } z_i^+ = 0 = z_j^- \\\\end{cases} Using the recentred and rescaled set Z we can observe the following. # * The kernel function is between -1 and 1, that is, h(z_i^+, z_j^-) \\\\leq 1. This follows from the reverse triangle inequality a - b \\\\leq a - b with a = z_i^+ and b = z_j^- and the fact that z_i^+ \\\\geq 0 \\\\geq z_j^-. #The medcouple kernel h(z_i^+, z_j^-) is non-decreasing in each variable. This can be verified by the partial derivatives \\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial z_i^+} and \\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial z_j^-}, both nonnegative, since z_i^+ \\\\geq 0 \\\\geq z_j^-. With properties 1, 2, and 4, we can thus define the following matrix, :: H :=(h_{ij}) = (h(z_i^+, z_j^-)) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} h(z_0^+, z_0^-) & \\\\cdots & h(z_0^+, z_{q - 1}^-) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ h(z_{p -1}^+, z_0^-) & \\\\cdots & h(z_{p -1}^+, z_{q - 1}^-) \\\\end{pmatrix}. If we sort the sets Z^+ and Z^- in decreasing order, then the matrix H has sorted rows and sorted columns, :: H = \\\\begin{pmatrix} h(z_0^+, z_0^-) & \\\\geq & \\\\cdots & \\\\geq & h(z_0^+, z_{q - 1}^-) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\geq & & & & \\\\geq \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & & \\\\ddots & & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\geq & & & & \\\\geq \\\\\\\\\\\\ h(z_{p -1}^+, z_0^-) & \\\\geq & \\\\cdots & \\\\geq & h(z_{p -1}^+, z_{q - 1}^-) \\\\end{pmatrix}. The medcouple is then the median of this matrix with sorted rows and sorted columns. The fact that the rows and columns are sorted allows the implementation of a fast algorithm for computing the medcouple.  Robustness  The breakdown point is the number of values that a statistic can resist before it becomes meaningless, i.e. the number of arbitrarily large outliers that the data set X may have before the value of the statistic is affected. For the medcouple, the breakdown point is 25%, since it is a median taken over the couples (x_i, x_j) such that x_i \\\\geq x_m \\\\geq x_j.  Values  Like all measures of skewness, the medcouple is positive for distributions that are skewed to the right, negative for distributions skewed to the left, and zero for symmetrical distributions. In addition, the values of the medcouple are bounded by 1 in absolute value. == Algorithms for computing the medcouple == Before presenting medcouple algorithms, we recall that there exist O(n) algorithms for the finding the median. Since the medcouple is a median, ordinary algorithms for median- finding are important.  Na√Øve algorithm  The na√Øve algorithm for computing the medcouple is slow. It proceeds in two steps. First, it constructs the medcouple matrix H which contains all of the possible values of the medcouple kernel. In the second step, it finds the median of this matrix. Since there are pq \\\\approx \\\\frac{n^2}{4} entries in the matrix in the case when all elements of the data set X are unique, the algorithmic complexity of the na√Øve algorithm is O(n^2). More concretely, the na√Øve algorithm proceeds as follows. Recall that we are using zero-based indexing. function na√Øve_medcouple(vector X): // X is a vector of size n. // Sorting in decreasing order can be done in-place in O(n log n) time sort_decreasing(X) xm := median(X) xscale := 2 * max(abs(X)) // Define the upper and lower centred and rescaled vectors // they inherit X's own decreasing sorting Zplus := [(x - xm)/xscale  x in X such that x >= xm] Zminus := [(x - xm)/xscale  x in X such that x <= xm] p := size(Zplus) q := size(Zminus) // Define the kernel function closing over Zplus and Zminus function h(i, j): a := Zplus[i] b := Zminus[j] if a == b: return signum(p - 1 - i - j) else: return (a + b) / (a - b) endif endfunction // O(n^2) operations necessary to form this vector H := [h(i, j)  i in [0, 1, ..., p - 1] and j in [0, 1, ..., q - 1 return median(H) endfunction The final call to \`median\` on a vector of size O(n^2) can be done itself in O(n^2) operations, hence the entire na√Øve medcouple algorithm is of the same complexity.  Fast algorithm  The fast algorithm outperforms the na√Øve algorithm by exploiting the sorted nature of the medcouple matrix H. Instead of computing all entries of the matrix, the fast algorithm uses the Kth pair algorithm of Johnson & Mizoguchi. The first stage of the fast algorithm proceeds as the na√Øve algorithm. We first compute the necessary ingredients for the kernel matrix, H = (h_{ij}), with sorted rows and sorted columns in decreasing order. Rather than computing all values of h_{ij}, we instead exploit the monotonicity in rows and columns, via the following observations.  Comparing a value against the kernel matrix  First, we note that we can compare any u with all values h_{ij} of H in O(n) time. For example, for determining all i and j such that h_{ij} > u, we have the following function: function greater_h(kernel h, int p, int q, real u): // h is the kernel function, h(i,j) gives the ith, jth entry of H // p and q are the number of rows and columns of the kernel matrix H // vector of size p P := vector(p) // indexing from zero j := 0 // starting from the bottom, compute the least upper bound for each row for i := p - 1, p - 2, ..., 1, 0: // search this row until we find a value less than u while j < q and h(i, j) > u: j := j + 1 endwhile // the entry preceding the one we just found is greater than u P[i] := j - 1 endfor return P endfunction This \`greater_h\` function is traversing the kernel matrix from the bottom left to the top right, and returns a vector P of indices that indicate for each row where the boundary lies between values greater than u and those less than or equal to u. This method works because of the row-column sorted property of H = (h_{ij}). Since \`greater_h\` computes at most p + q values of h_{ij}, its complexity is O(n). Conceptually, the resulting P vector can be visualised as establishing a boundary on the matrix as suggested by the following diagram, where the red entries are all larger than u: ::175px The symmetric algorithm for computing the values of h_{ij} less than u is very similar. It instead proceeds along H in the opposite direction, from the top right to the bottom left: function less_h(kernel h, int p, int q, real u): // vector of size p Q := vector(p) // last possible row index j := q - 1 // starting from the top, compute the greatest lower bound for each row for i := 0, 1, ..., p - 2, p - 1: // search this row until we find a value greater than u while j >= 0 and h(i, j) < u: j := j - 1 endwhile // the entry following the one we just found is less than u Q[i] := j + 1 endfor return Q endfunction This lower boundary can be visualised like so, where the blue entries are smaller than u: ::175px For each i, we have that P_i \\\\geq Q_i, with strict inequality occurring only for those rows that have values equal to u. We also have that the sums : \\\\sum_{i=0}^{p-1} (P_i + 1) ~\\\\qquad~ \\\\sum_{i=0}^{p-1} Q_i give, respectively, the number of elements of H that are greater than u, and the number of elements that are greater than or equal to u. Thus this method also yields the rank of u within the elements h_{ij} of H.  Weighted median of row medians  The second observation is that we can use the sorted matrix structure to instantly compare any element to at least half of the entries in the matrix. For example, the median of the row medians across the entire matrix is less than the upper left quadrant in red, but greater than the lower right quadrant in blue: ::175px More generally, using the boundaries given by the P and Q vectors from the previous section, we can assume that after some iterations, we have pinpointed the position of the medcouple to lie between the red left boundary and the blue right boundary: ::175px The yellow entries indicate the median of each row. If we mentally re-arrange the rows so that the medians align and ignore the discarded entries outside the boundaries, ::175px we can select a weighted median of these medians, each entry weighted by the number of remaining entries on this row. This ensures that we can discard at least 1/4 of all remaining values no matter if we have to discard the larger values in red or the smaller values in blue: ::175px Each row median can be computed in O(1) time, since the rows are sorted, and the weighted median can be computed in O(n) time, using a binary search.  Kth pair algorithm  rightthumb300pxA visualisation of the fast medcouple algorithm. It begins with a matrix with sorted rows and sorted columns, where darker squares are smaller than lighter squares. At each iteration, the weighted median of row medians is picked, in yellow. It is then compared to the rest of the matrix to produce candidate red upper and blue lower boundaries. The algorithm then selects the boundary which is known to exclude the global matrix median, by considering the number of entries excluded by this boundary (which is equivalent to considering the rank of the yellow entry). The algorithm then proceeds until the yellow weighted median of row medians is exactly the medcouple, or the number of candidate entries is small enough to perform a selection sort amongst the remaining entries. Putting together these two observations, the fast medcouple algorithm proceeds broadly as follows. # Compute the necessary ingredients for the medcouple kernel function h(i,j) with p sorted rows and q sorted columns. # At each iteration, approximate the medcouple with the weighted median of the row medians. # Compare this tentative guess to the entire matrix obtaining right and left boundary vectors P and Q respectively. The sum of these vectors also gives us the rank of this tentative medcouple. ## If the rank of the tentative medcouple is exactly pq/2, then stop. We have found the medcouple. ## Otherwise, discard the entries greater than or less than the tentative guess by picking either P or Q as the new right or left boundary, depending on which side the element of rank pq/2 is in. This step always discards at least 1/4 of all remaining entries. # Once the number of candidate medcouples between the right and left boundaries is less than or equal to p, perform a rank selection amongst the remaining entries, such that the rank within this smaller candidate set corresponds to the pq/2 rank of the medcouple within the whole matrix. The initial sorting in order to form the h(i,j) function takes O(n \\\\log n) time. At each iteration, the weighted median takes O(n) time, as well as the computations of the new tentative P and Q left and right boundaries. Since each iteration discards at least 1/4 of all remaining entries, there will be at most O(\\\\log n) iterations. Thus, the whole fast algorithm takes O(n \\\\log n) time. Let us restate the fast algorithm in more detail. function medcouple(vector X): // X is a vector of size n // Compute initial ingredients as for the na√Øve medcouple sort_decreasing(X) xm := median(X) xscale := 2 * max(abs(X)) Zplus := [(x - xm)/xscale  x in X such that x >= xm] Zminus := [(x - xm)/xscale  x in X such that x <= xm] p := size(Zplus) q := size(Zminus) function h(i, j): a := Zplus[i] b := Zminus[j] if a == b: return signum(p - 1 - i - j) else: return (a + b) / (a - b) endif endfunction // Begin Kth pair algorithm (Johnson & Mizoguchi) // The initial left and right boundaries, two vectors of size p L := [0, 0, ..., 0] R := [q - 1, q - 1, ..., q - 1] // number of entries to the left of the left boundary Ltotal := 0 // number of entries to the left of the right boundary Rtotal := p*q // Since we are indexing from zero, the medcouple index is one // less than its rank. medcouple_index := floor(Rtotal / 2) // Iterate while the number of entries between the boundaries is // greater than the number of rows in the matrix. while Rtotal - Ltotal > p: // Compute row medians and their associated weights, but skip // any rows that are already empty. middle_idx := [i  i in [0, 1, ..., p - 1] such that L[i] <= R[i row_medians := [h(i, floor((L[i] + R[i])/2)  i in middle_idx] weights := [R[i] - L[i] + 1  i in middle_idx] WM := weighted median(row_medians, weights) // New tentative right and left boundaries P := greater_h(h, p, q, WM) Q := less_h(h, p, q, WM) Ptotal := sum(P) + size(P) Qtotal := sum(Q) // Determine which entries to discard, or if we've found the medcouple if medcouple_index <= Ptotal - 1: R := P Rtotal := Ptotal else: if medcouple_index > Qtotal - 1: L := Q Ltotal := Qtotal else: // Found the medcouple, rank of the weighted median equals medcouple index return WM endif endif endwhile // Did not find the medcouple, but there are very few tentative entries remaining remaining := [h(i, j)  i in [0, 1, ..., p - 1], j in [L[i], L[i] + 1, ..., R[i such that L[i] <= R[i] ] // Select the medcouple by rank amongst the remaining entries medcouple := select_nth(remaining, medcouple_index - Ltotal) return medcouple endfunction In real-world use, the algorithm also needs to account for errors arising from finite-precision floating point arithmetic. For example, the comparisons for the medcouple kernel function should be done within machine epsilon, as well as the order comparisons in the \`greater_h\` and \`less_h\` functions. == Software/source code == * The fast medcouple algorithm is implemented in R's robustbase package. * The fast medcouple algorithm is implemented in a C extension for Python in the Robustats Python package. * A GPL'ed C++ implementation of the fast algorithm, derived from the R implementation. * A Stata implementation of the fast algorithm. * An implementation of the na√Øve algorithm in Matlab (and hence GNU Octave). * The na√Øve algorithm is also implemented for the Python package statsmodels. ==See also== * Robust statistic * Skewness * Adjusted boxplots ==References== Category:Robust statistics Category:Nonparametric statistics Category:Statistical deviation and dispersion Category:Statistical outliers ","title":"Medcouple"},{"id":"46325771","text":"Jennifer T.

In 1330, Young King Du≈°an defeated Bulgarian Emperor Michael III Shishman at Velbazhd, after which King Uro≈° III appointed his nephew Ivan Stefan at the Bulgarian throne in August. ==History== Uro≈° III's decision not to attack the Byzantines after the victory at the Battle of Velbazhd against Bulgaria resulted in the alienation of many nobles, who sought to expand to the south. By January or February 1331, Du≈°an was quarreling with his father, perhaps pressured by the nobility. According to contemporary pro-Du≈°an sources, evil advisors turned Uro≈° III against his son; he decided to seize and exclude Du≈°an of his inheritance. Uro≈° III sent an army into Zeta against his son, the army ravaged Skadar, but Du≈°an had crossed the Bojana. A brief period of anarchy in parts of Serbia took place before the father and son concluded peace in April 1331. Three months later, Uro≈° III ordered Du≈°an to meet him. Du≈°an feared for his life and his advisors persuaded him to resist, so Du≈°an marched from Skadar to Nerodimlje, where he besieged his father. Uro≈° III fled, and Du≈°an captured the treasury and family. He then pursued his father, catching up with him at Petriƒá. On 21 August 1331, Uro≈° III surrendered, and on the advice or insistence of Du≈°an's advisors, he was imprisoned. Du≈°an was crowned King of All Serbian and Maritime lands in the first week of September. The civil war had prevented Serbia from aiding Ivan Stephen and Anna Neda in Bulgaria, who were deposed in March 1331, taking refuge in the mountains. Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria feared for the danger of Serbia as the situation there had settled, and immediately sought peace with Du≈°an. As Du≈°an wanted to move against richer Byzantium, the two made peace and an alliance in December 1331, accepting Ivan Alexander as ruler. It was sealed with the marriage of Du≈°an and Helena, the sister of Ivan Alexander. ==Aftermath== Du≈°an later conquered most of the Byzantine Empire, and was crowned Emperor in 1346. ==ReferencesSources== * * Category:Civil wars of Serbia in the Middle Ages Category:Kingdom of Serbia (medieval) Category:14th century in Serbia Category:Stefan Du≈°an Category:Conflicts in 1331 Category:1331 in Europe Category:Rebellious princes ","title":"Serbian civil war of 1331"},{"id":"46325935","text":"Donald Fred McMichael (28 January 1932 ‚Äì 10 June 2017) was an Australian marine biologist and senior public servant. ==Life and career== McMichael was born in Rockhampton, Queensland on 28 January 1932.

McMichael was appointed the first Director of the National Museum of Australia in February 1984, for a seven-year term. At the time, the Museum was expected to open in 1990. In May 1989, McMichael announced his retirement from the role and from the Australian Public Service, describing the last three years at the museum as \\"quite frustrating and negative\\" due to the Australian Government's lack of commitment to the museum. ==Awards== In June 1981, McMichael was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for public service.

The case concerned whether or not the Employment Court had erred in law by determining that Bryson was an employee of Three Foot Six Ltd. The decision has been made redundant in the film industry by the passage in 2010 of the Employment Relations (Film Production) Amendment Act during the production of The Hobbit. ==Background== Bryson, a hobby model-maker for twenty years had worked for Weta Workshops in 1996 and 1997 before working for them again in 1998 and in 2000 to make models for The Lord of the Rings.Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd [2005] NZSC 34 at [3]. In April 2000, Bryson was seconded to a temporary position at Three Foot Six, although after two weeks work he was offered a permanent position as an on set model technician.Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd [2005] NZSC 34 at [3]. Bryson was not given any form of written employment agreement when he began work at Three Foot Six.Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd [2005] NZSC 34 at [3]. In October 2000 Three Foot Six gave all crew a written contract which referred throughout to \\"Contractor\\" and \\"Independent Contractor\\" and Bryson continued to work for Three Foot Six through 2001 before being made redundant at the end of September 2001.Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd [2005] NZSC 34 at [3]. Bryson raised a personal grievance alleging unjustified dismissal, an action that can only be brought if Bryson is found to be an employee and not a contractor.Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd [2005] NZSC 34 at [3]. The matter of whether Bryson was an employee was dealt with as preliminary question. At first instance the Employment Relations Authority (ERA) found Bryson to be a contractor but when the matter was heard de novo in the Employment Court in 2003 Judge Shaw decided Bryson was an employee. On appeal by Three Foot Six, a majority of the Court of Appeal overturned the Employment Court decision and restored the decision of the ERA.Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd [2005] NZSC 34 at [2]. Bryson took the matter to the Supreme Court on appeal. ==Judgment== Justice Blanchard delivered the Supreme Court's unanimous decision allowing Bryson's appeal and restoring the decision of the Employment Court. The key issue in this case concerned sections 6(2) and 6(3) of the Employment Relations Act which stated, > (2) In deciding for the purposes of subsection (1)(a) whether a person is > employed by another person under a contract of service, the Court or the > Authority (as the case may be) must determine the real nature of the > relationship between them. (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the Court > or the Authority‚Äî (a) must consider all relevant matters, including any > matters that indicate the intention of the persons; and (b) is not to treat > as a determining matter any statement by the persons that describes the > nature of their relationship. The majority of the Court of Appeal had overturned the Employment Court judgment on the basis that it contained an error of law. Judge Shaw, the majority had held, > was said to have ascertained the real nature of the arrangement by the three > traditional tests which, the majority judgment said, left little scope for > significant weight to be placed on contractual intention. The Judge had > downplayed this. The majority was also critical of the way in which she had > seen the industry context as having limited significance. Her approach in > effect involved ‚Äúa claim to require the restructuring of the way in which > the film industry operates.‚ÄùBryson v Three Foot Six Ltd [2005] NZSC 34 at > [15]. During the hearing Justices of the Supreme Court had raised issue with counsel that the Court of Appeal may have been incorrect in concluding that Judge Shaw's decision, \\"contained any error of law which could appropriately have been the subject of appeal to that Court\\".Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd [2005] NZSC 34 at [17]. Counsel for Three Foot Six responded to the Supreme Court by stating that there were five errors of law in the Employment Court judgment. Firstly, Judge Shaw was said to have \\"erred in saying that s 6 changed the tests for determining what constitutes a contract of service\\".Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd [2005] NZSC 34 at [30]. Justice Blanchard retorted that, \\"We are unable to find in her judgment anything concerning s 6 which does not appear faithfully to reflect the words of the section.\\"Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd [2005] NZSC 34 at [31]. The Supreme Court ruled that \\"all relevant matters\\" referred to in section 6 of the Employment Relations Act includes, * Written and oral terms of the contract between the parties; * Consideration of the way in parties have actually behaved in implementing their contract; * Having regard to features of control and integration and to whether the contracted person has been effectively working on his or her own account (the fundamental test), which were important determinants of the relationship at common law; * Industry practice.Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd [2005] NZSC 34 at [32]. Secondly, it was alleged Judge Shaw had \\"fell into error in saying that the real nature of the relationship could be ascertained by analysing the tests that have been historically applied such as control, integration, and the ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù test.\\" Justice Blanchard disagreed, \\"She correctly used them, in conjunction with the other relevant matters to which she referred, in an endeavour to determine the real nature of the relationship, as directed by s 6(2).\\"Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd [2005] NZSC 34 at [33]. Thirdly, it was alleged Judge Shaw, \\"disregarded industry practice\\".Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd [2005] NZSC 34 at [34]. Again Justice Blanchard failed to find that this was the case, Three Foot Six's fourth argument, that Judge Shaw was wrong to say there was no evidence of Bryson acting as a separate business entity when tax invoices existed, was swatted down by Justice Blanchard who reasoned that, \\"She plainly, and in our view correctly, felt that it did not provide any support for the respondent‚Äôs case\\".Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd [2005] NZSC 34 at [39]. The last submission of counsel was, \\"that no reasonable Judge could have reached the same overall conclusion as Judge Shaw in finding that the relationship between the parties was of employment by Mr Bryson under a contract of service.\\"Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd [2005] NZSC 34 at [40]. Justice Blanchard, failed to find merit in this line of attack, as the evidence as a whole did leave it open to Judge Shaw to find that the real nature of the relationship between Bryson and Three Foot Six was one of employment.Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd [2005] NZSC 34 at [40]. Therefore, as the Employment Court decision contained no error of law, the Court of Appeal had not been empowered by the Employment Relations Act to allow it to be challenged, let alone overturned. ==Aftermath== On 29 October 2010 the New Zealand Parliament passed the Employment Relations (Film Production) Amendment Act under urgency after pressure from the makers of The Hobbit. The law changed the definition of employee in section 6 of the Employment Relations Act to exclude all workers involved in the film production industry. ==References== Category:2005 in New Zealand law Category:Supreme Court of New Zealand cases Category:2005 in case law Category:Labour relations in New Zealand ","title":"Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd"},{"id":"46326032","text":"Paule Isabelle Anglim (January 30, 1923 ‚Äì April 2, 2015) was a Canadian-born gallerist, dealer, and curator. She founded and directed Gallery Paule Anglim in San Francisco for approximately four decades before her death on April 2, 2015. According to a tribute written about her in SF Gate April 2, 2015, Anglim \\"endeared herself to the artists she handled with her unflinching commitment to work that she believed in. Her exhibitions encompassed the work of defining figures of the Bay Area Beat era and conceptual art sensibility, such as David Ireland, Paul Kos, Tom Marioni and Jim Melchert.\\" ==Life and career== Born in a small town near Quebec City, Paule Anglim grew up speaking French. She was educated at the Universit√© Laval in Quebec and at the University of Toronto. After graduating with a degree in sociology, she was hired by Catholic Social Services to be a social worker in San Francisco. She gravitated toward the art world via an interest in architecture. Her first business was called Architecture Art Service, and her first exhibition was a look at fine art in new architecture, mounted at the school of architecture at UC Berkeley. Early in Anglim's career she specialized in public art and the siting of sculpture in relation to architecture and public landscapes, working with Alexander Calder, Henry Moore, and Isamu Noguchi, among others. She opened Gallery Paule Anglim in the early 1970s in North Beach and became popular for showing the fine art associated with the Beat scene. Joan Brown, Bruce Conner, and Jess Collins segued into the Conceptual Art movement of the 1960s and ‚Äô70s, and brought Bay Area conceptual artists to international attention. In the 1980s, the gallery moved to Geary Street and continued to show sculpture, installation, video, performance, and conceptual art. Anglim met her near-contemporary Louise Bourgeois in Paris, offering her a solo show in 1987, and represented the artist until her death in 2010. In 2007, Bourgeois' Crouching Spider, on loan from the artist, was installed on San Francisco's Embarcadero, epitomizing Anglim's longstanding commitment to the public realm. Another Spider, acquired from Gallery Paule Anglim in 1996, set records at auction when sold by a private collector for 10.7 m in 2011 and remains among the world's most highly valued artworks by a woman. ==Artists supported by Paule Anglim== See Gallery Paule Anglim. ==Personal life== Paule Anglim was married twice, to Charles Anglim and later to William Turnbull, both deceased. Her son Philip Anglim became an award-winning stage and television actor. Anglim preferred not to share her birth date. She held an annual \\"Epiphany Party\\" in January at her home, across the street from the San Francisco Art Institute. Her sparsely furnished Russian Hill home, where she hosted salons and dinners, housed her personal art collection, including works of Francis Picabia, Rebecca Horn, and Marcel Duchamp, among others. ==References *http://www.gallerypauleanglim.com Category:Canadian art dealers Category:Canadian curators Category:1923 births Category:2015 deaths ","title":"Paule Anglim"},{"id":"46326046","text":"The 1928 Arizona gubernatorial election took place on November 6, 1928.

Primilarly a winger, he can also operate as a left back. Formed at Villarreal, he went on to play as a senior for that club as well as Lugo, Leeds United, Alav√©s and Betis. ==Club career== Born in San Sebasti√°n de los Ballesteros, C√≥rdoba, Andalusia, Pedraza joined Villarreal CF's youth setup in 2011 at the age of 15, after starting out at S√©neca CF. In January 2015, he was promoted to the former's C team in Tercera Divisi√≥n. Pedraza made his senior debut on 11 January 2015, appearing as a second-half substitute for the reserves in a 2‚Äì2 away draw against CF Reus Deportiu for the Segunda Divisi√≥n B championship. He scored his first goal on 1 March, netting the game's only in a home success against CD Atl√©tico Baleares. On 5 April 2015, after being already a regular with the B's and being called up to the main squad by manager Marcelino Garc√≠a Toral, Pedraza made his professional ‚Äì and La Liga ‚Äì debut, replacing Jonathan dos Santos in the 72nd minute of a 0‚Äì0 draw at Valencia CF. On 28 July 2016, he was loaned to Segunda Divisi√≥n side CD Lugo for one year, scoring his first professional goal on 21 August by netting the first in a 2‚Äì2 away draw to Gimn√†stic de Tarragona; he ended the season with six successful strikes and eight assists, helping to a final ninth position. On 31 January 2017, Pedraza joined Leeds United on loan until the end of the campaign, with Villarreal paying Lugo ¬£300,000 in order to cancel his contract with them ‚Äì the deal with the English side included an option to buy for ¬£8.5 million in May, provided they won promotion from the EFL Championship. After featuring from the bench in his debut, a 1‚Äì2 loss at Huddersfield Town, he scored his first goal on 3 March in a 3‚Äì1 away victory over Birmingham City; as the team could only rank seventh, he returned to the Estadio de la Cer√°mica. On 5 July 2017, still owned by Villarreal, Pedraza signed with Deportivo Alav√©s for one year with a buyout clause. He scored his first goal in the Spanish top flight on 21 January 2018, putting the hosts ahead 2‚Äì0 in an eventual 2‚Äì2 home draw against CD Legan√©s. Upon returning from loan, Pedraza was regularly deployed as a left back by manager Javier Calleja, and was definitely included in Villarreal's first team. On 16 July 2019, however, he moved to fellow league team Real Betis on a one-year loan, with an option to make the deal permanent at the end of the season. ==International career== In 2015, Pedraza was part of the Spain under-19 squad that won the UEFA European Championship. He earned his first cap for the under-21s on 24 March 2016 of the following year, coming on for Dani Ceballos early in the second half of an eventual 0‚Äì3 home loss against Croatia for the 2017 European Championship qualifiers. ==Style of play== Pedraza played mainly as a left winger, but could also operate on the opposite flank cutting inside or as a forward. His style of play was compared to Gareth Bale due to his speed running with the ball, as well as his strength and ability to take on defenders.

Born in Los Angeles, California to Japanese-Polish and Native American-Irish parents, respectively, she studied at San Francisco State University, earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1982. She was awarded a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1985 from the San Francisco Art Institute. Anno began working at the California College of the Arts in 1996 as an associate professor, and was chair of the painting department as of 2012. == Early life == Kim Anno was raised next to the ocean on the west side of Los Angeles and came of age in the political flux of the 1970s. Anno‚Äôs father was a beatnik physicist and her mother a nurse and civil rights activist brought her to speeches by Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy where she was embedded in the \\"social upheaval and personal liberation\\" of the time. Anno was inspired by these activist mass gatherings, \\"whether cultural, like folk or rock-n-roll festivals, or political, such as the Chicano moratorium, Cambodian bombing protests, or the UFW‚Äôs Gallo boycott.\\" Near by Dogtown Z boys were \\"inventing skateboarding\\" with Jeff Ho‚Äôs surf shop gang and Peggy Oki, LA‚Äôs feminist and conceptual art movement was in full swing, as was the beginning of the punk scene by the 80s, \\"the electricity of the time ignited [Anno's] creativity, it‚Äôs the current running through [her] work all the way to the present.\\" == Influences == Anno works with a philosophy centered on expanding the function of art in society. Perhaps this credo began in her studies while attending the radical, non- accredited, women's art school, the Feminist Studio Workshop, in downtown Los Angeles. There she was influenced by the work of the graphic designer Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, and interdisciplinary artist Suzanne Lacy, both part of the Feminist art movement in the United States. Today, some of Anno's prominent artistic themes include ecology and climate change, the \\"joy and consequences of technology\\", and \\"the language of abstraction as it appears in religious and ritual art\\". Working on wood, aluminium and canvass surfaces, Anno has pushed her painting practice to explore the limits of abstraction. Her work shifted in 2008 when she allowed narrative into her process, revealing her interest in film and leading to her current interdisciplinary practice. Since then she has applied her painterly mark to working in short film and video installations, and has made several series of large-format photographs. Filmmaking and photography opened an entirely new horizon to reach a different, younger audience. ==Career== Exhibits and works that Anno has participated in include the Don‚Äôt Panic exhibition at the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Convention, Men and Women in Water Cities at the 2012 Convention, exhibitions at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive and Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro, and Women On the Silk Road, which travelled along the Silk Road network featuring artists influenced by Asian art and culture. She has been awarded the Wallace Alexander Gerbode Foundation Purchase Award, the Fleishhaker Fellowship, and further fellowships from the Open Circle Foundation and the Berkeley Film Foundation. Kim Anno is represented by the Patricial Sweetow Gallery in San Francisco, California since 2004; and the Marcia Wood Gallery in Atlanta, Gearogia, since 2009. Commissions Kim Anno is a San Francisco Bay Area artist who has received commissions by the San Francisco Art Commission and the City of Oakland Public Art Commission. From 2010 to 2012 the Zellerbach Foundation and the SFMOMA Phillis Moldaw, commissioned Anno for new work.

It took place in multiple malls throughout the United States and was designed to promote her debut album ...Baby One More Time. The tour was deemed to be a success. == Background == In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided to pitch her to record labels, which required a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song from Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded in a studio with a sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and \\"there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson or another Tiffany.\\" Two weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph. Senior vice president of A&R; Jeff Fenster stated, \\"It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation‚Äîthe 'eye of the tiger'‚Äî is extremely important. And Britney had that. \\"They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from \\"lower and less poppy\\" delivery to \\"distinctively, unmistakably Britney.\\" Spears recorded ten songs with White, including \\"Autumn Goodbye\\", \\"E-Mail My Heart\\", \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\\", \\"I'm So Curious\\", \\"I Will Still Love You\\", \\"Luv The Hurt Away\\", \\"Soda Pop\\", \\"Thinkin' About You\\", and \\"You Got It All\\". The singer also recorded a cover of Sonny & Cher's 1967 single \\"The Beat Goes On\\". White was responsible for the vocal recording and song production, while additional production was done by English electronic music group All Seeing I. After hearing the material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others. Martin showed Spears and her management a track titled \\"Hit Me Baby One More Time\\", which was originally written for American R&B; group TLC; however, they rejected it. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when she heard it and knew it was going to be a hit. \\"We at Jive said, 'This is a fuckin' smash',\\" revealed the label's A&R; executive, Steven Lunt; however, other executives were concerned that the line \\"Hit Me\\" would condone domestic violence, and later revised it to \\"...Baby One More Time\\". The singer revealed that she \\"didn't do well at all the first day in the studio [recording the song], I was just too nervous. So I went out that night and had some fun. The next day I was completely relaxed and nailed it. You gotta be relaxed singing '... Baby One More Time'.\\" By June 1998, the album was done, and Spears embarked on a promotional tour sponsored by L'Oreal. ...Baby One More Time was released as Spears' debut album on January 12, 1999. == Synopsis == Spears did small sets in malls and food courts around the United States, mostly in larger cities. Spears' set was around 30 minutes, and she only had two female dancers with her on the stage. Her label, Jive Records, has said that this tour was created to promote Spears' upcoming debut album (...Baby One More Time) and prepare for her first major tour. This tour is also known as the Hair Zone Mall Tour, because it was sponsored by L'Oreal. The \\"shopping mall tour\\" idea also worked well for '80s teen pop star Tiffany. == Set list == # \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\" # \\"Sometimes\\" # \\"Thinkin' About You\\" # \\"Deep in My Heart\\" # \\"Born to Make You Happy\\" # \\"...Baby One More Time\\" Note *This setlist would later be used as Spears' opening act set list on the NSYNC In Concert Tour. == References == Works cited *Blandford, James R.

The organisation is alleged to have established ties with Jemaah Islamiah and al-Qaeda. ASWJA is linked with the Islamic Information & Support Centre of Australia. The organisation supports Australian Muslim preacher Feiz Muhammad. In 2007, Muhammad established the Dawah Central centre in Auburn, in a building, subsequently purchased in 2011 by the ASWJA, located behind the Bukhari House bookshop. ASWJA is associated with the Hume Islamic Youth Centre (HIYC) in Melbourne, the Global Islamic Youth Centre (GIYC) in Sydney and the Bukhari House bookshop in Sydney. The Bukhari House bookshop has close links to Sydney's Street Dawah preaching group. Members of the Street Dawah preaching group have died fighting for ISIS. A young Melbourne man who attended HIYC, planned to launch a series of bombings across Melbourne, then travelled to Iraq where he carried out an Islamic State suicide bombing mission in which only he was killed. Another terrorist, now deceased, was one of at least five fighters who grew up close to, or attended the HIYC. Harun Mehicevic the leader of Melbourne's Al-Furqan Islamic Information Centre was a student of Sheik Abu Ayman. ASWJA provided the funds to establish the centre and installed Mehicevic as leader.

The school shield depicts an eagle (representing the United States of America), a lion (representing Great Britain), a book (symbol of education), and a cross (representing a tradition of Christianity). Although the school's name is spelled (though not pronounced) the same way as that of the breed of dog, which is also its mascot, it was in fact named for the rue St-Bernard in Brussels, Belgium, where a relative of one of St. Bernard's founders had also founded a school. ==History== The school was founded in 1904 by John Card Jenkins and Francis Tabor. Both graduates of Cambridge University, they had met after knocking heads on a soccer pitch. Originally on the upper floors of a small Midtown building, the school relocated to its current location on 98th street in 1915. The original 1915 building by Delano and Aldrich still stands, although it has undergone significant expansion and renovation, most recently in 1997. The current headmaster of the school is Stuart H. Johnson III (born August 14, 1954). A graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy and Yale University, he previously taught at St. Bernard's, and at Groton School, before becoming headmaster in 1985. Other notable faculty members have included David King- Wood,who directed the Shakespeare play for many years and is the namesake of an auditorium in the school and Gordon Bradley, who coached the school's soccer team. ==Students== The school has three divisions: the Junior (or Lower) School consists of grades K through 3, the Middle School grades 4 through 6, and the Upper School grades 7 through 9. Mondays through Thursdays, boys in the Junior School must wear St. Bernard's polo shirts (polo shirts with the school shield emblazoned upon the chest) in either red, white, or blue, khakis, and a blazer. Boys in the Middle and Upper Schools must wear a polo or oxford shirt, accompanied by khakis and blazers as well. On Fridays, all boys wear jackets and ties (with the exception of the kindergartners). St. Bernard's alumni, known as Old Boys, earn admission to a wide range of secondary schools in the United States and the United Kingdom, both day and boarding. The schools attended with greatest frequency include Andover, Collegiate, Deerfield, Exeter, Groton, Horace Mann, Lawrenceville, St. Paul's, Stuyvesant, and Trinity. ==Notable alumni== *Louis Auchincloss, novelist and winner of the National Medal of Arts *Andrew Bernard *Bartle Bull, novelist *Greg Daniels *Avery Dulles, Catholic priest of the Jesuit order, famed theologian, author, member of the College of Cardinals, son of John Foster Dulles *Theodore Dunham Jr. *Larry Fessenden *Anthony Gardner *Elbridge T.

Bradycardia is defined by a slower than normal heart rate, less than 60 bpm. (Normal range is 60-100 bpm). Ictal epileptic discharges can effect changes in cardiac rhythm. An increase in heart rhythm is common during seizures. This type of epileptic seizure is known as ictal tachycardia, in which the subject's heart rate increase of more than 10 beats per minute of above the baseline. In comparison, ictal bradycardia causes epileptic discharges that disrupt the normal cardiac rhythm in a negative fashion. Slowing the heart beat down by more than 10 beats per minute below the average baseline. Ictal bradycardia is a potential cause or reason for ictal asystole to occur and is believed to help explain the phenomenon of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).Through the simultaneous use of electroencephalograph (EEG) and electrocardiograms (ECG), researchers can monitor and record a patient going through ictal bradycardia seizures. And most importantly provide treatment with both antiepileptic drugs and cardiac pace as deemed necessary for the patient. Although there is limited amount of information about ictal bradycardia, as it is a relatively new discovery and is considered to be rare condition, researchers suggest that early diagnosis and treatment of ictal bradycardia can eliminate the chances of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. ==References== Category:Cardiac arrhythmia Category:Epilepsy types ","title":"Ictal bradycardia"},{"id":"46326296","text":"Stanford Art Spaces was an art exhibition program at Stanford University in Stanford, California, United States.

The Hospital in Apapa is the flagship hospital. The Group added two new locations: Lagoon Clinics in Adeniyi Jones, Ikeja and Lagoon Specialist Suites in Victoria Island making a total of six. ==Milestones== Lagoon Hospitals have pioneered advanced medical care in Nigeria. Lagoon hospitals became the first private hospital in the country to successfully perform an open-heart surgery. The surgery was performed by a team of resident Nigerian healthcare professionals. Lagoon hospitals in Apapa and Ikeja hospitals also became the first hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa to earn accreditation from Joint commission international (JCI), the global acclaimed and recognised agency certifying hospitals and healthcare organisations with world standards and best practice in healthcare delivery. Lagoon Hospitals achieved another major feat with the investment in a new, complete electronic system for keeping patients' medical records aiming to integrate patient care for its hospitals and physicians‚Äô practices. This has been implemented across the various locations. Aiming to prioritize primary healthcare services in Nigeria in order to improve access as well as ensure efficient healthcare delivery, the group inaugurated an ultramodern Primary healthcare Outpatient Complex in Apapa. The Outpatient Complex is projected to meet the growing demand for quality healthcare and strengthen the Nigerian primary healthcare system. Services in the department includes adult and children‚Äôs general out- patient services, wound dressing, Immunization clinics, laboratory services, pre-employment and other selective screening examinations. ==Controversy== Lagoon came under scrutiny after an allegation of demanding \\"payment before treatment\\".

He came to the realization that no movies had been made in Swahili. After contemplating this for several years, he wrote a script for a Swahili movie. It took him another 3 years to start making the movie. Finally, the movie Bongoland was made. According to him, the arrival of digital video cameras made it easy for independent filmmakers to produce movies cheaply. After Bongoland, Kibira continued to write and make movies in Swahili.

The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) ‚Äì 1. Shyampukur, 2.

A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government. With the implementation of the Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation was enlarged. Certain areas were already there but more parts of them were added (current spellings) - Entally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watganj and Ekbalpur, and Garden Reach and Tollygunj.

United Parcel Service, 575 U.S. ___ (2015), is a United States Supreme Court case that the Court evaluated the requirements for bringing a disparate treatment claim under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.. In a 6-3 decision, the Court held that to bring such a claim, a pregnant employee must show that their employer refused to provide accommodations and that the employer later provided accommodations to other employees with similar restrictions. The Court then remanded the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to determine whether the employer engaged in discrimination under this new test. == Background == Pregnancy Discrimination Act In 1978, the United States Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, amending Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to \\"prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy,\\" as a direct response to the Court's ruling in General Electric Company v. Gilbert. The Act mandates that employers must treat ‚Äúwomen affected by pregnancy . . . the same for all employment-related purposes . . . as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.‚Äù. However, the Act provides exceptions for a \\"legitimate, nondiscriminatory, nonpretextual justification for these differences in treatment.\\". Initial lawsuit In 2006, Peggy Young was working as a delivery driver for United Parcel Service when she requested time off in order to undergo in vitro fertilization. After becoming pregnant, Young's doctors advised her that \\"she should not lift more than 20 pounds during the first 20 weeks of her pregnancy or more than 10 pounds thereafter.\\" United Parcel Service (UPS) requires that delivery drivers be able to lift parcels up to 70 pounds (150 pounds with assistance). Young informed UPS that she could not work while under a lifting restriction and stayed home without pay during most of the time she was pregnant. Because of her time away from work, Young lost her employee medical coverage. She then filed suit in federal court, claiming that \\"UPS acted unlawfully in refusing to accommodate her pregnancy-related lifting restriction.\\" == Decision == Justice Stephen Breyer's majority opinion stated that the key inquiry was \\"whether the nature of the employer‚Äôs policy and the way in which it burdens pregnant women shows that the employer has engaged in intentional discrimination.\\" He provided a balancing test for determining whether employers engaged in intentional discrimination under the terms of the Act. The test provided, \\"A worker making a claim that her company intentionally treated her differently due to her pregnancy must show that she sought an accommodation, her company refused and then granted accommodations to others suffering from similar restrictions. The company, in turn, can try to show that its reasons were legitimate ‚Äî but not because it is more expensive or less convenient to add pregnant women to the categories of workers who are accommodated.\\" To determine whether UPS engaged in discrimination under the terms of the new test, the Court remanded the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for further proceedings. In a concurring opinion, Justice Samuel Alito stated that the wording of one of the clauses of the Act \\"adds a further requirement of equal treatment irrespective of intent.\\" Therefore, he argued that pregnant employees must also be compared with other employees performing similar jobs with similar abilities. In dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that the primary intent of the Act was to clarify that pregnancy discrimination falls under the general definition of sex discrimination and that the majority opinion is instead basically crafting a new law. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a separate dissent, stating that the majority interpreted the Act in a way that conflates \\"disparate impact\\" with \\"disparate treatment\\" and would result in confusion in litigating pregnancy discrimination cases. == Applicable theories ==  Formal equality  Justice Breyer's opinion adopts a formal equality approach. Formal equality is a theory of feminist thinking based on the idea that men and women are equal in all important aspects and so should be treated the same. The Act and, more specifically, the statute at issue in the case is built upon the tenets of formal equality. The PDA assumes equal capabilities between men and women: pregnancy will not inhibit a women from carrying out her job requirements (unless, of course, not being pregnant was one of an employer's bona fide occupational qualifications). The PDA likens pregnancy complications to disabilities in its mandate that employers must treat \\"women affected by pregnancy.... the same for all employment-related purposes.... as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.\\" The majority opinion follows suit and perpetuates the use of formal equality solutions for problems arising out of the treatment of pregnant women in the workplace. Justice Breyer sets out a new framework under which this type of discrimination will be analyzed. Firstly, the plaintiff must prove that it was likely the discrimination was based on a prohibited Title VII class. Next, the defendant may rebut the plaintiff‚Äôs accusations by providing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its perceived discrimination. Lastly, the plaintiff may show the defendant's reasons for discriminating were, in fact, pretextual. That may be proven by showing that the employer's policies placed a \\"significant burden\\" on plaintiff's class and the legitimate non-discriminatory reasons were not \\"sufficiently strong.\\" Such a framework attempts to tease out whether employers are acting in good faith in accommodating pregnant workers with restricted abilities (while realizing realistically that means some pregnant workers may not receive an accommodation), or whether pregnant workers are unfairly excluded from short term disability assignment while others of similar capabilities are given them. Underlying this inquiry is the assumption that women should be receiving the same treatment as others with similar capabilities, a formal equality assumption. What remains uncertain is how the Fourth Circuit applies the law decided by the Court to the facts of the case. Should the Fourth Circuit broadly accept evidence fulfilling the plaintiff‚Äôs showing on the significant burden/sufficiently strong prong, more claims will be successful. However, should the Fourth Circuit maintain a narrow approach to the significant burden/sufficiently strong elements, less claims will be successful as a result of the Court‚Äôs liberal interpretation of acceptable employer behavior. Allowing employers to escape liability would widen the gap between pregnancy- related accommodation seekers and non-pregnancy related accommodation seekers, and subsequently diminish the formal equality assumption that underscores the case.  Subordination theory  While the Court uses formal equality logic to guide its decision, does doing so subordinate the interests of women? The subordination theory is a school of feminist thought which analyzes law and society to determine whether women and the interests of women are treated less favorably than others. Based on the theory, the Court's majority opinion is subordinating in the way it refuses to treat pregnant accommodation seekers the same as other accommodation seekers. In coming to a conclusion about the actual rule of law that future courts will use to evaluate employers' actions, the Supreme Court evaluated the merits of each party's claim as to what the law should be. The plaintiff argued that under the PDA clause at issue, pregnant women should be given an accommodation whenever the employer gives other workers of a similar ability an accommodation. Conversely, the defendant argued that the PDA clause does nothing more than make pregnancy a form of sex discrimination. Since the plaintiff did not fit into any of its neutral categories acceptable accommodation-seekers, the defendant argued, she did not receive the treatment she sought but was not discriminated against on the basis of sex (importantly, the two lower courts had sided with the defendant's argument). While the opinion is certainly in keeping with the Court's trajectory away from prior decisions that did little to recognize the rights of pregnant women, the Court failed to do all that it could do. The majority opinion's inexplicable refusal to accept the plaintiff's argument and follow the plain text of the statute at issue subordinates pregnant accommodation seekers by treating them less favorably than non-pregnant accommodation seekers. Justice Breyer explains that treating both classes equally would give pregnant women a \\"most favored nation\\" status and create a duty on behalf of the employer to accommodate pregnant workers whenever they accommodate non- pregnant workers of similar capabilities. However, why should the law not give pregnant women similar treatment? If the law says to look at (dis)ability as is relates to job duties, what difference does it make that the root of the issue is pregnancy as opposed to a car accident or a bad back? By refusing to hold employers accountable for accommodating pregnant workers the same way it accommodates disabled workers, the Court fails to equally value that group's interests and thus is subordinating. Practically, this logic may be recognizing the fact that employers should be able to discern between on-duty and off-duty injuries and should be able to treat them differently. The common distinction rewards workers who perform certain types of duties (ultrahazardous jobs) and allows employers to keep costs lower by not having to accommodate everyone with such a request. The majority's opinion is perhaps best conceptualized as splitting the difference between these two important policy issues: supporting the accommodation of pregnant workers but allowing employers to accommodate only some of its workforce. == See also == * List of United States Supreme Court cases *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 575 == References  * *Coverage on SCOTUSblog Category:2015 in United States case law Category:Anti-discrimination law in the United States Category:Legal issues in pregnancy Category:United States reproductive rights case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:United Parcel Service ","title":"Young v.

With her family and friends, Tighe founded Joan's Legacy to honor her sister. Tighe's mother, also a non-smoker, died from the disease. In 2009 Joan's Legacy became Uniting Against Lung Cancer, reflecting the foundation's commitment to uniting all families and organizations dedicated to conquering lung cancer. Since 2003, the organization has awarded more than $12 million to academic investigators, leading to more than $55 million in follow-on funding, new researchers entering the field, and scientific progress. In a merger approved in May 2015, Uniting Against Lung Cancer elected to merge with the Lung Cancer Research Foundation, another organization dedicated to funding research. A scholarship student herself, Tighe co-founded the Scarangello Scholarship program in 1982 at Cardinal Spellman High School. The program honors the memory of Tighe's parents by providing a college-preparatory Catholic high school education to six selected students at the school each year.‚ÄúSpellman Celebrates 20 Years of the Scarangello Scholarship Program‚Äù, Spellman News, Summer/Fall 2012 She also funds scholarships to Saints Peter and Paul, her grade school, through the Inner-City Scholarship Fund. ==Honors== Tighe received the Real Estate Board of New York's Deal of the Year Award for ingenious brokerage nine times, a record number of wins since the award was created in 1944.

He is professor of clinical psychology and director of the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine's Tobacco Dependence Research Unit at Queen Mary University of London. He is known for his research into smoking cessation, including the effectiveness of electronic cigarettes for this purpose. ==Education and academic career== Hajek received his PhD from Charles University in Prague in 1973. In 1982, he moved to England, where he joined the Institute of Psychiatry's Addiction Research Unit. He became a lecturer at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry in 1992, and became a professor there in 1998. ==Scientific work== Hajek is the author of over 250 peer-reviewed papers, and has helped develop treatments for people who are dependent on cigarette smoking. He is known for his research into electronic cigarettes, which, he has said, are \\"at least as effective as nicotine patches\\" for smoking cessation in the context of minimum support. In 2014, Hajek and other researchers published a paper criticizing a World Health Organization report on electronic cigarettes published earlier that year, which they said had made \\"misleading\\" assumptions. Hajek has told the BBC that \\"...the risks [of electronic cigarettes] are unlikely, some already proven not to exist, while the benefits are potentially enormous.\\" Also in 2014, Hajek co-authored a Cochrane review of the effectiveness of electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation; the review found limited evidence that they were effective for this purpose. Hajek described the results of this review as \\"encouraging\\". In February 2019 he published \\"A Randomized Trial of E-Cigarettes versus Nicotine-Replacement Therapy\\" in the New England Journal of Medicine.. This landmark study demonstrated that smokers who used e-cigarettes to help them quit were 83% more likely to have quit smoking at one year than those who used conventional nicotine replacement therapy. ==References *Peter Hajek at Google Scholar Category:British psychologists Category:Living people Category:Academics of Queen Mary University of London Category:Charles University alumni Category:Clinical psychologists Category:Tobacco researchers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Peter Hajek"},{"id":"46326635","text":"The Missing () is a 2015 South Korean television series starring Kim Kang-woo and Park Hee-soon.

In 1900 he won a by-election for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Uralla-Walcha as a Protectionist. Re-elected in 1901, he was defeated in 1904 running for Armidale. In 1907 he was the Labor candidate for Armidale.

With them he scored two goals in a cup game against Liberian Premier League club Nimba FC who were so impressed by his performance that they ended up signing him. In 2011 Johnson travelled to Norway to trial with FK Haugesund. He impressed the Norwegian club, but only enough for them to offer him a youth contract, so he instead signed with Swedish club Dalkurd FF. He would however only stay there for a couple of months due to work permit problems. Johnson remained in Sweden though and played for fourth tier club Assyriska IF KF during the second half of the 2011 season. For the first half of the following season Johnson stepped down one division and played for fifth tier club Juventus IF before once again returning to the fourth tier when playing for H√§rn√∂sands FF during the fall. After the season, he was awarded the title of \\"best midfielder\\" in the league H√§rn√∂sand played in. Before the 2013 season Johnson trialed with second tier Superettan club J√∂nk√∂pings S√∂dra IF but was turned down. Instead he signed a three-year deal with third tier club IK Frej. In his second season with them Johnson, who was now playing as forward, became their top goalscorer as the club was promoted to Superettan. In December 2014 Allsvenskan club Djurg√•rdens IF announced that they had signed Johnson on a four-year deal. Sam Johnson made his Allsvenskan debut for Djurg√•rden in the 1‚Äì2 loss against Elfsborg on 5 April 2015. He got his first Allsvenskan goal in the 1‚Äì2 loss against Hammarby on 13 April. After a successful first top flight season where Johnson scored a total of 10 times Djurg√•rden turned down a 22 million SEK bid from french Ligue 1 club Bordeaux the following winter. In the summer of 2016 Johnson was sold for a 30 million SEK. Then he joined Chinese side Wuhan Zall. He played a crucial part in the club's relegation battle, scoring six goals in 11 appearances and helping the club to finish sixth in China League One. On July 14, 2017 he was removed from the club's first squad. On February 4, 2019 Real Salt Lake announced that they had signed Johnson to a Designated Player contract. ==International career== Johnson played with the Liberia U23 National Team in 2011 for which he scored six goals in eight games. In 2015, he started playing for the Liberia national football team. ==Career statistics== Á∫¶Áø∞Êùæ at sodasoccer.com Retrieved 2016-11-02 {   center;\\" - !rowspan=2Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=3League !colspan=2CupIncludes the Svenska Cupen and Norwegian Football Cup !colspan=2Continental !colspan=2OtherAll appearances in the Division 1 promotion playoffs !colspan=2Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - Assyriska IF 2011 Division 2 51colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì51 - Juventus IF 2012 Division 3 104colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì104 - H√§rn√∂sands FF 2012 Division 2 95colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì95 - rowspan=3IK Frej 2013 Division 1 25541colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì296 - 2014 Division 1 251221colspan=2‚Äì202913 - !colspan=2Total !50!!17!!6!!2!!0!!0!!2!!0!!58!!19 - rowspan=3Djurg√•rdens IF 2015 Allsvenskan 291030colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì3210 - 2016 Allsvenskan 12730colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì157 - !colspan=2Total !41!!17!!6!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!47!!17 - rowspan=3Wuhan Zall 2016 China League One 11600colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì116 - 2017 China League One 15500colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì155 - !colspan=2Total !26!!11!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!26!!11 - V√•lerenga 2018 Eliteserien 211141colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì2512 - !colspan=3Career total !162!!66!!16!!3!!0!!0!!2!!0!!180!!69 } International {  !colspan=3Liberia - !Year!!Apps!!Goals - 201560 - 201631 - 201700 - 201831 - 201941 - !Total!!16!!3 } International goals :Scores and results list Liberia's goal tally first. { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - !scope=colNo. !scope=col data-sort-type=dateDate !scope=colVenue !scope=colOpponent !scope=colScore !scope=colResult !scope=colCompetition - !scope=row1. 29 March 2016  Antoinette Tubman Stadium, Monrovia, Liberia   align=center  2‚Äì0  align=center  5‚Äì0  2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification - !scope=row2. 11 October 2018  Stade Alphonse Massemba-D√©bat, Brazzaville, Congo   align=center  1‚Äì1  align=center  1‚Äì3  2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualification - !scope=row 3. 4 September 2019  SKD Stadium, Monrovia, Liberia   align=center  3‚Äì1  align=center  3‚Äì1  2022 FIFA World Cup qualification } ==References * Elite Prospects profile * * * Djurg√•rden profile Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Association football forwards Category:Liberian footballers Category:Liberia international footballers Category:Allsvenskan players Category:Division 1 (Swedish football) players Category:Division 2 (Swedish football) players Category:Division 3 (Swedish football) players Category:China League One players Category:Juventus IF players Category:IK Frej players Category:Djurg√•rdens IF Fotboll players Category:Wuhan Zall F.C. players Category:Expatriate footballers in China Category:V√•lerenga Fotball players Category:Eliteserien players Category:Real Salt Lake players Category:Designated Players (MLS) Category:Liberian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Sweden Category:Liberian expatriate sportspeople in Sweden Category:Liberian expatriate sportspeople in China Category:Expatriate footballers in Norway Category:Liberian expatriate sportspeople in Norway Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:Liberian expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:Major League Soccer players ","title":"Sam Johnson (footballer, born 1993)"},{"id":"46326740","text":"The 2015 Australian Goldfields Open was a professional ranking snooker tournament that took place between 29 June and 5 July 2015 at the Bendigo Stadium in Bendigo, Australia.

It is in the subfamily Bruchinae, the bean weevils.Tuda, M., et al. (2006). Evolutionary diversification of the bean beetle genus Callosobruchus (Coleoptera: Bruchidae): traits associated with stored‚Äêproduct pest status. Molecular Ecology 15(12), 3541-51. Many beetles in the genus are well known as economically important pests that infest stored foodstuffs. These beetles specialize on legumes of the tribe Phaseoleae, which includes many types of beans used for food. Host plants include mung bean (Vigna radiata), adzuki bean (V. angularis), rice bean (V. umbellata), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), Bambara groundnut (V. subterranea), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), lablab (Lablab purpureus), and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). They can also be found in peas, lentils, chickpeas, and peanuts.Tuda, M., et al. (2005). Ecological factors associated with pest status in Callosobruchus (Coleoptera: Bruchidae): high host specificity of non-pests to Cajaninae (Fabaceae). Journal of Stored Products Research 41, 31-45. Most species in the genus are native to Asia. They can be found in warm regions in the Old World. They occur in places outside of their native range as introduced species. At least 11 species of legumes are natural hosts for these beetles, including wild and domesticated plants. Some are considered pests because they invade stores of legume foods, such as beans and lentils. They lay eggs on the seeds and the larvae consume them as they develop. They emerge from the seeds as adults. C. maculatus in particular is well adapted to living in dry beans and seeds because it does not require food or water to reproduce. It can invade a store of chickpeas and infest 100% of the seeds.Erler, F., et al. (2009). Preliminary results on evaluation of chickpea, Cicer arietinum, genotypes for resistance to the pulse beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus. Journal of Insect Science 9(1), 58. C. maculatus has also been studied in the field of reproductive biology because of the sexual conflict that occurs between mating male and female. The genitalia of the male is covered in hard spines that injure the female during copulation, and the female has a habit of kicking the male during the process.Crudgington, H. S. and Siva-Jothy, M. T. Genital damage, kicking and early death. Nature 407; 19 October 2000. There are at least 20 species in genus Callosobruchus. Species include: *Callosobruchus analis *Callosobruchus chinensis *Callosobruchus dolichosi *Callosobruchus imitator *Callosobruchus latealbus *Callosobruchus maculatus *Callosobruchus nigripennis *Callosobruchus phaseoli *Callosobruchus pulcher *Callosobruchus rhodesianus *Callosobruchus semigriseus *Callosobruchus subinnotatus *Callosobruchus theobromae *Callosobruchus utidai ==Gallery== Callosobruchus analis.jpgCallosobruchus analis Callosobruchus maculatus dorsal.jpgCallosobruchus maculatus Callosobruchus phaseoli.jpgCallosobruchus phaseoli Eggs of Callosobruchus maculatus on cowpea and azuki.jpgCallosobruchus eggs on beans ==References== Category:Chrysomelidae genera Category:Taxa named by Maurice Pic ","title":"Callosobruchus"},{"id":"46326766","text":"Greenpoint was the terminal train station for the Evergreen Branch of the Long Island Rail Road.

In this episode, Emma Swan must deal with the truth about her parents' past with Maleficent, while she tracks down the Author, whom she must find before Gold does. As Gold's quest for his happy ending grows more urgent, he resorts to blackmailing Regina in order to help him. Nine weeks before this, Mr. Gold needs Robin's help. Back in the Enchanted Forest, Rumplestiltskin enlists Robin Hood to go to Oz to steal an elixir from Zelena. ==Plot== Opening Sequence The Emerald City looms in the forest. In The Characters' Past Back in \\"Sherwood Forest many years ago,\\" Robin Hood is at his bar, when the Sheriff of Nottingham shows up and threatens his nemesis over taxes and gives him just two days to get his money in order. That night after closing, Rumplestiltskin appears with a proposition: Rumplestiltskin will solve Robin‚Äôs monetary issues, if Robin will steal something for him in return. Rumplestiltskin informs Robin that they‚Äôll have to go to a realm called the Land of Oz to acquire a potion called the elixir of the wounded heart, which can cure hearts both physically and emotionally. Robin goes through a portal into Oz, where after the portal lands on a guard after he steps out, Robin runs into Will Scarlet, who was just captured by the aforementioned guard, and frees him. The two then agree to work together, though Will wants some of the elixir for himself. Robin then takes the guard‚Äôs clothing as a disguise and uses it to break into the Wicked Witch of the West‚Äôs palace, where he bottles some of the elixir, only to have Zelena catch him, immediately assuming he is there on Rumplestiltskin‚Äôs behalf. He narrowly escapes but lies to Will, telling him that he didn‚Äôt get to gather any of the elixir. Before Robin leaves to return to Sherwood Forest, Will tells him that he is trying to mend his own broken heart, which has been crushed since his sister died. As Robin leaves to return to his realm, Will notices that a vial of the elixir has been sneakily placed in his pocket by Robin, who's tender heart was moved by Will's tale. Back in the Sherwood Forest, Robin is in his bar all alone when the Sheriff shows up looking for his money and is ready to cuff Robin, when The Merry Men led by Little John appear with arrows ready on aim; they then steal the Sheriff‚Äôs money and distribute it to the poor townspeople. As Robin and Marian make plans to stay together on the run, he gives her the six-leaf clover of Oz, which would later be the catalyst for Marian's demise by Zelena during Emma Swan and Captain Hook's stint in the Enchanted Forest. In Storybrooke As Emma and her parents search the woods for The Author, Mary Margaret tells Emma that they met him before, and David adds that he was the one responsible for placing them on the path to destroy Maleficent‚Äôs child. David explains that they didn't understand what they did out of fear, but Emma snaps and says they‚Äôve been lying to her and adds that she became the anointed savior because they destroyed someone else‚Äôs soul. Meanwhile, the Author is ahead of them, trying to make a magic quill when Gold shows up and says there are no enchanted trees in Storybrooke. Gold produces a magic quill, thereby convincing the Author to come with him, and they disappear in a magic cloud. Back in Regina‚Äôs crypt, Regina wakes up and discovers her hands are tied and sees Gold standing there, as he tells her that he has the author, but says he can‚Äôt let her find her happiness at his expense, adding that he lost everything and she will too if she doesn‚Äôt obey. Regina then panics after she sees Gold with the phone number for Robin Hood that she had in her pocket, but then uses his magic to free her so she can call him. It's nine weeks later after the events of the outside world, when Regina called Robin, only to be in shock to have her half-sister Zelena answer, explaining her domestic life with Robin, and tells Regina that they will be seeing each other very soon. After the phone call, Gold tells Regina that if she doesn't help him turn Emma's heart dark, he'll order Zelena on the phone to kill Robin. However Regina refuses to work for Gold and tells him, she won't let him turn Emma into a monster, the same way he did to her. Outside Storybrooke Nine weeks earlier, after Robin kissed Regina before stepping over the magical boundary of Storybrooke (and nine weeks before the aforementioned phone call that Regina made) to leave with Marian and Roland, they have entered New York City, where Robin tells Marian that Regina gave her the keys to Neal/Baelfire‚Äôs apartment, but as they check for directions, a man on a bike snatches Marian‚Äôs purse and Robin tries to give chase, then steals a horse and goes after the thief; he runs the guy down and tackles him then stops himself, saying a thief who steals from those in need has no honor. Unfortunately, As they have now settled in the apartment, Marian is already not happy about living in New York City, despite her feelings about Robin Hood and Regina. They then hear someone knocking on the door, and they see Gold there; he wants Robin and his family out of his son's apartment, saying that Regina told him about the Author and what will happen to her if her happy endings do not come true, but even as Robin refuses to give up the place Gold starts suffering chest pains and is taken to the hospital, where he is told that he had a heart attack. Gold explains to Robin the only thing that can cure him now is the elixir of the wounded heart, which is actually being kept safe nearby at a place called \\"The Wizard of Oak.\\" Gold tells Robin where to find it, and Robin breaks in to steal it just in time to escape the police, upsetting Marian in the process. Robin then brings the elixir to Gold in the hospital, then makes a deal that in exchange for the elixir that Gold allows Robin and his family to keep the house. As Gold drinks it, he realizes it doesn‚Äôt work, when out of nowhere, Marian enters the room with the real elixir, having swapped the real bottle; it turns out Marian was actually Zelena, who Gold discovers had been alive all along and not dead. Zelena's soul had actually travelled back in time, where she killed the real Marian back in the Enchanted Forest, by using the six-leaf clover of Oz to make Marian vanish and to transform herself into Marian. This was part of her plan to ruin Regina‚Äôs happiness, and to add the misery it's now causing to Gold, which is certainly making Zelena happy too. Gold briefly flatlines, then comes to afterwards with Zelena telling him that she wanted to make Robin fall in love with her, but he just couldn‚Äôt, making her realize that she needed the Author to change her story, and since Gold is the one that can find him, she proposes that in exchange for the only elixir that could save him, he agrees to the deal to find the Author. As Gold is finally released from the hospital, Robin give him some possessions that were left in the house while they discuss about Marian and how Robin doesn‚Äôt feel anything for her anymore, although Gold, neglecting to tell Robin the truth about what happened to his actual wife, tells Robin to pursue his happiness with whomever that may be. Robin then goes home and tells \\"Marian\\" that he wants to stay with her, no matter what they have to go through, and to prove it he deletes Regina‚Äôs phone number from his cell phone in front of \\"Marian.\\" As Robin starts kissing his \\"wife,\\" he is unaware that from what viewers see in the mirror‚Äôs reflection, it's Zelena kissing Robin instead. This would eventually later lead to the phone call that Regina made later on as alluded by Gold in Storybrooke nine weeks later. ==Cultural references== *When Robin enters Oz, the magic portal lands on the guard, and his feet are sticking out, just like the Wicked Witch of the East from the novel. *The Six-Leaf Clover is from L. Frank Baum's children's novel The Patchwork Girl of Oz. *The Enchanted Bow painting says \\"The Omaha Circus and Freak Show\\". In the novel, Omaha was the name of the Wizard's birthplace. *When Robin Hood and Will Scarlet hug, there is an overhead shot where you can see the Tin Man from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz lying on the side of the Yellow Brick Road.\\"The Tin Man cameo in Once Upon a Time\\" (April 18, 2015) *The scene when Mr. Gold's heart stops and Zelena says \\"What a beautiful echo\\" is a reference to The Wizard of Oz scene where Dorothy bangs on the Tin Woodman's chest and the Scarecrow says, \\"Beautiful! What an echo\\". ==Reception== Ratings The episode dropped slightly from the previous episode, as it posted a 1.6/5 among 18-49s with 5.17 million viewers tuning in, but at the same time helped the series win its timeslot although it did placed second among the most watched scripted programs that night behind A.D.: The Bible Continues, which had more viewers.\\"Sunday Final Ratings: 'America's Funniest Home Videos' Adjusted Up; 'Mad Secretary', 'The Good Wife' & '60 Minutes' Adjusted Down\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (April 14, 2015) Reviews The episode was met with mixed reviews. Amy Ratcliffe of IGN said of the episode, \\"The exploration of Robin Hood's origins slowed tonight's Once way down as everything about the trip to fairy tale land seemed like it was about forcing connections and parallels. However, in the modern day, learning Marian is actually Zelena almost made up for it. They shouldn't get in the habit of bringing back blasts from the past, but Zelena has the potential to shake things up so much that her return is worth it. Since she's also searching for the Author though, it would have been better to tie him more into the story considering what happened in the previous episode.\\" Ratcliffe gave the episode a 7.2 rating out of 10. Hilary Busis of Entertainment Weekly notes: \\"Like it or not, you‚Äôve got to admit that Zelena‚Äôs return was the most exciting part of an episode that otherwise read as wheel- spinning.\\"\\"Once Upon a Time recap: 'Heart of Gold'\\" from Entertainment Weekly (April 12, 2015) In a review from Rickey.org, Nick Roman cites that \\"This was one of the weirdest Once Upon A Time episodes in recent memory. Flashbacks within flashbacks, and a story that diverges from the overarching narrative we‚Äôve been following for this entire half season all contribute to making ‚ÄúHeart of Gold‚Äù feel like it‚Äôs from a different show entirely.\\" but added that despite the subpar twist, the episode's plotline was done well.\\"‚ÄòOnce Upon A Time‚Äô Review: A Face From The Past Returns In 'Heart of Gold'\\" from Rickey.org (April 12, 2015) ==ReferencesCategory:2015 American television episodes Category:Once Upon a Time (season 4) episodes ","title":"Heart of Gold (Once Upon a Time)"},{"id":"46326830","text":"The 2015 International Championship was a professional ranking snooker tournament that took place between 25 October and 1 November 2015 at the Baihu Media Broadcasting Centre in Daqing, China.

1 June 1904) was a French-born Australian politician. He was born at Nantes in France to Robert William Newman, the British Vice-Consul at Nantes, and Adelaide Heseltine. The family migrated to Sydney in 1841 and he attended Sydney Grammar School. He briefly studied law and went to the gold rush, failing at Forbes and having some success at Lucknow with the \\"Homeward Bound\\" claim, but lost all his money going into business in Lucknow. He spent four years as a mining labourer at Grenfell and a stint as a newspaper reporter at Forest Reefs (near Cadia), before returning to Lucknow and purchasing the main storekeeping business there. The second Lucknow business was very successful, and he subsequently went into mining ownership, purchasing his first mine, the \\"Uncle Tom\\", in 1878. His interests at Lucknow were partially attributed with the revival of the town, and he continued to acquire mining interests, with interests all over New South Wales and in Queensland, South Australia and New Zealand by the time of his death. He was heavily involved in local organisations in Lucknow and Orange, was a generous benefactor to local causes and having himself experienced poverty, was known for paying \\"the highest current rate of wages\\" in his mines. He was married three times and had ten children. In 1891 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Orange, with joint Labor and Free Trade endorsement. Although initially sitting as a Labor member, he refused to take the pledge and by 1894 was a Free Trader. He held the seat until his death in 1904 from heart disease at Lucknow. ==References== Category:1839 births Category:1904 deaths Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of New South Wales Category:Free Trade Party politicians Category:19th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Harry Newman (politician)"},{"id":"46326860","text":"The High Rock Petroglyph Shelter is a prehistoric rock art site in Crawford County, Arkansas.

It was the fourth ranking event of the 2015/2016 season. The 2014 champion Ronnie O'Sullivan, who had not played in professional competition since April, decided not to defend his title. He made his debut as a pundit during the tournament, providing in-studio expert analysis for Eurosport alongside Jimmy White. On the opening day of the tournament, amateur player Adam Duffy defeated world number 9 and two-time UK Champion Ding Junhui 6‚Äì2, a result that was described as \\"one of the biggest upsets in UK Championship history\\". In the sixth frame of his third-round match against Neil Robertson, Thailand's Thepchaiya Un-Nooh came close to achieving his first maximum break in professional competition, but missed the final black off the spot. The final between Australia's Neil Robertson and China's Liang Wenbo marked the first time that a British player did not compete in the UK Championship final. In the sixth frame, Robertson made the 115th official maximum break in professional competition, and the first 147 break ever attained in a Triple Crown snooker final, for which he earned ¬£44,000 (a rolling prize of ¬£40,000 for a 147 break, plus the tournament's ¬£4,000 highest break prize). It was the fourth time in a row, that a maximum was made in a UK Championship. Robertson went on to defeat Liang 10‚Äì5 to claim his second UK Championship title, and the 11th ranking title of his career. A record 104 centuries were made during the tournament, including nine from Robertson and eight from Liang. ==Prize fund== The breakdown of prize money for this year is shown below: * Winner: ¬£150,000 * Runner-up: ¬£70,000 * Semi-final: ¬£30,000 * Quarter-final: ¬£20,000 * Last 16: ¬£12,000 * Last 32: ¬£9,000 * Last 64: ¬£4,000 * Highest break: ¬£4,000 * Total: ¬£732,000 The \\"rolling 147 prize\\" for a maximum break stands at ¬£40,000 (8 ranking events since it was last won, ¬£5,000 added for each ranking event) ==Main draw== Top half Section 1 Section 2 Section 3 Section 4 Bottom half Section 5 Section 6 Section 7 Section 8 Finals ==Final== {  style=\\"font-size: 95%; margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffd700\\"  Final: Best of 19 frames.

Three victories were required to secure a head-to-head team win, but all five individual contests needed to be played, similar to the Davis Cup and Fed Cup formats in professional tennis. All matches were scheduled to include two singles contests, a doubles encounter, and two reverse singles showdowns. The top two teams from each bracket advanced to the Knockout Stages. During the Quarter-Finals, Semi- Finals, and Championship Final, the remaining national sides were paired off a head-to-head knockout bracket. The format for these head-to-head matches was a sudden death best-of-seven competition, similar to professional sporting events like baseball's World Series and basketball's NBA Finals, with the contest coming to an end as soon as one team accumulated four individual victories. These encounters were scheduled as two singles showdowns, a doubles match, two reverse singles contests, another doubles encounter, and a winner- take-all singles showdown if necessary.

He was born in Taverna, a city in the province of Catanzaro in Sila Piccola. He later studied natural science, languages and theology, probably in Naples. He certainly lived there for a few years and served as the teacher of the Archbishop Mario Carafa. At Carafa's death on 11 September 1575, d'Anania returned to Taverna where he remained until his death (between 1607 and 1609). During d'Anania's stay in Naples, he published his most famous work, L'Universale fabbrica del Mondo, ovvero Cosmografia (1573), a geographical work which consists of a preface and four volumes that provide a picture of geographical knowledge in the second half of the 16th century. A new, second edition was prepared in Venice in 1576, in which d'Anania supplemented physical geography, with history and anthropology, as well as information religious faiths.L' vniuersale fabrica del mondo, ouero Cosmografia di M Gio. Lorenzo d'Anania, diuisa in quattro Trattati: ne' quali distintamente si misura il Cielo, e la Terra, & si descriuono particolarmente le Prouincie, Citt√†, Castella, Monti, Mari, Laghi, Fiumi, & Fonti.

D'Anania also authored a theological work titled De natura daemonum, first published in Venice in 1570. In it, d'Anania posits the existence of demons, malevolent beings behind the works of astrologers and necromancers and who are responsible for any diseases which can be cured by the intercession of saints. De natura daemonum saw many editions, including that produced by Aldus Manutius.De natura daemonum Io. Laurentii Ananiae tabernatis theologi, libri quatuor. Quorum I.

She was nominated twice for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing: for Pal Joey (1957), with Jerome Thoms; and for Pepe (1960), with Al Clark. ==Career== She began working at Vitagraph Studios in Flatbush, Brooklyn as a messenger at the age of 11. At 12, she was holding title cards. In 1915, she became the second female film cutter in cinema history, after Anna McKnight, who also worked at Vitagraph. She married Frank Lawrence, her film cutting teacher at Vitagraph. In 1917, she moved to Hollywood and worked for Universal, First National, Gloria Swanson Productions, and Columbia Pictures at various times. She became Columbia's \\"head editor\\" or \\"supervising editor\\" in 1925. After director Erich von Stroheim was fired from the production of Queen Kelly (1929), star Gloria Swanson herself directed an alternate ending, with the help of cinematographer Gregg Toland and Lawrence. Lawrence edited Samuel Goldwyn Studio's first sound film, Bulldog Drummond (1929). She rejoined Columbia in 1934 and remained at the studio for the rest of her career, ending with Pepe (1960). Orson Welles biographer Charles Higham wrote that, when Lawrence was assigned to The Lady from Shanghai (1947), she reported to studio boss Harry Cohn that \\"the footage was a jumbled mess\\". She also informed Cohn that Welles \\"had not shot a single close-up\\"; Welles reluctantly obeyed orders to add some. Following poorly received previews, the studio instructed Lawrence to make drastic cuts, over an hour of footage, shortening the film to 87 minutes. The California State University, Fullerton University Archives and Special Collections has a collection of material related to Lawrence. ==Complete filmography== * Within the Law (1917) (as Viola Mallory) * An Alabaster Box (1917) (as Viola Mallory) * The Heart of Humanity (1918) (as Viola Mallory) * Loot (1919) (as Viola Mallory) * His Divorced Wife (1919) (as Viola Mallory) * The Virgin of Stamboul (1920) (uncredited) * Once to Every Woman (1920) (uncredited) * Man, Woman & Marriage (1921) * The Winning of Barbara Worth (1926) * The Devil Dancer (1927) * Two Lovers (1928) * The Awakening (1928) * Queen Kelly (1929) * Bulldog Drummond (1929) * This Is Heaven (1929) * What a Widow!

This is the first game ever created with contribution from Goichi Suda. Due to complaints about the game's difficulty, Human released \\"Super Fire Pro Wrestling 3 Easy Type\\". In this version there is no edit mode but all of the hidden wrestlers are unlocked. ;Gameplay Characters based on wrestling stars such as WWF's Hulk Hogan and WCW's Rick Rude are featured in the game along with Japanese professional wrestlers like Masahiro Chono. Each wrestler is ranked based on their attacking ability, defensive ability, and their running speed. An \\"edit mode\\" allows customized wrestlers to be created based on their wrestling type, the color of their skin, and a unique set of customized ring attire. A certain number of points also have to be spent on developing certain attacks (and their respective defense against these attacks from opposing wrestlers). Digitized voices from the wrestlers and cheers from the audience members are included. Two of the buttons on the Super Famicom controller are used for strong blows while another button is used strictly for low blows. Sprites in the game actually show wrestlers in different sizes to each other (depending on height and weight). A battle royale mode permits four wrestlers to face off against each other simultaneously. There are 56 different wrestlers to control; with eight playable wrestling legends. Referees are available and can be chosen by the player; each referee has his own level of strictness and essentially determine how long the match will last. It is possible to perform up to 300 different professional wrestling moves in the game.

It is the first game in the series to be done in full 3D. Its gameplay, however, retains the familiar timing-based grapple system found in all of the other Fire Pro games. Also, as with the other games in the series, the characters are based on real- life wrestlers that were popular at the time. Unlike its predecessors, it lacks the extensive Create-A-Wrestler mode. Super Fire Pro Wrestling X Premium Super Fire Pro Wrestling X Premium was released in 1996 for the Super Famicom. It has an extensive edit mode where up to 80 created wrestlers can be stored and used in the game. The game features likenesses of over 100 real-life professional wrestlers that were included with fake names to prevent copyright infringement. Fan translations of the game surfaced online with the advent of emulators such as Snes9x and ZSNES. These translations not only converted the Japanese text to English, but also replaced the names of each wrestling likeness to its real-life counterpart. Unlike the more frenzied pace and button-mashing of arcade-style wrestling games, Super Fire Pro Wrestling X Premium focused instead on skill and specific timing. Each wrestler possesses three different 'levels' of attacks, Weak, Medium, and Strong, and must realistically wear down the opponent to use their most powerful attacks without being reversed or countered. Fire Prowrestling S: 6Men Scramble Fire Pro Wrestling S: 6 Men Scramble was released in 1996 for the Sega Saturn. The game's story mode was called \\"Victory Road\\", which enabled \\"Title Match\\" when completed.

Scharlau (May 23, 1845 ‚Äì March 23, 1903) was an American soldier and political leader in the State of Illinois. He was born in Pomerania where his parents were farmers. In 1851 his family immigrated to the United States in search of a better life, and settled in Chicago. At age 17 Charles enlisted in the Union Army in the Fifty-seventh Illinois Volunteers, and later served under Major-General John A. Logan. After discharge Charles entered politics and served two terms in the Illinois House of Representatives where his efforts were instrumental in bringing about the successful election of John A. Logan as U.S. Senator representing Illinois. Charles' candidacy for the Illinois Legislature in 1880 led to the celebrated Scharlau-Mieroslowski contested election which, after two recounts, was not settled until three months later when the Illinois Committee on Elections ruled in Mieroslowski's favor. ==Early life and political career== Born in Alt Tellin, Germany on May 23, 1845 he was christened \\"Carl Johann Ludwig Ernst Scharlau\\" and assumed the name Charles E. Scharlau after immigrating to the United States in 1851. His family set down roots in Chicago, Illinois where Charles attended the Franklin Public School. At twelve years of age Charles apprenticed as a gilder, eventually becoming foreman of Rando & Company's picture frame establishment. In 1862, at seventeen years of age, he enlisted in Company G 57th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, then re-enlisted as a veteran at Lynnville, Tennessee, in December 1863. He served in the Sixteenth Army Corps under General Richard J. Oglesby, and in the Fifteenth Corps under Major-General John A. Logan. He was with the Army of the Tennessee on Sherman's March to the Sea, and was injured May 9, 1864, in the passage of the Oostanaula River, at the Battle of Resaca. He was in the Battle of Bentonville, NC, and was in the Grand Review of the Armies at Washington D.C., May 23, 1865. Charles received his discharge in June 1865 and soon thereafter returned to Chicago to resume work at his trade. Appointments and Positions Charles was appointed Deputy Sheriff by Sheriff Tim Bradley in 1870, and remained in that position four years, and then served as Deputy County Collector under County Collector Louis Huck, and was Deputy Assessor for West Chicago under Assessor Pleasant Ansick. When Jacob Rehm was Chief of Police and Charles Rehm Chief of Detectives, Mr. Scharlau briefly held a position in the Detective force. In 1891 he was appointed General Inspector in the Board of Public Works by Mayor Hempstead Washburne, and held that position until the end of Mr. Washburne's term in 1893. In 1868 he was a delegate in the Republican County Convention, and was offered but declined the nomination for Supervisor of Chicago's Fourteenth Ward. He served as Central Committeeman and delegate to various State, County and City Conventions from 1868 onward. Candidacies and Contested Election In 1874 he became a candidate for the Illinois State House of Representatives and was defeated. In 1880 he was again a candidate, running against S. D. Mieroslowski, and out of this election the celebrated Scharlau-Mieroslowski contest arose. The ballots, after three counts, showed Scharlau ahead by 50 votes. But upon being taken to Springfield the Committee on Elections declared Mieroslowski elected by a margin of 8607 votes to 8548 for Scharlau.Chicago Daily Tribune, \\"The State Capital\\", Chicago, Illinois, Fri, March 4, 1881, Page 9 In 1882 there were rival Senatorial conventions in the District, and Scharlau was the nominee of the Fourteenth Ward wing, but declined the nomination in favor of William E. Mason. In 1884 he was nominated and elected to the House of Representatives by the largest majority ever received by a candidate in the District, defeating August Wendel, a prominent and popular German. He was renominated for the House by acclamation on September 29, 1886, and was re-elected. While in the House he secured passage of the Park Bill, allowing an additional tax of half a mill for park improvements. He was a member of the Committee on Labor and Industrial Affairs, and a supporter of the Convict Labor Bill. In his later years he practiced law in Chicago,Illinois State Bar Association, Proceedings of the Illinois State Bar Association at Its Annual Meeting, Illinois State Register Book Publishing House, 1899, p. 21 and was a member of the Kent Law School Class of 1894.Chicago-Kent College of Law, Kent Law School, 1894 ==References== Category:1903 deaths Category:Members of the Illinois House of Representatives Category:1845 births Category:Illinois Republicans Category:People of Illinois in the American Civil War Category:Illinois lawyers ","title":"Charles E.

Several of the group eventually replaced members of the Lisbon Lions team that had won the European Cup in 1967. George Connelly, Kenny Dalglish, Davie Hay, Danny McGrain, Lou Macari and Paul Wilson all went on to win major honours at Celtic and were capped by Scotland. In August 1968, Celtic Reserves needed to defeat Partick Thistle Reserves by at least seven goals to win their Reserve League Cup section over Rangers Reserves. Celtic won 12‚Äì0, with Macari scoring four goals. Later that same year Scotland manager Bobby Brown asked Celtic manager Jock Stein to supply players to provide opposition for a warm-up practice match. Stein sent his young reserve side, and they went on to defeat a full strength Scotland international team (including Colin Stein and Billy Bremner) 5‚Äì2.

The word \\"oreum\\" is the Jeju dialect which implies the parasitic cone [Hangul: Ï∏°ÌôîÏÇ∞, Hanja: ÂÅ¥ÁÅ´Â±±) (also Hangul: Í∏∞ÏÉùÌôîÏÇ∞, Hanja: ÂØÑÁîüÁÅ´Â±±) and the origin of a word \\"oreum\\" is a noun type of the word \\"climb\\" (Hangul: Ïò§Î•¥Îã§). The name refers to a small volcano within a main volcanic crater in Jeju-do and is usually applied to the hill in Jeju.:ko:Ï∏°ÌôîÏÇ∞ The cinder cone, symbolizing the oreum, is a typical form of Jeju Oreum.„ÄéÏ†úÏ£ºÏùò Ïò§Î¶Ñ„Äè (Ï†úÏ£ºÎèÑ, 1998) The Oreum is divided into pyroclastic cone, tuff cone and lava dome depending on the nature of volcanic eruptions. The pyroclastic cones are volcanic bodies formed by the accumulation of volcanic clusters released into the air by explosive eruption.ÎÑ§Ïù¥Î≤Ñ ÏßÄÏãùÎ∞±Í≥º, 'Ïò§Î¶Ñ' (ÌïúÍµ≠Ìñ•ÌÜ†Î¨∏ÌôîÏ†ÑÏûêÎåÄÏ†Ñ, ÌïúÍµ≠ÌïôÏ§ëÏïôÏó∞Íµ¨Ïõê) More than 360 Oreums are distributed throughout Jeju Island from the mountains to coast, centered on Mt. Halla. These Oreums are characterized by the fact that their formations are not long and the prototype is well preserved due to the high permeability of rainwater. When talking about life in Jeju Island, Oreum is an indispensable object with Dol Hareubang (Hangul: ÎèåÌïòÎ•¥Î∞©) and is a symbol of Jeju Island. To the people of Jeju Island, it has been sacred as a site of folk religion. So, even now, in the areas, can be found traces of the site in which the villagers performed ancestral worship rituals. Oreum has also become the home of the villages as a base for people living in Jeju. The people gathered at the base of Oreums, planted the fields, farmed the fields, and livestocked. Efforts are being made to protect and manage Oreum as a target of sustainable development. It was designated as Natural Monument (No. 444) in 2005 and was registered as A World Heritage Site in 2007 under the name of 'Geomunoreum Lava Cave System' in Korea. The Geomunoreum lava tube system (Hangul: Í±∞Î¨∏Ïò§Î¶Ñ Ïö©ÏïîÎèôÍµ¥Í≥Ñ) is one of Jeju's three locations to be designated as UNESCO World Natural Heritage Sites. == Formation == Magma erupting under pressure can solidify into scoria, which may fall and pile up around the crater to form circular and elliptical scoria cones and cinder cones. These are popularly known as Oreum in Jeju Island. There are about 360 such Oreum. Oreum are classified as cinder cones, lava domes, fault blocks, or cryptodomes. If the internal density of the volcano sufficient to prevent collapse, a crater is formed, while a collapse produces a caldera. In the case of Mt. Halle, the crater Baekrokdam was formed. The typical caldera terrain on the Korea peninsula is Cheonji on Mt. Baekdu. As the formation of the Oreum occurred in the Cenozoic era and is thus relatively recent, the initial topography of the volcanoes has been well preserved and frequently allows investigation of characteristics like spouting time and eruption specifics, in addition to influences on surface formation that lead to different oreum shapes (e.g., horseshoe-, cone-, circle-, or hybrid-type).Ïù¥Î¨∏Ïõê¬∑ÏÜêÏù∏ÏÑù, 1983, „ÄéÏ†úÏ£ºÎèÑÎäî Ïñ¥ÎñªÍ≤å ÎßåÎì§Ïñ¥ÏßÑ ÏÑ¨ÏùºÍπå„Äè, ÎèÑÏÑúÏ∂úÌåê Ï∂òÍ¥ë == Famous Oreum ==  Geomunoreum  The image of (Hangul: Í±∞Î¨∏Ïò§Î¶Ñ) Geomunoreum (Hangul: Í±∞Î¨∏Ïò§Î¶Ñ) forms boundary among Jocheon-eup Jeju-si, Namwon-eup Seogwipo-si and Pyoseon-myeon Seogwipo-si. The crater of top is complex form divided into east and west by ridge. The Oreum located Jeju 400 m of Jeju northeast bevel's sea is where many caves are concentrated. This Oreum is important because the lava flows that flowed from this volcano reached shoreline in the direction of the northeast along the terrain gradient and completed the lava tube structure including about 20 caves. The cave system of three direction are formed in this cave structure. The first cave system is Geomunoreum to Dangcheomul cave, which is about 13 km and leads to Banjul cave (Hangul: Î±ÖÎí§Íµ¥), Manjanggul Cave (Hangul: ÎßåÏû•Íµ¥), Gimnyongsa cave (Hangul: ÍπÄÎÖïÏÇ¨Íµ¥) and Dangcheomul cave (Hangul: ÎãπÏ≤òÎ¨ºÍµ¥) in lava cave structure formed nearly straight line. It can be traced on a topographic map. According to result of research on the Jeju natural heritage site, the scale of lava cave developed around Sunheul-ri Geomunoreum and the extension cave things have been confirmed to be world class. It was listed as UNESCO World Natural Heritage in June 2007 because of its high academic and natural heritage value.  Yongnunioreum  Yongnunioreum (Hangul: Ïö©ÎààÏù¥Ïò§Î¶Ñ) is located in Jongdal-ri Gujwa-eup Jeju-si. The top of Yongnunioreum is composed of three peaks around the top of north-east direction, and there is an elliptical crater somewhat opened in the east‚Äìwest direction. Overall, the shape of mountain is a horseshoe-shaped crater that spreads shallowly toward the east slope. At the foot of the west slope, there are a small parasitic volcano with marginated top and two conical parasitic volcanos, Aloreum, and it is recorded as a complex Oreum formed with two or more crater along with Yongnunioreum (Hangul: Ïö©ÎààÏù¥Ïò§Î¶Ñ) and Donurioreum (Hangul: ÎèÑÎÑàÎ¶¨Ïò§Î¶Ñ). Especially, a complex volcano made up of various craters is known as an unusual shape. It is said that it is called Oreum because of the shape of Oreum, the figure of the dragons playing, lying and rising in regard to the origin of the place name.  Geumoreum  The image of (Hangul: Í∏àÏò§Î¶Ñ) Geumoreum (Hangul: Í∏àÏò§Î¶Ñ) is located in Geumak-ri Hallim-eup Jeju- si. It is one of the representative Oreum of western middle mountain area. It is parasitic volcanic with a large circular crater and a mountaintop crater lake. It has 2 peaks in the north and the south, leading to a low col in the east and the west. The mountaintop crater lake was in a great volume of water but the floor of the lake is exposed now. \\"Geum\\" (Hangul: Í∏à) stands for God and it can be seen that it has been sacred from ancient time.  Saebyeoloreum  Saebyeoloreum (Hangul: ÏÉàÎ≥ÑÏò§Î¶Ñ) is located in Bongseong-ri Aewol-eup Jeju-si. Saebyeoloreum was also called the Saebeloreum or Saebiloreum. It was written as Hyobyeolak(Chinese: ÊõâÂà•Â≤≥) in Sinjeungdonggukyeojiseungram (Hangul: Ïã†Ï¶ùÎèôÍµ≠Ïó¨ÏßÄÏäπÎûå), Hyoseongak(Chinese: ÊõâÊòüÂ≤≥)in Tamraji (Hangul: ÌÉêÎùºÏßÄ) and Sinseongak(Chinese: Êñ∞ÊòüÂ≤≥) in Jejuguyneupji (Hangul: Ï†úÏ£ºÍµ∞ÏùçÏßÄ). There is a view that Saebel and Saebil are Jeju dialect and they mean stars but it's uncertain. At the southern peak, there are ridges in the southwest, northwest, and northeast directions and there are 5 dagger-shaped mountaintops looked like a star. And Saebyeoloreum was the place where Goryeo[Korean] military under General Choi Young suppressed Mongolian military.  Darangswioreum  Darangswioreum (Hangul: Îã§ÎûëÏâ¨Ïò§Î¶Ñ) is located in Sehwa-ri, Gujwa-eup, Jeju-si. Although it is only 382 meters above sea level, it has all of the characteristics of a volcanic terrain and is called a 'queen of Oreum'. Darangswi (Hangul: Îã§ÎûëÏâ¨) is the dialect of Jeju which means the Moon. It is named Darangswi because the crater of mountain peaks looks like a full moon. There is a large, deep funnel-shaped circular crater in the mountain area. The outer circumference of this crater is about 1,500 m. It forms a long ellipse from south to north, the north is relatively flat. The depth of the crater is 115 m, which is same with Baekrokdam in Halla Mountain. Most of Oreum are asymmetrically inclined, whereas Darangswioreum is arranged with concentric contour lines. There is a village of Darangswi, which was abandoned due to the 4.3 incident. In 1992, eleven of the remains of the victims were unearthed at the Darangswi cave.  Ttarabioreum  Ttarabioreum (Hangul: Îî∞ÎùºÎπÑÏò§Î¶Ñ) is located in Gasi-ri, Pyoseon-myeon, Seogwipo- si. The biggest feature is there are 3 craters. Several large and small peaks are connected with a smooth ridge. On the horseshoe-shaped foot of the mountain, there are debris slide layers as Dunjioreum in Gujwa-eup. It is said that it is considered to belong to a recent volcano erupted because of the debris slide. It is said that the name, Ttarabi (Hangul: Îî∞ÎùºÎπÑ) comes from the name Ttangharabeoji (hangul: ÎïÖÌï†ÏïÑÎ≤ÑÏßÄ), which looks like a family with near oreums. Ttangharabeoji means grandfather for ground in English. Ttarabioreum is a typical autumn oreum. As well as the foot of the oreum, the surrounding mountain are all silver grass field. The old days, horses was released and raised in this great grassland. == Distribution of Jeju Oreum == This is an image from this source. * Jeju City (Hangul: Ï†úÏ£ºÏãú) : 59 * Seogwipo City Hangul: ÏÑúÍ∑ÄÌè¨Ïãú) : 37 * North part of Jeju (Hangul: Î∂ÅÏ†úÏ£ºÍµ∞) : 151 (Hallim Town 16, Aewol Town 50, Gujwa Town 40, Jocheon Town 30, Hangyeong-myeon 13, Udo-myeon 2) * South part of Jeju (Hangul: ÎÇ®Ï†úÏ£ºÍµ∞) : 121 (Daejeong Town 8, Namwon Town 29, Seongsan Town 22, Andeok-myeon 31, Pyoseon-myeon 31) == Classification by Type == {  !Classification !Sum !Horseshoe-type !Cone-type !Circle-type !Hybrid-type - Sum 368 174 102 53 39 - Jeju City 59 29 21 6 3 - Seogwipo City 37 8 20 6 3 - Hallim Town 16 9 2 2 3 - Aewol Town 50 25 17 2 6 - Gujwa Town 40 26 1 7 6 - Jocheon Town 30 17 2 7 4 - Hangyeong-myeon 13 5 2 3 3 - Udo-myeon 2  - 1  - 1 - Daejeong Town 8 3 3 1 1 - Namwon Town 29 12 11 6  - - Seongsan Town 22 9 6 5 2 - Andeok-myeon 31 13 10 3 5 - Pyoseon-myeon 31 18 6 5 2 } „Ñ¥(This is a chart from this source) == List of Oreums == This is a list of...

Byzantine units of measurement were a combination and modification of the ancient Greek and Roman units of measurement used in the Byzantine Empire. Until the reign of Justinian I (527‚Äì565), no universal system of units of measurement existed in the Byzantine world, and each region used its traditional measures. Justinian began the process of standardization that resulted in a specifically Byzantine system, chiefly due to the need of such a system for the fiscal administration. Official measurement and weighing was performed subject to an array of charges including the mestikon, miniatikon, zygastikon, kambaniatikon, gomariatikon, and samariatikon. Despite the central government's insistence on the use of official measures, other systems continued to be used in parallel, whether due to local traditions or foreign influences, or in order to cover the necessities of specific trades or crafts. In addition, from the 12th century, foreign merchants such as the Venetians, Pisans, and Genovese operating within the Empire received the right to use their own systems. ==Length== The Byzantine Empire continued to employ the anthropometric units used by the Greeks and Romans. Weights and measures acts were sometimes undertaken by the emperors as forms of tax reform. An 11th-century guide to Byzantine tax collection contains emendations concerning the Emperor Michael's addition of a palm to the fathom used in computing the schoinion, an act which reduced the holders' taxable area by about 5%. {  style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\\" +Units of length - !

This has been reconstructed on the basis of known legislation of Constantine the Great in 309 establishing 72 gold solidi (, n√≥misma) to the pound. As the early solidi weighed 4.55 g, the pound was therefore 0.3276 kg at the time. The solidus was repeatedly debased, however, implying average pounds of 0.324 kg (4th‚Äì6th century), 0.322 kg (6th‚Äì7th century), 0.320 kg (7th‚Äì9th century), 0.319 kg (9th‚Äì13th century), and even less thereafter. Model weights were made in lead, bronze, and glass and (less often) from gold and silver. They came in various styles. Presently, archaeologists believe the bronze spheres sliced flat at top and bottom and marked with an omicron/upsilon date from the early 3rd to late 5th centuries, gradually being replaced by cubes marked with a gamma/omicron (êÜÑ) over the course of the 4th century. In the second half of the 6th century, these were replaced by discs until at least the early 9th century and possibly the 12th. The glass weights had numerous advantages in manufacture and use but seem to have disappeared following the loss of the empire's Syrian and Egyptian provinces in the 7th century. Analysis of the thousands of surviving model weights strongly suggest multiple local weight standards in the Byzantine Empire before the Arab conquests. Under Justinian, the weights of currency were administered by the ' and commodity weights by the praetorian prefect and eparch of the city. By the 9th century, the eparch nominally controlled all official weights in Constantinople, although archaeology has shown others issued their own weights, including proconsuls, ', and ' in the west and anthypatoi, counts, and ephors in the east. {  style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\\" +Units of weight - !

At the time of the accident, both aircraft were operating under visual flight rules. The weather was good, with a few clouds and 50 km visibility. The collision occurred at an altitude of about , approximately north-west of Zell am See Airport, as the helicopter flew over the airport's traffic pattern travelling north-north-eastwards. At the same time, the light aircraft was climbing through the traffic pattern and was subsequently involved in a collision with the helicopter, destroying both aircraft. The Austrian Federal Department of Aviation's Air Accident Investigation Board launched an investigation into the accident, releasing the investigation report on 9 April 2008. The report stated that the main cause of the accident was the inability of both pilots to see the other aircraft in time to avoid the collision as a result of the reduced fields of vision allowed by the cockpit designs. Another factor in the collision was the subtle limitations on visual perception relating in part to the proximity of the mountain slope not far below both aircraft, requiring both pilots' attention to maintain suitable terrain clearance. == See also == * Inattentional blindness, also known as perceptual blindness, is the failure to notice a fully visible, but unexpected object because attention was engaged on another task, event, or object. * Change blindness is a surprising perceptual phenomenon that occurs when a change in a visual stimulus is introduced and the observer does not notice it. ==References *Inattentional Blindness, an article by Daniel J.

It was produced on a shoestring budget in Washington, DC and surrounding suburbs \\"Local Movie Making for the Masses\\". Retrieved 2015-04-01. and premiered on March 3, 2012 at the DC Independent Film Festival.\\"DCIFF: Ultrasonic\\". The film won the Best of Fest award at the DC Independent Film Festival and went on to receive a limited theatrical and on-demand distribution deal with Garden Thieves Pictures. ==Plot== Ultrasonic tells the tale of Simon York ‚Äì music teacher, married, soon to be father. Simon plays in a band and dreams of one day getting paid to write music. For now, however, money is tight and Simon shelling out $2000 to record an album is an additional cause of stress on his marriage to Ruth. Jonas is Ruth‚Äôs troubled brother and spends his days handing out flyers and trying to, ‚Äúopen peoples‚Äô eyes,‚Äù to his theories of conspiracies and injustices in the world. One night Simon hears what he thinks is a very real sound in an alleyway. The sound does not disappear and remains audible from his house. Ruth doesn‚Äôt hear it and she dismisses it, claiming that his ears are ringing from years of loud music. Jonas‚Äô reaction to Simon‚Äôs ailment is much different than Ruth‚Äôs. Jonas believes Simon and, after doing some research, believes that what Simon is hearing is in fact a government experiment, which utilizes an ultrasonic auditory signal to control the minds of all who hear it. Simon, with some prodding from Ruth, goes to visit an ear doctor who informs him that his test results show Simon‚Äôs hearing to be least 6,000 Hz higher than the average human. This convinces Jonas that his theory is correct, and the two of them embark on a journey to get to the bottom of the sound experiment and stop the noise. ==Soundtrack== The Rock Songs - Ultrasonic begins and ends with a song. The songs were contributed by Rao‚Äôs two previous bands, Tigertronic and The Translucents, playing the opening and closing songs of the movie, respectively. The songs were written by the bands, with lyrics and vocal performances by Rao. These songs will be on the soundtrack in addition to the electronica pieces that comprise the rest of the soundtrack. The Electronica Songs - For the rest of the soundtrack, Rao utilized a relatively unknown piece of software called Renoise. Renoise allowed Rao to implement a technique known as beat-slicing to create the distinct frenetic feel of the electronic beats, and coupled it with analog instruments like the piano. The resulting pieces add a vibe of underlying tension to the film and help create the film‚Äôs unique feel, often leaving the audience wondering if the sound that Simon hears is also the sounds that they are hearing on the soundtrack. ==Reception== Ultrasonic opened to middling reviews. The Washington Post called it \\"an impressive feat\\" while giving it two out of four stars. The soundtrack reaction was also split, with some critics lauding it as the star of the film while others calling it \\"monotonously percussive electronica that unfortunately serves to distance us from, rather than draw us into, Simon's private aural torment.\\" Brent Simon of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association gave Ultrasonic its most positive review. ==References * Ultrasonic Official Website * Ultrasonic Trailers * * \\"Ultrasonic Movie Review\\" Category:2012 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2012 action drama films Category:2012 romantic drama films Category:American action drama films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American independent films Category:Films shot in Washington, D.C.

Kirk argued that \\"the New Zealand farmer has always been at the mercy of the overseas shipping companies.\\" Upon election to office following the 1972 general election, Kirk moved quickly to establish the shipping line, appointing former Meat Board chairman John Ormond as chairman and Federation of Labour President Tom Skinner as his deputy.

Retrieved 4 April 2015. Around 1871, his family moved to Victoria, Australia where his father became a principal of Whittingham Bros, a pastoral firm that had holdings in several states. He attended Kew High School before attending Geelong Grammar School and in 1887, Whittingham studied arts at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He next studied medicine at London University but after three years his studies were interrupted due to the deaths of his father and elder brother and Whittingham headed back to Australia to look after the family's business interests. The Whittingham Homestead at Alice Downs Station, 1908 In 1901, Whittingham was sent to manage Alice Downs, a property near Blackall that his father and brother, John had taken up in 1878. Along with another brother, Harold, he bought the property in 1903 and in 1909, after buying out Harold's interest, became sole owner of the run. He had stocked the property with 80,000 Merino sheep but land resumptions of the property to meet the increasing nearby population led to purchasing several more properties in Central Queensland. ==Political career== Having been Chairman of the Kargoolnah Shire Council and a Member of the Barcoo Marsupial Board, Whittingham's first attempt at entering state politics was at the 1907 state election, where, as an independent Ministerial candidate, he contested the electoral district of Barcoo and was soundly defeated by the sitting member, George Kerr. Whittingham was called to the Legislative Council on 1 July 1912, serving for the next 10 years until the Council was abolished in 1922. During his time in the Council, he was bitterly opposed to the Labor Government's changes to the land Acts and to plans to abolish the Council which eventually took place in March 1922, ending his political career. He was a founding member of the Queensland Recruiting Committee during World War I. ==Personal life== At St John's Cathedral in Brisbane, on 4 June 1913, Whittingham married Cecile Viva Condamine Taylor, the daughter of the late Condamine Taylor, and, after Taylor's death, step-daughter of the late Charles Lumley Hill, a former member of the Legislative Assembly. They lived at Mayfield in the suburb of Hamilton and in the 1920s it became a centre of Brisbane's social activities with Cecile being described as 'Queensland's best dressed woman'. Mayfield, the Whittingham residence in Brisbane, 1910 Whittingham's business career was wide and varied. Along with his pastoral interests, he was a director of The Union Trustee Company, the Blackall Wool Scouring Company, and the Australian Mercantile, Land, and Finance Company. He was a prominent Freemason, belonged to several sporting and cultural clubs, and was patron of the RACQ. For several years Whittingham was consular agent for Italy. Whittingham died of heart disease at the Mater Misericordiae Private Hospital in June 1927. His funeral was held at St John's Cathedral and proceeded to the Toowong Cemetery.Whittingham Arthur Herbert ‚Äì Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search. Retrieved 6 April 2015.

Characters are listed by order of appearance in the storyline. ==Mingchao's Cohort== Mingchao :: is a young, orphaned Chinese girl who lives by herself in the Old West. She dreams of becoming a famous superstar. Her grandfather created the mysterious Eto gun, which she can fire with the number XII that had been branded on her palm on accident when she was younger. Mingchao has a kind, carefree personality, and can show outstanding courage when her friends are in danger. She is also incredibly fortunate to where Benkate has dubbed her as having the \\"Devil's Luck\\" due to her ability to narrowly avoid death or injury. She refuses to kill any person, and often stops others from killing their enemies, no matter how bad they are. This stems from her belief that it is sad whenever someone dies, and that killing someone would make her as bad as the murdering scoundrels she frowns upon. She is very forgiving, even allowing Alternate, a was an enemy, to join the group. Her demeanor makes her likable to others, and she builds friendships easily, even with people who dislike her at first. She shares a special bond with Baskerville (or, as she calls him, \\"Mr. Priest\\"), and cares about him deeply. She was the most heartbroken when it was everyone thought he had died, even when knowing he might've been using her. When it was discovered he was still alive, but had amnesia and was working for Blush, she was the only one who had any confidence he would regain his memory. She has never wavered in her faith that he's a good person, even when the others, and even Baskerville himself, didn't believe so. She was so ecstatic when he showed the first signs of remembering her that she didn't care that she was falling several dozen feet into a stormy, raging ocean, and she cried happy tears when they were reunited. It is implied several times that she may have romantic feeling towards him despite their obvious age gap, as pointed out by other characters such as Benkate and Luriele. The only real indication is she seems happiest when he's by her side. ::When it became clear how many lives were being ruined by the Syndicate, Mingchao and her friends started trying to find a way to stop it. But it seemed the closer they got to discovering what the Syndicate was, the more it seemed Mingchao's family was connected to it somehow. When the gang reached Manhattan, they soon found themselves battered, injured, and in the heart of the Syndicate, face to face with its leader \\"Gothic\\". To Mingchao's horror, he reveals himself as her father. Her father then gloated about his dark, underground exploits and how great it was he'd gained so much power. Mingchao, appalled that she shared this man's blood, grew enraged by his callous referrals to all the misery he caused. Her rage and sadness only amplified when Gothic, discovering his daughter didn't agree with him, mercilessly attacked her comrades. Desperate to stop him, Mingchao, with Baskerville's help, shot him with the Eto gun's powerful dragon bullet and he fell to his death. This made Gothic the first, and probably only, life she willingly took. She had to because she'd lose the people she cared about if she didn't. At the series' end, Mingchao goes off to continue following her dream of achieving stardom, and to her great joy, Baskerville decides to join her. Baskerville ::After Mingchao saves him from vultures, introduces himself as a traveling priest. He displays a deadly prowess with throwing knives. When it is shown that his \\"Bible\\" actually carries information on the Eto gun, it becomes obvious his goals are much darker than those of a simple missionary. At first he seems to only be using Mingchao to get the Eto gun, but this changes as he begins to care about her. It is later revealed his real name is } and he was a member of The Syndicate, a shady organization that sells drugs and seeks to gather unique guns. The guns they want the most are the Eto and Zodiac guns. It is later shown that Baskerville lost his parents at a young age, leaving him to care for his younger sister, Chisel, whom he doted on. When Chisel fell ill, he joined the Syndicate out of desperation so he could get medicine for her. He gained a reputation as a ruthless killer who showed no mercy, even to children, all for the sake of his sister's health. However, the medicine he was receiving turned out to be a dangerous narcotic that if abused could over time rot the body from the inside out. By the time he learned this it was already too late for Chisel. After Chisel's death, he took on an identity as a wandering priest and started plotting to find and use the Eto gun to kill the Syndicate boss and avenge Chisel. The cross he wears identifies him as a Syndicate member with the engraving of a bride in a wedding dress on the back; however, he now wears the cross in memory of Chisel, as it had been a gift from her. He grows to be devoted to Mingchao; he hates seeing her hurt or cry, and he has wept at the thought of her dying. Because of his affection for her, it becomes a running gag in the series. He is often accused of having a \\"Lolita-complex\\", usually by Benkate, and the issue is the subject of a few omakes. Despite his criminal past, he's proven to be a very caring individual. He never goes back on his word once he promises something, and doesn't hesitate to put his life on the line to save his friends, and even people he doesn't know well. ::After risking his life to save Mingchao and the others from Gordy, he suffers memory loss when Gordy's gold mine collapses on him, and is later found by Cavanaugh and taken in by Blush. His head injury caused him to suffer from intense headaches that seemed to worsen over time, and Blush starts to offer Baskerville \\"medicine\\" for his headaches to make him do his bidding. Unfortunately for Baskerville, he does not remember the medicine is the same drug that led his sister to her death. Eventually, Baskerville becomes so dependent on the addictive narcotic that he starts becoming a mental wreck. He begins following even the most dangerous of Blush's demands to get the \\"medicine\\", such as picking up a heated Eto gun from a burning furnace. This ended up branding his hand, enabling him to fire the gun. He is also goaded several times into nearly shooting Mingchao. When he regains his memories, he stops experiencing headaches and stops relying on the drug. Later he travels with Cavanaugh with plans to infiltrate the Syndicate and kill the boss with the Eto gun, so he continues to pretend he has amnesia to divert her suspicion. His plan fails, but he's able to rejoin Mingchao and the others. In the final battle he is given a powerful dose of opium to numb the pain of his injuries so he can help Mingchao. The dose was so powerful that his lifespan is likely shortened. He decides to live out the rest of his life traveling alongside Mingchao and dedicating himself to helping others whose lives have been ruined by the Syndicate. Benkate :: is a collector of exotic guns. She enters the series having 99 guns in her possession, with a fierce desire to make the Eto gun, and later the Zodiac, the 100th and 101st guns in her collection. Many of her guns are concealed, some of which are even a part of her own clothing, so she is almost never unarmed. Her favorites include two gun earrings, gun boots, a gun designed to look like a cat, a three-barreled multi-directional pistol, and a powerful seven-foot-long folding rifle. She crossed paths with Baskerville in the past while they were looking for the same gun, though she was never aware of his real name or his ties to the Syndicate. She was shocked when she later learned of his past. Apparently the conflict resulted in the two having hostile feelings towards each other until Mingchao forced them to work together. At first glance she's a tall, skinny, somewhat masculine woman with a ruthless disposition who shows no mercy towards anyone who gets between her and a gun she wants, but overtime she shows a more caring side. Like Baskerville, she begins to care about Mingchao as she learns the girl's more endearing and admirable qualities. Her relationship with Baskerville also softens, with the two of them eventually talking like old friends that like to annoy each other but at the same time respect each other. She gets agitated when it is believed that Baskerville was dead and again when she learns he's lost his memory. Despite themselves, they work well together, and Benkate likes to flirt with Baskerville and tease him. She is often paired with Yaghi when the group splits up and has protected him on many occasions. She acts as a sort of substitute big sister to him if Fino isn't around to play her role. In general Benkate shows a soft spot for Yaghi and looks out for his well-being. ::She made a promise with Mingchao to never kill again after Mingchao saved her life, and she has kept that promise. She started off in the series having long, bushy hair tied back with a ponytail, but when she gets captured and held hostage, her hair gets hacked off by Cavanaugh. Benkate later expresses annoyance with her new, shorter haircut, though is grateful that she and everyone else is alive. After the series ends she loses her desire for the Eto and Zodiac guns, and instead goes off to search for another gun that might be worthy of holding the 100th place in her collection. Fino :: is a teenage Native American girl who wields the Zodiac gun, which uses the essences of the Constellations. At first she doesn't trust Mingchao or the others, but later accepts them as friends. It is later revealed that her distrust of white people comes from when she met Blush as a small child. Her people found Blush in bad shape and Fino helped nurse him back to health. He'd been kind to her and her people and learned about their ways. But when Fino's parents refused to talk about the tribe's sacred treasure, Blush proceeded to murder them in cold blood with his guns, leaving the two children orphans. After that, she grew bitter and developed a hatred for guns and white men, thinking that no one could be trusted except her own people. Ever since then she's wanted revenge against Blush for deceiving her and ruining her family. She is the most cautious of the group and has a hard time trusting others. She is also a vegetarian. ::She had been opposed to Alternate joining the team because he'd been so easily deceived by Blush. It wasn't until he saved her and the others from a monopolizing gang that she finally accepted him. He saves her yet again from Cavanaugh, taking a direct hit from the Eto gun in the process. At one point, she makes him an Indian-styled outfit after his shirt had been ruined. By the end of the series it seemed that Fino had started to care for him, and it is possible that she's developed romantic feelings for him. She and Alternate can relate to one another since his father was also killed by Blush, and thus both share a common goal of wanting to bring Blush to justice. After the Syndicate is dissolved, she decides to travel with Alternate to track down Blush. Yaghi :: is Fino's younger brother. He is more trusting and outgoing than his sister. He's very adventurous and cares about his sister a lot. After Benkate saves his life, he starts hanging around her more and looks up to her, and she in turn looks out for him. An omake drawn by one of Nakazaki's assistants shows that Yaghi dreams of one day making Benkate his wife, though he fears his sister wouldn't approve. Yaghi is very talkative and friendly to other people, which makes him likable to others. However, he is sometimes too trusting, as once he allowed the Zodiac to be taken away while his sister was taking a bath. Yaghi is also incredibly brave for his age and is willing to do anything for people he cares about, though this causes worry for Fino since it puts him at risk of being hurt. A testament to his bravery is how he willingly stayed behind with Benkate to help her hold off a band of hooligans in order to let Mingchao and the others get away, despite the danger it put him in. At the end of the series he went with Fino and Alternate to return to his village. Alternate :: is the first recurring antagonist, who later becomes a hero. He is intelligent and a decent gunman, and is identified by the monocle he wears over his left eye. He wants to get his hands on the Eto gun, and makes several failed attempts to do so. His father, Gordy, a member of the Syndicate, is betrayed and murdered by fellow member Blush. Blush then told Alternate that Mingchao had done it. He becomes obsessed with revenge and is tricked into obeying Blush. Upon learning Blush was the true killer, Alternate assists the others in saving Mingchao from Blush. From then on he vows to find and punish Blush for what he did. When he wants to join the others, all seem to oppose the idea except Mingchao. After rescuing Fino, Yaghi, and Big, the others accept him as well. ::Alternate had a very lonely life, as he was almost the polar opposite of Mingchao. He would lie, cheat, and hurt people to get what he wanted. Because of this, he had never had a single friend. However, like many of the other characters, he begins to change under Mingchao's influence, and his true personality eventually comes out. He is somewhat insecure, partly due to guilt and a disbelief that he'll be forgiven for all the trouble he caused. But he has proven to be brave in the face of danger, willing put his life on the line to defend his friends. He seems to have grown to care a lot for Fino, and possibly has romantic feelings for her. He ends up saving her life twice, once taking a bullet in the chest from the Eto gun for her. She seems to reciprocate these feelings at least in part, when she makes him a new shirt after his old one is ruined. She also expresses worry after he is injured saving her. He goes off with Fino and Yaghi when the gang splits up at the end. ==The Syndicate== Bokassy ::Bokassy is an information broker and a member of the Syndicate. Baskerville goes to him to get information on the Eto gun. Baskerville knows Bokassy but Bokassy doesn‚Äôt recognize him until later on. When Bokassy finds out the Eto gun is in town, he tries to have Baskerville and Benkate murdered to gain access to the gun, but he fails. He then tells Alternate about the gun, calling him \\"Master Alternate\\", indicating some kind of superior-subordinate relationship with him, even though Alternate isn‚Äôt with the Syndicate. Bokassy disappears and is likely dead after falling off a runaway train. Gordy ::Gordy is a member of the Syndicate who digs a gold mine in a mountain Fino‚Äôs tribe regards as sacred. He is ruthless and mean, even towards Alternate, his own son. He is territorial to where he will attack anyone who comes close to his mine. A tall and muscular man, Gordy is greedy and wears a lot of gold jewelry, as well as armor made of gold under his clothes. Concept art for Gordy showed him as shorter and more slender, but Nakazaki admitted he liked drawing \\"buff guys\\", and so Gordy's final design was muscular. ::Gordy tries to trap Mingchao and her friends in his mine to steal the Eto gun, and the ensuing fight uncovers the location of the tribe‚Äôs sacred treasure, which turns out to be the Zodiac gun. Gordy also blows Baskerville‚Äôs cover as a priest, devastating Mingchao. He tries to kill everyone to get his hands on the tribe‚Äôs sacred \\"treasure\\", but is subdued by Fino‚Äôs Pisces bullet. Mingchao then stops Fino from killing him with a tomahawk. When Gordy regains consciousness, he encounters Blush and tells him about the Eto gun. In return, Blush murders him to eliminate the competition. Blush :: is a member of the Syndicate. He is sneaky, manipulative, and cruel. He killed Fino's parents as well as Gordy, Alternate's father, and tricked Alternate into thinking that Mingchao had done it. He used both Alternate and Baskerville to try to get his way, but ultimately did not succeed as he was later duped by Cavanaugh. He despises Cavanaugh despite her being his superior in the Syndicate. He claims she took credit for one of his reports and stole his bonus. After she tricks him he tries to bring her down, even when it meant helping out Mingchao briefly. He is noted for his ability to fire up to twelve bullets at once with his two guns. ::Blush disappears after Cavanaugh's attack on the ship heading for New York City. At the end of the story, an omake by one of Nakazaki's assistants jokes that Blush was killed by the giant energy wave created by the Eto gun's dragon bullet. However, Blush's whereabouts are unknown and he is still at large. ::Concept art shows a female version of Blush, as Tow Nakazaki had been unsure whether he wanted Blush to be male or female. He eventually settled on a male character. Cavanaugh P. Script :: is a high-ranking member of the Syndicate and considered to be one of the most feared and cruel of them all. Blush calls her \\"the crazy wench\\". She at first appears to be an authoritative figure with the ability to hold a stern hand over her peers, but she is sadistic, calculating, and controlling. She becomes increasingly sociopathic and violent as the story progresses, and her obsession with killing Mingchao and her companions escalates. She had found Baskerville after he'd lost his memory. After Blush took him and she discovered Baskerville could fire the Eto gun, she sought to bring him to her side. She used a concentrated form of a potent drug to convince Baskerville to do her bidding, though he defected after his memory returned. She loses her right eye in a train accident resulting from a gunfight between herself, Baskerville, and Mingchao's friends. Following the injury she swears revenge against them for scarring her face. She brands XII into her palm so she is able to use the Eto gun, though the brand later gets destroyed when her hand is scarred by a shot from the Zodiac gun. She is killed after falling from a high flight of stairs in a battle with Mingchao and her friends. Futura ::Futura is a member of the Syndicate and a magician. He first appears on the Syndicate-owned ship heading for New York out of Los Angeles. He uses magic to entertain guests, but also for more sinister reasons. He tricks Yaghi into giving him the Zodiac by amusing the boy with magic tricks. In the midst of their escape, Cavanaugh orders Futura to burn the Zodiac‚Äôs brand on his hand so he and Baskerville can create a double cow bullet against the ship. He does it, but is later knocked out of the hot air balloon they are in and falls to his death in the ocean. Futura is one of three people who was able to use the Zodiac, along with Fino and Gothic. Bearded Ina ::Bearded Ina was a friend of Mingchao‚Äôs grandfather, but he is also a member of the Syndicate. Both he and Mingchao‚Äôs grandfather emigrated from China because they were disturbed by how badly the opium trade had ravaged their fellow countrymen. They took with them a large stash of opium with the original intent on destroying it, but then decided to try researching ways to make it into a safe medicine. When they failed, they hid the drugs in a cavern beneath New York City. Since the both of them were blacksmiths, they decided to create a pair of magic guns that when brought together would create a mystical map leading to the location of the drugs. Bearded Ina is responsible for the creation of the two guns, and had the brand of the Eto gun on his right palm. However, after Gothic‚Äôs wife died and he started gaining power, Bearded Ina helped his friend and the infant Mingchao escape the clutches of the Syndicate. Afterwards, he burned off his right hand to keep his ability to use the gun from falling into the wrong hands, and it was replaced with a prosthetic hand. But he continued to work with the Syndicate, using his medicine shop‚Äôs basement as the place where the drugs are transported to Bedloe‚Äôs Island by a tunnel. This is the only reason the Syndicate spared his life. ::When he finally meets Mingchao again, he pretends not to know her, but he‚Äôs only pretending so he can protect her. Mingchao wholeheartedly believes Bearded Ina is on her side, but he locks her in his basement, saying he‚Äôll turn her in to Cavanaugh. It turns out he was trying to show her the way to the Syndicate‚Äôs base, through his basement. Later Bearded Ina shows up again to help Benkate and Yaghi outside the Black Goddess statue that is the Syndicate‚Äôs base. ::During the final battle against Gothic, Bearded Ina gives Baskerville a pill that is a concentrated form of opium, saying it will numb Baskerville‚Äôs wounds so he can help Mingchao against her father. He then gives Baskerville the secret to defeating Gothic. Afterwards, he dies, because Gothic shot him when he shielded Mingchao from the bullets. Gothic ::Gothic is the boss of the Syndicate as well as Mingchao's father. He wants to rule all of the United States in revenge for the death of his wife, Mingchao's mother, who died because she couldn't get proper medical treatment as a Chinese immigrant in America. He bleached his hair, damaged his vocal cords to change his voice, and wore a mask to disguise that he was actually Chinese. Mingchao declared that neither he nor she should exist, and he is the first and probably only life she takes, if only to put a stop to the misery he's caused others. He is ultimately killed by the Eto gun's dragon bullet. ==Other Characters== Grandpa ::Mingchao often describes her grandfather as an unfriendly old man and she doesn‚Äôt seem to remember him very fondly. However, the fact that he escaped New York City with her shows that he probably cared for her a great deal. He was a skilled blacksmith and along with Bearded Ina created the Eto and Zodiac guns. He finished the guns on his way out West, dropping the Zodiac gun off at Fino‚Äôs village and then taking the Eto gun with him to the mountain where he settled with Mingchao. He left the Eto gun with Mingchao after he died, but sometimes appears to her as a ghost in her dreams to give her tips about how the gun works. ::Mingchao‚Äôs grandfather is also Gothic‚Äôs father. Gothic accused him and Bearded Ina of hoarding an enormous stash of drugs to use for profit at a later time, when really the two were hoping to use the stash to experiment creating safe medicines. When the plan failed, they kept the drugs hidden and created the Eto and Zodiac guns to act as a mystical map to the drugs when the two guns are brought together. ::In the end, Mingchao‚Äôs grandfather tells her about Gothic‚Äôs true motives for wanting to take control of America. Suhbo ::Suhbo is a boy around Mingchao‚Äôs age. She and Baskeville help him save his family‚Äôs ranch from Phineas Franklin and his henchmen. He and Mingchao don‚Äôt get along well because she tries to eat one of his dairy cows. His mother‚Äôs name is Sasha, whom Baskerville seems to have affection for. Phineas Franklin ::Phineas Franklin is a cruel businessman. He harasses Suhbo and his mother to make them give up their ranch, and plans to have a monopoly over the cattle business in the state. He kidnaps Suhbo and holds him hostage to force Sasha gives him the deed to her ranch. Mingchao defeats him and his cronies using an ox bullet. He again returns to the story to take over Big‚Äôs fishing business, but Fino puts him out with a Pisces bullet. Bodney ::Bodney is a popular saloon dancer. Her boyfriend was Kaufman, but she broke up with him over his drinking habit. She is an excellent gambler and manages to win the Eto gun in a poker game. Baskerville challenges her to get the gun back, but their game is interrupted by Kaufman. When Kaufman kidnaps Mingchao for money, Bodney goes to help her, which ends in Mingchao using Bodney‚Äôs tiger fur underwear to power a tiger bullet and stop Kaufman from killing the dancer. After the fight, Bodney stays to help Kaufman heal from his wounds. Kaufman ::Kaufman is Bodney‚Äôs ex-boyfriend, but he‚Äôs still in love with Bodney to the point of obsession. He developed a drinking habit because he was cheated out of his life‚Äôs savings in a poker game. He used to be a good and decent man, but after losing his money he became combative and mean towards others, and Bodney couldn‚Äôt stand it so she broke off their relationship. Kaufman gets extremely jealous when other men give Bodney attention, so when he sees Baskerville playing a poker game with her he explodes and kidnaps Mingchao, saying he wants money in return for the girl. When Bodney arrives to help Mingchao, Kaufman tries to convince her to get back together with him, but she refuses. This enrages him and he plans on killing her and then himself, but he‚Äôs stopped by Mingchao‚Äôs tiger bullet. He‚Äôs hit in the throat, and Bodney chooses to take care of him in the end, since Kaufman can‚Äôt drink alcohol with his throat injury. Luriele ::Luriele is a young performer who befriends Mingchao on a train heading for Hollywood. She couldn‚Äôt use her legs due to an accident that left her too afraid to walk on her own again. It left her so depressed that she believed she would never dance again, and even wanted to give Mingchao her dresses. With Mingchao‚Äôs encouragement she eventually learns how to walk again. After an incident on a runaway train (thanks to Alternate), Luriele invites Mingchao and her friends to join the troupe in a performance at a nearby town. It is during the performance that Mingchao discovers she herself is tone-deaf. Typus ::Typus is a priest whom Mingchao at first mistakes as Baskerville because of his black clothes, even though Typus is much shorter. He invites the gang to stay at his home. When he tries to steal the Eto gun, the friends find out he‚Äôs really working for Blush, but only because Blush is holding his daughter Coronet hostage. In the past, Typus was a soldier alongside Blush, killing Indians and destroying their villages. He was so ashamed, he left the military to marry and become a priest. Fino is enraged by Typus‚Äô past and at first refuses to help him save Coronet until she realizes she‚Äôll be just as bad as Blush if Coronet dies. In the end, Typus mentions helping a man with Baskerville‚Äôs description, saying he might be in Las Vegas. Chisel ::Chisel was Baskerville‚Äôs younger sister. She was gravely ill, so Baskerville joined the Syndicate to help get her the medicine she needed. The \\"medicine\\" was just a nasty narcotic that made her symptoms worse, but Baskerville didn‚Äôt realize it until he overheard Cavanaugh and Gothic talking about how she would die. Unlike her brother, Chisel believed in God and spent time in prayer. She gave Baskerville the cross he wears, the one he had engraved with the wedding dress relief. Chisel didn‚Äôt know about how he was getting the medicine, thinking he was just working hard somewhere. She loved Baskerville very much, and after her death Baskerville vowed revenge against the Syndicate. He buried Chisel near their home. Big ::Big is a fisherman who makes a living selling fish. One day he accidentally catches Mingchao in his net after she fell off a hot air balloon and into the ocean. When she is reunited with her friends, they thank Big by helping him with his business. Phineas Franklin returns and with his sights set on the fishing industry. Fino defeats Franklin using a Pisces bullet powered by a flying fish, saving Big‚Äôs business. Big is an amiable person, and Alternate takes a liking to him because Big is a large man who reminds him of Gordy. The Narls Brothers ::The Narls Brothers are twin brothers who run a stagecoach business. Their first names were never disclosed. One brother is more talkative than the other, and he likes to remind everyone how fast and cheap their stagecoach rides are. The brothers pick up Mingchao and her friends to help them catch up to the train that's carrying Cavanaugh and Baskerville. Fino uses their hair to power a Gemini bullet. Gocal ::Gocal runs a restaurant not far from New York City and invites Mingchao and her friends to stay with him. The bank has been trying to get Gocal to give up the property, claiming the land had been loaned to him, when really no one had owned the land previously. Arnold, the banker, creates a ruckus in the restaurant and tries to threaten Gocal to give up the land, but Mingchao defeats him with a snake bullet. Yoshille ::Yoshille is a young man living near New York City with his father Gocal and his younger sister Cornelia. He is working for the Syndicate as a drug runner, but doesn‚Äôt realize the \\"cargo\\" he carries is actually drugs. Since his sister is sick, he is trying to earn \\"medicine\\" to make her well, similar to what Baskerville did for Chisel. After he tries to steal the Eto gun for Cavanaugh, he finds out the truth about the drugs and burns the cargo he was transporting. He then gives Mingchao and her friends the information they need to get inside the Syndicate‚Äôs base.

The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) ‚Äì 1. Shyampukur, 2.

A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government. With the implementation of the Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation was enlarged. Certain areas were already there but more parts of them were added (current spellings) - Entally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watganj and Ekbalpur, and Garden Reach and Tollygunj. The Calcutta Municipal Act of 1923 brought about important changes. It liberalised the constitution along democratic lines.Bagchi, Amiya Kumar, Wealth and Work in Calcutta, 1860-1921, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p. 213-215, Oxford University Press, . The state government superseded the Corporation in 1948 and the Calcutta Municipal Act of 1951 came into force. Adult franchise was introduced in municipal elections in 1962. With the addition of certain areas in the southern parts of the city, the number of wards increased from 75 to 144. ==Geography== Ward No. 27 is bordered on the north by Abhedananda Road (earlier a part of Beadon Street); on the east by Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road; on the south by Kailash Bose Street and Mahendra Srimani Street (earlier Sukeas Street); and on the west by Bidhan Sarani.Kolkata: Detail Maps of 141 Wards with Street Directory.

This wood decay fungus is found commonly in Eastern North America, and is associated with declining or dead hardwoods. There is taxonomic uncertainty with this fungus since its circumscription in 1902.Murrill, W. A. 1902. The Polyporaceae of North America, genus I Ganoderma. Bull. Torrey Bot. Club 29:599-608. ==Taxonomy and history == G. sessile basidiocarp G. sessile chlamydospores stained in lactophenol cotton blue Murrill described 17 new Ganoderma species in his treatises of North American polypores, including for example, G. oregonense, G. sessile, G. tsugae, G. tuberculosum and G. zonatum. Most notably and controversial was the typification of Ganoderma sessile, which was described from various hardwoods only in the United States.Murrill, W. A. 1908. Agaricales (Polyporaceae). North Amer. Flora 9:73-131. The specific epithet \\"sessile\\" comes from the sessile, or without typical stem, nature of this species when found growing in a natural setting. Ganoderma sessile was distinguished based on a sessile fruiting habit, common on hardwood substrates and occasionally having a reduced, eccentric or ‚Äúwanting‚Äù stipe. In 1908, Atkinson considered G. tsugae and G. sessile as synonyms of G. lucidum, but erected the species G. subperforatum from a single collection in Ohio on the basis of having ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù spores.Atkinson, G. F. 1908. Observations on Polyporus lucidus Leys and some of its Allies from Europe and North America. Botanical Gazette 46:321-338. Although he did not recognize the genus Ganoderma, but rather kept taxa in the genus Polyporus, Overholts agreed with Atkinson, and considered G. sessile as a synonym of the European G. lucidum .Overholts, L. O. 1915. Comparative Studies in the Polyporaceae. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 2:667-730. In a 1920 report on Polyporaceae of North America, Murrill conceded that G. sessile was closely related to the European G. lucidum . It is difficult to determine if this concession was the result of political scrutiny or from a scientific foundation, due to the retention of the name by Murrill in a later publication and a single herbarium collection in 1926 (www.mycoportal.org). Approximately a decade later, Haddow considered G. sessile a unique taxon, but suggested Atkinson‚Äôs G. subperforatum was a synonym of G. sessile, on the basis of the ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù spores, which was the original basis of G. subperforatum when earlier erected by Atkinson in 1931. Until this point, all identifications of Ganoderma taxa were based on fruiting body morphology, geography, host, and spore characters. In 1948 and then amended in 1965, Nobles characterized the cultural characteristics of numerous wood-inhabiting hymenomycetes including Ganoderma taxa.Nobles, M. K. 1948. Studies in Forest Pathology. IV. Identification of Cultures of Wood-Rotting Fungi. Can. J. Res. 26:281-431.Nobles, M. K. 1965. Identification of cultures of wood-inhabiting Hymenomycetes. Canadian journal of Botany 43:1097-1139. Her work laid the foundation for culture-based identifications in this group of fungi. Nobles recognized that there were differences in cultural characteristics between G. oregonense, G. sessile, and G. tsugae . Although Nobles recognized G. lucidum in her 1948 publication as a correct name for the taxon from North American isolates that produce numerous broadly ovoid to elongate chlamydospores (12.0-21.0 x 7.5-10.5 Œºm), she corrected this misnomer in 1968 by amending the name to G. sessile . Clarifying further, Bazallo & Wright and Steyaert agree with Haddow‚Äôs distinction between G. lucidum and G. sessile on the basis of ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù spores, but they synonymize G. sessile with G. resinaceum, a previously described European taxon.Bazzalo, M. E., and Wright, J. E. 1982. Survey of the Argentine Species of the Ganoderma lucidum Complex. Mycotaxon 16:293-325.Steyaert, R. L. 1980. Study of Some Ganoderma Species. Bull. du Jardin Bot. Nat. de Belgique/ Bull. van de Nat. Plantentuin van Blegie 50:135-186. Later Adaskaveg and Gilbertson demonstrated the similarity in culture morphology and that vegetative compatibility was successful between the North American taxon recognized as ‚ÄòG. lucidum‚Äô and the European G. resinaceum Adaskaveg, J. E., and Gilbertson, R. L. 1986. Cultural studies and genetics of sexuality of Ganoderma lucidum and G. tsugae in relation to the taxonomy of the G. lucidum complex. Mycologia:694-705.. In the monograph of North American Polypores written in 1986, which is still the only comprehensive treatise on this group of fungi unique for North America, the authors Gilbertson and Ryvarden do not recognize G. sessile, but rather recognize the five following laccate species being present in the U.S.: G. colossum (Fr.) C.F. Baker (current name: Tomophagus colossus (Fr.) Murrill), G. curtisii, G. lucidum, G. oregonense, and G. tsugae Gilbertson, R., and Ryvarden, L. 1986. North American Polypores, vol. 1. Abortiporus to Lindteria, Fungiflora, Oslo. 443 pp., 1987. North American Polypores 2.. They considered G. sessile along with other laccate species synonyms with G. lucidum, and in the comments under G. lucidum they discuss the taxonomic chaos of this particular species complex, and leave it somewhat unresolved. == Molecular taxonomy == \\"Smooth\\" basidiospores of G. sessile at 100x magnification In a multilocus phylogeny, the authors revealed that the global diversity of the laccate Ganoderma species included three highly supported major lineages that separated G. oregonense/G. tsugae from G. zonatum and from G. curtisii/G. sessile, and these lineages were not correlated to geographical separation. These results agree with several of the earlier works focusing mostly on morphology, geography and host preference showing genetic affinity of G. resinaceum and G. sessile, but with statistical support separating the European and North American taxa. Also, Ganoderma curtisii and G. sessile were separated with high levels of statistical support, although there was not enough information to say they were from distinct lineages. Lastly, G. sessile was not sister to G. lucidum. The phylogeny supported G. tsugae and G. oregonense as sister taxa to the European taxon G. lucdium sensu stricto. G. sessile fruiting body at base of Quercus shumardii == Description == Fruiting bodies annual and sessile (without a stipe) or pseudostipitate (very small stipe). Fruiting bodies found growing on trunks or root flares of living or dead hardwood trees. Very common taxon, being found in practically every state East of the Rocky Mountains within the United States. Mature fruiting bodies are laccate and reddish-brown, often with a wrinkled margin if dry. Fruiting bodies are shelf-like if on stumps or overlapping clusters of fan-shaped (flabelliform) fruiting bodies if growing from underground roots, and range in size of 3-20 cm in diameter. Hymenium white, bruising brown, and poroid with irregular pores that can range in shape from circular to angular. The context tissue is cream colored and can be thin to thick and on average the same length as the tubes. Black resinous deposits are never found embedded in the context tissue, but concentric zones are often found. Spores appear ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù, or nearly so, due to the fine (thin) echinulations from the endosporium, which can differentiate them from other common Eastern North American species such as Ganoderma curtisii (Berk.) Murrill. Elliptical to obovate to obpyriform chlamydospores formed in vegetative mycelium, and are abundant in cultures. ==Uses== For centuries, laccate (varnished or polished) Ganoderma species have been used as traditional medicine in many parts of Asia. These species are often mislabeled as G. lucidum', although genetic testing has shown this to be multiple species such as G. lingzhi, G. multipileum, and G. sichuanense Hennicke, F., Z. Cheikh-Ali, T. Liebisch, J.G. Maci√°-Vicente, H.B. Bode, and M. Piepenbring. 2016.

Research has been conducted on Asian species, but limited information is available for the medicinal properties of the North American laccate Ganoderma species; although it is often used to make tea, similar to the cultivated Asian species. Ganoderma sessile is the most prevalent species in Eastern North America and is likely the species that many used medicinally in the United States. == References Ganoderma sessile images at Mushroom Observer * Category:Fungi described in 1902 Category:Fungi of North America Category:Fungal plant pathogens and diseases Category:Ganodermataceae ","title":"Ganoderma sessile"},{"id":"46328146","text":"FabricLive.76 is a DJ mix album by English drum and bass musician Calyx and Norwegian DJ musician TeeBee.

However, through these dance sequences, it holds a mirror up to Egyptian society in the 1970s. The movie focuses on the tensions within Egyptian society between tradition and modernism, as well as social pressure towards liberalism. == Plot == ZouZou is a college student that comes from a family of entertainers. Her mother was a retired belly dancer and runs a troupe of performers that entertain at weddings. Her home was on Cairo's famous Muhammad Ali St., known for housing entertainers and musicians. Zouzou performs every night with her family at weddings and private parties as a dancer and singer. This is kept as a secret from all her friends because she worries about how she will be perceived by her peers. Being a professional belly dancer in Egypt during this period was understood to be a low profession, one loosely associated with prostitution, or a lack of morality. Zouzou falls in love with one of her professors who breaks his engagement in order to be with her. The cousin of the professor tries to break off what he has with Zouzou and eventually finds out that she is an entertainer. The cousin frames Zouzou in public, arranging an event that forces her to expose her work as a dancer. Her professor was shocked and ashamed at first, but in the end, all is resolved as Zouzou decides to return to her studies and embrace a bright future free of the need to work as a Muhammad Ali St. dancer. == Cast == *Taheyya Kariokka as Naima Almazia *Hussein Fahmy as professor Said Kamel *Soad Hosni as Zozo Almazia *Azza Sherif *Samir Ghanem *Shahinaz Taha *Mohie Ismail *Abbas Fares *Zouzou Shakib *Ali Gohar *Mostafa Metwali == Music == Khalli Balak Min ZouZou has many songs that are still sung by Egyptians till now. The songs were the most influential and memorable on Egyptians and many more. Two main music composers were Kamal El-Taweel and Salah Gaheen. Kamal El-Taweel was friends with Abdel Halim Hafez, also another great music composer and singer. Kamal El-Taweel created the most memorable song Ya Wad Ya Te‚Äôeel (O Teaser Boy) which was sung by Soad Hosny. == References == *Azza Sharif (ÿπÿ≤ÿ© ÿ¥ÿ±ŸäŸÅ) and Souad Hosni (1972) *http://www.elcinema.com/person/pr1083752/ *http://www.elcinema.com/person/pr1028411/ Walter Armbrust.

The choir would ascend to increased national recognition when in 1980, Hayes and Cosmo would release Everything's Alright with Savoy Records. He and the choir recorded over 30 albums and releases 5 single 45's in over 50 years. Out of them, he made the Billboard magazine Gospel Albums chart, for five of those releases. Those releases are the following; Turn It over to Jesus in 1989 with Intersound Records at No. 12, No. 6 for I'll Never Forget with Savory Gospel in 1992, 2002's Rise & Sing Forever at No. 22 with Meek Records, The Remix with Icee Records in 2005 peaking at No. 3, and 2012's Back Again at No. 21 with Cosmo Sounds Records. The album, The Remix, placed on three more Billboard charts at No. 55 on the R&B; Albums, No. 25 on the Independent Albums, and No. 15 on the Heatseekers Albums. ==Personal life== Dr. Hayes was never married, but had two sons, Marcus Hayes and Charles G Hayes III , and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren at the time of his death in a nursing home in Oak Park, Illinois on February 12, 2014. ==Discography== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" + List of selected studio albums, with selected chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\"  Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\"  Peak chart positions - !style=\\"width:3em; font-size:90%\\"US Gos - !scope=\\"row\\"Turn It over to Jesus  * Released: 1989 * * CD, digital download  12 - !scope=\\"row\\"I'll Never Forget  * Released: 1992 * * CD, digital download  6 - !scope=\\"row\\"Rise & Sing Forever  * Released: 2002 * * CD, digital download  22 - !scope=\\"row\\"The Remix  * Released: 2005 * * CD, digital download  3 - !scope=\\"row\\"Back Again  * Released: 2012 * * CD, digital download  21 } ==References * Cross Rhythms Profile Category:1937 births Category:2014 deaths Category:African-American musicians Category:African-American Christians Category:Musicians from Alabama Category:Musicians from Illinois Category:Songwriters from Alabama Category:Songwriters from Illinois ","title":"Charles G.

The album was produced by husband and highly respected musician Rod McCormack and showcased a new vocal maturity of Jeffreys. The first single, \\"Live It\\", was released in November 2006 and the album was released at the 2007 Tamworth Country Music Festival. Jeffreys co-wrote five of the songs on the album and said of this; \\"I try to write songs about real stuff in my life and if I‚Äôm lucky, people will connect with it. Musically, I love the traditional sounds of acoustic instruments like the banjo, mandolin, fiddle and guitar with lots of beautiful harmonies.\\" The title of the album gives name to a now annual \\"Walk of Life\\" at the Tamworth Country Music Festival. It commenced in 2007 with Jeffreys and other country music artists and fans walking around the streets of Tamworth creating an awareness and raise money for the Foundation. Money raised goes towards the Leukaemia Foundation. Jeffreys toured nationally with the album. ==Review== Susan Jarvis of Country Music Capital News said; \\"It‚Äôs been a long wait for Gina‚Äôs new album, Walks Of Life, but well worth every minute. From the first song, Gina sets the tone for an inspiring, perceptive album that is both appealing and contains some important messages. Walks Of Life is about all the stages of life. Perhaps the highest accolade I can give an album is that it moved me so much it made me cry. This one did.

The tournament was due to be held in India, but was switched to Sri Lanka when an exemption from tax in India was not granted. Fifteen matches were to be played in the tournament including two semi-finals and a final match.[1] All the matches were played in Colombo at two grounds: R. Premadasa Stadium and Sinhalese Sports Club Ground. It was the first time that the teams of all International Cricket Council (ICC) member nations visited Sri Lanka to participate in a cricket tournament.[1] Twelve teams competed: the 10 Test-playing nations plus Kenya who has full One Day International (ODI) status and the 2001 ICC Trophy winners the Netherlands. The teams were split into four pools of three teams each. Each team played the other two teams in its pool once, and the four teams that lead in each pool proceeded to the Semi Finals.[2][3] Australia lost to Sri Lanka in the first semi-final whereas India defeated South Africa in the second semi final. The Final between India and Sri Lanka was washed out twice, to leave no result.[4] Virender Sehwag was the highest run-scorer of the tournament and Muttiah Muralitharan was the highest wicket-taker.

HIT is ‚Äúthe application of information processing involving both computer hardware and software that deals with the storage, retrieval, sharing, and use of health care information, data, and knowledge for communication and decision making‚Äù Home health software is designed specifically for companies employing home health providers, as well as government entities who track payments to home health care providers. ==History== The first use of home health care software was in the 1990s, with companies making software based on the Omaha system of software. The first software was made available for public health departments, nurse-managed centers, and community clinics. The use of home health care software increased with the technologies of cloud computing, telehealth and business analytical tools. Implementing these technologies with home health software is attributed to the enhancement of quality care at home, and reduction of fraud. During the early stages of 2000s, the home health care software industry expanded from simple databases to agencies being able to transmit electronic health records. There was also an increase in the available types of software as a result of software vendors working directly with health care providers. GrandPad is designed to reduce loneliness in older people. ==Types of software== There are clinical and non-clinical applications of home health care software. Including types such as agency software, hospice solutions, clinical management systems, telehealth solutions, and electronic visit verification. Depending on the type of software used, companies can track health care employee visits to patients, verify payroll, and document patient care. Governments can also use home health care software to verify visits from providers who bill them for services. Use of some software is mandated by government agencies such as OASIS assessment information that must be transmitted electronically by home health care providers. Agency software Agency software is used by home health care providers for office use and is a subset of medical practice management software used by inpatient clinics and doctors offices. Agency software is used for billing, paying vendors, staff scheduling, and maintaining records associated with the business. Agency software can be standalone or part of software packages, that include electronic visit verification to track hours of employees and time spent on home visits and patient care. Agency software can be purchased or leased through various vendors. Agency software can range from Medical Home Health EMRs, Hospice EMRs, or non-medical Home Care Software. There are additional sub-categories of home health and related software solutions. Electronic visit verification Electronic visit verification (often referred to as EVV) is a method used to verify home healthcare visits to ensure patients are not neglected and to cut down on fraudulently documented home visits. EVV monitors locations of caregivers, and is mandated by certain states, including Texas and Illinois. Other states do not mandate it, but use it as part of its Medicaid fraud oversight, created by the passing of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. It is also widely used by employers of home healthcare providers to verify employee's locations and hours of work as well as document patient care. Outcome and assessment information set (OASIS) Home health care providers that participate in Medicaid are required to report specific data about patient care known as Outcome and Assessment Information Set-C (OASIS-C). Data includes health status, functional status, and support system information. The data is used to establish a measurement of patient home health care options. Home health care software allows health care providers to obtain and transmit such data while on location with a patient. Data collection is mandated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Software for collecting and transmitting data is free through CMM and can also be purchased through private vendors as an add-on to other home health care software. == Software Delivery Platforms ==  On-Site Server Based Model  The software is hosted on servers located and maintained on-site at the agency. The localization of the data provides the agency direct access to the computers hosting their software and may also require the agency to maintain the technology that hosts the software.  Cloud Based Software Model  The software is deployed on a cloud system maintained by the software vendor. The off-site maintenance of the cloud system results in a lower cost to the home health agency and provides access to the agency's data from off-site locations. ==See also== * Health informatics * List of open-source health software * Medical record ==References== * Category:Healthcare in the United States Category:Nursing informatics ","title":"Home health care software"},{"id":"46328511","text":"Queen Nonyerem Okafor is a Nigerian-born, 29-year-old lady who is said to be Nigeria's hairiest woman.

He settled in the Sandergrove district, and was responsible for a large number of constructions in the area, including John Dunn's flour mill at Mount Barker. His brother Joseph also emigrated, joining him in 1847. He acquired some property and began breeding sheep. When William Bowman left the Finniss district around 1878, Rogers purchased his property \\"View Bank\\" and later had a share in Portee station on the River Murray near Blanchetown and another at Swan Reach. He made his elder son manager (later owner) of Finniss, and gave Portee and Swan Reach stations to younger son Edwin. They sustained heavy losses in the 1890s drought, but survived and had largely recovered financially at the time of his death. He was a member of the first fully elected House of Assembly, representing Mount Barker from September 1858 to March 1860 and June 1864 to March 1865 as a colleague of John Dunn. He held the same seat from May 1868 to August 1868 and November 1868 to April 1870 with John Cheriton then Encounter Bay from February 1872 to February 1875, when his colleagues were in turn Thomas Reynolds and Arthur Fydell Lindsay. ==Family== Rogers married Ann Wright (ca.1818 ‚Äì 17 February 1912) on 7 March 1846.

Bilardi kept a blog describing his disdain for United States forces committing crimes against Muslims in the Middle East. He became radical after his mother died of cancer. By 2014, he expressed sympathy for Osama bin Laden on Facebook. Concerned that the Australian government was monitoring him, Bilardi turned to building explosives in the event he would not be able to leave the country. A recruiter for Jabhat al-Nusra made contact with him in August 2014 and he left for Iraq. Bilardi died in a suicide attack in Ramadi, Iraq on 11 March 2015. The Iraqi Army stated Bilardi's attack was unsuccessful, killing only himself. ISIL used his death as propaganda, in order to recruit more people to become suicide bombers. According to a friend, Bilardi was concerned his family would \\"spend eternity in hell\\" for being non-believers. Reaction Prime Minister Tony Abbott, commented on Bilardi's death as an \\"absolutely horrific situation\\", stating, \\"it's very, very important that we do everything we can to try to safeguard our young people against the lure of this shocking, alien and extreme ideology.\\" Greg Barton, director of the Centre for Islam and the Modern World considers Bilardi a self-radical motivated by underlying mental health issues instead of religious zealotry. ==See also== * 2015 Parramatta shooting * Jihobbyist * Terrorism in Australia ==References== Category:1996 births Category:2015 deaths Category:21st-century Australian criminals Category:Australian Islamists Category:Australian Sunni Muslims Category:Converts to Sunni Islam Category:Criminals from Melbourne Category:Criminals who committed suicide Category:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant members Category:Male suicide bombers Category:People from Melbourne ","title":"Jake Bilardi"},{"id":"46328670","text":"The 2015 Maldivian FA Charity Shield, (commonly known as the 2015 Milo Charity Shield due to sponsorship reasons) was the 7th Maldivian FA Charity Shield, an annual Maldivian football match played between the winners of the previous season's Dhivehi League and FA Cup.

His father was a diplomat, which is why, from 1923 until 1932, Castro lived in Switzerland with his parents and his two sisters. During these years he visited cities like Lausanne, Geneva and Turin. In 1933 he entered a Jesuit school in Montevideo and he started studying music. He discovered poetry by learning to speak and write in Spanish. He was specially touched by the works of C√©sar Vallejo. Through the years Castro would become close friends with writers like Octavio Paz, Julio Cort√°zar, Samuel Beckett, Kostas Papaioannou and Georges Schehad√©. Later, during a trip to Uruguay, he met Joaqu√≠n Torres Garc√≠a, with whom he studied painting and monumental art from 1941 until 1949. In 1942 he moved to Argentina, where he would live until 1949. Castro was also friends with other artists like Nikos Hadjikyriakos- Ghikas, Maria Helena Vieira da Silva and √Årp√°d Szenes. In 1945 he found a job as a secretary in the Astronomy Observatorium of the city of C√≥rdoba, where we also worked as the assistant to the musician Manuel de Falla in Alta Gracia, until his death in 1946. In 1945 and 1946 he had a grant from the French government to study musical composition. During the year of 1946 he had an exhibition in New York City among other members of Torres Garc√≠a's workshop. That same year he traveled to the northeast of Argentina and the south of Per√∫ to study pre-columbian art with Gonzalo Fonseca, Julio Uruguay Alpuy and Jonio Montiel. In 1949 he started teaching History of Music in the new music school of the city of La Plata. His work as a musician drew attention from relevant figures such as Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, Aaron Copland and Juan Jos√© Castro. He quit this job when he got a grant from the French government to improve his musical studies in Paris, where he settled in November 1949. Since 1951 he devoted himself exclusively to painting. In 1955, his friend the German writer and translator Edith Aron introduced him to Julio Cort√°zar, who would become a close friend of him. Castro inspired the character of Etienne in Cort√°zar's novel Rayuela (Hopscotch). In the book is featured the intimate friendship of the protagonist, Horacio Oliveira, with his companion in the Serpent Club, whom he often visited in his studio in Paris. In 1960 he won the Hallmark Prize in New York. In 1979 he obtained the French nationality. In 1980 he showed his works at the Argentinian pavilion in the 39th Venice Biennale. He was associate professor in the Human Sciences Faculty of the University of Strasbourg from 1981 until 1986. In 1997 he became Officer in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. In 2006, Sergio de Castro made a 220-work donation to the Fine Arts Museum of Saint-L√¥. He was also a close friend of the musician Alberto Ginastera, who made reference to Sergio de Castro and his first works in his notes on modern Argentinian music. Castro died 31 December 2012 in Paris. He is buried in the Montparnasse cemetery, in Paris, close to his dear friend Samuel Beckett. == Monumental works == * Two wall paintings for the Martiren√© Pavilion of the Hospital Saint-Bois (1942), in Montevideo (Uruguay), in collaboration with Joaqu√≠n Torres Garc√≠a and his disciples, among which Castro was the youngest. * The Creation of the Universe (1956‚Äì1958), 6m x 20m stained-glass window.

It was published by Enrique Marcatili in 1969. Optical dielectric waveguides guide electromagnetic waves in the optical spectrum (light). This type of waveguide consists of dielectric materials (e.g., glass, silicon, indium phosphide, etc). The core of the waveguide has a higher index of refraction than its surrounding and the light is guided due to total internal reflection. In a ray description, the light zig-zags between the walls. The geometry of the waveguide dictates the light to propagate with specific velocities and specific distributions of the electric and magnetic fields, known as modes. For rectangular waveguides, these modes cannot be computed analytically. This can be done either using a numerical mode solver, or using an approximate method such as Marcatili‚Äôs method. ==Propagation velocity of the light in the waveguide== Sketch of the cross-section of a rectangular waveguide (450 nm x 220 nm). The waveguide consists of a silicon core (dark gray) on top of a silicon-dioxide layer (light-gray). Marcatili's method is sketched. The four outer quadrants are neglected. The standing waves in the core of the waveguide are sketched (blue and purple curves) and the exponentially decaying waves outside the waveguide are also sketched (blue and purple curves). The refractive index n of each of the regions is indicated. The method can also be understood from the behavior of two planar (slab) waveguides. In his approximate method, the light zig-zags simultaneously upwards-and-downwards as well as left-and-rightwards. In a wave description, the mode is formed by a standing wave in both horizontal x-direction and vertical y-direction with wave vector (k_x, k_y, \\\\beta). The up-and-downwards zig-zag path of the light (k_y) is given by a horizontal planar waveguide that is formed by the rectangular waveguide but with infinite width. The left-and-right zig-zag path (k_x) is given by a vertical planar waveguide that is formed by the rectangular waveguide but with infinite height. Knowing the zig-zag paths (k_x, k_y) allows to compute the propagation velocity of the light in the waveguide (or equivalently, the effective refractive index). The propagation constant of the waveguide mode is then computed using: \\\\beta^2 = k^2 - k_x^2 - k_y^2, where k^2 is the wavenumber corresponding to the core material of the waveguide, k_x and k_y are the wave-numbers corresponding to the standing waves in the x- and y-direction, and beta is the wavenumber in the propagation direction of the waveguide, also known as the propagation constant. ==Distribution of the electromagnetic field in the waveguide== Marcatili‚Äôs method used an Ansatz on the shape of the electromagnetic fields in the waveguide. In the core of the waveguide, the mode is a composed of a standing wave in the x- and y-directions. Outside the core, the field decays exponentially in horizontal and vertical directions. The outer quadrants of the rectangular waveguide are neglected. For low-index-contrast waveguides k \\\\approx \\\\beta because modes are not guided otherwise, so k_x \\\\approx k_y \\\\ll 1. Marcatili's method neglects these terms in the second order, and computes the electromagnetic fields in the waveguide based on this assumption and the Ansatz of the shape of the fields. ==Extension to high-index-contrast== Marcatili‚Äôs method was extended to the regime of high-index-contrast, i.e., a large difference between the refractive index of the core of the waveguide and its surrounding. An example of such a waveguide is a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguide. Based on Marcatili‚Äôs propagation constant and the Ansatz on the shape of the electromagnetic field, Westerveld and co-workers derived new relations for the distribution of the electric and magnetic fields. Maxwell‚Äôs equations require that the electromagnetic fields tangential to an interface between the core of the waveguide and its cladding are continuous. Several methods where proposed: The Extended Ey ‚âà 0 method is based on continuity of the dominant electromagnetic field components. The amplitude optimization method in which the energy density associated with the discontinuity of the tangential field across the interfaces is minimized. These methods provided a more accurate description of the electromagnetic fields in subwavelength silicon waveguides. ==Implementations== RECTWG is an open-source implementation in Matlab of Marcatili's method as well as the extension to high-index-contrast. It allows computation of the effective index (propagation constant), the effective group index (dispersion), and the linear influence of external changes (e.g. temperature, cladding refractive index) and the electromagnetic fields of the modes in the waveguide. The method works for both TE-like and TM-like modes. ==References== Category:Optics ","title":"Marcatili's method"},{"id":"46328810","text":"Karanjkot is a village in Golamunda block of Kalahandi district, Odisha state, India.

Banks started the Messengers in 1972 after he left The Jackson Southernaires. While with the Jackson Southernaires, Banks made his first big hit in 1964 on Peacock Records with the song \\"Too Late\\". His first song with The Messengers in 1972 was \\"Heaven Must Be A Beautiful Place\\", also on Peacock Records. A String of \\"Chittlin Circuit\\" hits was released on HSE Records. His first major hit was \\"Things I Can't Change\\" in 1974. Another hit came in 1975 with \\"God‚Äôs Goodness\\". His super hit was \\"For The Wrong I've Done\\" for which he was nominated for a Grammy in 1980. Perhaps Banks‚Äô most memorable song, \\"God Is Still In Charge\\" came in 1982 off of an album of the same name. Banks stayed with HSE Records until they changed their name to Black Label. Three projects were released on this label. Willie Banks moved over to Malaco Records in the mid 80's. He penned \\"Look at the Blessings\\" in 1986 with Malaco. He would release thirteen albums , five of them placing on the Billboard magazine Top Gospel Albums chart: For The Wrong I Done (1978), Mother Why (1980), \\"Masterpiece\\" (1989), The Legend Lives On (1992) and 1993's The Best of Willie Banks, which was released posthumously. ==Early life== Banks was born on May 11, 1929 in Raymond, Mississippi, and his mother started him singing at five years. He help formed The Jackson Southernaires, a group to which he would come an go over a period of years , he did a brief few years with madam Edna G Cooke. In 1972 after leaving The Southernaires he would form his own group The Messengers. The group had a tragic accident on July 6, 1981 with their van careening down a 50-foot embankment near Atlanta, Georgia that killed one band member by the name of Willie \\"Bill\\" Badger of Yemassee, South Carolina, one of the Lead guitarists at the time. Banks was left to cling to life for several days before rescuers found him. Banks gave an account of the accident in a sermonette when he re-recorded his hit \\"God‚Äôs Goodness\\" in 1982. This accident was the impetus for him and the band to sign with Malaco Records. ==Music career== Banks began his singing career with quartets. He sang with one of the earliest versions of The Violinaires of Detroit, Michigan prior to the arrival of Robert Blair. His most notable connection was with The Jackson Southernaires with whom he released the album \\"Too Late\\" on Peacock/Songbird Records in 1969. The album was a best seller for the group and after several singles and one side of the lp, \\"He's My Brother\\" on Songbird, Banks left the group to organize his own group. He commenced his solo recording music career in 1972, with the release \\"Heaven Must Be A Beautiful Place\\" On Peacock Records. He signed with Malaco Records in 1985 with the release of Look at the Blessings.He would release twelve more albums with some being released posthumously, and two of these charted on the Billboard magazine Gospel Albums chart. The 1992 album, The Legend Lives On, placed on that particular chart at No. 19, while the 1993 album, Best of Willie Banks, placed at No. 40. He released albums with several labels including, Peacock Records, HSE Records, Sue-Ann Records, Malaco Records and Black Label Recordings. == Personal life == Banks was married to Deliana Williams, sister of Huey and Frank Williams of The Jackson Southernaires and Melvin, Leonard and Doug Williams of The Williams Brothers. At the time of his death, he was married to Patricia Banks. Banks was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 1990 and given 6 months. He survived until February 1, 1993 when his death was attributed to heart failure.

The evacuation of Pakistani citizens was a civil-military combined effort by Pakistan to extract and evacuate overseas Pakistanis from war-torn areas of Yemen. According to Ministry of Human Resource Development of Pakistan, there were ~3,000 overseas Pakistanis residing in Yemen prior to the Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen. In response to the Yemeni crises, the Pakistan government authorized the Pakistan International Airlines to launch of the special flights for aerial evacuation while the Pakistan Navy evacuated the remaining stranded Pakistanis with two frigates. Besides the evacuation of overseas Pakistanis, citizens of China and the United Kingdom among other countries were also evacuated by Pakistan. Approximately, ~1,800 Pakistan's citizens were extracted from Yemen and safely returned to Pakistan, before the conflict escalated. ==Background== On 26 March 2015, the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States, Adel al-Jubeir, announced the Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council launched a military operation against Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen. This was preceded by weeks of turmoil during which the Houthi guerrillas toppled the government of President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi and took over the large parts of the country. The Foreign Office had earlier instructed the Pakistani community to leave Yemen as the situation on ground could worsen. However, 3000 Pakistani citizens had not heeded the warnings and were trapped in Yemen. The overseas Pakistanis began reaching out the country's news media, notably Geo News, ARY News, and Express News, appealing the government for a safe evacuation on 27 March. The Pakistan Embassy in Yemen worked towards moving the Pakistani community from Aden to Sana'a; around 150 to 200 Pakistani citizens were still reportedly trapped in Aden.

It was partially rebuilt in 1619. The church was restored in 1868‚Äì70 by George Edmund Street with the work started by Malland and Son of Bamford at a cost of ¬£1,337 () for rebuilding the chancel and installing a new window. However, the work was much more involved than first estimated, as the chancel work uncovered the poor condition of the rest of the church and an additional ¬£1,200 () was needed. The contractor was changed to Dennett and Co of Nottingham, and the north aisle was rebuilt with five windows, and an additional aisle was added to the north side of the chancel. The galleries were removed, and the roof was re-leaded. The south aisle and porch were rebuilt between 1882 and 1883 by Walker of Sheffield with the contractor being Hibbert of Baslow. ==Parish status== The church is in a joint parish with: *St Anne‚Äôs Church, Baslow *St Hugh‚Äôs Church, Foolow ==Organ== The church contains a pipe organ by Brindley and Foster dating from 1879.

The museum was founded in 1995 by Ilana Goor, an artist, designer and sculptor. Its eclectic collection has been called an \\"artistic jungle\\", but Goor considers it to have been her own \\"university\\". ==History== Sculpture room The building now housing the Ilana Goor Museum was originally erected in 1742. At that time it was used as an inn for Jewish pilgrims travelling to Jerusalem. The inn, located outside the city walls, served as a shelter, protecting the pilgrims from robbers.Ilana Goor Museum In the second half of the 19th century it became a factory for olive oil soap. Yet another century later, in 1949 and thus by now within the newly created State of Israel, a community of Libyan Jews were using part of the building as a synagogue. Ilana Goor first purchased part of the building in 1983, and then eventually also the rest of it, with the intention of converting it to a museum dedicated to her art collection. The museum was inaugurated in September 1995. ==Collections== The museum has a collection of more than 500 works of art, either created by Ilana Goor or collected by her over a period of 50 years, either in Israel or during her travels around the world. The collection includes paintings, some 300 sculptures, video art, Ethnic Art from Africa and Latin America, antiques, drawings and design objects. The museum has works by contemporary artists like Diego Giacometti, Henry Moore, Josef Albers and Olga Wolniak. ==See also== *Visual arts in Israel *List of Israeli museums ==References * Category:Museums in Tel Aviv Category:Art museums and galleries in Israel Category:1995 establishments in Israel ","title":"Ilana Goor Museum"},{"id":"46329055","text":"Kara were (active from April 2013 until October 2017) a folk music group from Hertfordshire, England, whose music has been called \\"spirited acoustic folk with a Russian twist\\". Their debut album, Waters So Deep, was acclaimed by The Daily Telegraph. ==Personnel== The latest line-up members were Daria Kulesh (lead vocals), Phil Underwood (melodeon, vocals), Pete Morton (guitar, vocals) and Kate Rouse (hammered dulcimer, vocals). Kara's lead vocalist, Daria Kulesh, was born in Russia. She has been described as \\"always deliver[ing] lyrics that expose untainted sincerity with a voice that pours out their spirit\\". ==Albums== Waters So Deep Kara's debut album, Waters So Deep, produced by Jason Emberton and released on 1 July 2014, was one of The Daily Telegraph 's ten folk music highlights for autumn 2014. The Telegraph's reviewer, Martin Chilton, described it as \\"an interesting debut\\" with \\"impressive energy\\", and said that the album incorporates influences from Russia, England, Ireland and France. Rebekah Foard, for Bright Young Folk, said that many of the songs on the album \\"explore belief, spirituality and temptation, often giving the tracks a deeply mythical feel. The main influences are Russian and British folk traditions but tracks such as In Lille ‚Äì where French context is teamed with a beautiful Venezuelan Waltz ‚Äì highlight the international flavour of the band‚Äôs music\\". Dai Jeffries, for Folking.com, described the album's sound as \\"decidedly pan-European\\". Some Other Shore Their second album, Some other Shore, was released on 3 June 2016. Also produced by Jason Emberton, it includes contributions from James Delarre on fiddle and Lukas Drinkwater on double bass. Andy McMillan, reviewing it for Bright Young Folk, described it as \\"an exceptionally fine and enjoyable album full of contrasts and carefully crafted and delivered\\". Eternal Child Daria Kulesh released her solo debut album, Eternal Child, on 31 January 2015. It was produced by Ben Walker. He plays piano, accordion, ukulele, keyboards, bass, guitar and mandolin on the album, which also features Kate Rouse, Kaity Rae, Luke Jackson and Lauren Deakin-Davies. Eternal Child was Blues and Roots Radio's Album of the Week on 24 January 2015, one of Paul Mansell's albums of the week on Radio Marlow FM 97.5 and Album of the Month for January 2015 on FolkWords. Reviewing the album for Folking.com, Dai Jeffries described Daria Kulesh's debut as very different from another Kara album ‚Äì \\"ten original songs that are largely autobiographical... Daria writes strong melodies to go with her crystal clear voice and I wonder how much the music of her Russian childhood influences them. The result, however, is an album that rewards repeated listening.\\" Pete Bradley, reviewing Eternal Child for FATEA Records, described it as \\"a phenomenal debut album\\". Tim Carroll, for FolkWords, said it was \\"possibly the most raw and unashamedly revealing collection of songs I‚Äôve heard in a long while...Daria uses these songs to explore acute moments in her life-documentary from the unique perspective of guileless innocence born into all children\\". \\"Letting Go\\", a single from the album, was released in May 2014. It is described as \\"a bittersweet, haunting track\\" about her Canadian ex-sweetheart. Long Lost Home On 23 February 2017, Daria Kulesh launched a second album, Long Lost Home, which has won multiple awards, including LCM Album of the Year. fRoots described is as \\"Bold, exotic, impressive... literate original songs powerfully sung\\". Long Lost Home has enjoyed national radio play and reviews calling it a \\"triumph\\", a \\"masterpiece\\" and \\"a definite contender for the best album of 2017\\". Mike Harding praised the Moon and the Pilot as \\"one of the most beautiful new songs of the last ten years\\". The album's title refers to Ingushetia in the Caucasus, which was the ancestral home of Daria's grandmother. ==Discography== Kara {  - ! Album ! Label !

It has a large mouth with an underbite, lined with prominent sharp teeth. It is dark above and silvery below, and in some freshly-caught specimens there is a yellow band parallel to the lateral line. It has 20 or 22 dark transverse bands on the back which do not reach the flanks. The anterior dorsal fin has 5 spiny rays, and the posterior has a single spiny ray and 9 soft rays. It has relatively small pectoral fins, and the pelvic fins are directly below the forwardmost point of the first dorsal fin; The anal fin has a one spiny ray and 9 soft rays. S. sphyraena has scales covering both the anterior and posterior margins of the preoperculum, whereas in Sphyraena viridensis both margins have no scales. They are normally around 30‚Äì60 cm in length and weigh 6 kg, but there are records of fish 165 cm long and reaching weights of at least 12 kg. It is the largest species of barracuda in the Mediterranean. ==Distribution== In the Eastern Atlantic Sphyraena sphyraena is found from the Bay of Biscay in the north through the Canary Islands and the Azores to Mossamedes, Angola in the south and is found off Bermuda and Brazil in the western Atlantic. It is also found throughout the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. It has been found as far north as Cornwall in the United Kingdom.http://www.glaucus.org.uk/Barracuda.txt ==Ecology== Sphyraena sphyraena is normally a pelagic species found high in the water column, but smaller fish often found near bottom of the water column. The main food is other fish but sometimes includes cephalopods and crustaceans. They are a social species and large groups of Sphyraena sphyraena numbering between ten and two hundred have been recorded. Reproduction occurs between May and August and the female can lay up to 300,000 eggs. The copepod Bomolochus unicirrus is known to be an ectoparasite of S. sphyraena. ==Fisheries== It is caught in some quantities by commercial fisheries and it is an important game fish. A decline in mean size and in the range of sizes caught has been noted in the eastern and southern Mediterranean and this may be an indication of over exploitation. Juvenile S.sphyraena are taken as bycatch in fisheries small forage fish, such as sardines and anchovies, while the rather sedentary adults are vulnerable to other fishing pressures, including spearfishing. right == References == Category:Fish of Europe Category:Sport fish Category:Sphyraenidae Category:Fish described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Sphyraena sphyraena"},{"id":"46329242","text":"Reverend Fair Cloth (\\"F.

At that time a large percentage of agricultural land was owned by large landowners and the majority of the rural population of Vietnam owned only small plots of land or was landless. The early success of the land reform program of the Viet Minh (and their successors, the Viet Cong), gave the communists a strong base of support among the 80 percent of the Vietnamese people who lived in rural areas. The support of the communists by a large number of rural dwellers was an important factor in determining the outcome of the Vietnam War. From 1954 to 1975 land reform was on two separate tracks as the country was provisionally divided into two parts: South Vietnam (The Republic of Vietnam) and North Vietnam (the Democratic Republic of Vietnam). Communist North Vietnam and its southern supporters, the Viet Cong, early adopted a policy of confiscating the land of landlords and rich peasants and distributing it to poor and landless peasants and later organizing the rural population into collectives. Capitalistic South Vietnam failed in several land reform endeavors before finally achieving some success with a \\"Land to the Tiller\\" program in the early 1970s. The conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam in 1975 ended that program. Vietnam expert Bernard Fall said land reform in South Vietnam was as essential to success in the Vietnam War as \\"ammunition for howitzers.\\" South Vietnam's ally and financial supporter, the United States, either failed to realize the importance of land reform or failed to persuade the South Vietnamese government of its importance. In the words of an American official, \\"The Americans offered the peasant a constitution; the Viet Cong offered him his land and with it the right to survive.\\"Prosterman, Roy L. (Aug 1970), \\"Land- to-the-Tiller in South Vietnam: The Tables Turn,\\" Asian Survey, Vol 10, No 8, p. 751. Downloaded from JSTOR. Land reform in North Vietnam was accomplished from 1954 to 1956 by confiscating and redistributing land owned by landlords to poor and landless peasants. This program resulted in executions of \\"landlords and reactionaries,\\" estimated most reliably at 13,500 killed, and resistance, including rioting, in the countryside. The North Vietnamese government apologized for the excesses and attempted to rectify errors. The communist government of North Vietnam (and after 1975 all of Vietnam) followed up land redistribution by establishing collective farms, but collectivized agriculture failed to result in large gains in agriculture production. Collectives were abandoned after 1988 and agricultural production rose rapidly thereafter. ==French rule== During the period of French rule of Indochina (1887-1954) Vietnam consisted of three regions: Tonkin‚Äîthe rice-growing area of the Red River valley of northern Vietnam; Cochinchina‚Äîthe rice-growing area of the Mekong Delta of southern Vietnam; and Annam‚Äîthe connective between the two regions, consisting of a narrow coastal plain and highlands. Tonkin and Annam had difficulty growing enough rice to feed their population and often imported rice from Cochinchina which produced a surplus.Moise, Edward E. (1983), Land Reform in China and North Vietnam, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, p. 154 North and South Vietnam from 1954 to 1975. Under French rule, French citizens and Vietnamese supporters of the French (mostly Roman Catholics), were granted large tracts of land, confiscated or obtained in some manner from its traditional occupants and owners. In southern Vietnam, the production of industrial crops for export, notably rubber, began on a large scale. Vietnam was managed by the French primarily to produce revenue which was attained by exports, taxation and government monopolies. By the 1930s, one result of French economic exploitation was a serious problem of unequal land distribution.Cima, Ronald J. Vietnam: A Country Study, Washington: GPO, 1987. http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/16.htm and http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/47.htm, accessed 16 Sep 2015 Approximately 80 percent of the population of Vietnam was rural and depended upon agriculture for a livelihood. About one million families‚Äî40 percent of the rural population of southern Vietnam‚Äîwere landless tenants.Prosterman, Roy L. (Nov 1967), \\"Land Reform in South Vietnam: A Proposal for Turning the Tables on the Viet Cong, Cornell Law Review, Vol. 53, http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/clr/vol53/iss1/3, accessed 16 Sep 2015 In Northern Vietnam about 21 percent of the rural population was landless and another 35 percent owned only very small parcels of land.Moise, p. 150 Out of a total population of Vietnam of around 25 million in 1940, 7 or 8 million people were probably landless peasants.Cima, http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/16.htm, accessed 16 Sep 2015 The country's richest agriculture region, the Mekong delta, was considered one of the five worst areas in the world for the prevalence of landlessness and tenancy among its inhabitants.Prosterman, Roy L.

The tenant had to provide his own hut, tools, and livestock, and hire supplementary labor at the height of the season....By the time the tenant had discharged all his obligations, his share of the crop was roughly a third of the total.\\"Prosterman (1967), p. 28 ==The Viet Minh== The Viet Minh‚ÄîVietnamese independence movement‚Äîfought to gain independence from France after World War II. They were the dominant political force in many of the rural areas of Vietnam, especially in the north where the French presence was less that in the south. In 1948, the Viet Minh initiated a modest program of reducing the rent peasants paid to landlords, although they were careful not to offend large landowners and landlords who supported the revolution. The Viet Minh confiscated land owned by French nationals, \\"traitors.\\" and landlords who fled to the cities to avoid the war in rural areas. The redistributed land was allocated to poor and landless peasants, but the Viet Minh retained control of the ownership of the land.Moise, p. 155-159 Scholar Jeffrey Race, who did a grassroots study of the people in one Mekong Delta province, said that \\"no other [Communist] Party activities had such an immediate and profound impact...the promise of land being one of the principal means of obtaining a core of activists in each village to drive out the government authorities.\\"Race, Jeremy (1972), War Comes to Long An, Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 126-128 In 1953, the Viet Minh, now in control of 60 to 90 percent of the rural areas of Vietnam, took a bolder approach to expand the land redistribution programs in what was called the rectification movement. They continued the rectification movement after Vietnam was provisionally divided into South Vietnam and North Vietnam as a result of the Geneva Accord of 1954. The land reforms carried out in North and South Vietnam bifurcate after 1954.Moise, p. 168 ==South Vietnam== Landlords and rich peasants owned a greater percentage of land in South Vietnam, especially in the rich agricultural land of the Mekong Delta, than in North Vietnam. Prior to the provisional separation of North and South Vietnam, emperor Bao Dai in 1953 responded to the Viet Minh program of land redistribution and rent reduction with a decree declaring that rents for land should not exceed 15 percent of the crop. The decree was unenforceable and rendered null by a failing colonial government and, in any case, contained loopholes that could have been exploited by landlords.Prosterman (1967), p. 27-29 in 1954, South Vietnam's ally, the United States, advised the new government of South Vietnam, headed by Ngo Dinh Diem, to undertake \\"indispensable reforms\\" including land reform. In response on 8 January 1955, Diem adopted Ordinance No. 2, which capped rental of land at 25 percent of production. In 1956, Diem adopted Ordinance No. 57 which forbade ownership by an individual of more than of rice land and prescribed the conditions and terms under which the excess land expropriated from the rich could be transferred to less-wealthy farmers.Wurfel, David (Jun 1957), \\"Agrarian Reform in the Republic of Vietnam,\\" Far Eastern Survey, Vol 26, No. 6, p. 82-83. Downloaded from JSTOR. Under the program the government acquired from 1958 to 1961 and distributed .Dacy, Douglas C. (1986), Foreign aid, war, and economic development: South Vietnam 1955-1975, Austin: University of Texas Press, p. 112 The land redistributed thus comprised less than 10 percent of the 7.5 million acres of cultivated land in South Vietnam.Prosterman (1967), p. 35; Tyson, James L. (1973), \\"Land Reform in Vietnam: A Progress Report,\\" Asian Affairs, Vol. l, No. 1, p. 36. Downloaded from JSTOR. The land reform program implemented under Ordinance 57 was unpopular in the countryside. The Viet Minh had already divided up the land -- \\"fairly,\\" in the words of one official.Race, Jeffrey (1972), War Comes to Long An, Berkeley: University of California Press, p. 70 The government's program was less generous to the majority of farmers than had been the Viet Minh redistribution of land in areas which it controlled. The amount of land that individuals were permitted to retain was large, farmers were required to pay for land they acquired under the program, and the program was riddled with corruption and inefficiency.Tucker, Spencer C., Ed. (1998), Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 219 Many rural people believed that the United States army and the government of South Vietnam were on the side of the landlords. Military operations by the U.S. and South Vietnamese armies to clear communist insurgents from an area would often result in landlords reclaiming land previously abandoned or confiscated and redistributed by the Viet Minh or Viet Cong. Ordinance 57 resulted in the reverse of what was the objective of land reform advocates: large landowners and landlords increased their influence, especially in the important rice- growing area of the Mekong Delta.Wurfel, pp. 91-92 The ordinance remained in effect until 1970, but was largely unutilized after 1960 as the Viet Cong insurgents took control or disputed government control of most of the rural areas of South Vietnam.Dacy, p. 112 Land-to-the-Tiller. In 1967, land reform expert Roy Prosterman revived the idea of land reform in South Vietnam. Drawing on experience in other countries, Prosterman proposed a \\"land-to-the- tiller\\" program to compete \\"with the Viet Cong for the allegiance of the peasants.\\" The plan had two main features: (1) all agricultural land in South Vietnam was to be owned by the farmers actually tilling the land, including land previously distributed by the Viet Cong and (2) landlords would be compensated fully for the land taken from them with payment guaranteed by the United States. Prosterman estimated that the land-to-the-tiller program could be accomplished at a cost of $900 million‚Äîless than the Vietnam War was costing the United States each month.Prosterman (1967), pp. 26-44 On 26 March 1970, with the Vietnam War still underway, the government of South Vietnam began implementation of the Land-to-the-Tiller program, similar to what Prosterman had proposed. The reform aimed to expropriate land from landlords not personally cultivating the land and giving it to tenant farmers; the landlords were compensated. Individual land holding was limited to 15 hectares. Legal title was extended to peasants who lived in areas under control of the South Vietnamese government to whom land had previously been given by the Viet Cong. U.S.President Richard Nixon gave his support to new land reform measures in June 1969 in the Midway communiqu√©, judging it favorable to the vietnamization of the conflict. In total, the United States financed $339 million of the total $441 million the reform cost. \\"By all accounts, the program was highly successful,\\" in the words of one scholar. By the end of 1973, 953,000 land titles had been distributed to poor or landless farmers and 1,198,000 hectares of land‚Äînearly 40 percent of cultivated land in South Vietnam‚Äîhad been distributed. By the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, the U.S. estimated that land tenancy had practically disappeared in South Vietnam and that the living standard of farmers had increased by 30 to 50 percent.Dacy, p. 113 However, the Land-to-the-Tiller program \\"failed to have a decisive impact [on the Vietnam War] because it was too little, too late.\\"Elliott, David (2003), The Vietnamese War: Revolution and Social Change in the Mekong Delta, 1930-1975, New York: Routledge, p. 372 ==North Vietnam== { style=\\"width: 35%; height:30px\\" border=\\"1\\" align=\\"right\\" + Land tenure situation in North Vietnam‚Äî1953Moise (1983), pp. 151, 165 -  Incomplete data; totals do not add to 100%; households consist of an average of more than 5 persons.

In characteristic communist fashion, the government divided the farmers into social classes: landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, poor peasants, and landless or nearly landless laborers. In North Vietnam about one-fourth of agricultural land was owned communally and allocated by the village or hamlet leaders to individual farmers.Moise (1983), pp. 159-166 The Land Reform Law of 4 December 1953 called for (1) confiscation of land belonging to landlords who were enemies of the regime; (2) requisition of land from landlords not judged to be enemies; and (3) purchase with payment in bonds. The land reform was carried out from 1953 to 1956 in five \\"waves,\\" each larger that the previous and extending to most of the good agricultural land of North Vietnam. Some farming areas did not undergo land reform but only rent reduction and the highland areas occupied by minority peoples were not substantially impacted. Some land was retained by the government but most was distributed without payment with priority given to Viet Minh fighters and their families.Moise (1983), pp. 178-181 The total number of rural people impacted by the land reform program was more than 4 million. The rent reduction program impacted nearly 8 million people.Szalontai, Balazs (2005), \\"Political and Economic Crisis in North Vietnam, 1955-1956\\", Cold War History, Vol. 5, No. 4, p. 401. Downloaded from JSTOR. North Vietnam had a total population of approximately 15 million people in 1955. Results.The land reform program was a success in terms of distributing much land to poor and landless peasants and reducing or eliminating the land holdings of landlords and rich peasants. However it was carried out with violence and repression primarily directed against large landowners identified, sometimes incorrectly, as landlords. On 18 August 1956, North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh acknowledged the serious errors the government had made in the land reform program. Too many farmers, he said, had been incorrectly classified as \\"landlords\\" and executed or imprisoned and too many mistakes had been made in redistributing land. Severe rioting protesting the excesses of the land reform program broke out in November 1956 in one largely-Catholic rural district. About 1,000 people were killed or injured and several thousand imprisoned. North Vietnam initiated a \\"correction campaign\\" which by 1958 had resulted in the return of land to many of those harmed by the land reform.Moise, pp. 237-268 Many of those imprisoned were released. Executions. Executions and imprisonment of persons classified as \\"landlords\\" or enemies of the state were contemplated from the beginning of the land reform program. A Politburo document dated 4 May 1953 said that executions were \\"fixed in principle at the ratio of one per one thousand people of the total population.\\" That ratio would indicate that communist Vietnam contemplated the execution of about 15,000 \\"reactionaries and evil landlords\\" in carrying out the program.\\"Politburo's Directive Issued on May 4, 1953, on some Special Issues regarding Mass Mobilization,\\" Journal of Vietnamese Studies, Vol. 5, No. 2 (Summer 2010), p. 243. Downloaded from JSTOR. The number of persons actually executed by communist cadre carrying out the land reform program has been variously estimated. South Vietnamese sources estimate up to 200,000 were killed.Lam Thanh Liem (2005), \\"Ho Chi Minh's Land Reform: Mistake or Crime,\\" http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/vietnam/landreform.html, accessed 4 October 2015 Author Bernard Fall estimated executions at 50,000. Other scholarship has concluded that the higher estimates were based on political propaganda emanating from South Vietnam and that the actual total of those executed was probably much lower. Scholar Edwin E. Moise estimated the total number of executions at between 3,000 and 15,000 and later came up with a more precise figure of 13,500.Moise, pp. 205-222; \\"Newly released documents on the land reform\\", Vietnam Studies Group, link, accessed 3 Oct 2015 Moise's conclusions were supported by documents of Hungarian diplomats living in North Vietnam at the time of the land reform.Balazs, p. 401 Author Michael Lind in a 2013 book gives a similar estimate of \\"at least ten or fifteen thousand\\" executed.Lind, Michael (2003), Vietnam: The Necessary War, New York: Simon and Schuster, p. 155 As part of the correction campaign as many as 23,748 political prisoners were released by North Vietnam by September 1957.Szalontai, p. 401 ==Collective farming== The ultimate objective of the land reform program of the North Vietnamese government, which became the government of all Vietnam in 1975, was not to achieve equitable distribution of farmland but rather the organization of all farmers into co-operatives in which land and other factors of agricultural production would be owned and used collectively. Farmers to whom land given in the land reform program did not receive title to the land. The ultimate ownership of the land remained with the State.Moise, pp. 155-159 The first steps after the 1953-1956 land reform were the encouragement by the government of labor exchanges in which farmers would unite to exchange labor; secondly in 1958 and 1959 was the formation of \\"low level cooperatives\\" in which farmers cooperated in production. By 1961, 86 percent of farmers were members of low-level cooperatives. The third step beginning in 1961 was to organize \\"high level cooperatives\\", true collective farming in which land and resources were utilized collectively without individual ownership of land. Workers received points for the quality and quantity of work they performed and the points accumulated were used to compute the share each member received of the cooperative's profit or production. This point system deteriorated into a system in which shares were computed only on the basis of hours worked, with no benefit accruing to farmers on the basis of the quality of their work.Kerkvliet, Bendedict J. Tria (1998), \\"Wobbly Foundations\\" building co- operatives in rural Vietnam, 1955-61,\\" South East Research, Vol. 6, No. 3, pp. 193-197.

Downloaded from JSTOR. By 1971, the great majority of farmers in North Vietnam were organized into high-level cooperatives. In former South Vietnam after 1975, however, the collectivization movement was much slower to be implemented. By 1986, more than 90 percent of farmers in former North Vietnam were organized into cooperatives; by contrast only 5. 9 percent of farmers in the Mekong Delta (Vietnam's \\"rice bowl\\") of former South Vietnam were members of cooperatives. Redistribution of land, begun under the South Vietnamese government, continued with each adult receiving 0.1 to 0.15 hectares and each minor child or elder person receiving .08 to .1 hectare of land. Collectivization efforts notwithstanding, the family farm remained the basis of agriculture in the Mekong Delta.Pingali and Vo-Tong Xuan, pp 700-704 ==Abolishment of collective farms== Rice production per capita under collectivization remained stagnant in northern Vietnam and declined in southern Vietnam. This decline was attributed by scholars to uncertainty and opposition to the attempted collectivization of the South.Pingali and Vo-Tong Xuan, p. 706 Rice production usually comprises more than 90 percent of total grain production in Vietnam and in 1978 rice production bottomed out at 9,790,000 metric tons.Young, Kenneth B, Wailes, Eric J, Cramer, Gail L., and Nguen Tri Khiem (2002), \\"Vietnam's Rice Economy: Development and Prospects\\", Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station, Division of Agriculture, University of Arkansas, http://arkansasagnews.uark.edu/968.pdf, accessed 5 Oct 2015 Reform of the collective farm system began in 1981 in which farmers were permitted to sell their agricultural production after meeting a required level of output for the state. This was a shift from a fixed wage system to a fixed rent system of production. Although initially production of rice and other crops increased as a result, the government still controlled the distribution of inputs and dictated land use and crop choices. In 1988, to further stimulate agricultural production, the government adopted Resolution 10, which ended most characteristics of the collective farm system. Regulation 10 enabled farmers to lease land from the government for up to 20 years, thus providing security of tenure.Pingali and Vo-Tong Xuan, pp 706-707 In 1993, the government further liberalized the agricultural sector with the adoption of the Land Law which gave land holders the rights of \\"exchange, transfer, inheritance, lease, and mortgage\\" of their leased land, The reforms were successful. Rice production in Vietnam rose from 15,103,000 metric tons in 1987 to 32,554,000 metric tons in 2000. In 1989, Vietnam became a net exporter of rice and later became one of the largest rice exporters in the world.Young, et al, pp. 7, 27 ==References== Category:History of Vietnam Vietnam Category:Reform in Vietnam Category:Agriculture in Vietnam Category:Collectives Category:Agricultural cooperatives Category:Cooperatives in Vietnam ","title":"Land reform in Vietnam"},{"id":"46329311","text":"Thomas Scott was formerly the Assistant Surveyor-General of Tasmania.

He was a landscape artist who is now mainly known for his italianising and topographical drawings of sites throughout the Southern Netherlands. He was a less prolific painter of landscapes and also produced a number of landscape prints. He further left a great number of figure studies. ==Life== The location and date of his birth are not known with certainty. It is likely that he was born in Ghent where he was baptized on 4 May 1623. However, there is also a record in Namur dated 10 June 1665, in which he is listed as a native of Overijse. An album with drawings mentions him as a native of Lille.Gillis Neyts at the Netherlands Institute for Art History View of Namur It is not clear with whom he trained. Some scholars mention as a possible teacher the Antwerp painter, draftsman and printmaker Lucas van Uden since some of Neyts' landscape paintings reflect van Uden's style.Gillis Neyts at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco However, there is no evidence for this presumed pupilage. In 1643 he was living in Antwerp where he married Clara de la Porte. The couple had two daughters and a son. In 1647 he was registered in the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp as a master painter and engraver. In 1650 he spent some time in Dortrecht. In the year 1653 he may have made a trip to Spain as it is known he made plans to do so.Gillis Neyts, a landscape painter from Brabant in the Meuse valley in the 17th century at codart From 1662 he is known to have been active in the Meuse valley around Namur and Huy where he made many studies of the landscapes. In 1665 he is registered as a poorter of Namur. He enjoyed the patronage of the local monasteries. He collaborated with Jacques Nicola√Ø who painted the figures in 18 landscapes commissioned by the Church of the convent of Croisiers in Namur.Gillis Neyts, Landscape with a view of a castle near Namur at Galerie Jan de Maere He travelled widely throughout the Meuse region and portrayed its cities, steep-banked valleys, imposing castles, ruins, rivers and luxuriant forests. He probably worked in Lille in the late 1670s. On the basis of a drawing of Antwerp, he is believed to have returned to Antwerp around 1680. He remained there until his death around 1687, the year in which the register of the Guild of Saint Luke mentions the payment of his death debt. He was buried in the Antwerp Cathedral. ==Work== General While in his early career Gillis Neyts produced some religious and mythological paintings, the vast majority of his later output was as a landscape artist.Gillis Neyts at Christie‚Äôs His subjects are either imaginary, idealised panoramas or topographical views of towns and villages. He often placed figures in his landscapes to animate the foreground or the composition.Gillis Neyts, River landscape with a town in the distance at Thomas Williams Fine Art Even his works on religious themes were landscapes with small devotional figures included. Many of his figure studies have been preserved. He also produced a number of harbour views with ships.Gillis Neyts, Landscape with three peasants and a church at the British Museum Neyts was able to develop his landscapes with infinite variation in both technique and scale. The paintings and drawings are characterized by the high quality of their execution and a constant desire to translate the peaceful atmosphere of the regions he visited. A large portion of his output consists of drawings and to a lesser extent paintings. He made print versions of some of his works. Drawings Landscape of the Meuse with the city of Huy in 1663 A great number of his landscape and figure drawings have been preserved and are in the collections of the British Museum, the Louvre, the Frits Lugt Collection in Paris, the Royal Collection and the Rijksmuseum.George Gordon. \\"Neyts, Gillis.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 5 April 2015Gillis Neyts at the British Museum Many of the drawings are signed or part of drawing albums. A majority of these drawings are small and executed in brown or black ink with a fine nib. Some of the drawings are on vellum. Neyts was, along with Jan Siberechts and Lucas van Uden, one of the most accomplished artists in the use of both watercolours and bodycolours in his drawings,. His penwork is delicate and characterized by the use of numerous dots and short strokes of the pen, sometimes accompanied by long sinuous meandering lines. Occasionally Neyts added grey wash or watercolour. Some of the imaginary scenes incorporate distant views of the church spires of Antwerp. Wenceslaus Hollar and the calligraphic style of Jacques Callot were probably influences on his landscape drawings. He is likely to have known these artist's prints rather than their drawings. Paintings His paintings also depicted imaginary and, less often, real views. They are typically in the blue-green tones characteristic of his Flemish contemporaries such as Lucas van Uden and Gillis Peeters. The compositions are derived from his drawings and his distinctive drawing style is duplicated in his handling of trees and figures. Printmaking Neyts created several etchings, sometimes after his drawings, while other artists used his designs for their own prints. Neyts' prints display the same personal style as his drawings. ==Notes== The little bridge Category:1768 deaths Category:17th-century engravers Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish engravers Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:Flemish marine artists Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Category:People from Ghent Category:People from Overijse Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Gillis Neyts"},{"id":"46329567","text":"Elections for Boston Borough Council, which governs as a second-tier authority the Borough of Boston were held on Thursday 7 May 2015.

He was the founder of the Pontifical Institute of the Religious Teachers Filippini and also founded both the Religious Teachers Filippini of Montefiascone and the Augustinian Sisters of Divine Love. He was the great-uncle of Pope Clement XIII and was a relative of Saint Gregorio Barbarigo. In the process towards sainthood Pope Benedict XVI approved that he lived a life of heroic virtue and bestowed upon him the title of Venerable in 2007. ==Biography== Marcantonio Barbarigo was born on 6 March 1640 in Venice. Barbarigo studied in Padua where he earned a doctorate in both canon law and civil law. He abandoned a successful diplomatic career in order to follow his religious vocation. Bishop of Corfu Barbarigo was ordained to the priesthood in Padua and Pope Innocent XI later appointed him as the Bishop of Corfu in 1678. His relative Gregorio Barbarigo bestowed upon him episcopal consecration in the Roman church of Santa Maria in Vallicella on 26 June 1678 and he was granted the pallium the following month. There he established a seminary for the training of young priests.\\"Our Founders\\", Religious Teachers Filippini In August 1684, the Venetian fleet anchored at Corfu was stricken with cholera.

From the Land of the Etruscans, Ed. di Storia e Letteratura, 1986 ==Montefiascone and Corneto== Pope Innocent XI elevated him into the cardinalate on 2 September 1686 as the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Susanna. He was transferred to the see of Montefiascone and Corneto in 1687 with the title of Archbishop. He established an orphanage in Corneto which was subsequently named \\"Orfanotrofio Barbarigo\\" in his honor. In 1685 Rose Venerini established a school for girls in Viterbo. Cardinal Barbarigo invited Venerini to come to his diocese to give advice on the administration of schools in the diocese and to help train teachers.\\"St. Rose Venerini\\", FaithND From 1692 to 1694, Venerini opened ten schools in Montefiascone and the villages surrounding Lake Bolsena. The cardinal rented a house for Venerini and her school, and provided the material means; Rosa trained the teachers, and organized the schools. When she had to return to Viterbo to attend to her first school, Venerini entrusted the Montefiascone schools and the teachers to the direction of a young woman, Lucy Filippini, whom the cardinal had entrusted with the leadership of the project in his diocese. Filippini organized the teachers of that diocese as a separate religious congregation known as the Religious Teachers Filippini.Filippini Sisters \\"History\\" He participated in the papal conclave of 1689 which resulted in the election of Pope Alexander VIII and also partook in the conclave of 1691 that saw the election of Pope Innocent XII. He later opted to be the Cardinal-Priest of San Marco in 1697 and partook in the papal conclave of 1700 that saw the election of Pope Clement XI. Barbarigo died on 26 May 1706 at 10:00am in Montefiascone in the residence of the bishop. He was buried in the tomb where bishops of the see were buried but was later transferred to another church and his heart placed in the Montefiascone seminary. ==Sainthood== The cause of beatification was introduced on 23 March 1941 and bestowed on him the title of Servant of God and the Positio was forwarded to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 2006.

Labour fielded ten fewer, the Greens five, the Liberal Democrats four, and six fewer independents stood in the election. ==Full results by ward== Note that the holds and gains mentioned here are strictly nominal and should only be treated as a rough guideline, as the ward map changed significantly between 2011 and 2015. The seats of Bedingfield, Harling and Heathland, Launditch, and Swaffham were uncontested. All elected a single unopposed Conservative with the exception of Swaffham, which elected three unopposed Conservatives. ==References== Category:2015 English local elections Category:May 2015 events in the United Kingdom 2015 Category:21st century in Norfolk ","title":"2015 Breckland District Council election"},{"id":"46329627","text":"Thompson v Vincent [2001] 3 NZLR 355 is a cited case in New Zealand confirming that where a party has cancelled a contract on unjustifiable grounds, can legally cancel the contract if justifiable grounds are later discovered. ==Background== The Thompsons were developing a 22-24 unit motel complex.

Shortly after graduating St. Johns College in 1810, Marriott was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates where he served on the Grievances and Courts of Justice Committee through the opening of the War of 1812. During this time, Marriott built a log home on his plantation at Ivy Hill in Anne Arundel County. The location would later become Howard County, in the town of Marriottsville. Marriott formed the 8th Brigade of the Maryland Militia serving as a Brigade Major and Inspector. He served in the positions from 1812 to 7 January 1820. From 1818 to 1822, Marriott was reelected to the House of Delegates, later becoming Speaker in the 1822 and 1824 sessions. Marriott received a large undisclosed sum of money as an inheritance from his grandfather William Hammond including a slave named Hess Badger who was supposed to be manumitted, but remained a slave until Marriott's death. In an 1854 case appealing his will, Hess' son Sam Badger appealed for his freedom from Marriott's heirs, since he was born into slavery while Marriott owned his mother, who was supposed to have her freedom before his birth.

Their goal was to free the peasants from the bondages of feudalism, but currently they are regarded as one of the main causes for the rise of the Sicilian Mafia. == In the Kingdom of Sicily == Under feudalism, the nobility owned most of the land. They enforced law and order through their private armies, which were also used to keep unruly workers and tenants in line. In 1773, in the Palermo revolt, guilds (maestranza) urged peasants to apply for the nationalized lands of the Jesuits. in 1781-1786, Viceroy Caracciolo ruled that the fiefs of nobles now belong to the king. He also declared that private armies are illegal. Peasant obligations to lords were reduced. In 1789, an edict called for enclosure of common lands, to be distributed to the poor in copyhold in exchange for yielding some of their feudal rights. However, most peasants were too poor to buy their rights, and the laws could be interpreted and enforced only by local magistrates. As a result, the rich became richer and the poor became poorer. A rural proletariat was created. After 1812, the feudal barons steadily sold off or rented their lands to private citizens. Primogeniture was abolished, land could no longer be seized to settle debts, and one fifth of the land was to become private property of the peasants.Jason Sardell, Economic Origins of the Mafia and Patronage System in Sicily, 2009. == In the Kingdom of Italy == In the 1860s, After Italy annexed Sicily in the Italian unification wars, it redistributed a large share of public and church land to private citizens. Some scholars claim that the unification forces did not favor land reform, and with little benefit to them, the peasants rebelled. The insurrection was put down in 1865, killing 5000 peasants. Other scholars claim that, on the contrary, the redistribution resulted in a huge boom in landowners: from 2,000 in 1812 to 20,000 by 1861.Oriana Bandiera, Private States and the Enforcement of Property Rights: Theory and evidence on the origins of the Sicilian mafia , 2001, pp. 8-10 With this increase in property owners and commerce came more disputes that needed settling, contracts that needed enforcing, transactions that needed oversight, and properties that needed protecting. The barons were releasing their private armies to let the state take over the job of enforcing the law, but the new authorities were not up to the task, largely due to their inexperience with capitalism. Lack of manpower was also a problem: there were often less than 350 active policemen for the entire island. Some towns did not have any permanent police force, only visited every few months by some troops to collect malcontents, leaving criminals to operate with impunity from the law in the interim.D. Mack Smith. A History of Sicily: Modern Sicily, after 1713. p. 368. Compounding these problems was banditry: rising food prices, the loss of public and church lands, and the loss of feudal commons pushed many desperate peasants to steal. In the face of rising crime, booming commerce, and inefficient authorities, property owners turned to extralegal arbitrators and protectors. These extralegal protectors would eventually organize themselves into the first Sicilian Mafia clans.The last paragraph was copied from Sicilian Mafia. == References == Sicily Category:Sicily Category:Reform in Italy ","title":"Land reform in Sicily"},{"id":"46329822","text":"Stewart Orr Gardner‚Ä† (31 October 1878 ‚Äì 12 April 1931) was a Scottish-American professional golfer who played in the late 19th and early 20th century. He had seven top-10 finishes in the U.S. Open. His best performance was a T2 finish in the 1902 U.S. Open. In 1924 he served as vice president at large of the PGA of America. ==Early life== Gardner was born on 31 October 1878 in Troon, Scotland, the son of Robert Gardner and Agnes Gardner (n√©e Snoddy) who were both born in Ireland. He grew to be a tall man, and had blue eyes and brown hair. He emigrated to the United States in 1899 and on 6 November 1919 he applied for, and was granted, U.S. citizenship. He registered for the draft during World War I on 12 September 1918 but it is unknown whether he saw any combat since the war would be over only two months later. He occasionally took trips back to Scotland, presumably to visit his mother and other family members, but would then return to the U.S. One such trip was aboard the SS Cameronia which left Glasgow on 28 February 1914 and arrived in New York on 9 March 1914. ==Golf career== Gardner was best known for a strong finish in the 1902 U.S. Open where he finished tied second with Walter Travis, but a distant six shots behind winner Laurie Auchterlonie. Gardner placed third in the 1903 U.S. Open and ninth in the 1900 U.S. Open. Gardner also finished fourth in the 1901 U.S. Open held at Myopia Hunt Club. In 1901 the Myopia Hunt Club course played extraordinarily difficult; no players in the event broke 80. Gardner was one of the first of a large group of Scottish golf professionals to come to America around the turn of the 19th century. He arrived in the United States in 1899 and took his first position at Lenox, Massachusetts. He served as head professional at Garden City Golf Club on Long Island, New York, but his longest stint was a 10-year posting at Exmoor Country Club. In his prime, he won many tournaments between 1901 and 1904. In 1905 he was tied for the lead after the first day in the U.S. Open with Alex Smith but he had a third round 85 and eventually finished fifth. In 1909 he was runner-up in the Western Open, nine shots behind winner Willie Anderson. The Western Open was considered to be a major tournament in the early 20th century. ==Death and legacy== By 1930 Gardner was single and rooming with the Alfred Stupple family in Highland Park, Illinois. Gardner died at his home in Highland Park on 12 April 1931 after a lingering illness at the age of 52. He is best remembered for a T2 finish in the 1902 U.S. Open. He was buried at North Shore Cemetery in Chicago, Illinois. ==Results in major championships== { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1900 !1901 !1902 !1903 !1904 !1905 !1906 !1907 - align=leftU.S. Open style=\\"background:yellow;\\"9 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"4 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T2 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"3 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T6 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"5 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"7 21 } Note: Gardner played only in the U.S. Open. \\"T\\" indicates a tie for a place Yellow background for top-10 ==Notes== ‚Ä† It is possible that Gardner's middle name might be \\"Owen\\" as shown on his draft registration card. ==References== Category:Scottish male golfers Category:Scottish emigrants to the United States Category:Golf administrators Category:1878 births Category:1931 deaths ","title":"Stewart Gardner"},{"id":"46329846","text":"Nippon Connection is a festival for Japanese film which takes place in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, every year in early summer.\\"Japan wird gr√∂√üer\\".

The festival organizers were invited to Tokyo to take part in a symposium on the impact of Japanese films abroad by the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs (Bunkacho). In 2005 the tour program was extended and the Nippon Cinema Award was introduced. In 2007 the Kinema Club held its first European conference at Nippon Connection. That year 170 films were shown. For the 10th anniversary in 2010, the Nippon Digital Award was established to support rising talents. The winner, chosen by a professional jury, receives a free subtitling for his or her next film. The Nippon Digital Award was renamed in 2011 into the Nippon Visions Award. 2010 was the last year that parts of the Nippon Visions section, which focuses on independent productions, were distributed worldwide to cities including New York, Barcelona, and Berlin under the designation Nippon Connection Film Festival on Tour. In 2012 the children‚Äôs program Nippon Kids was established. From 2012 until 2014, the VGF Nippon in Motion Award was given to the director of the best 12-second spot.

He established the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions in 1850. Ramazzotti had served as the Bishop of Pavia prior to his relocation to Venice and died less than a week before Pope Pius IX could elevate him to the cardinalate. He became well known across Venice for his love of the people and for his careful attention and consideration of the social and pastoral issues that faced the archdiocese. He brought to Venice his sense of calmness and resolve in tending to the social needs of the poor and to all people in general as a means of rekindling the Christian virtues in Venice. His cause of beatification has commenced and he was bestowed with the title of Servant of God in 1976. Pope Francis recognized his life of heroic virtue and conferred upon him the title of Venerable on 14 December 2015. ==Biography== Angelo Francesco Ramazzotti was born in Milan on 3 August 1800 as the second of two sons to Giuseppe Ramazzotti and Giulia Maderna. His elder brother was Filippo. He received confirmation in October 1806 and felt his religious vocation which awakened in him a desire to become part of the priesthood. He studied in Pavia where he obtained a doctorate in both canon law and civil law on 10 August 1823. He practiced law until 1826 when he went to become a priest. He received the minor orders on 22 December 1826 and 21 December 1827. Ramazzotti later received the subdiaconate on 14 March 1829 and the diaconate on 4 April 1829. He was ordained to the priesthood on 13 June 1829. He became a member of the Oblate Missionaries of Rho after his ordination. He was elected as the order's superior-general three times. Pope Pius IX appointed him as the Bishop of Pavia in 1850 and he received episcopal consecration a month after the appointment in the church of San Carlo al Corso on 30 June 1850. He wanted to refuse the appointment but accepted in obedience to the pontiff. He was installed on 20 September 1850. He devoted himself to various charitable works and looked after the needs of the people. He visited the sick in hospitals and also created institutions to shelter orphans and abandoned children. He founded the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions in 1850 and was later promoted as the Patriarch of Venice in 1858. A surprised Ramazzotti appealed to the pope to rethink the appointment but his pleas were ignored. Official news on 22 August 1861 revealed that Ramazzotti would be promoted to the cardinalate on 27 September 1861 and when he heard he attempted to dissuade Pope Pius IX from the elevation due to his poor health - he suffered from angina pectoris. He also made an appeal to Cardinal Giacomo Antonelli on the grounds on his financial condition that he could not afford the expenses for the cardinalate. Angelo Ramazzotti died on 24 September 1861 in Crespano del Grappa where he had gone in order to recover from his ailments. Bishop Giovanni Antonio Farina - future saint - celebrated his funeral and he was buried in Saint Mark's Basilica. His remains were later transferred to Milan on 3 March 1957. The Patriarch of Venice, Cardinal Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli; and Archbishop of Milan Giovanni Battista Montini - two future popes - presided over the transferral. Roncalli hailed Ramazzotti as a \\"true saint\\". ==Sainthood== The cause of beatification commenced under Pope Paul VI on 13 February 1976. This bestowed him with the posthumous title of Servant of God. The process commenced on a diocesan level at exactly the same time which concluded its work on 16 February 1978. That process was validated on 4 December 1998. The Positio - which documented his life of heroic virtue - was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome in 1999. The historical consultants to the cause met in 2014 and the theological consultants approved the documentation on 3 March 2015. It went to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints before it could go to the pope for approval - that meeting of the congregation took place on 3 November 2015 though further discussions were held on 1 December 2015. Pope Francis recognized his life of heroic virtue on 14 December 2015 which allowed him to confer upon him the title of Venerable. A miracle is required to be attributed to his intercession for beatification. ==References * *Hagiography Circle *Catholic Hierarchy *Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church Category:1800 births Category:1861 deaths Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:19th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:19th-century Italian people Category:Italian clergy Category:Patriarchs of Venice Category:Bishops of Pavia Category:People from Milan Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope Francis Category:Clergy from Milan ","title":"Angelo Ramazzotti"},{"id":"46329917","text":"The \\"Pililla, Rizal\\" Wind Energy Service Contract granted to Alternergy Philippine Holdings Corporation (APHC) covers an area of 4,515 hectares under Department of Energy WESC NO. 2009-09-018. This Wind Energy Service Contract (WESC) has two phases, Pililla Wind Power Project under WESC NO. 2009-09-018-AF1 and the Mt. Sembrano Wind Power Project under WESC NO. 2009-09-018-AP2. In December 2008, Alternergy Philippine Holdings Corporation (APHC) was awarded by the Department of Energy (DOE) the exclusive right to develop wind power projects in 3 locations: Pililla in Rizal, Abra de Ilog in Occidental Mindoro, and Kalayaan, Laguna. These locations were among those identified under the Philippine Wind Atlas as potential sites for wind farms due to good to excellent wind resources. APHC was subsequently awarded additional wind energy service contracts in 3 other locations in 2009. APHC is committed to implementing the wind projects if the wind measurements and site- specific studies demonstrate that the power plants are commercially viable. Phase 1 of this project is a wind farm in Barangay Halayhayin in Pililla, Rizal, Philippines. The wind farm is being undertaken by Alternergy Wind One Corporation. The total cost for the construction of the wind farm is US$177.9 million. The project consists of 27 wind turbine generators grouped into three clusters with an aggregate capacity of 54 megawatts (MW). The said project, after completion, will interconnect to Meralco's Malaya-Teresa 115 kilovolts (kV) transmission line located just 10 kilometers from the project site. Phase 2 located in Pililla, Rizal and Mabitac, Laguna was not initially included by Alternergy Philippine Holdings Corporation (APHC) in the Technical Assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank. A minor change in the ADB TA implementation was approved in February 2013 to prioritize the development of the Pililla, Rizal wind farm site and expand the study to Pililla Stage 2, which covers the southern portion of the area, as initial findings showed certain limitations in wind resource and constructability in the Laguna and Occidental Mindoro sites. Construction of a wind power project in Abra de Ilog, Occidental Mindoro, in particular, is not feasible until either the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) or the Philippine government has installed a submarine cable connecting Mindoro and Luzon. Based on the initial findings, further studies on the Laguna and Mindoro sites were discontinued; unutilized TA budget for these sites was reallocated instead to fund the study for Pililla Stage 2 . The projected cost for Phase 2 is Php 7.056 Billion and its planned output is 72 megawatts (MW). ==References== Category:Wind farms in the Philippines Category:Buildings and structures in Rizal ","title":"Pililla Wind Farm"},{"id":"46329943","text":"Rebus is an album by American jazz guitarist Joe Morris with reedist Ken Vandermark, who played tenor sax, and drummer Luther Gray.

Later, when he read the letter, which concerned defects to the exterior cladding, that needed to be rectified before the building consent would be granted, with an estimated cost of up to $14,000, he canceled the contract and sought the refund of his $37,000 deposit. The Cullinanes claimed it was not a substantial breach to justify the cancelling of the sale contract, adding that the argument was immaterial anyway, as they claimed one of the letters by McGuigan's solicitors discussing settlement amounted to affirmation. In the District Court, it was ruled the solicitors letter amounted to affirmation of the contract. However, on appeal, the High Court ruled that the contents of the letter could have been interpreted in numerous ways, setting aside the affirmation ruling, and instead ruling that the defects involved were substantial in nature, and that McGuigan was entitled to cancel the contract, and was duly awarded a refund of his deposit. The Cullianes appealed. ==Held== The court dismissed the appeal. ==References== Category:New Zealand contract case law Category:1999 in New Zealand law Category:Court of Appeal of New Zealand Category:1999 in case law ","title":"Cullinane v McGuigan"},{"id":"46330212","text":"La Grosse Bertha (Big Bertha) was a French weekly satirical magazine created in 1991 in opposition to the Gulf War.

The Yarmouk Camp is a district of Damascus that is home to the largest community of Palestinian refugees in Syria. ==Background== On 17 December 2012, the Free Syrian Army and anti- government Palestinians took control of the camp. After subsequent heavy fighting, the FSA and the Syrian Army agreed to leave Yarmouk as a neutral, demilitarized zone, but the camp remained besieged and sporadic clashes continued. Syrian government forces besieged Yarmouk for two years, and as a result, approximately 200 people were believed to have died of hunger in 2014.Palestinian refugees at Yarmouk are left to their fate, irishtimes.com. ==The battle== ISIL storms the camp On 1 April, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant militants entered the Yarmouk Refugee Camp from the Hajar Al- Aswad district, but were expelled the next day by Syrian and Palestinian rebels. However, ISIL re-entered the camp on 4 April and took control of 90% of it. Local recruits were among the ISIL forces‚Äîhaving joined the militants due to anger at being starved by the Syrian government and disliking some of the rebel groups that controlled Yarmouk \\"for playing politics with the regime rather than confronting it.\\" On 5 April, Jaysh al-Islam claimed that its fighters were refused access to the camp by al-Nusra Front and that al-Nusra allowed ISIL to enter the camp, which led to some defections from the first party. The al-Nusra Front responded by defending its neutral stance in the conflict and claimed to have mediated a ceasefire. It also denied rumors about the alleged defections. Meanwhile, the Army bombed the camp with 13 barrel bombs. A commander in the Aknaf Bait al-Maqdis was killed during clashes with ISIL. On 6 April, it was reported that about 2,000 people were evacuated from the camp since ISIL's attack. The same day, pro-government Palestinian groups led by the Palestine Liberation Army, the PFLP, PFLP-GC and Fatah al-Intifada launched an assault against ISIL. They reportedly captured Morocco Street, Al- Ja‚Äôounah Street and the Martyrs Cemetery and claimed to have killed 36 ISIL militant and controlled 40% of the Yarmouk camp. On 7 April, the fighting had ceased, with ISIL in control of 95% of the camp. Rebel counterattack On 12 April, Jaysh al-Islam and allied forces launched a counterattack on the ISIL-held Hajar al-Aswad district and reportedly advanced. Jaysh al-Islam also recaptured Al-Zein street in Yarmouk Camp from ISIL, during a nighttime operation. By 16 April, ISIL and al-Nusra were still holding 80% of the Yarmouk Camp, after clashes with Aknaf Bait al-Maqdis and other rebels. Two days later, fighting between the rebels and ISIL expanded to the neighborhoods of al-Qaboun and Barzah. The rebels captured 9 ISIL militants and killed 12 others. On 19 April, an activist reported that ISIL was planning to leave the camp, although they had not yet done so. He also revealed that most of the al- Nusra Front fighters in Yarmouk Camp had defected to ISIL, and that the two groups were closely collaborating in the area. By then, Aknaf Bai al-Maqdis had dissolved and joined Syrian Government forces. By 20 April, the ISIL attack on the two districts had been repelled. ==Aftermath== After the retreat of ISIL from the al-Qaboun and Barzah districts, the UN continued trying to bring relief aid into Yarmouk Camp. However, the camp remained sealed off, and the relief workers were only able to deliver supplies to the communities outside of Yarmouk Camp. ISIL control was eventually shrunk to 40% of the area, with another 20% being contested. Meanwhile, talks continued for making the Yarmouk Camp a neutral region, with plans for the expulsion of all gunmen from the area. Fighting between ISIL and government forces continued in the camp into late May.Clashes in Jobar and the Yarmouk camp, and aerial bombardment on al-Sokhna city On 8 June 2015, Palestinian militias in Yarmouk Camp reportedly expelled ISIL from the area of Damascus.Palestinian Militias Force ISIS Out of Yarmouk Camp However, three weeks later, it was revealed that Yarmouk Camp was still under siege by Syrian Army forces.Palestinians in Syria facing ‚Äòimminent threat‚Äô: PLO  October 2017  The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) launched a big assault in the Yarmouk Camp, targeting the neighbourhoods controlled by Aknaf Beit Al-Maqdis and Jaysh Al- Islam. According to the terrorist group‚Äôs official media wing, their forces captured the Yarmouk Hospital and several buildings nearby after overtaking the Islamist fighters in the southern part of the district. Most of the Yarmouk Camp is under the occupation of the Islamic State, which leaves the remaining civilians inside the district at the mercy of the terrorist group. While the Syrian Red Crescent and U.N. have attempted to deliver humanitarian aid to the beleaguered neighbourhoods of Yarmouk, they have found themselves often blocked by the Islamic State terrorists manning checkpoints between this district and nearby Palestine Camp. January 2018 On 5 January 2018, Jaysh al-Islam fighters attempted to infiltrate ISIL positions within the orchards situated in-between Yalda and Hajjar As-Aswad. After weeks of sporadic clashes, ISIL managed to capture 3/4 of Yarmouk Camp. By 27 January, ISIL almost entirely controlled Hajjar al-Aswad after breaking through the last lines of defense, and were on the verge of entering the town of Yalda. During the same time, further areas had also been captured in Yarmouk district. ==Foreign reactions== * ‚Äì State Department Deputy Spokesperson Marie Harf condemned ISIL's attack on the Yarmouk refugees camp. * ‚Äì The Egyptian Foreign Ministry also condemned ISIL's attack and called for \\"an immediate end to the fighting in order to preserve the lives of civilians‚Ä¶ and reiterates Egypt‚Äôs solidarity with our Palestinian brotherly-people.\\"Egypt condemns IS advances on Yarmouk refugee camp * ‚Äì The UN Security Council demanded humanitarian aid access to the camp \\"for the protection of civilians\\". ==See also== *Battle of Yarmouk Camp (December 2012) *Hama and Homs offensive (March‚ÄìApril 2015) *Qalamoun offensive (May 2015) *Palmyra offensive (2015) *Military intervention against ISIL **American-led intervention in Syria *List of wars and battles involving ISIL ==References== Category:Battles of the Syrian Civil War Category:2015 in the Syrian Civil War Category:Damascus in the Syrian Civil War Category:Damascus Governorate in the Syrian Civil War Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Syrian government Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the al-Nusra Front Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Free Syrian Army Category:April 2015 events in Asia ","title":"Battle of Yarmouk Camp (2015)"},{"id":"46330589","text":"David Romney (born June 12, 1993) is an American soccer player who currently plays for Nashville SC in MLS. ==Career== Romney began his professional career with LA Galaxy II, having previously played for the University of San Francisco men's soccer team and amateur club San Francisco City FC.

In a minor match in Patiala in 1956-57 he made 502 not out. ==Early career== Chamanlal made his first-class debut in 1952-53 for Eastern Punjab and played a few more games in subsequent seasons. He also opened the batting for Punjab University in the Rohinton Baria Trophy from 1953-54 to 1955-56. In 1956-57, playing in Patiala for Mohindra College, Patiala, against Government College, Rupar, he scored 502 not out. He is still one of only seven players to score 500 or more in a cricket match anywhere in the world, but his score was never an Indian record, as Dadabhoy Havewala had scored 515 in a match in Bombay in 1933-34. In 1957-58 he captained Eastern Punjab, scoring 182 runs at an average of 30.33 and taking 5 wickets at 41.80 in a team that lost all three matches. He then spent time in England furthering his engineering studies and experience. ==Captaincy of Northern Punjab== He next played first-class cricket in 1962-63, by which time the Eastern Punjab team had been disbanded, and he captained its successor team, Northern Punjab, in the Ranji Trophy. In his first match he scored 131 not out, his first century, against Jammu and Kashmir. In 1963-64 he was one of the leading batsmen in the Ranji Trophy, with 414 runs at 69.00, including another century (138) against Jammu and Kashmir. He played for North Zone in 1963-64, in the match against the touring MCC. In 1964-65, still captaining Northern Punjab, he made his highest score, 141 not out, against Railways. In the same match he also took his best bowling figures, 4 for 46, in Railways' first innings. In all 23 matches that he played for Northern Punjab between 1962‚Äì63 and 1967‚Äì68, captaining the side in every match, he made 1615 runs at an average of 55.68, and scored all four of his first-class centuries. He also took 24 wickets at 30.25. ==Later career== Northern Punjab and Southern Punjab combined after 1967-68 to form a united Punjab team. Rajinder Pal was the inaugural captain, but Chamanlal took over the captaincy in 1969-70 and 1970-71. Punjab made the Ranji Trophy finals for the first time in 1970-71.

His cross-genre sound was called \\"a vital new music form\\" by Magnet Magazine, \\"melding improvisation, world music, punk and avant garde.\\" His performances were so controversial in his home country of Israel that his first band Monotonix got banned from playing shows in almost all venues of the country, leading Gat ‚Äì a conscientious objector ‚Äì to leave his country for a life of touring, playing 1,500 concerts in 50 countries in 5 continents in the last decade alone. Rolling Stone editor David Fricke celebrated the multiculturalism of Gat's sound, calling him \\"a citizen of the world,\\" adding \\"Gat wields his guitar like a universal translator.\\" After relocating to Paris, Porto, and New Orleans, Gat found a home in New York, where his work was profiled by The New York Times, Rolling Stone, The Wire, UNCUT, Pitchfork, NPR, Vice,The New Yorker and People Magazine. The Village Voice named him \\"Best Guitarist in New York, 2013,\\" and The Guardian listed his sophomore album Universalists in their top ten Contemporary Classical Music albums of 2018, while PopMatters called it a \\"Visionary New Album for Rock Music, rearranged electronically in unpredictable ways that suggest Teo Macero, DJ Screw, Yeezus-era Kanye West, but not much else in rock music\\". ==Biography== As Member of Monotonix (2000s) Gat first came to prominence as the guitarist and founder of Monotonix. After finding themselves banned from most venues in their country due to the wild and controversial nature of their concerts, the band decided to leave Israel and tour the United States and Europe. With Monotonix, Gat released an EP and two albums on Drag City Records. Gat's guitar was the only harmonic instrument in the drums-guitar- vocals power trio and was singled out by the likes of Pitchfork mentioning \\"guitarist Yonatan Gat slides in and out of solos without ever throwing the rhythm off the rails... The descending guitar line that follows is sweet and yearning enough to fit onto a damn Strokes record.\\" During the band's 5-year existence, Gat played 1,000 concerts as its guitarist and co-founder, collaborating with musicians such as Fugazi's Ian Mackaye and Guy Picciotto and Beat Happening and K Records founder Calvin Johnson, while touring as support for Pavement, Faith No More and Silver Jews. The latter's frontman David Berman would go on to co-produce Gat's 2018 sophomore LP Universalists. Songs by Monotonix were used in TV, film and video games such as House, Grand Theft Auto and Better Living Through Chemistry. In 2008, Monotonix were called \\"the most exciting live band in rock 'n' roll\\" by Spin Magazine and by 2011, after completing a world tour for the final album, Not Yet, they stopped touring, allowing Gat to focus on his career as a solo artist. As Composer and Solo Artist After Monotonix's final world tours in 2011, Gat settled in New York and began recording and performing as a bandleader and solo artist, engaging Gal Lazer (drums) and Sergio Sayeg (bass) as his core studio- collaborators while expanding his projects to include musicians such as Brian Chase (Yeah Yeah Yeahs), Greg Saunier (Deerhoof) and Thor Harris (Swans). Gat began touring the United States and Europe both as headliner and sharing the stage with artists such as Thee Oh Sees and Sun Ra Arkestra, often performing his set on the floor in the middle of the audience. He released his debut EP, Iberian Passage, written and recorded while he was living in Portugal, in the spring of 2014 on Joyful Noise Recordings and his full-length studio album debut, Director, followed in 2015.

The old Carife was under administration from 2013 and 2015, and now being liquidated as a bad bank. Nevertheless, Nuova Carife was a short-lived bank, which was acquired by BPER Banca in 2017 from Italian Resolution Fund, becoming branches of the banking group in the same year. The former majority shareholder and the old legal person of the bank, Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara (Fondazione Carife) survived as a charity organization. ==History== Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara Found in 1838 by Count Alessandro Masi, Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara was one of the oldest savings bank () after Bologna (since 1837), Spoleto (since 1836; renamed and relocated in 2012; closed 2016) and Rome (1836; now defunct) in the Papal States (but not in the whole Italy). From 1927 to 1942 the bank acquired Cassa di Risparmio di Copparo, Banca Mutua Popolare di Bondeno, the local mount of piety of Ferrara (found 1508), Banca di Portomaggiore, Monte di Credito su Pegno di Comacchio and Banca Popolare Cooperativa di Argenta. An Italian law enacted in 1927 requires the savings bank to merge with bigger bank if it was under a certain size. In December 1991, the bank daily operation and ownership also split into a societ√† per azioni and Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara (Fondazione Carife). In 1994 the group acquired Banca di Credito Agrario di Ferrara. In 2002 the bank acquired Commercio e Finanza ‚Äì Leasing e Factoring as well as Banca di Treviso (the latter was sold to Banca Popolare di Marostica in 2010), and Credito Veronese (Creverbanca) in 2003. In 2004 the bank acquired Finproget. In 2005 Banca Modenese and Banca Farnese (some branches of the latter was sold to Banca Centropadana in 2014) were acquired. In 2008 Banca di Credito e Risparmio di Romagna joined the banking group. In 2012, Carife would be merged with its subsidiaries: Banca Popolare di Roma, Banca Modenese, Banca di Credito e Risparmio di Romagna and Finproget.

The 4 banks were the first bail-out in Italy since Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive was in force in Italy. The Bank of Italy was the national resolution authority of the Single Resolution Mechanism. The Italian National Resolution Fund had also injected a further ‚Ç¨1.7 billion in total to the 4 banks to cover the losses. On 3 May 2016, Decree-Law N¬∞59/2016 was announced, which the retail investors of the bond of the 4 banks would be refunded (up to ‚Ç¨100,000, same as deposit insurance) if they purchased the bond on or before 12 June 2014, the date of Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive was passed in the European Parliament. The decree-law was a response to criticism of the bail-in of all investor of the bank, which Italian bank often sold risky bond to their depositors. The refund scheme: Fondo di solidariet√†, would be managed by FITD. Nuova Carife On 22 November 2015 a \\"good bank\\" Nuova Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara S.p.A.

Lalith Wijeratne alias Aravinda) was a Sri Lankan politician. He was a member of the JVP party in the period 1983-1990. He was known to be appointed as the third leader of the JVP after Rohana Wijeweera and Saman Piyasiri Fernando. Wijerathna was killed in 1990. == Family life == Lalith Wijerathna was born in Divulapitiya of the Western Province in 1958. He belonged to a family of five. His father worked as a farmer. He had an elder brother and a younger brother named Ranjith Wijerathna who was a laborer at a textile factory. Government Forces attack The government security forces raided Wijerathna's home with the intention of arresting him. However, the forces could not find him, so they arrested the brother Ranjith Wijerathna and his father instead. Subsequently, the father was released, but the brother disappeared. It is alleged that Ranjith Wijerathna was tortured and killed by the government security forces. == Education == Lalith Wijerathna studied at the Hunumulla Central College (near Divulapitiya) until the GCE Advanced level examination and entered the Science Faculty of University of Peradeniya in 1980. However, he did not complete his studies at the university due to his heavy engagement in politics. His studentship was revoked after a decision from the Udulagama Commission which was set up to probe student agitations at the University of Peradeniya in 1983. == Career == Lalith Wijerathna started his political career as a student activist of Socialist Student Union (SSU), the student wing of the JVP. After the expulsion from the university he became a full-time JVP member. In 1982, when the JVP's leader Rohana Wijeweera contested the presidential election, Wijerathna supported his campaign. Even though he was a skillful organizer and a charismatic leader, Wijeratha was little known outside the party. In mid 1989, after the killing of Sumith Athukorala, a prominent politbureau member of the JVP, Wijerathna was believed to be promoted to the political bureau to fill up the vacant position. During second JVP insurrection, he was both a political and military wing leader in Anuradapura, Polonnaruwa and Trincomalee. ==Capture and Murder== In November 1989, after Rohana Wijeweera's alleged assassination, the remaining leaders including Saman Piyasiri Fernando, Lalilth Wijerathna, Upali Jayaweera, Ranjitham Gunaratnam, Gamini Wijegunasekara and Shantha Bandara tried to regroup. This attempt was made under the leadership of Saman Piyasisri Fernando. However, the government forces managed to capture Saman Piyasisri and subsequently killed him on 27th December 1989. After the capture of Saman Piyasiri, the leadership of the JVP was transferred to Lalith Wijerathna. It is believed that Wijerathna was captured in Colombo by a special police team from Kandy either late December 1989 or early January 1990. At a later date in January he was allegedly executed by his captors in Kandy. At the time of his death in January 1990, Lalith Wijerathna was believed to be around 32 years old. ==Bibliography== *Rohan Gunarathna (1990), Sri Lanka, a lost revolution, Institute of fundamental studies *C.

However, it was disbanded before it saw active service abroad. ==Origin== The regiment was formed in late 1941 by the conversion to the armoured role of the 9th Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment. The 9th North Staffords was a hostilities-only infantry battalion raised in 1940 that had been serving with the 224th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home).

Major fires burned across the Cape Peninsula starting on 1 March in Muizenberg and burning until 9 March, when firefighters extinguished it. The fire resulted in 1 death, 56 injuries, over of burnt land, and 13 damaged properties, of which 3 were destroyed. The cause of the fire was later determined to be arson. There were also major fires near Wellington and Porteville starting in February, which claimed the lives of 3 firefighters and a fire in Stellenbosch that caused the evacuation of the University of Stellenbosch and burned over of land. == Major fires == Cape Peninsula  Muizenberg  Imitate aftermath of the fires on the hills of Muizenberg overlooking Cape Town. The Muizenberg fire ignited in the afternoon on 1 March. The fire burned through the night and was brought under control until 2am the next morning, when it flared up again. By noon, 52 people had been treated for smoke inhalation, a firefighter had been treated for burn wounds and 2 bungalows and 5 homes had been destroyed. A number of buildings were evacuated, including 10 homes, a retirement village in Muizenberg and an old-age home in Noordhoek.

Cape Point  A Working on Fire Huey The Cape Point fire started on Wednesday, 4 March in Cape Point Nature Reserve after a lightning strike in the area. Firefighters managed to bring the fire under control, but strong winds fueled the fire and made it difficult for aerial firefighting resources to be used and the fire flared up again on Thursday. On Saturday, 71 year-old firefighting helicopter pilot, Hendrik Willem Marais, was killed when his Bell Huey helicopter crashed while fighting the fire. Mayor of Cape Town, Patricia de Lille and Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Edna Molewa sent their condolences. The fire in Cape Point flared up again on Sunday and 70-80 firefighters with water tanks were sent to control the fire.  Tokai  The Cape Peninsula fires had spread to Tokai by 4 March. The SANParks offices in Tokai Forest were evacuated. Groot Constantia, the oldest wine estate in South Africa suffered vineyard damage and had to be evacuated.

After three years, on February 26, 2017, TMR was the first player to play through the entire NES catalogue, completing all 714 officially-licensed titles in a project he called NESMania, which earned him a Guinness World Record. TMR is also known for his speedrunning accomplishments in Contra, Battletoads, and Cuphead. ==Early life== The Mexican Runner was born to a Mexican father and Polish mother. He grew up in Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico. ==Career beginnings== The Mexican Runner began performing NES speedruns on the Twitch streaming platform on January 3, 2013. Occasionally, his brother Marek (dubbed The Mexican Brother) would also participate in the streams. Together they recorded a two-player Battletoads completion clocking at 38:44. ==NESMania== In 2014, The Mexican Runner's mother's health started to suffer as she developed kidney cysts. TMR moved from London to Mexico to take care of her. While speaking online with fellow speedrunners from Chile about the stressful situation regarding his mother's health, they sarcastically suggested that he should play the entire NES library. He decided it was a good idea, and on May 28, 2014, he started streaming a complete playthrough of the entire licensed NES library, beginning with Whomp 'Em. The playthrough was coordinated with a Google spreadsheet and archived as YouTube videos. –¢MR named the project NESMania, in honour of Nintendoman√≠a, a 1990s Mexican TV show centred on video games. The original self-imposed rules were that he would play each game without consulting online strategy guides nor accept help from others for completing the game. The only allowed outside information was the original game manuals. The criterion for when a game was completed depended on the nature of the game, as many of the original NES games had no clear winning conditions and can be played indefinitely for higher scores. If the game had a clear ending sequence or ending credits, that was the winning condition. Otherwise, TMR would play a game until the game repeated itself or no further progress could be made. In one instance, when playing the Elite port to the NES, a member of the online audience contacted Ian Bell who suggested a winning condition. TMR wrote, > At first glance this game looks like doesn't have an ending screen and > surely doesn't so we had to pick a winning condition and luckily the > designer of the game 'Ian Bell' who was contacted by [audience member] > 'Alchman' give us an answer. He proposed as winning condition beating the > two main missions and having that as goal the rest was figuring out how to > do it. In this manner TMR made steady progress through the NES library, streaming it all live on Twitch. Around April 15, 2016 near game #395 (Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum) a modification to the self-imposed rules became necessary when he learned that another runner was also attempting a full completion of the NES library, but using extra outside help with hints and spoilers, which greatly reduced play time. At this point, TMR decided that he was willing to accept outside help in order to be able to compete on gaming speed and be the first to finish the complete NES library. The NESMania project attracted attention from the video game press, both when nearing and after completion. When the project was nearing completion, Kotaku reported how The Mexican Runner had to spend 91 hours playing Miracle Piano Teaching System, where the winning condition was learning how to play the piano. In an interview with the Mexican publication LevelUp, TMR explained that despite being a musician, learning how to play the piano was challenging as the game's difficulty continuously increased the required coordination between the two hands, demanding ever more skill. This was the game that took the longest completion time. On February 21, 2017, a few days before the finale, Nintendo Life noted that the project took over 3000 hours of game play time and the final game would be Super Mario Bros. 3. Also just two days before the finale, Waypoint of Vice Media noted how TMR found Ikari Warriors to be one of the most punishing games and required using save states on an emulator in order to practice, discovering glitches and other speedrunning techniques along the way. After the final streaming on February 26, 2017 of Super Mario Bros. 3, a game chosen for its popularity in order to end NESMania on a high note, Kotaku again reported on the finale, noting The Mexican Runner's celebratory song accompanied by guitar performed by himself.  Guinness World Record  On September 7, 2017, TMR was awarded a Guinness World Record for the completion of NESMania. The official record reads, ==Battletoads speedruns== On numerous occasions, The Mexican Runner has stated that his favourite NES game is Battletoads, a game that he considers enjoyable for its varied and famously difficult gameplay. He has also elaborated that he started playing it at age nine and finished the game as a child, but he could not find anyone at the time to share his accomplishments with. A desire to share is what made him start streaming his runs. TMR holds the world record in several speedrunning categories in Battletoads, some with fellow speedrunner and rival jay_cee, including * Hitless (never taking hit from the enemies or obstacles): 30m 56s * Warpless (no level-skipping warps allowed): 23m 42s * Any% Co-op (cooperative two-player mode, with jay_cee, warps allowed): 16m 15s * Warpless Co-op (cooperative two-player mode, with jay_cee, no warps allowed): 30m 27s In addition, TMR is also the former record holder in a couple more categories, such as Any% no wrong warps (no level-skipping not intended by the game designers, but early level termination is allowed). TMR has also performed Battletoads speedruns in front of a live audience at the speedrunning events Games Done Quick and the European Speedrunner Assembly.  Blindfolded Turbo Tunnel  An unofficial speedrunning category he participates in is blindfolded Turbo Tunnel. Many casual Battletoads players consider the Turbo Tunnel to be the hardest level in the game, but experienced speedrunners are able to memorise the level and rely on audio cues to play it. In this manner, TMR has performed several blindfolded Turbo Tunnel runs live, including a deathless run (no lives lost) at ESA 2018 that garnered a standing ovation from the crowd and was often mentioned during the following days. The two- player run is of particular note because neither player can be certain by audio cues alone of who made a mistake and lost a life, and both have to start over from the last checkpoint if either loses. TMR also remarked that in the blindfolded category the exact height that the player character is on-screen is difficult to know, as it depends on the amount of time the up and down arrows on the gamepad are pressed. ==Cuphead speedruns== The Mexican Runner does not usually run more modern games, but following his audience's suggestions, he started running the notoriously difficult run'n'gun indie video game Cuphead shortly after its release, quickly rising in the ranks and dominating it. The suggestion came about due to the game's similarity to Contra, another game that TMR enjoys speedrunning. Soon after the game's release, TMR started accumulating world records, many of which have since been bested by other speedrunners. He maintains, however, several records, particularly in the cooperative categories with fellow speedrunners luigi100 and SBDWolf. TMR's performance attracted the attention of StudioMDHR, the creators of Cuphead, and they endorsed his participation in SGDQ 2018 with promotional artwork for The Mexican Runner mascot in the 1930s Max Fleischer style of Cuphead. TMR's performance at that event won much acclaim from the audience, with particular praise given to his concurrent gameplay commentary. ==References== Category:Video game speedrunners Category:Living people Category:Mexican esports players Category:Polish esports players Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"The Mexican Runner"},{"id":"46331226","text":"Sayif Rasheed (born 25 November 1994) is an Emirati footballer who currently plays as a winger for Al-Sharjah. ==International career== International goals :Scores and results list the United Arab Emirates' goal tally first. {  - ! # !!

The walls are constructed of stone surrounded with bricks and white mortar creating an impression similar to the older, 14th century churches, the golden age of church building in Macedonia.–¶—Ä–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏—ò–∞ –≤–æ –°–∫–æ–ø—ò–µ –∏ –°–∫–æ–ø—Å–∫–æ –æ–¥ IV –≤–µ–∫ –¥–æ –¥–µ–Ω–µ—Å(2- –¥–µ–ª), http://www.preminportal.com.mk/duhovnost-2/drugo/2231-crkovnata-tradicija-vo- skopje-i-skopsko-od-iv-vek-do-denes-2-del The frescoes in the church have been done right after the construction. Their anonymous painter was a man of substantial technical skills, though not much talent. His compositions are well envisioned and dynamic, all in vivid colors. Among the most interesting frescoes are Christ as high priest surrounded with seraphim, then Mother of God with a crown and the Christmas Hymn of Saint John Damascene. In the lowest zone, among the most important saints we find also Saint Sava and Saint Simeon, a common feature in all Serb churches at the time.–°. –ü–µ—Ç–∫–æ–≤–∏—õ, –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∞ —É–º–µ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç —É XVI –∏ XVII –≤–µ–∫—É, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ 1995, —Å—Ç—Ä. 23 The iconostasis was painted in 1846 by Dicho Zograf.

Rumors have heard Hwang Jang Lee suppose to return to Don Wong and John Liu however being that Hwang Jang Lee was already working on in Hong Kong for the movies such as Dance of the Drunken Mantis and Hell\`s Windstaff for 1979. This results to give a leading villain role for Eagle Han who numerously worked for the low budget movies (such as Bruce Le\`s Return of the Red Tiger.) in South Korea. The success of the movie will later give him more villain roles in Godfrey Ho\`s movies.

On Jupiter Arrival Day (7 December 1995), the Galileo spacecraft was given a gravity- assist from Io and then subjected to the Jupiter orbit insertion (JOI) maneuver, which slowed the spacecraft down so that the planet could \\"catch\\" it. These two actions placed the orbiter on its proper trajectory to tour the Jovian moons. The Jupiter orbit insertion maneuver involved an orbit around the planet, which is referred to as the spacecraft's \\"zeroth\\" orbit. The spacecraft's \\"first,\\" and by far longest, orbit around Jupiter followed the JOI and lasted nearly seven months. On 27 June 1996, this initial orbit culminated in a close encounter with Ganymede, the largest of the four Galilean satellites. After the first Jupiter orbit of seven months, subsequent orbits were much shorter, ranging from one to two and a half months. The orbiter tour included four close encounters with Ganymede, three with Europa, and three with Callisto. No Io encounters were planned for the primary mission (besides the flyby on arrival day) because mission scientists feared that the high radiation levels so close to Jupiter could damage the spacecraft and possibly end the project. The primary mission ended in December 1997, two years after Jupiter arrival.Michael Meltzer, Mission to Jupiter: a History of the Galileo Project, NASA SP 2007‚Äì4231, p. 223-282 The Galileo mission used a two-character code to specify each orbit. The first character was the first letter of the name of the moon that would receive a flyby on the orbit, while the second character indicated the number of the orbit. Orbit: C: Callisto; E: Europa; G: Ganymede; I: Io; J: Jovian { class='' - valign='top' ! Orbit ! Closest approach in kilometers (miles) ! Date in Pacific time ! Observations - valign='top'  Jupiter Arrival Day  1,000 (600)  width = \\"140px\\"  7 December 1995  No imaging of Io and Europa due to tape-recorder problems. Because of the high radiation levels around Io and their effect on sensitive instruments, the scientists knew that Arrival Day might be the only time they would get a detailed look at Io‚Äîthe only time they could obtain high-resolution, closeup images. But concerns regarding Galileos malfunctioning tape recorder made it necessary to cancel all remote sensing operations during the flyby. Only fields-and-particles instruments were allowed to take and record data. Remote sensing instruments such as the SSI camera required the recorder to run discontinuously, with abrupt starts and stops, and at high speeds. That kind of operation might well have permanently crippled the recorder and, with it, the entire mission. - valign='top'  G1  835 (519)  27 June 1996  A gravity-assist during G1 reduced Galileos orbital period from 210 to 72 days, which allowed more orbits and close encounters each year. The perijove of orbit (point of closest approach to Jupiter) was increased to keep the spacecraft out of the most intense radiation regions. A radio-science experiment analyzed Ganymede's gravitational field and internal structure. The instruments detected evidence of a self-generated magnetosphere around the moon. - valign='top'  G2  260 (161)  6 September 1996  A Ganymede gravity-assist put Galileo into coplanar orbit with other Galilean satellites, permitting subsequent encounters with them. A radio-science experiment analyzed Ganymede's gravitational field and internal structure. G1 and G2 radio-science and other data revealed that Ganymede had an interior that was probably differentiated into a core and a mantle. The plasma wave experiment and magnetometer data gave evidence of an internally generated magnetic field. - valign='top'  C3  1,136 (705)  4 November 1996  Observations supported the theory that Callisto has a homogeneous internal structure, 60 percent rock and 40 percent ice. - valign='top'  E4  692 (429)  19 December 1996  Galileos primary science objectives during E4 were to conduct remote sensing observations of Europa's surface, collect data on the moon's interactions with Jupiter's magnetosphere, and analyze Jovian atmospheric features. It included occultations of the Sun and Earth by both Jupiter and Europa, which provided an opportunity to search for indications of an ionosphere and atmosphere on the moon. The return of data from E4 was limited by a solar conjunction on 19 January 1997, occurring approximately midway between the E4 and E6 encounters. - valign='top'  J5  no close flyby   No close encounter to a Jovian moon was designed because Earth and Jupiter were in solar conjunction about the time that the closest approach would have occurred, and there would have been minimal communication capability between the spacecraft and Earth. - valign='top'  E6  586 (363)  20 February 1997  The main scientific objective was to conduct high-resolution coverage of Europa. This was a similar objective to E4, but with some new Europa surface terrain observed. Monitoring of Io was also conducted. Jupiter atmospheric observations during E4 involved a coordinated effort by all of the Orbiter's remote sensing instruments to analyze white oval features in the infrared and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum. Four occultations of Earth occurred during E6‚Äîtwo by Europa, one by Io, and one by Jupiter. The radio science occultation measurements made during these events provided data on atmospheric profiles of the moons and Jupiter, and also on Europa's gravitational field. - valign='top'  G7  3,102 (1,926)  5 April 1997  The spacecraft flew over the high latitudes of Ganymede and took high-resolution observations of high- energy impact regions, as well as Jupiter magnetosphere and aurora observations. - valign='top'  G8  1,603 (995)  7 May 1997  The spacecraft passed over the midlatitudes of Ganymede, with closest approach longitudes 180¬∞ apart from those of the G7 encounter, allowing new terrain to be imaged. - valign='top'  C9  418 (260)  25 June 1997  The spacecraft passed through and studied the magnetotail region of the Jovian magnetosphere during the period between the C9 and C10 flybys. Analysis of the C3, C9, and C10 data suggests that Callisto may have a subsurface, salty ocean that is responsible for a variable magnetic field induced by Jupiter's field. - valign='top'  C10  539 (335)  17 September 1997  C10 data suggest that the internal structure of the moon is not homogeneous, but partially differentiated, with a higher percentage of rock than ice having settled toward the center of the satellite. Callisto is probably less differentiated than the other Galilean moons. - valign='top'  E11  2,042 (1,266)  6 November 1997  The encounter included the longest recording to date, lasting almost 3 hours, of Jovian magnetospheric data close to Europa. The data were helpful not only in the study of Europa, but also for analyzing Io's plasma torus, whose charged particles are strongly influenced by the magnetic fields they encounter. Primary science objectives of E11 included more remote sensing of the moon's surface and more Jovian atmospheric observations. Another objective was to obtain the highest resolution images yet taken of four small, inner Jovian satellites: Thebe, Metis, Amalthea, and Adrastea. } == Galileo Europa Mission (1997 - 1999) == The Galileo project would have been considered a success even if the spacecraft had stayed operational only through the end of the primary mission on 7 December 1997, two years after Jupiter arrival. The orbiter was an extremely robust machine, however, with many backup systems. It showed no sign of quitting at the end of the primary mission, so it was given a highly focused set of new exploration objectives, defined in part by the findings of the primary mission. As some of these new objectives centered on investigating Europa in great detail, the new mission was appropriately called the \\"Galileo Europa Mission\\" (GEM). Mission objectives were not limited to Europa, however; they included analyses of other satellites, as well as of Jovian fields and particles and atmospheric characteristics. During GEM, some of the most important and spectacular observations of the volcanic moon Io were taken. GEM ran for slightly over two years, from 8 December 1997 to 31 December 1999. It was a low-cost mission with a budget of only $30 million. At the end of the primary mission, most of the 200 Galileo staff members left for other assignments. The remaining bare-bones crew, about one-fifth the size of the primary mission, was left to run GEM and achieve the objectives of four separate studies: * Europa campaign. * Io campaign. * Io plasma torus study. * Jupiter water study. On each flyby, the spacecraft took only two days of data versus the seven days it had taken during the primary mission. Minimal Jovian magnetic field data were collected. The GEM team did not include the expertise to deal with unexpected problems, as the primary mission had. When issues arose, specialists who had gone on to other missions were temporarily brought back and placed on \\"tiger teams\\" to work through the problems quickly. { class='' - valign='top' ! Orbit ! Closest approach in kilometers (miles) ! Date in Pacific time ! Observations - valign='top'  E12  196 (122)  width = \\"140px\\"  16 December 1997  The instruments observed the Conamara ice raft region and took stereo images o the Pwyll crater region. Stereo imaging discerned the topography of a region. - valign='top'  E13  3,562 (2,212)  10 February 1998  No remote sensing or magnetospheric data were collected because of the solar conjunction, which reduced the capacity to transmit science data to Earth. Radio science data for studying Europan gravitational field and internal structure were taken. - valign='top'  E14  1,645 (1,022)  28 March 1998  Stereo imaging of Mannann'an crater and Tyre Macula dark spot was accomplished. The spacecraft observed banded terrain, bright plains, and ice rafts. - valign='top'  E15  2,515 (1,562)  31 May 1998  The spacecraft carried out stereo and color imaging of Cilix massif, previously believed to be the largest mountain on Europa (but E15 data revealed that it was an impact crater). Created near-terminator maps of unexplored mottled terrain. (The terminator is the boundary between the part of the moon that is illuminated and that which is dark.) Because of the low Sun angles near the terminator, shadows cast by uneven terrain are more measurable, and the heights of mounds, ridges and ice rafts can be determined. - valign='top'  E16  1,830 (1,136)  21 July 1998  A spacecraft safing event prevented Europan science observations. The cause of the event was believed to be electrostatic discharges in the slip rings between the spun and despun sections of the Orbiter. The spacecraft passed over the Europan south pole. - valign='top'  E17  3,582 (2,224)  26 September 1998  A south polar pass (like that of E16) allowed observations of many of the targets missed during E16. The spacecraft searched for evidence of large-scale shifting of surface features, which would indicate a possible liquid sublayer. The spacecraft's instruments took images of the Agenor Linea-Thrace Macula region, Libya Linea, a strike-slip fault zone, Rhiannon Crater, Thynia Linea, and south polar terrain (for comparison with E4 and E6 equatorial terrain images). Thermal maps of Europa were generated. Radioscience analyses of the Europan gravity field were made over a 20-hour period. The instruments also made ultraviolet observations of Europa outgassing and atmospheric emissions. - valign='top'  E18  2,273 (1,412)  22 November 1998  A safing event terminated science observations 6 hours before the Europan closest approach. The primary collection was of radio-science Doppler data. - valign='top'  E19  1,439 (894)  1 February 1999  The instruments carried out global- and regional-scale mapping, along with imaging of Tegid Crater, Rhadmanthys Linea volcanic features, mottled terrain, and a dark spot. The ultraviolet instruments also made observations of atmospheric emissions and possible outgassing. A safing event terminated science observations 4 hours after the Europan closest approach. Outbound distant observations of Europa (as well as Jupiter and Io) were lost. - valign='top'  C20  1,315 (817)  5 May 1999  The perijove reduction campaign began; it involved incremental changes in the closest approach to Jupiter carried out over four Callisto encounters (C20‚ÄìC23). The campaign was designed to set up flybys of Io, the Galilean moon closest to Jupiter. - valign='top'  C21  1,047 (650)  30 June 1999  NIMS studied the trailing edge of Callisto. The SSI camera observed dark surface material. The PPR studied equatorial region. - valign='top'  C22  2,296 (1,426)  14 August 1999  The spacecraft observed Callisto's ionosphere and measured the distribution of free electrons. - valign='top'  C23  1,057 (656)  16 September 1999  The spacecraft observed Callisto's ionosphere, measured the distribution of free electrons, and completed the perijove reduction campaign. - valign='top'  I24  611 (379)  11 October 1999  Spacecraft safed at 19 hours before Io encounter due to radiation memory hit. The Galileo engineering staff succeeded to get the spacecraft fully operational by 8 P.M. Pacific Time, a mere 2 hours before the closest approach. Obtained valuable imaging of Io volcanism. Observed a 10-kilometer- long eruption of Pele volcano. - valign='top'  I25  300 (186)  25 November 1999  Spacecraft safed at 4 hours before encounter due to software problem. With very little time, the Galileo team had to formulate command sequences and get them to Jupiter. The spacecraft recovered only three minutes before the closest encounter with Io. Collected dramatic pictures of Io volcanic activity. Observed mile-high lava fountain. } == Galileo Millennium Mission == Because the orbiter was continuing to operate well, a further extension to the original project, the Galileo Millennium Mission (GMM), was added to pursue answers to key questions raised during GEM. The original GMM schedule ran from January 2000 through March 2001, but it was then extended to the end of mission operations in January 2003. The spacecraft met its demise in September 2003, when its trajectory took it on a collision course toward Jupiter and it burned up in the planet's atmosphere. GMM conducted additional investigations of Europa, including a magnetic field measurement key to detecting the presence of liquid water. GMM also added to our knowledge of Io, studied the dynamics of Ganymede's unique magnetosphere, determined particle sizes in Jupiter's rings, and performed a joint investigation with the Cassini spacecraft, whose closest approach to Jupiter was on 30 December 2000. Some of Galileos instruments were not operating at full performance during GMM because exposure to Jupiter's intense radiation belts had damaged them. This was not surprising; the total radiation that the spacecraft had received was three times the amount that its systems had been built to withstand. But even with its impaired systems, Galileo continued to make valuable observations and generate important scientific data. { class='' - valign='top' ! Orbit ! Closest approach in kilometers (miles) ! Date in Pacific time ! Observations - valign='top'  E26  351 (218)  width = \\"140px\\"  3 January 2000  Only limited observations were made during E26 due to factors such as the decreasing periods of Galileo orbits (allowing less time to develop orbital sequences), a smaller workforce and budget than during GEM, and reduced downlink resources. Recorded observations during E26 included high- resolution pictures near the Europan terminator, images of three of the four Jovian inner moons (Thebe, Amalthea, and Metis), and observations of the Loki volcanic region on Io. The E26 flyby was also designed to better characterize Europa's magnetic field signature to determine whether the moon generated its own magnetic field or had an induced field whose characteristics were affected by Europa's location within Jupiter's magnetosphere. - valign='top'  I27  198 (123)  22 February 2000  Discovered volcanoes that change from hot to cool in several weeks. After flyby the spacecraft safed due to transient bus reset. Some Io 27 data played back during Ganymede 28. - valign='top'  G28  1,000 (600)  20 May 2000  Galileos closest approach to Ganymede coincided with Cassinis. Joint Galileo-Cassini observations revealed solar wind effects and magnetospheric dynamics. High-resolution Ganymede images also were taken. Magnetometer data suggest that a salty water layer exists beneath the icy crust. - valign='top'  -  -  15 June 2000 to 15 November 2000  Magnetosphere‚Äìsolar wind interaction measurements. - valign='top'  G29  2,321 (1,441)  28 December 2000  Real-time data were transmitted as Galileo flew from the inner magnetosphere through the magnetopause and bow shock and into the solar wind. Remote sensing instruments targeted Jupiter, its rings, and the Galilean satellites. - valign='top'  C30  138 (86)  25 May 2001  The spacecraft observed the Asgard, Valhalla, and Bran craters in the closest flyby to date (in order to set up an Io encounter in August 2001). Camera problems were possibly due to continued radiation exposure that affected distant images taken of Io. Problems were corrected before the closest approach to Callisto. - valign='top'  I31  200 (120)  5 August 2001  Magnetic measurements of Io indicated a weak or absent internally generated field. Spacecraft directly sampled fresh sulfur dioxide \\"snowfakes\\" from a volcanic vent. - valign='top'  I32  181 (112)  16 October 2001  Galileo observed the Loki volcano (largest in the solar system) and a new eruption in the southern region of the moon. - valign='top'  I33  102 (63)  17 January 2002  This was the closest of all the flybys of Io. The moon provided a gravity-assist necessary for Galileos ultimate collision course with Jupiter. A safing event 28 minutes before closest approach prevented most of the planned data from being collected. Galileo s cameras were deactivated, after they had sustained irreparable radiation damage. - valign='top'  Amalthea 34  160 (99)  4 November 2002  Scientists used data from Amalthea encounter in order to better determine the mass and density profile of Amalthea. Combined with previously determined shape and volume information, observations generated a bulk density estimate near 1 gram per cubic centimeter, considerably lower than had been envisioned from the moon's dark albedo and its expected rocky composition. About 10 minutes after the closest approach of the Amalthea flyby, Galileo stopped collecting data, shut down all of its instruments, and went into safe mode. Though most of the Amalthea data was already written to tape, it was found that the recorder refused to play back the data collected. After weeks of troubleshooting, the flight team concluded that the problem was not stuck tape, as had happened when Galileo was first approaching Jupiter in 1995, but was instead the result of radiation damage of one or more of the instrument's infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The damage was believed to consist of the displacement of atoms in the LEDs' crystal lattices, which degraded the LED optical output to only 20 percent of its full power. Laboratory experiments suggested that for the tape recorder to run properly, the LED output had to be at least 50 percent. The Galileo flight team conducted an exhaustive analysis of possible ways to work around the problem and developed a strategy that might partially repair the damaged lattices. JPL would send commands to the spacecraft to initiate electric currents passing through the LEDs. The strategy did not immediately fix the LEDs, but after multiple applications of electric current, LED optical output increased to 60 percent, allowing the tape recorder to begin running again and download its stored data. After about 100 hours of annealing and playback cycles, the recorder was able to operate for up to an hour at a time. After many subsequent playback and cooling cycles, the complete transmission back to Earth of all recorded Amalthea flyby data was successful. - valign='top'  Jupiter 35  (impact)  21 September 2003  Galileos final orbit took it on an elongated loop away from Jupiter, from which it returned on 21 September 2003 to plow into the parent planet's 60,000-kilometer-thick atmosphere. This demise was planned in order to avoid any chance that the spacecraft might strike and contaminate the moon Europa, where scientists believe that simple life-forms may exist. If such life-forms are discovered in future missions, scientists must be sure that they are not Earth organisms that were accidentally carried to Europa aboard Galileo. } == References  External links == *Mission to Jupiter: a History of the Galileo Project, by Michael Meltzer, NASA SP 2007‚Äì4231 (on-line book) *Galileo News Archive *Galileo Satellite Image Mosaics *The Radiation Effects on Galileo Spacecraft Systems at Jupiter, by Fieseler, et. al Category:Galileo (spacecraft) Category:Spaceflight timelines ","title":"Timeline of Galileo (spacecraft)"},{"id":"46331712","text":"South West Phoenix Football Club is an Australian semi-professional association football club based in Bunbury, Western Australia. The club currently competes in the SWSA Premier League. ==History== The first club from the Bunbury region to join the Perth-based State League was Bunbury City FC from 1979 to 1987. Bunbury Tricolore FC entered the State Amateur League in 1990, and participated there for the following 5 seasons. In 1996 they amalgamated with Ashfield to form Ashfield-Bunbury and entered the State League Division One; in 1999 this combined club won promotion to the Premier League after three seasons in Division One. The amalgamation with Ashfield was brought about mainly because of the costs involved in playing in the State League. The club in its present form was founded in 2001 after the departure of Ashfield-Bunbury from the State League. The club's name came from a competition in the Bunbury-based newspaper The South-West Times. The club entered the WA State League Division 1 and finished 6th in their first season. The club's name was changed to the Bunbury Forum Force in 2010, due to sponsorship arrangements, and they then won their first Division 1 title the year after in 2011, and therefore promoted to the WA Premier League for the 2012 season. In their two seasons in the Premier League they finished 9th and 7th, however they were not selected as one of the 12 initial teams in the newly formed National Premier Leagues WA for the 2014 season. In the 2015 season the club reverted to the name South West Phoenix FC after sponsorship arrangements expired. In 2017 SWP won their first-ever Night Series Championship and were unbeaten throughout the whole tournament. In February 2019, the squad suffered an embarrassing 3‚Äì5 defeat at the hands of local club Bunbury Dynamos in a friendly match. With goals from Chadley Edwards, Jack Menzies, Darcy Vane and Tererai Gwavava. About a week later Tony Novello resigned as the first-team coach. On 15 March 2019, South West Phoenix officially asked Football West to be removed from the Football West State League Division 1. Football West accepted SWP request. Guy Italiano then resigned as president of the club. South West Phoenix Won their first game in the SWSA Premier League with a 6‚Äì3 win away to local club Football Margaret River At the end of the SWSA Premier League Season South West Phoenix finished the season 2nd on the ladder 9 points behind eventual league champions Bunbury Dynamos. ==Coaching and Medical staff== * First Team Coach: Kevin Homden * First Team Assistant Coach: Vacant * Reserves Team Coach: * Youth Team Coach: * Club captain: * Club Doctor: Vacant) * Head Trainer: Vacant ==Executive Committee== * President ‚Äì Jen Curtis * Vice President ‚Äì Mark Bateman * Treasurer ‚Äì Steve Lawty * Secretary ‚Äì Jacinta Fazey ==References * Club Facebook Page Category:Soccer clubs in Western Australia Category:Association football clubs established in 1979 Category:1979 establishments in Australia ","title":"South West Phoenix FC"},{"id":"46331723","text":"Cato Nordbeck is a Norwegian former professional racing cyclist.

The cathedral, dedicated to Saint Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, is the ecclesiastical seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro. ==History== The present Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro had its beginnings as a territory of the Archdioceses of Cebu and Jaro from 1607 to 1910. Its administration is later transferred to the Diocese of Zamboanga from 1911 to 1933 before its canonical erection in 1933. During its early history, it was believed that the first church structure built in present-day Cagayan de Oro (formerly Cagayan de Misamis) was erected in 1624 by the Augustinian Recollects under the leadership of Father Agustin de San Pedro. The old settlement used to be located in an area called Himologan or Huluga. It was moved to its present location due to Father San Pedro's urging, reasoning out that the current location would be easier to defend from marauding pirates and other enemies. The church structure during that time was made of light materials with fortification built of the same materials. The church was frequently attacked and razed to the ground by soldiers from the Non-Christian areas of Mindanao. One such instance happened in 1649, when a Manobo tribe under the leadership of a certain Dabao revolted against the presence of the Spanish government and church in the area. After the incident, the church was rebuilt with wood and other light materials until it was again burned in 1778. The following year, Father Pedro de Santa Barbara led the construction of a new and bigger church. The said church, like its predecessors, was also razed by fire in 1831. After the most recent fire, the church officials did not rebuild the church until 1841 when Father Simon Loscos instigated the construction of a stone church. The town mayor during that time, Don Jose Corrales, together with members of the local clergy, helped in the construction of the stone church. The church construction lasted from 1843 to 1851. In 1886, the parish priest of Cagayan de Oro, Father Ramon Zueco, bought a pipe organ from Manila. In 1942, during the Second World War, the church of Cagayan de Oro was bombed. Soon after the war, the construction of the present cathedral structure was started. It was not specified when the current Neo-Gothic cathedral was completed. ==Image Gallery== File:JC Cagayan de Oro 5.JPGView of main church nave File:JC Cagayan de Oro 3.JPGFont found attached to one of the choir loft pillars File:JC Cagayan de Oro 2.JPGNeo- Gothic motif windows File:JC Cagayan de Oro 1.JPGView of the Epistle-side nave File:JC Cagayan de Oro 4.JPGTableau of the Crucifixion of Christ ==See also== *Roman Catholicism in the Philippines ==References Category:Roman Catholic churches in Misamis Oriental Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in the Philippines Category:Buildings and structures in Cagayan de Oro ","title":"Saint Augustine Metropolitan Cathedral"},{"id":"46331756","text":"Tom Martin Biseth (born 29 March 1946) is a Norwegian former professional racing cyclist.
