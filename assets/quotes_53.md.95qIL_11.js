Its main use is to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE). It is a preferred choice of imaging in the diagnosis of PE due to its minimally invasive nature for the patient, whose only requirement for the scan is an intravenous line. Modern MDCT (multi-detector CT) scanners are able to deliver images of sufficient resolution within a short time period, such that CTPA has now supplanted previous methods of testing, such as direct pulmonary angiography, as the gold standard for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. The patient receives an intravenous injection of an iodine-containing contrast agent at a high-rate using an injector pump. Images are acquired with the maximum intensity of radio-opaque contrast in the pulmonary arteries. This can be done using bolus tracking. A normal CTPA scan will show the contrast filling the pulmonary vessels, appearing as bright white. Any mass filling defects, such as an embolus, will appear dark in place of the contrast, filling/blocking the space where blood should be flowing into the lungs. Diagnostic use Pulmonary emboli can be classified according to level along the pulmonary arterial tree. CT pulmonary angiogram showing segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli on both sides. CTPA was introduced in the 1990s as an alternative to ventilation/perfusion scanning (V/Q scan), which relies on radionuclide imaging of the blood vessels of the lung. It is regarded as a highly sensitive and specific test for pulmonary embolism. CTPA is typically only requested if pulmonary embolism is suspected clinically. If the probability of PE is considered low, a blood test called D-dimer may be requested. If this is negative and risk of a PE is considered negligible, then CTPA or other scans are generally not performed. Most patients will have undergone a chest X-ray before CTPA is requested. After initial concern that CTPA would miss smaller emboli, a 2007 study comparing CTPA directly with V/Q scanning found that CTPA identified more emboli without increasing the risk of long-term complications compared to V/Q scanning. A V/Q scan may still be recommended when a lower radiation dose is required. On CTPA, acute emboli have been found at radiodensities ranging between about 5 and 65 Hounsfield units (HU), while chronic emboli have ranged between about 30 and 150. Contraindications CTPA is less desirable in pregnancy due to the amount of ionizing radiation required, which may damage the breasts, which are particularly sensitive during pregnancy, and because of concerns of the effects of iodine on the fetus' thyroid gland. V/Q scans can offer lower radiation doses, and may be adapted to further reduce the dose by omitting the lung ventilation portion of the exam. They are therefore recommended to be preferentially applied to pregnant patients. Diagnostic algorithms for pulmonary embolism in pregnancy vary; however, a common compromise is to perform ultrasound testing for deep vein thrombosis of the legs, and if this is positive, make the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism on the basis of symptoms and presence of the DVT. CTPA would then only be performed if exhaustive non- radiation based testing could not make a positive diagnosis. CTPA is contraindicated in known or suspected allergy to contrast media or in kidney failure (where contrast agents could worsen the kidney function). Acquisition The best results are obtained using multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scanners. An intravenous cannula is required for the administration of iodinated contrast. The typical dose is 30-40 g of iodine (corresponding to 20–30 cc of 370 mg/ml iodine solution). However, for patients at high risk of contrast-induced nephropathy, it is possible to reduce the required amount of contrast using dual energy CT. With such a protocol, only 7–10 g of iodine (20–30 cc of 370 mg/ml iodine solution) may be needed. Many hospitals use bolus tracking, where the scan commences when the contrast is detected at the level of the proximal pulmonary arteries. If this is done manually, scanning commences about 10–12 seconds after the injection has started. Slices of 1–3 mm. are performed at 1–3 mm. intervals, depending on the nature of the scanner (single- versus multidetector). State of the art modern CT scanners with a scan rate of up to 320 mm/s can acquire all the images within a 1-second X-ray exposure, avoiding the problems of respiratory motion, cardiac motion and contrast draining from the pulmonary circulation during the study. Even though the actual scan may be completed in 1 second or less, considerable staff and patient time is required for preparation of the contrast agent, positioning on the scanner and planning the scan. This is particularly the case, as patients undergoing CTPA are frequently seriously unwell requiring oxygen treatment and/or close monitoring. Interpretation On CTPA, the pulmonary vessels are filled with contrast, and appear white. Any mass filling defects (embolus or other matter such as fat) appears darker. Ideally, the scan should be complete before the contrast reaches the left side of the heart and the aorta, as this may mean contrast has drained from the pulmonary arteries, or require a larger dose of contrast media.

The series was based mostly on the 1963 Astro Boy anime series, but began to include elements from the 1980 series in later issues. The comic went through three writers and artists, and embellished the original plotline, despite only covering the first episode of the 1963 series. Main story The series begins with Dr. Boynton (Doctor Tenma) putting together Astro Boy, and immediately adopting him under the name \\"Astor.\\" After only a few days, Boynton becomes fed up with Astro's cold, unchildlike behavior, and plans to shut down and discard him. However, Astro begins to discover that he has powers and was based on Boynton's dead son. In the meantime, the army attempts to capture Astro, as it is hinted that Boynton borrowed money from the military and couldn't repay them. Dr. Elefun (Professor Ochanomizu) is also trying to find Astro, as well as keep the Institute of Science under control. Astro is sold to the circus with an implanted robot named Bruno (a sentient bomb looking like a spider), where he discovers his fellow robots are constantly in anguish. From there, Astro is pulled into the middle of the robot rights revolution. This story was covered in issues 1-10. Megathreat Following the end of the initial storyline, issue 12 focused on the president of a large company called Megacorp hiring a cloaked figure named Agent R to lure in and destroy Astro. Agent R (shown later to be Lance Lumiere, former Institute of Science researcher) used a bulky robot named 'Megathreat' to kidnap a boy named Archie from Astro's school. Archie happens to be the Megacorp president's son, and the plan begins to fail. Astro, in the meantime, is recovering from an internal overload after saving a police car from sinking in the bay. Despite Elefun's warning, Astro goes out to save Archie, destroys Megathreat and earns the Megacorp president's respect. The Cybot Arc This was the point in the series when Brian Thomas took over as the main artist, adopting Astro's 1980 character design. Issues 16-18 featured Astro going on a rocket to space, with General Hawkins hoping to find out the reason for multiple shuttle disappearances around a certain area. As Astro and the flight crew prepare to depart, Astro Girl hides on board, with Dr. I.Q. Plenty and Spud doing the same. Dr. Boynton appears one last time and gives Astro a special back-up battery cell, but warns Astro not to let it overload. While in space, the ship is attacked by a grotesque monster, and crashes on the planet of the Cybots. Astro and the crew are dragged to the palace of King Cosmo, the leader of the Cybots. The Cybots, as it was hinted in earlier issues, were a brand of extremely advanced androids who faced human discrimination and were forced to flee to space. King Cosmo finds Astro Girl and orders his men to destroy her, forcing Astro to fight them. After Astro tells Cosmo that humans and robots are equals now, he explodes from the overloading battery. While I.Q. and the shuttle crew try to repair Astro, King Cosmo announces that the population of Cybots will be returning to Earth, along with the members of the previously captured ships. The series The Astro Boy license was sold to Tony C. Caputo by a \\"Japanese national\\", whom actually had no legal access to Tezuka's characters. (Since the bankruptcy of Mushi Production in 1973, and due to the ensuing court- ordered settlement, ownership of Tezuka's copyrights came into question and would not be resolved for almost thirty years.Schodt, Frederik L.; The Astro Boy Essays: Osamu Tezuka, Mighty Atom, and the Manga/Anime Revolution Pages 95 and 96 Stone Bridge Press (2007) ) This person is only credited as Suzuki & Associates in the fine print of most issues. Brian Thomas was originally assigned as the lead artist in 1987, with Ken Steacy as the cover artist, but Steacy offered to do full-colour artwork and be paid in Canadian dollars. Ken Steacy became the artist until issue #16 and writer for issues #8-17, before Brian Thomas took over fully. Sales rose, but the series was cancelled after NOW! Comics got a deal for newsstand distribution for all of their titles. While dedicating itself to the 1960s anime's continuum, the first nine issues were a longer, drawn-out version of only the anime's first episode. Despite taking quite a few elements and character designs from the 1980s series, the editors claimed that the then-newer anime \\"did not stand up to (the) old black-and-white version\\". The comic possessed a greater level of war and robot-to-human violence, greatly differing from Osamu Tezuka's original morals. The comic seemed to be intended for an older audience until halfway through the series, when Michael Dimpsey left NOW Comics and Ken Steacy became the main writer. After this change of writers, there were a string of light stand-alone plots, going until the cancellation of the series. Characters * Dr. Boynton - Astro's creator and \\"father\\". Boynton went slightly insane, following his divorce and the death of his son Astor, and became a recluse. He built Astro as a replacement for his son, but soon became disappointed with the result. Boynton clashes with Astro Boy constantly, at one point putting a tracker named Bruno in Astro and selling him to a circus. Later on, he appears to regret his actions, and secretly shows up to help Astro. He is based directly on the character Dr. Tenma. * Dr. Elefun - A scientist vying for Boynton's role as Director of the Institute, whom later saves Astro from the robot circus. In addition to teaching and taking care of Astro for a few issues, he enrolls Astro in school and builds him two parents and a sister. He is directly based on Professor Ochanomizu. * Mr. Cacciatore - The ringmaster and owner of the Robot Circus. He buys Astro from Dr. Boynton and sets him through various jobs and dangerous stunts in the circus, threatening to activate a robot spider bomb that Boynton has implanted in Astro's chest cabinet. He is directly based on Osamu Tezuka's character Ham Egg. * General Hawkins - A short, portly woman in charge of the local army base. Before the current storyline, Hawkins lends money to Boynton to help with building Astro. However, she expected Astro to be able to work with the military, and tries to recapture him at the cost of destroying a neighborhood. * Tas Tamil - A man at the Institute of Science who is attempting to take Boynton's place as director. Tas begins working with General Hawkins and Cacciatore. Despite being much more meeker and scheming, he is based directly on the character Duke Red. * Bruno - A robotic spider built by Boynton, which is a combined tracker and bomb. It is connected to a remote, and designed to give a disobedient Astro an electric shock at the push of a button. * Simon - A male android at the Robot Circus. He befriends Astro immediately, and tells him of the horrible conditions he and the robots are in. Simon, later on, attempts to remove Bruno from Astro's system, but Bruno detonates in Simon's hand and kills him. * Rebecca and Elmer - Two researchers at the Institute of Science. Elmer pines after Rebecca, only to neutral response from her. Late into the 10th issue, they are killed by a creature called the Cyber Shark, but rebuilt by Elefun as robots. They then go to live with Astro as his parents. The whole time, they look identical to Astro's robot parents in the 1980s series. * Astro Girl - Astro's sister, built and given to him by Dr. Elefun. She is very much identical-looking to her animated version, there known as Uran. She is much more curious and willing to get into trouble. * Dr. I.Q. Plenty - A short, arrogant scientist who tries to become the new leader of the Institute of Science. He is pushy and indignant about becoming the director, and on the side, he attempts to woo Rebecca. I.Q. lives alone, his only companion a dog named Spud, who wears a special collar that enables him to talk. I.Q. is based entirely on Dr. Fooler, an obscure character in Tezuka's manga. * Astor Boynton - Boynton's deceased son. Astor did not get a lot of character development, but he was shown to be an energetic and loving boy. He sees firsthand the divorce of Boynton and his wife Jean.

Many bleeding control techniques are taught as part of first aid throughout the world, though some more advanced techniques such as tourniquets, are often taught as being reserved for use by health professionals, or as an absolute last resort, to mitigate associated risks, such as potential loss of limbs. To manage bleeding effectively, it is important to be able to readily identify types of wounds and types of bleeding.  Types of wounds  Wounds are normally described in a variety of ways. Descriptions may include wound size (length) and thickness; plainly visible wound characteristics such as shape and open or closed; and origin, acute or chronic. The most common descriptors of wounds are these: * Incision: Straight edges to the wound margins, as if sliced with a knife. These can vary in size, and may be caused by a variety of objects, including a scalpel, a knife, any piece of straight, sharp metal, or a piece of glass. Tissue is rarely missing from the wound site, and the margins of the wound may be easily matched from one side of the wound to the other for the purposes of closure. * Laceration: Jagged edges to the wound margins, more closely resembling a tear than a slice. The direction of the wound is random rather than straight, and it may have multiple branches. Most often caused by an object with a broken or serrated edge, such as a piece of broken glass or metal, but may also be caused by a blow from a blunt object to tissue with bone immediately behind it. * Puncture: Sharp object penetrates the tissue and travels inward, but does not move laterally in any direction from the point of entry. Such wounds can be misleading, as they may appear quite small on surface examination, but extend quite deeply into the body, even damaging nerves, blood vessels, or internal organs. They may cause substantial internal bleeding or secondary injuries, such as a collapsed lung, which may not be readily evident during primary assessment. Occasionally, the object causing the injury remains in the wound as an impaled object. A stab wound from a knife or other sharp object, or a bullet wound, are examples of this type of injury. Medical professionals usually refer to this type of wound as penetrating trauma. * Abrasion: A scraping or scratching. Generally quite superficial, and affecting only the surface layers of the epidermis. No internal organs, nerves, or blood vessels other than capillaries, are affected. This may be the result of a fall, or of sliding (friction) against rough surfaces. The road rash often suffered by falling motorcyclists is an example of this type of wound. * Contusion: Simple bruising. In this type of injury, the capillaries in the epidermis and dermis are damaged, without breaking the skin.'Contusion' Merrian-Webster. Retrieved 24/01/2018 Blood oozes out of these vessels into the spaces between cells or interstitial space, causing swelling and discoloration. Blood loss is generally limited, and not of serious consequence. It may, however, act as a signpost, pointing to more serious injuries. * Avulsion: A full thickness laceration-type wound, often semi-circular in shape. This creates a flap that, when lifted, exposes the deeper tissues to view, or extrudes them from the wound itself. Avulsions often occur in mechanical accidents involving fingers (sometimes referred to as degloving), or, more seriously, may affect the orbit of the eye or the abdominal cavity, exposing the internal viscera. Avulsions are difficult to repair, and no avulsion should ever be considered a minor injury. * Amputation: Similar to, but distinct from, an avulsion. Whereas an avulsion is characterized by a \\"flap\\" of skin being removed, an amputation is characterized by a complete loss of a limb. This can occur at any point on the extremity, and is usually followed by significant arterial bleeding. However, as serious as this injury is, an amputated limb that is cooled and transported to the hospital can sometimes be surgically reattached.

The basic categories of external bleeding are: * Arterial bleeding: As the name suggests, blood flow originating in an artery. With this type of bleeding, the blood is typically bright red to yellowish in colour, due to the high degree of oxygenation. Blood typically exits the wound in spurts, rather than in a steady flow; the blood spurts out in time with the heartbeat. The amount of blood loss can be copious, and can occur very rapidly. * Venous bleeding: This blood is flowing from a damaged vein. As a result, it is blackish in colour (due to the lack of oxygen it transports) and flows in a steady manner. Caution is still indicated: while the blood loss may not be arterial, it can still be quite substantial, and can occur with surprising speed without intervention.Why Having a First Aid Kit is Important? * Capillary bleeding: Capillary bleeding usually occurs in superficial wounds, such as abrasions. The colour of the blood may vary somewhat (distal portion of circulation with oxygenated and unoxygenated blood mixing), and generally oozes in small amounts, as opposed to flowing or spurting. External wound management The type of wound (incision, laceration, puncture, etc.) has a major effect on the way a wound is managed, as does the area of the body affected and presence of any foreign objects in the wound. Key principles of wound management are:'Wound Care' The Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne. (2013). (Clinical Guidelines). Retrieved 24/01/2018 Elevation Elevation was commonly recommended for the control of haemorrhage. Some protocols continue to include it, but recent studies have failed to find any evidence of its effectiveness and it was removed from the PHTLS guidance in 2006. Direct pressure Placing pressure on the wound constricts the blood vessels manually, helping to stem blood flow. When applying pressure, the type and direction of the wound may have an effect, for instance, a cut lengthways on the hand would be opened up by closing the hand into a fist, whilst a cut across the hand would be sealed by making a fist. A patient can apply pressure directly to their own wound, if their consciousness level allows. Ideally a barrier, such as sterile, low-adherent gauze should be used between the pressure supplier and the wound, to help reduce chances of infection and help the wound to seal. Third parties assisting a patient are always advised to use protective latex or nitrile medical gloves to reduce risk of infection or contamination passing either way. Direct pressure can be used with some foreign objects protruding from a wound; padding is applied from each side of the object to push in and seal the wound - objects are never removed. Pressure points The arterial pressure points In situations where direct pressure and elevation are either not possible or proving ineffective, and there is a risk of exsanguination, some training protocols advocate the use of pressure points to constrict the major artery that feeds the point of the bleed. This is usually performed at a place where a pulse can be found, such as in the femoral artery. There are significant risks involved in performing pressure point constriction, including necrosis of the area below the constriction, and most protocols give a maximum time for constriction (often around 10 minutes). There is particularly high danger if constricting the carotid artery in the neck, as the brain is sensitive to hypoxia and brain damage can result within minutes of application of pressure. Pressure on the carotid artery can also cause vagal tone induced bradycardia, which can eventually stop the heart. Other dangers in use of a constricting method include rhabdomyolysis, which is a buildup of toxins below the pressure point, which if released back into the main bloodstream may cause kidney failure. =Epistaxis= :Epistaxis, or nosebleed, is a special case, where almost all first aid providers train the use of pressure points. The appropriate point here is on the soft fleshy part of the nose, which should constrict the capillaries sufficiently to stop bleeding, although obviously it does not stop bleeding from the nasopharynx or tear ducts. Tourniquet Another method of achieving constriction of the supplying artery is a tourniquet - a band tied tightly around a limb to restrict blood flow. Tourniquets are routinely used to bring veins to the surface for cannulation, though their use in emergency medicine is more limited. Tourniquet use is restricted in most countries to professionals such as physicians and paramedics, as this is often considered beyond the reach of first aid and those acting in good faith as a good samaritan. A key exception is the military, where many armies carry a tourniquet as part of their personal first aid kit. Improvised tourniquets, in addition to creating potential problems for the ongoing medical management of the patient, usually fail to achieve force enough to adequately compress the arteries of the limb. As a result, they not only fail to stop arterial bleeding, but may actually increase bleeding by impairing venous bloodflow. Clotting agents Some protocols call for the use of clotting accelerating agents, which can be either externally applied as a powder or gel, or pre-dosed in a dressing or as an intravenous injection. These may be particularly useful in situations where the wound is not clotting, which can be due to external factors, such as size of wound, or medical factors such as haemophilia. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is not, as of 2012, supported by the evidence for most cases of major bleeding. Its use brings a significant risk of arterial thrombosis, and therefore it should only be used in clinical trials or with patients with factor VII deficiency. Internal wound management Internal wounds (usually to the torso) are harder to deal with than external wounds, although they often have an external cause. The key dangers of internal bleeding include hypovolaemic shock (leading to exsanguination), causing a tamponade on the heart or a haemothorax on the lung. The aortic aneurysm is a special case where the aorta, the body's main blood vessel, becomes ruptured through an inherent weakness, although exertion, raised blood pressure or sudden movements could cause a sudden catastrophic failure. This is one of the most serious medical emergencies a patient can face, as the only treatment is rapid surgery. In the event of bleeding caused by an external source (trauma, penetrating wound), the patient is usually inclined to the injured side, so that the 'good' side can continue to function properly, without interference from the blood inside the body cavity. Treatment of internal bleeding is beyond the scope of simple first aid, and a person giving first aid should consider it potentially life-threatening. The definitive treatment for internal bleeding is always surgical treatment, and medical advice must be sought urgently for any victim of internal bleeding.

It is a member of the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL). The Hoosier Lottery sells scratch-off tickets; its draw games include Mega Millions, Hoosier Lotto, Powerball, Cash 5, and Poker Lotto. The Hoosier Lottery is based in the state capital of Indianapolis, with regional offices in Mishawaka and Evansville. Indiana was among those states participating in the short-lived multi-state draw game Monopoly Millionaires' Club from October 19 to December 26, 2014. History In early American history, legislators commonly established lotteries to fund schools, roads, and other public works. The government of the Indiana Territory in 1807 chartered Vincennes University, authorizing it to raise up to $20,000 in a lottery, to provide for a library and other facilities. The lottery was a failure; after a year, those few tickets that had been sold were recalled. Another lottery was authorized in 1810 to raise $1,000 to buy books for a library in Vincennes, but it was unsuccessful. Another was authorized in 1818 for the Jeffersonville Ohio Canal Company to raise $100,000, but it only brought in $2,536. The 1840s and 1850s saw a general movement against lotteries in the United States, partly on moral grounds, and partly due to a backlash against legislative corruption. The Indiana constitutional convention of 1851 adopted, with little debate, a clause that \\"no lottery shall be authorized; nor shall the sale of lottery tickets be allowed\\". Vincennes University moved to revive its lottery in 1879, arguing successfully in a test case before the Indiana Supreme Court that, under the Contracts Clause, the lottery provision of the 1807 charter could not be revoked, even by a constitutional ban. The U.S. Supreme Court soon rejected a similar argument in Stone v. Mississippi, but Vincennes was able to run its lottery as a policy game, contracted out to a group of experienced lottery operators from Kentucky, for over a year before it was ruled unlawful in 1883. In 1988, state voters approved by 62 percent a constitutional amendment lifting the ban. Indiana legislators authorized the state lottery, along with parimutuel betting on horse racing, in May 1989. The first scratch- off game, Hoosier Millionaire, went on sale in October. Lotto Cash, the first online game, began in April 1990. Record in-house jackpot The drawing on November 7, 2007 had a jackpot of $54.5 million, its largest jackpot ever. Retired steel worker Peter Gilbert of East Chicago, Indiana chose the cash option of $40.4 million rather than the 30 annual payments.http://www.in.gov/hoosierlottery/main/media_room/pressdata.asp?pressid=1377 There were no jackpot winners since October 21, 2006, so the grand prize broke its previous jackpot record of $42 million set June 5, 1999. Current Games In-house draw games Daily 3 Daily 3 is a daily pick 3 game that began in 1990. Prices, prizes and types of play vary. Daily 3 is drawn 14 times weekly. Daily 4 Daily 4 also began in 1990. Prices, prizes and types of play vary. Daily 4 is drawn 14 times weekly. Cash 5 Cash 5 is a $1-per-play draw game, where players must match from 2-5 of their 5 selected numbers from a field of 45 in order to win. Numbers are drawn 7 nights a week. Quick Draw Quick Draw is daily; games cost $1 each. Players choose 10 numbers from 1-80. The Lottery draws 20 numbers. Matching any 10 of the 20 numbers wins $300,000. This game is very similar to Keno. Hoosier Lotto Hoosier Lotto was the first Indiana lottery game. The draw held on Wednesday and Saturdays, and uses a 6/46 matrix. The jackpots begin at $1 million; after two drawings without a winner, the jackpot increases by $100,000 per draw. Games cost $2 each. For an extra $1, the add-on feature called +Plus add one more chance to win $1 million. Multi-jurisdictional games Cash4Life The Hoosier lottery joined Cash4Life on September 19, 2016. (The game also is available in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia.) Players choose 5 of 60 numbers in one field, and 1 of 4 green \\"Cash Ball\\" numbers in the second field. Live drawings are held on Monday and Thursday evenings at 9pm Eastern Time on Livestream. The top prize (win or share) $1,000-per-day-for-life. Second prize is $1,000-per-week-for-life. Mega Millions On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball in U.S. lottery jurisdictions. On January 31, 2010, the Hoosier Lottery began selling Mega Millions tickets. Powerball Since 1990, the Hoosier Lottery has been a MUSL member. Powerball began in 1992. Powerball's jackpots currently start at $40 million; it is drawn Wednesday and Saturday nights. Retired Games Lucky 5 Lucky 5 was replaced by Cash 5 on November 3, 2012. Mix & Match Mix & Match was drawn on Tuesday and Friday evenings. For each Mix & Match ticket, players received three lines of five numbers each; one play cost $2. Five numbers from 1-50 were drawn. There were multiple ways of winning. Players could have matched the 5 numbers across a three line set to win up to $5,000; or matched all five numbers on a single line to win $200,000. The game was retired on August 22, 2014. Poker Lotto With a cost of $2 per play, Poker Lotto is a combination of both instant and draw games. All picks are computer generated \\"quick picks\\", as the first half of the game is won by the player being \\"dealt\\" a winning poker hand on their ticket. (Pair of Jacks or better, grand prize $5,000). Regardless of a win or loss on the instant game, the player's ticket is eligible for the nightly draw, where the player's cards must match at least 2 of the drawn cards in order to win. (Grand prize $250,000). Poker Lotto began selling tickets on August 25, 2013. The game's end date is unknown.

Aitken was with the Greenock club for only two games before being signed by Clyde on 14 June 2000. He made his first team debut for Clyde on 5 August 2000 against Falkirk and went on to make a further 23 appearances for Clyde. Aitken scored his first goal of his professional career against Airdrie on 22 November 2000. Aitken stayed with Clyde for just over a season before returning to play for Greenock Morton on 10 November 2001. He made his second debut for Morton on 10 November 2001 against Forfar Athletic. Aitken remained with Greenock Morton for two seasons making 19 appearances for the club, before signing for Hamilton Academical in June 2003. Hamilton Aitken made his debut for Hamilton and scored his first goal on 2 August 2003 against St Johnstone in the Scottish League Challenge Cup. He went on to make over 50 league appearances, scoring 8 goals for the club during his time there, before he signed for Stirling Albion on 31 January 2005. Stirling Aitken made his debut for Stirling Albion against Dumbarton on 5 February 2005. Aitken scored his first goal for Stirling Albion against Brechin City on 26 February 2005. Since signing in 2005, Aitken went on to make over 90 league appearances, scoring over 30 goals for the Binos. Aitken was awarded the Players Player of the Year award for the 2006–07 season. He was made captain of the Stirlingshire side and at the end of the 2007–08 season, Aitken won the Stirling Albion supporters club player of the year award and the Stirling Albion supporters Trust award. Aitken was the leading goal scorer for Stirling Albion in the 2007–08 season. In May 2008, after Stirling Albion were relegated to the Scottish Second Division, Aitken agreed a two-year deal with Second Division rivals Ayr United, stating that Ayr's ambition is what drew him to Somerset Park. Ayr In May 2008, Aitken became Ayr's eighth signing since the end of the 2007–08 season. Chris is widely recognised as one of the best penalty kick taker's in Scottish football, having only missed two out of 40 attempts. He played a major part in Ayr's playoff success in the 2008–09 season, scoring three goals against Brechin and captaining the side all the way to the First division. On 13 January 2010, Chris, by mutual agreement, had his contract ended, and signed for former club Stirling Albion. Stirling (second spell) Aitken made his second début for the Beanos in a 3–3 draw with East Fife on 23 January 2010. Three goals in his first two games back in an Albion shirt showed that Chris was just as potent a goal threat as ever. It was announced he was to be released from 15 May 2011. Stranraer After his release he joined Stranraer for the 2011–12 season, signing a deal in May 2011. Aitken spent 5 seasons with Stranraer before retiring at the end of the 2015–16 season. Coaching career After being involved with first- team coaching with Stranraer during the 2015–16 season, Aitken was appointed assistant manager to Brian Reid shortly after announcing his retirement. After Reid left the club by mutual consent in January 2017, Aitken was made interim manager until Reid's successor could be appointed. Not long after this, former Blues assistant Stephen Farrell was named the new manager of Stranraer, taking up the position following on 23 January 2017. Aitken remained as interim manager for the Scottish Cup match against Aberdeen, which the side lost 4–0, before returning to his previous position as assistant manager.

He is best known for his development and application of hierarchical linear models (HLM) in the field of education but he has also published on other subjects such as health and crime. Hierarchical linear models, which go by many other names, are used to study many natural processes. To use an example from education, a three level hierarchical model might account for the fact that students are nested in classrooms which are nested in schools. With the right data one could go further and note that schools are nested in districts which are nested in states. Repeated measures of the same individuals can be studied with these models as observations nested in people. Raudenbush received an Ed.D. in Policy Analysis and Evaluation Research in 1984 from Harvard University. In subsequent years he made major contributions to education research. His work has earned him numerous honors. In 2006, he was awarded both the “Distinguished Contributions to Research in Education Award” and the “Robert Park Award,” for outstanding work in community and urban sociology.

Theming is increasingly used to create physical spaces for \\"experiential marketing,” in which consumers can connect and interact with a brand.Experiential Marketing, Defined — and Examples to Inspire You.

Examples include theme parks, water parks, museums, zoos, visitor centers, casinos, theme restaurants, and resorts.About Us. Themed Entertainment Association. Retrieved 2018-03-02. Theming is also increasingly used on smaller scale projects, including parties and product launches, to make these events more impactful. Common themes include holidays (such as Christmas and Valentine’s Day), historical eras (such as the Medieval Period and the American frontier), cultures (such as Ancient Greece and Polynesian culture), and literary genres (such as Fantasy and Science fiction). History Theming has been used in public spaces at least as far back as the World’s Fairs of the Nineteenth Century. Professor Susan Ingram argues that the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London was, in effect, the world’s first theme park, utilizing theming to further its pro-industrial message, and reproducing foreign lands as spectacle.The Historical Development of Themed Space: Susan Ingram on Industrial Europe and the Commodification of Leisure.

The forerunners to today’s themed mega-resorts were the El Rancho Vegas, opened in 1941, and the Last Frontier, opened in 1942, the first two properties on the Las Vegas Strip, both with Wild West themes. They were followed by even more elaborately themed hotels, including Caesars Palace in 1966 and Circus Circus in 1968. The term “theme park” came into use circa 1960, likely to describe the many parks built across the United States and around the world following the successful opening of Disneyland in 1955. Though arguably not the first theme park, Disneyland was the first amusement park to combine multiple named areas (“lands”) with different themes.

Criticism As perhaps the best known example of theming, the theme park Disneyland has often been a target for criticism. In his overwhelmingly negative review, Disneyland and Las Vegas, published in The Nation upon the opening of the park, writer Julian Halevy lamented: Noted author Ray Bradbury responded with a letter to the editor, published three years later, titled Not Child Enough: Another notable criticism of theming, again targeting Disneyland and its guests, can be found in French sociologist Jean Baudrillard’s 1981 treatise Simulacra and Simulation: Along with Baudrillard, the Italian writer Umberto Eco helped develop the idea of “hyperreality,” or the world of \\"the Absolute Fake,\\" in which imitations don't merely reproduce reality, but try to improve on it.Traveling Through Hyperreality With Umberto Eco.

Eco traveled to tourist attractions across the United States and wrote frequently about \\"America's obsession with simulacra and counterfeit reality.” More recently, concerns have been raised about theming’s role in influencing consumers, sometimes subconsciously, as part of experiential retailing or “shoppertainment.” Kim Einhorm, director of Theme Traders, points out that “theming becomes an invisible form of branding.” Indeed, because theming has become such a commonplace aspect of so many people’s everyday lives, the public is often unwilling or unable to effectively understand its consequences. Some have even argued that the growth of experiential marketing is contributing to a degraded quality of life by eliminating “contemplative time.”Antonella Carù and Bernard Cova, “A Critical Approach To Experiential Consumption: Fighting Against The Disappearance Of The Contemplative Time”.

This silver idol that resembles the main deity represents the presiding officer for all activities and rituals in the temple. Koluvu Srinivasa is regarded as the guardian deity of the temple and presides over all its financial and economic affairs. The idol is also called as Bali Bera. The duties of the Bali Bera closely resemble that of the householder. He manages the finances and accounts, and his permission is sought before offering Bali to Nityasuris like Garuda, Hanuman and Vishvaksena on the Balipeetham. There is no recorded history of the deity leaving the innermost 16-pillared hall (Tirumamani Mantapam). There is no reference in the temple of when the idol was obtained, its identity or the start of rituals involving the idol. Daily Seva: Koluvu After the morning Thomala Seva or (Abhishekam (on Fridays), the accounts of the previous day is closed and submitted to the lord. This ritual is called Koluvu and is also called Durbar. Koluvu Srinivasa is brought to the Tirumamani mantapam (inside the sanctum sanctorum) and seated on a silver- plated chair with a canopy of gilt umbrella presented by the Maharajah of Mysore. This ritual is conducted in Ekantam, and only the priests and TTD officials are present. The following rituals are held: * Mixture of fried gingelly seeds and jaggery is offered to the Lord. * Texts from the Vedas, Vishnu Suktam and Tamil Divya Prabandhams are read. * Then the Lord is requested to listen to the Panchangam (almanac) when the priest says, \\"PanchAngam AgamyatAm\\". Panchangam (day's calendar) is read to the Lord with the activities that will be undertaken for the day as well as activities of the next day. Details of festivals and observances in the Tirumala temple and those at the temples of Govindaraja Swami and Kodandarama Swami at Tirupati, Padmavathi Devi at Tiruchanur, Sri Kalahastiswara at Sri Kalahasti and several other nearby temples are read out. * A TTD official then reads out the previous day's hundi collection details with the date, morning collection, afternoon collection and the loose change that was collected. These details do not include donations, Arjitham and other sources of income. At the end, it is declared that the total amount has been credited to Srivari's Bhandaram. * Matradana: The archakas (priests) who recited the slokas and Prabandhams are awarded rice, ginger and rations. Yearly Seva: Pushpa Pallaki  At the end of the financial year (falling in July), Anivara Asthanam is a procedure performed where yearly records are submitted to the Lord. Along with the previous year's accounts, insignia of office for all principal officers are submitted to the Lord and take them back to signify that the Lord finds them fit to hold their respective offices. New books are issued for recording financials of the next year. At the end of the event, thambulam is issued by the presiding priest to all principal officers signifying the Lord's pleasure with the temple officers. The above ritual is done in ekanta (private) and is not open to the public. After the ritual, the utsava murti with his consorts (Malayappa swami) are taken in a palanquin decorated with flowers; this ceremony is open to public.

It is routinely and incorrectly labeled as \\"methylmalonyl-CoA racemase\\". It is not a racemase because the CoA moiety has 5 other stereocenters.  Structure  The \\"MCEE\\" gene is located in the 2p13 region and contains 4 exons, and encodes for a protein that is approximately 18 kDa in size and located to the mitochondrial matrix. Several natural variants in amino acid sequences exist. The structure of the MCEE protein has been resolved by X-ray crystallography at 1.8-angstrom resolution.  Function  The MCEE gene encodes an enzyme that interconverts D- and L- methylmalonyl-CoA during the degradation of branched-chain amino acids, odd chain-length fatty acids, and other metabolites. In biochemistry terms, it catalyzes the reaction that converts (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA to the (R) form. This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction : (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA \\\\rightleftharpoons (R)-methylmalonyl-CoA Methylmalonyl CoA epimerase plays an important role in the catabolism of fatty acids with odd-length carbon chains. In the catabolism of even-chain saturated fatty acids, the β-oxidation pathway breaks down fatty acyl-CoA molecules in repeated sequences of four reactions to yield one acetyl CoA per repeated sequence. This means that, for each round of β-oxidation, the fatty acyl-Co-A is shortened by two carbons. If the fatty acid began with an even number of carbons, this process could break down an entire saturated fatty acid into acetyl-CoA units. If the fatty acid began with an odd number of carbons, however, β-oxidation would break the fatty acyl-CoA down until the three carbon propionyl-CoA is formed. In order to convert this to the metabolically useful succinyl-CoA, three reactions are needed. The propionyl- CoA is first carboxylated to (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA by the enzyme Propionyl-CoA carboxylase. Methylmalonyl CoA epimerase then catalyzes the rearrangement of (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA to the (R) form in a reaction that uses a vitamin B12 cofactor and a resonance-stabilized carbanion intermediate. The (R)-methylmalonyl-CoA is then converted to succinyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Acting as a general base, the enzyme abstracts a proton from the β-carbon of (R)-methylmalonyl-CoA. This results in the formation of a carbanion intermediate in which the α-carbon is stabilized by resonance. The enzyme then acts as a general acid to protonate the β-carbon, resulting in the formation of (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the MCEE gene causes methymalonyl-CoA epimerase deficiency (MCEED), a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism in amino acid metabolisms involving branched-chain amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine. Patients with MCEED may present with life-threatening neonatal metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, feeding difficulties, and coma.

Biography LeConte was born in Liberty County, Georgia, to Louis Le Conte, patriarch of the noted LeConte family. He attended Franklin College at the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens, where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society and graduated in 1838. His younger brother Joseph LeConte also attended the University. Like many of his immediate relatives, John LeConte next studied medicine at the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons and earned his M.D. in 1842. During this time, LeConte married Eleanor Josephine Graham. He practiced medicine until 1846 when he returned to UGA as a professor of physics and chemistry and taught there until his resignation in 1855. His next academic position was at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, as professor of physics and chemistry from 1856 until 1869. In March 1869, he moved to Oakland, California, to join the faculty of the newly established University of California as a professor of physics. In June 1869, he was appointed acting president of the University, serving until Henry Durant became the president in 1870. In September 1869, his brother Joseph LeConte arrived in California to join the faculty of the University as a professor of geology. Upon the resignation of President Gilman in March 1875, LeConte was appointed acting president a second time until June, 1876, when he was elected president. On June 7, 1881, LeConte tendered his resignation as president of the University, asking to be returned to his faculty position. LeConte died at his home in Berkeley, on April 29, 1891, while still active as a professor of physics.  Contributions to physics  LeConte contributed major discoveries to physics throughout the 19th century. In 1858, he demonstrated that flames are sensitive to sound \\"On the Influence of Musical Sounds on the Flame of a Jet of Coal Gas,\\" [American Journal of Science], 2nd series 23 (1858): 62-67 and in 1864, LeConte successfully measured the speed of sound.

In one instance he actually transmitted the virus. Born in Cape Town, South Africa, Parenzee moved to Adelaide, Australia at the age of 15, becoming a chef and settling in Port Pirie.Independent Weekly In January 2006, he was convicted on 3 counts of endangering life; the basis of the conviction was that he had unprotected sex with three women over a period of several years, despite being aware of the transmissibility of HIV, and had transmitted HIV to one of them.Supreme Court of South Australia: R v. Parenzee. Decision on appeal, dated 27 April 2007. Accessed 9 May 2007. In March 2006, Parenzee appealed his conviction, claiming that the existence and virulence of HIV have not been proven. He was supported by testimony from Valendar Turner and Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos, two AIDS denialists from The Perth Group who question the existence of HIV. A number of prominent researchers, including Robert Gallo, testified to the scientific consensus that HIV exists and causes AIDS. Ultimately, the judge rejected the qualifications and testimony of the AIDS dissident witnesses, finding that there is \\"no longer any genuine scientific dispute\\" that HIV exists and causes AIDS.\\"Shadow of Doubters\\" (5 May 2007) Sydney Morning Herald, Accessed 9 May 2007. Parenzee's appeal was denied. Parenzee's lawyer, Kevin Borick, stated that he planned to appeal to a three judge panel.  Circumstances of the case  The first woman involved, known in court documents as \\"Ms KC\\", bore Parenzee two children (one in 1990 and one in 1994). Parenzee was diagnosed HIV positive on 21 September 1998; he married Ms KC on 7 November 1998, keeping his diagnosis from her, and continuing to have unprotected sex with her. They separated in 2000, at which time Parenzee began cohabiting with \\"Ms SMC\\", a mother of two, and having unprotected sexual intercourse with her. In July 2001 Parenzee was hospitalized with what he falsely claimed to be cancer, and Parenzee's sister informed Ms SMC that in fact, Parenzee was HIV positive. Ms SMC took an HIV test of her own at that time and was determined to be HIV positive on 20 July 2001. Ms KC did not learn of Parenzee's diagnosis until 21 July 2003, at a hearing over access to their children. She testified that when confronted, he stated that he \\"did not give a shit about making [Ms SMC] ill.\\" The third victim, referred to as \\"Ms JB\\", had sexual intercourse with Parenzee from September to October 2004. Ms KC let her know that Parenzee was HIV positive by phone on 19 November 2004. Parenzee told her that was a lie; however JB confirmed it was true with Parenzee's mother, and by obtaining documentation from KC.  Court proceedings  Parenzee's request to try the cases separately was denied.Regina v. Parenzee (2 May 2006) SASC 127, Supreme Court of South Australia He was tried and convicted on 3 counts of endangering human life on 31 January 2006. His lawyers appealed the case to the Supreme Court of South Australia, claiming a miscarriage of justice, on the basis that there was no proof that HIV existed, could be sexually transmitted, caused AIDS, or could be tested for. At the hearing, the lawyers tried to present two members of the Perth Group, Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos and Valendar Francis Turner, as expert witnesses in support of their claims. David Albert Cooper, Martyn Andrew Haydon French, Elizabeth Mara Dax, Dominic Edmund Dwyer, David Llewellyn Gordon, John Martin Kaldor, Robert Gallo, and Peter James McDonald were expert witnesses testifying against the claims. The presiding Justice John Sulan found that Papadopulos-Eleopulos lacked training and expertise in the field of biology, and had misrepresented the positions of others in her testimony. His finding was that: Justice Sulan also found that \\"her qualifications do not provide her with the academic study required to give opinions on medical and scientific matters unrelated to nuclear physics.\\" He further noted that she had no practical experience or formal qualifications in virology, epidemiology, electron microscopy, biology or immunology. The judge found that: Regarding the Perth Group, the judge found that the Perth Group will use whatever means available to promote debate, including encouragement of persons such as the applicant, to promote their theories in courts of law. Regarding Dr. Turner, the judge found that his knowledge of the subject matter is limited to reading. \\"He has no formal qualifications to give expert opinions about the virus. He has no practical experience in the treatment of viral diseases. He has no practical experience in the disciplines of virology, immunology or epidemiology.\\" Despite the inadmissibility of Turner & Papadopulos-Eleopulos's testimony, the Judge chose to consider the claims of the defence that HIV did not exist, that it was not sexually transmissible, that it did not cause AIDS, and that tests for HIV were unreliable.  Findings  The judge found that, contrary to Turner & Papadopulos-Eleopulos's assertions:\\"Judge dismisses claim HIV does not exist\\" (27 April 2007) Brisbane Times # HIV has been isolated # HIV exists and is identifiable. # There is no longer any genuine scientific dispute about that proposition. # Electron micrographs of HIV exist. # The genetic testing which has been developed is specific and accurate for the identification of HIV # Endogenous retroviral sequences are distinguishable from HIV # The method for testing for HIV is extremely rigorous and is highly specific and sensitive, and provides a scientific basis for establishing HIV infection # Antibody tests which are used throughout the world accurately test for the virus HIV. # There is overwhelming evidence that HIV can be and is transmitted by sexual intercourse, including heterosexual contact # HIV causes AIDS # Though there is disagreement about the mechanism, HIV causes the depletion of CD4 cells and causes the breakdown of the immune system, resulting in the various diseases which are defined as AIDS-related diseases The judge also denied an extension of time to appeal on the basis that the woman who seroconverted after having sex with Parenzee might have contracted the virus elsewhere, citing studies demonstrating the similarities of the infective strains. In September 2007, Parenzee was sentenced to nine years in prison. He will be eligible for parole in five years. The sentencing judge noted that, even at the time of sentencing, Parenzee had not yet come to terms with the damage he had wrought.\\"HIV sufferer jailed for unprotected sex\\" (28 September 2007) The Times, London In September 2008, South Australia's Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed Parenzee's application for an extension of time to appeal and his application for leave to appeal, finding both applications incompetent.\\"HIV man loses appeal against conviction\\" (16 September 2008) The Sydney Morning Herald The finding was 2 to 1; the dissenter, Chief Justice John Doyle, said he would have granted leave to appeal, but would have rejected that final appeal anyway. An application to the High Court was expected; Parenzee was, with time off for good behaviour, eligible for parole in 2011. Imprisonment and compensation Parenzee was admitted to the Royal Adelaide Hospital in 2011. He was shackled to his bed there for eighteen days. He sued the South Australian government and obtained an out-of-court settlement in 2016. Because the settlement was for more than the minimum $10,000, the payment was quarantined and Parenzee's victims were eligible to make first claims were they to pursue an action to recover compensation.

His style combines roots, jazz, blues, classical, and folk. He has released albums of contemporary folk music, blues music, and of instrumental guitar music. In addition to his solo recordings and tours, he has frequently recorded and toured with many other musicians over the years, including Boo Hewerdine, Jim Henry, Guy Davis, Hans Theessink, Steve Tilston and Sloan Wainwright. Biography Williams was born in Statesboro, Georgia.https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/16/nyregion/music-allowing-his-guitar- to-sing.html In his late teens, he moved to Boston to pursue higher education and a career in music.https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/lake-county-news- sun/lifestyles/ct-lns-ent-brooks-williams-1019-story.html Williams began releasing music on his own label, Red Guitar Blue Music, in 1989, with an EP called Red Guitar Plays Blue; this EP was pressed on CD with additional unreleased recordings from the late '80s in 1993, under the same title and label. His first two \\"official\\" albums (North, Night-time) were also self- released under Red Guitar Blue Music. The albums from 1992-1997 were recorded under contract with Green Linnet Records, except for Ring Some Changes, which was released by Signature Sounds. Williams signed to Signature Sounds and released the albums listed from 1999–2003, except for Dead Sea Cafe, a compilation of Green Linnet-era recordings released by Silent Planet Records. In 2004, Williams returned to own Red Guitar Blue Music label, and has released albums exclusively in this way to the present, apart from Guitar Player, which was released through Solid Air Records. The first two albums, plus both versions of Red Guitar Plays Blue have been out of print for many years; in 2002, Williams selected favorite tracks from the first two albums for a best-of compilation on Red Guitar Blue Music called Acoustic Beginnings 1990-1991 which is now also out of print. In May 2006, Green Linnet Records was sold to Compass Records and four of those records are now available through their website. In recent years, Williams' music has been more heavily focused on the blues. Williams has relocated to England, and currently tours in both the UK and the US. In 2011, State of the Union, was a collaboration with the well-known British singer-songwriter Boo Hewerdine that was planned to be recorded in a total of 5 days. They finished in 1 1/2. Snake Oil captured the live energy between the two in concert. Brooks released two albums in 2016. The first, entitled My Turn Now, features Sally Barker on backing vocals, Richard Gates on electric bass and co-producer Chris Pepper on the drums. The second, Brooks' Blues, features a number of Williams's favourite blues songs including Robert Johnson's 'From Four Until Late', Memphis Slim's 'Mother Earth', Bessie Smith's 'Backwater Blues' and Willie McTell's 'Statesboro Blues'. Recorded 'old school' with just voice and guitar (acoustic, resonator and cigar box), live in the studio, using vintage mics and a creaky chair, Brooks’ Blues is a fitting homage to the music that has inspired this Statesboro, Georgia native since the day he was born. In November 2016, Brooks joined forces with the New York blues guitar legend Guy Davis for a UK tour entitled 'Inside The Delta', a showcase of the many varied styles of the blues. 2017 saw the release of a third 'State of the Union' album entitled 'The Saltwell Sessions' - another joint venture with Boo Hewerdine. In May 2018, Hans Theessink, Europe's number one blues journeyman, joined Brooks for an extensive tour of the UK. In July 2018, Williams released the album 'Lucky Star'. In February 2020, Brooks released the album 'Work My Claim', a celebration of his 30 years in the music business.

The springs are found at two separate locations on the high school campus. The larger is now closed off from the rest of the campus and is under the care of the Gabrielino/Tongva Springs Foundation. The other spring is located on the northeastern edge of the so-called Girls' Field. A third spring was located farther north, near Texas Avenue, but it ceased to flow during the 1940s when a local water company began drawing from the aquifer.The Chieftain (Yearbook), 1974 ed. Chumash-style 'Ap at the Springs History The name Kuruvungna, which means \\"a place where we are in the sun,\\" comes from the name of a village that was located at the site of the springs. The Portolá Expedition of 1769, one of the two expeditions that led to the founding of Los Angeles, camped at that village, while traveling along the route that would become known as El Camino Real. The Tongva gave them watercress, pashí (chia) and fresh water from the spring. The Tongva were described in unpublished diary of Juan Crespí, who traveled with the Portolá Expedition of 1769: > ... as we arrived and set up camp, six very friendly, compliant tractable > heathens came over, who had their little houses roofed with grass, the first > we have been seeing of this sort. Three of them came wearing a great deal of > paint; all of them, however unarmed. They brought four or six bowls of usual > seeds and good sage which they presented to our captain; on me they bestowed > a good sized string of the sort of beads that they all have, made of white > sea shells and red ones (though not very bright colored) that look to be > coral, though of a very inferior sort. The name Serra comes from Junípero Serra, the founder of the Alta California mission chain, who is reported to have said mass there. Crespi renamed the springs \\"San Gregorio\\" while visiting the Tongva village at the springs with the Portola Expedition in 1769, but the expedition soldiers called them \\"El Berrendo\\" after wounding a deer there. Later, around the turn of the 19th century, the two springs began to be called \\"The Tears of Santa Monica\\" because they brought to mind the weeping eyes of the saint as she cried for her erring son. \\"Santa Monica\\", as an official place name, was first recorded in 1827 on a grazing permit, next in 1828 when the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica was granted to Marques and Reyes. Later, in 1839, the name was used again for Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica when it was granted to Sepulveda and Machado. Kuruvungna Springs was included in this rancho, the first time it had been \\"owned\\" by anyone other than the indigenous inhabitants. Jose Delores Sepulveda, one of the sons of the rancho's owner, lived in the Sepulveda adobe which once stood on the high ground near Bundy Ave and Wilshire Blvd overlooking the Kuruvungna village site and the springs. The canyon, the ranchos, the city, the bay, the mountains, the boulevard, the airport and the freeway are all called after a former turn-of-the-19th-century name for Kuruvungna Springs. Hancock, Ralph, \\"Fabulous Boulevard\\", 1949, Funk & Wagnalls In the 1800s, the spring served as the water supply for the city of Santa Monica. The smallest of the Springs bubbling from underground University High School Shortly after the annexation of Sawtelle, construction began at the springs to build Warren G. Harding High School, later renamed University High School. Construction at the school in 1925 unearthed evidence of an Indian village. The springs were landscaped to make them a feature of the campus. The waters of the upper spring were made to cascade down a small waterfall (still extant) and also fill a wishing well (demolished). The source of the lower springs was left open, as it still is, so one could see the water bubbling up through the sand. The overflow fills a large pond with a small island before being directed into a storm drain. The pond was surrounded with manicured lawns and served as a gathering place for students and the setting for group graduation photos. However, the springs corner of the campus fell into disrepair in the 1980s and began to be used as a dump. After the Gabrielino Tongva Springs Foundation removed tons of trash from the site in the 1990s, the area around the springs was planted with tule reeds and other native plants. In 1975, a grave containing a small skeleton and soapstone bowls was discovered by students and a science teacher from what archaeologists now believe to be a burial site. This grave was dated to approximately 4000 BCE and the character of the bowls suggested kinship with the culture of Santa Catalina Island in the same era. In 1980 Indian Springs Continuation High School, which is housed on the part of the campus where the springs are, was opened.California Department of Education's California School Directory In 1992, developers proposed an underground parking lot one block north of the springs which would have cut off the spring's water. In response, tribal descendants, community members and teachers and students from the school founded a non-profit foundation, the Gabrielino/Tongva Springs Foundation, and after a two-year fight, the proposed parking structure was voted down. The foundation currently leases the site from the Los Angeles Unified School District in order to use the location for their monthly ceremony and guided tours, and received a $7,000 grant from Los Angeles' Environmental Affairs Department to enhance the area with different types of trees, vines and herbs. In 1992, the newly established Gabrieleno Springs Foundation held the first annual Life Before Columbus Day event.Annual \\"Life Before Coumbus Day Event\\" The event takes place just before Columbus day every year and celebrates the history of the land and of the Tongva people. Previous events have drawn more than 600 people, including Native Americans from various tribes, local politicians, community members and students and faculty from the school. The event includes tours of the Kuruvunga Village site and springs, performances by dancers from the Tongva and Aztec tribe and storytelling from the Chumash tribe. There are also hands-on activities like corn-doll making, rock painting, and tortilla making, offered by authentic Native American vendors. In 1998, Governor Wilson signed senate bill SB 1956. The Bill, introduced by Senator Tom Hayden, required the California Department of Parks and Recreation to, \\"seek to establish a permanent cultural and ecological site at the Gabrielino/Tongva Springs\\", and called for the creation of a task force created by University High School's administration, \\"in consultation with the Gabrielino/Tongva Springs Foundation and the Los Angeles Unified School District\\". The bill appropriated $50,000 to the department to be spent on a local assistance grant to the task force, \\"to plan for the preservation of the Gabrielino/Tongva Springs, and property adjacent thereto...in order to enhance environmental, cultural, and educational opportunities.\\"SB 1956 Amended California Historical Landmark The marker at the site reads:California Parks, California Historical Landmark > NO. 522 SERRA SPRINGS - The Portolá Expedition of 1769 encamped at this > spring, and it is reported that in 1770 Father Serra said Mass here to the > Indians of this area.

She was involved in Leo Frank's defense and in the Wallace case as a witness for the prosecution. History Born Amanda Mayhayley Lancaster, she grew up in Heard County, Georgia, where she lived for most of her life. Mayhayley Lancaster was 39 years old in 1915, during the Leo Frank case. She was one of the few public voices in Georgia to defend Frank. Thirty-two years later, in 1947, the 71-year-old Mayhayley Lancaster took part in the Wallace trial, later described in the book Murder in Coweta County. In the 1983 made-for-TV movie of the same name, she was portrayed as a local oracle by 54-year-old June Carter Cash. Cash's real-life husband, Johnny Cash, played the key role of the persistent sheriff Lamar Potts determined to bring to justice the arrogant John Wallace (Andy Griffith). Political campaign Lancaster ran for the Georgia legislature in 1926, the first woman to do so. She ran on a platform advocating roads and railroads into rural counties, public schools, and the passage of a law that mandated that doctors must deliver babies regardless of the family's ability to pay fees. She did not win, but some of her ideas were eventually carried out. Death and legacy Mayhayley Lancaster died May 22, 1955. In addition to her legal, political and educational activities, she was also described as a noted fortune teller, numbers runner and self-proclaimed \\"Oracle of the Ages\\". She is buried in the cemetery at Caney Head Methodist Church. Books Oracle of the Ages: Reflections on the Curious Life of Fortune Teller Mayhayley Lancaster (hardcover ; paperback ), by Dot Moore, is a biography of fortune-teller Mahayley Lancaster. The people who knew her reflect on her personality, her politics, and her passions, delving fully into Mayhayley lore and legend. Also included is information on Lancaster's role in the trial of John Wallace, subject of the book and movie Murder in Coweta County. Oracle of the Ages was the 2002 winner of the Lilla M.

It has over 150 partners and approximately 860 employees. Headquartered in London, Trowers & Hamlins was founded over 200 years ago. History In 1777 the practice was run by Richard and John Woodhouse. Since that time it has undergone more than 20 changes of identity and amalgamations. Walter Trower (who was knighted in 1915) joined the partnership in 1886, and the name Hamlin originated in a firm called Hamlin & Grammer which was practising in 1875. Though the two firms using these names had been in association for many years, it was not until 1987 that they finally integrated to become Trowers & Hamlins. Offices During the last 30 years Trowers & Hamlins has expanded considerably. The Manchester office opened in 1973, followed by the opening of offices in Oman (1980), Exeter (1984), Dubai (1991), Abu Dhabi (1993), Bahrain (1998) and Birmingham (2011). Trowers & Hamlins also merged with Devon-based law firm, Stones Solicitors (2015). Outside the UK it has approximately 150 lawyers working across the Middle East. In 2012 Trowers & Hamlins opened a non-trading representative office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, having secured unique approval from the Malaysia Investment Development Authority (MIDA). Trowers & Hamlins was the first foreign firm to open in this manner in Malaysia. In 2015, the firm was the first foreign law firm to receive a Qualified Foreign Law Firm licence in Malaysia and now operates an office there. Today, Trowers & Hamlins has over 860 staff in its UK, Middle East and Far East offices.

In that capacity, he was the architect of U.S. President Barack Obama's Russian reset policy. Early life and education Born in Glasgow, Montana, McFaul was raised in Butte and Bozeman, where his father worked as a musician and music teacher. While attending Bozeman High School, McFaul participated in policy debate; his partner was current U.S. Senator Steve Daines (R) of Montana. While an undergraduate at Stanford University he spent time in the Soviet Union, first in the summer of 1983 studying Russian at the Leningrad State University (now Saint Petersburg State University), and then a semester in 1985 at Pushkin Institute in Moscow. He earned a B.A. in international relations and Slavic languages and an M.A. in Slavic and East European Studies from Stanford in 1986. As a Rhodes Scholar, he earned a DPhil in international relations from St John's College, Oxford, in 1991. He wrote his dissertation on U.S. and Soviet intervention in revolutionary movements in southern Africa. McFaul received an honorary doctorate from Montana State University during the university's fall commencement in 2015. Career In 1994, McFaul and one-time close friend and colleague Sergey Markov helped found the Moscow Carnegie Center. McFaul's past engagement with Russian political figures included a denunciation of him in 1994 by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and a member of the State Duma (the Russian parliament), and a subsequent shooting incident in which a shot was fired into McFaul's office window in Moscow. Two years later, Alexander Korzhakov, a confidante of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, invited McFaul to the Kremlin during the 1996 Russian presidential election, because of McFaul's research on electoral politics. President Barack Obama is briefed during a flight to Moscow, 2009 Barack Obama, Joe Biden and McFaul with former Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev, March 20, 2009 In his capacity as a professor of political science at Stanford University, McFaul was the director of the university's Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law. A Hoover Institution Peter and Helen Bing Senior Fellow, McFaul is a Democrat who was the architect of U.S. President Barack Obama's policy on Russia. In a 2012 interview for the news portal Slon.ru, McFaul described himself as \\"specialist on democracy, anti-dictator movements, revolutions\\". Secretary of State John Kerry and McFaul tour Red Square in Moscow on May 7, 2013 House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on \\"U.S. Policy Toward Putin’s Russia,\\" on June 14, 2016. McFaul testified as Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, center left, sat behind him. In 2009, McFaul joined the Barack Obama administration as a senior adviser in Washington, D.C., where he was the architect of the so-called \\"Russian reset\\" policy. In 2011, Obama nominated McFaul to be the 7th post-Soviet United States Ambassador to the Russian Federation. On December 17, 2011, the United States Senate confirmed McFaul by unanimous consent. McFaul became the first non-career diplomat to be the U.S. ambassador to Russia. He arrived in Russia just as massive protests were erupting over Vladimir Putin's resumption of the presidency. As ambassador he was often controversial, meeting with Russian pro-democracy activists and commenting frequently on Twitter in English and Russian. McFaul announced his resignation as ambassador to Russia on February 4, 2014, effective after the Sochi Olympics. In a blog post, he expressed his gratitude for the job and his sorrow at leaving Moscow, but explained that originally he had planned to spend only two years in the Obama administration, and after five years, his family desperately wanted to return to life in California. John F. Tefft was confirmed as the next ambassador to Russia. McFaul returned to Stanford as a professor of political science and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. He continued to be involved in geopolitics. In October 2014, he stated that he believed the Russians continued to bug his and his wife's cell phones in the United States. He is currently on the Kremlin's sanction list of people who are not allowed to enter Russia. Russian opposition visit On January 17, 2012, soon after McFaul was appointed the new United States Ambassador to Russia and arrived in Moscow to assume his post, a number of organizers and prominent participants of the 2011 Russian protests, as well as some prominent figures of the Russian opposition parties, visited the Embassy of the United States in Moscow. On the entrance to the embassy, they were encountered by TV journalists who asked them why they were visiting the new Ambassador. On the video later released on YouTubeПолучение инструкций в посольстве США and titled \\"Получение инструкций в посольстве США\\" (Receiving instructions in the Embassy of the United States), opposition activists appear flustered by the unexpected media attention. Later, when upon leaving the embassy and once again being encircled by journalists, the activists responded by declaring the journalists spreaders of \\"Surkovian propaganda\\" and made no other statement. The visitors to Michael McFaul included Yevgeniya Chirikova (member of Strategy-31 and Khimki forest activist leader), Boris Nemtsov (leader of the People's Freedom Party at the time; assassinated in 2015), Lev Ponomarev (human rights activist of the Moscow Helsinki Group), Sergey Mitrokhin (leader of Yabloko party), Oksana Dmitriyeva (deputy head of A Just Russia), Lilia Shibanova (head of the GOLOS Association elections monitor group). Leonid Kalashnikov from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation also attended. Two weeks later, journalist Olga Romanova who managed the financial spending of the December protests, also visited the American Embassy. She said that they discussed Russian protests and the United States Presidential election campaign with McFaul. Reaction to the incident was mixed: President Dmitry Medvedev, in his public comments at Moscow State University, largely exonerated McFaul by saying that meeting with opposition figures was a routine occurrence, although he warned the new U.S. ambassador that he was on Russian soil and should respect Russian political sensibilities. The incident sparked a highly negative reaction in the state- controlled Russian media, which accused him of conspiring with the opposition.Russia Profile Weekly Experts Panel: United States Looms Large in Russian Elections russiaprofile.org But an article in The Daily Beast wrote that McFaul's stance won plaudits from pro-democracy activists and Web-savvy Russian youth and that, \\"in the tight-knit world of Moscow’s opposition, McFaul has become something of an Internet celebrity, making him a true 21st- century diplomat.\\" Russian request for an interview On July 17, 2018, the Prosecutor General of Russia announced that it was seeking to question McFaul, amongst other Americans, in relation to its investigation of allegations made against Bill Browder. This followed a request Vladimir Putin made to President Donald Trump during the summit in Helsinki. In a White House news conference two days later, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump described Putin's suggestion as an \\"interesting idea\\", but neither rejected it out of hand nor made a firm commitment. On July 19, shortly before the Senate was to vote on a resolution opposing the idea, Sanders stated that Trump \\"disagrees\\" with the Putin proposal. The Senate approved the non-binding \\"sense of the Senate\\" resolution on a 98-0 vote; it stated that no current or former diplomat or other government employee should be made available to the Russians for interrogation. Political positions After the 2016 election, he became a regular commentator on MSNBC and social media, and has frequently been critical of the policies and actions of President Donald Trump with regard to Russia. McFaul supported the Iran nuclear deal. In July 2019, McFaul wrote that Communist Party of China's officials \\"champion the advantages of their system — an ability to undertake massive infrastructure projects, the capacity to manage income inequalities and a commitment to harmony in government and society. In contrast, polarized U.S. politics in the Trump era seem to impede any major initiative, be it infrastructure development or addressing income inequality.\\" Recognition Coit D. Blacker called McFaul \\"the leading scholar of his generation, maybe the leading scholar, on post- Communist Russia\\" and a Stanford news release said his knowledge of Russia \\"was an important resource to politicians. He advised President George W. Bush on his dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin\\". An article in Russia Profile called McFaul one of the leading U.S. experts in democracy and democratic transitions. An article in The Daily Beast described McFaul as \\"an earnest Stanford academic\\".

Hossain Ali was a Bangladeshi diplomat and former ambassador to the United States. Early life Ali was born in Patharghata, Bhangura Upazila, Pabna District on 1 February 1923. In 1945 he graduated from University of Dhaka with a bachelor's degree in Chemistry. In 1948, he completed his LLB from University of Karachi in 1948. In 1949 he completed the Pakistan Civil Service examination and joined the foreign service. He studied further on foreign policy and diplomacy in Foreign Service Institute in Washington D.C. and in the British foreign office in London. He completed a diploma program in the Paris-based Institute of International Relations.  Career  Ali was posted in a number of different diplomatic posts including in Australia, Belgium, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Burma, United Kingdom and Netherlands. During the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, he was the Deputy High Commissioner at Calcutta, India for Pakistan. He was transferred by the government to West Pakistan. On 18 April 1971, he refused to obey the orders and declared his allegiance to the Bangladesh government in exile. He was supported by 65 of his colleagues in the commission. The Pakistan High Commission in Kolkata was changed to the Bangladesh High Commission. The flag of Bangladesh was raised in the Embassy compound. It was just one day after the declaration of the People's Republic of Bangladesh at Baidyanathtala. First Secretary Rafiqul Islam Chowdhury, third Secretary Anwarul Karim Chowdhury and Assistant Press Attaché Moqshed Ali were also present in that ceremony and were negotiating with other nations for support of Bangladeshi independence. The role of Ali is very important, as he pioneered the way for other expatriate Bengali diplomats to pledge their allegiance to the new Bangladesh Government. Ali was then named Chief of Mission at Calcutta for Bangladesh. Following this lead, Bengali diplomats defected to the new government at the missions in New York, Washington, D.C., London, Baghdad, Manila, Kathmandu, Buenos Aires, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Lagos and Bern. In 1972, Ali was appointed the first High Commissioner in Australia for Bangladesh and later served as the first Bangladeshi Ambassador to the United States. He served as the ambassador of Bangladesh to West Germany from 1976 to 1979. He was then appointed the ambassador of Bangladesh to Canada.  Death and legacy  Ali died on 2 January 1981 in Canada.

Biography His father, Lee Meng Hin, was a tin-miner who gave the then Malayan economy a boost. After Lee Meng Hin's reign, his company was passed on to one of his sons, Lee Wan Seng, and the younger Loy Seng worked just as an employee during the early years of his life. During the Malayan Emergency, many British firms and trading houses sold off their assets, including rubber plantations at very low prices. Loy Seng saw the opportunity of a lifetime to invest in these lands, subsequently turning them into rubber plantations. With luck on his side, the price of rubber was increasing immensely due to industrial rise. As he built up his fast blossoming business, Mr. Lee founded the company Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad, which became and still is one of the leading plantation owning companies in Malaysia. Mr Lee was a member of Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), president of Ipoh Municipal Council in 1976, and a senator from 1971 to 1980.

He is executive editor for Breitbart London, and has published several novels and four political books. He describes himself as a libertarian conservative. He has published articles rejecting the scientific consensus on climate change and expressing opposition to wind power. Education and early life Delingpole grew up near Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, the son of a factory owner. He attended Malvern College from 1978 to 1983, an independent school for boys, followed by Christ Church, Oxford (1983 to 86), where he studied English Language and Literature. Career In addition to writing articles and commentary for the Daily Mail, Daily Express, The Times, The Daily Telegraph, and The Spectator, Delingpole has published four political books including: How to be Right: The Essential Guide to Making Lefty Liberals History, Welcome to Obamaland: I Have Seen Your Future and It Doesn't Work, and 365 Ways to Drive a Liberal Crazy.365 Ways to Drive a Liberal Crazy, James Delingpole His writing for the book Welcome to Obamaland has been called an \\"engaging, witty writing style\\" and \\"at least original and amusing\\" by otherwise critical author John Wright. Delingpole is the author of several novels including Fin and Thinly Disguised Autobiography. In August 2007, Bloomsbury published his first novel of the \\"Coward\\" series, Coward on the Beach, which tells the story of a man's reluctant quest for military glory and is set on the beaches of Normandy during the D-Day landings. In June 2009 the second novel of the series, Coward at the Bridge (set during Operation Market Garden in September 1944), was published. In 2005 Delingpole presented the Channel 4 documentary The British Upper Class, which was part of a series of three documentaries on the class system in Britain. Writing in The Guardian, the television reviewer Charlie Brooker concludes that \\"Delingpole succeeds in improving the image of the upper classes. Whenever he opens his mouth to defend them, they magically become 50 times less irritating. Than him.\\" On environmental issues, Delingpole has written with scepticism regarding the impact and consequences of man's activities on climate change, and has been highly critical of wind farms. He has called wind turbines \\"environmentally damaging\\" and suggested that they deface the countryside. In 2012, Delingpole began Bogpaper, a satirical blog, with Jan Skoyles. Controversies  On anthropogenic global warming  Delingpole has engaged in climate change denialism; in 2009 he wrote of \\"The conspiracy behind the Anthropogenic Global Warming myth\\". He says he does not dispute that global warming has occurred, but doubts the extent to which it is man-made (\\"anthropogenic\\") or catastrophic. Hence, Delingpole has disputed the findings of climate science on global warming for a number of years. He has written \\"I am not a scientist and have never claimed to be,\\" and that he does not have a science degree, but is \\"a believer in empiricism and not spending taxpayers' money on a problem that may well not exist.\\" In a BBC Horizon documentary, \\"Science under Attack\\", Delingpole responded to Paul Nurse's discussion of the scientific consensus on global warming by saying that the idea of a consensus is unscientific; and in response to Nurse's question as to whether he had read any peer-reviewed papers, he maintained that as a journalist \\"it is not my job\\" to read peer reviewed papers, but to be \\"an interpreter of interpretations.\\" See also Delingpole reused a term appearing in a follow-up comment to another blog, and so popularised the term \\"Climategate\\" in The Spectator, to refer to the Climatic Research Unit email controversy, and called it \\"the greatest scientific scandal in the history of the world\\". Subsequent investigations have cleared the scientists involved of any wrongdoing. In a 15-minute talk to what was termed The Heartland Institute's Fourth International Conference on Climate Change, Delingpole humorously quipped in 2010 that the Climategate was \\"the story that would change my life and, quite possibly, save Western civilisation from the greatest threat it has ever known.\\"Clear manifestations of the intended humorous nature of the talk are its closing anecdote relating anti-Nazi propaganda illustrations of Nazi genitalia to a former U.S. Vice President, and the following further excerpt from Delingpole (ICCF-4, 2010, op cit.): \\"Recognizing that, you know, we humans have done some pretty good shit in our time… [laughter] uh, we've uh, painted the Cistine Chapel. [laughter] Not me personally but somebody did, Michaelangelo I believe… We have written Shakespeare, uh, even Moliere, the French think he is quite good, I'm not so… Germans, Germans did Goethe… Uh, Thomas Jefferson, I mean, wasn't he cool, didn't he do some cool stuff? We like him. Ronnie Reagan. You know, in all sorts of different… I, I, I would mention sport but I am not very good at… Dale Earnhart… [extended laughter] Uh, uh, uhm, we have done some good stuff in our time. And I think we should celebrate that. You know, I like me. I like you. I think we should all be here. I think we should all be breeding…\\" [12:27-13:24]. In 2012 Delingpole wrote an article in The Australian titled \\"Wind Farm Scam a Huge Cover-Up\\" containing controversial issues and tone, which was ultimately censured. Three complaints were made, and the Australian Press Council upheld three aspects of the complaints, commenting on the \\"offensiveness\\" of the comment made by a New South Wales sheep farmer, which Delingpole quoted, that made an analogy between advocates of wind farms and paedophiles. On 10 January 2013 the UK Met Office responded to Delingpole's Daily Mail article published earlier that day, ‘The crazy climate change obsession that’s made the Met Office a menace’, with a blog rebutting \\"a series of factual inaccuracies\\" in the piece, which included repetition of a falsehood which the Telegraph had withdrawn in 2012 following a Press Complaints Commission ruling. The Met Office refuted an assertion attributed to Global Warming Policy Foundation member David Whitehouse, but agreed with Whitehouse's statement that \\"when it comes to four or five day weather forecasting, the Met Office is the best in the world\\". The Mail Online version of the article is presented as amended on 13 March 2013, with a copy of an 8 March letter from the Met Office's then Chairman Greg Clarke appended below Delingpole's article. In 2013 Delingpole published an article in The Spectator, asking the question whether climate scientists like Michael E. Mann, natural scientist Tim Flannery and journalist George Monbiot should be \\"given the electric chair\\", \\"hanged\\" or \\"fed to the crocodiles\\" for speaking out on anthropogenic global warming. Then he went on that his answer \\"is – *regretful sigh* – no.\\" Then he explained that \\"extreme authoritarianism and capital penalties\\" wouldn't be his \\"bag\\". However he continued, \\"perhaps more importantly, it would be counterproductive, ugly, excessive and deeply unsatisfying. The last thing I would want is for Monbiot, Mann, Flannery, Jones, Hansen and the rest of the Climate rogues' gallery to be granted the mercy of quick release. [...] But hanging? Hell no. Hanging is far too good for such ineffable toerags.\\" He also wished to establish Nuremberg trials for climate scientists and activists, claiming this is meant as a metaphor. Other controversies In 2013 he described an article by a fellow journalist, which attacked the views of columnist Suzanne Moore, as giving her \\"such a seeing-to, she'll be walking bow-legged for weeks.\\" Delingpole later apologised.Michael Gove's gang perfect the art of fighting dirty, The Observer, 10 February 2013 In 2015 Delingpole was named as a source for Lord Ashcroft's unauthorised biography of David Cameron, Call Me Dave written with journalist Isabel Oakeshott, about Cameron's time at university, in which Delingpole claims to have smoked cannabis with the future PM. Politics Delingpole has described himself \\"as a member of probably the most discriminated-against subsection in the whole of British society—the white, middle-aged, public-school-and-Oxbridge educated middle-class male.\\"The Cameron club, John Harris, The Guardian, 16 February 2007 On 6 September 2012, Delingpole announced he would stand in the upcoming Corby by-election on an anti-wind farms platform. He withdrew, saying his campaign against wind farms had been \\"stunningly successful\\" before a vote was cast. A Greenpeace investigation said that Delingpole's campaign was supported by the Conservative Party's campaign manager for the Corby by-election, Chris Heaton- Harris. Heaton-Harris said that Delingpole had announced his candidacy as part of a \\"plan\\" to \\"cause some hassle\\" and drive the issue of wind farms up the political agenda. In a 2013 article in The Spectator, he stated that for some time prior \\"I've held dual political nationality: my heart with UKIP (United Kingdom Independence Party), my head with the Tories\\", going on to praise the latter as \\"the natural party of government in a brave new world where politicians are the people’s servants, not their masters.\\"  Awards and prizes  In 2005 Delingpole was awarded the Charles Douglas-Home Memorial Trust Award for his essay \\"What are museums for?\\" In 2010 Delingpole won the Bastiat Prize for Online Journalism for his Telegraph blog, a $3,000 prize awarded by the free-market International Policy Network for \\"work that promotes 'the principles and institutions of the free society'\\"; Damian Thompson, the Telegraph's blog editor, linked receipt of the award to the impact of Delingpole's posts on the Climatic Research Unit email controversy.

Carr (born 1959) is an American entrepreneur and philanthropist. His most notable philanthropic venture is the restoration of Mozambique's famous Gorongosa National Park, which has been ravaged by civil war and environmental destruction. He has pledged $40 million over 30 years to rebuild the park as a source of tourist income for the local population. Biography Greg Carr was born in Idaho Falls, Idaho, in 1959. His parents are Taylor H. and Betty O. Carr. He attended Utah State University as an undergraduate, majoring in history, and received a master's degree in public policy from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1986. Later that year, inspired by the breakup of AT&T;, he and Scott Jones founded Boston Technology, one of the earlier firms to sell voice mail systems to telephone companies. Carr served as the chair of Boston Technology until it was purchased by Comverse Technology (CMVT) in 1998. From 1996 to 1998 he was chair of Prodigy, an early global Internet service provider (ISP). He also co- founded Africa Online in 1996 and served as its chair until 1998. In 1998 Carr resigned from his for-profit boards and dedicated himself to humanitarian activities. He formed the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard University in 1999. Through research and teaching, the Carr Center seeks to make human rights principles central to the formulation of good public policy in the United States and throughout the world. In 1999 he also founded the Gregory C. Carr Foundation, a non-profit organization through which he has been involved in various projects including the Gorongosa Restoration Project. The Carr Foundation is currently committed to the 30 year restoration of Gorongosa National Park in central Mozambique as well as to the sustainable development of the communities surrounding the park. The Gorongosa team has reintroduced species to the ecosystem, worked with the Mozambican government to extend the park's boundaries to include Mount Gorongosa and planted more than three million trees on the mountain, created an international Restoration Ecology science research center, established eco-tourism in the Park, and provides health and education programs to the local communities living near the Park's borders. National Geographic Television chronicled the Park's restoration in their film \\"Africa's Lost Eden\\", as well as the CBS News program \\"60 Minutes\\" on October 26, 2008. Carr has been active in human rights activities in his home state of Idaho. In 2000, he co-founded the Museum of Idaho located in Idaho Falls, and in 2001 he opened the Market Theater in Harvard Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The theater was known for showcasing small independent and experimental productions. In 2001 he purchased the compound of the Aryan Nations, near Hayden Lake, Idaho, after it was seized by court order following a successful lawsuit brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center against the Nazi group. The land, donated to North Idaho College, is now a peace park. Carr currently sits on the board of Internews, a non-profit organization advancing independent journalism. He is a close friend of biologist E. O. Wilson.

They are west of Bird Island, separated by the Stewart Strait. They were discovered on 14 January 1775 by Captain James Cook and named for Cook's midshipman Thomas Willis, the crew member who first sighted them. The Willis Islands were charted in greater detail and individually named by Discovery Investigations (DI) personnel between 1926-1930.  Geography   Main Island  The archipelago's largest island is called Main Island, so-named because at long and high, it is the principal island in the group. Its southwestern point is called Johannesen Point, originally \\"All Johannesens Point,\\" likely by DI personnel. Following a survey of the island in 1951–52, the South Georgia Survey (SGS) reported that the cumbersome name was seldom used locally. On that basis, the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) recommended the present shortened form of the name. West and south of Main Island West of Main Island are several named rocks, groups of rocks, and shoals. Acorn Rock rises above sea level, northwest of Main Island. The descriptive name was applied during a hydrographic survey from in 1960–61. northwest of Main Island is Holgate Shoal, an area of shoals named by the UK-APC for Able Seaman Ralph A. Holgate of the Owen, which charted the shoal in 1961. A pair of rocks named the Tiger Rocks are located west of Main Island, southwest of the shoal. The descriptive name was applied during the surveys from the Owen. The westernmost point of the Willis Islands is a group of three barren rocks called the Ramp Rocks, northwest of Johannesen Point on Main Island. The largest of them was originally called laavebrua (\\"threshing floor ramp\\") by Norwegian whalers, but to avoid confusion with Låvebrua Island, UK-APC named the trio the Ramp Rocks. west-southwest of the south end of Main Island is a small group of rocks named the Bryde Rocks. Positioned by the SGS between 1951–57, the group was named by UK-APC for Thorleif Bryde, a gunner of the South Georgia Whaling Co. Pugh Shoal is an area of shoal south of Main Island, named by UK-APC for Able Seaman Peter J. Pugh of the Owen, which charted this shoal in 1961. East of Main Island Heron Passage separates Main Island from Vaughan Island close to the east, and Trinity Island to the northeast. The existence of the passage was first reported in the 1930s, and confirmed by HMS Owen during a hydrographic survey of the area in 1961. It was named by UK-APC after one of the Owen's survey motor boats, the Heron. Vaughan Island is a small, conical tussock-covered island close east of Main Island. It was named by UK-APC for Lieutenant Commander Hugh L.F. Vaughan, Royal Navy, First Lieutenant of the Owen. The much larger Trinity Island was so-named by DI because it has three peaks. To the southeast are a pair of small tussock-covered islands called the Verdant Islands, descriptively named \\"Verdant Island\\" by DI. The name was amended in 1985 to reflect that there were actually two islands there. To the east is Hall Island, small, steep-sided, and tussock-covered. It was named by UK-APC after Commander Geoffrey P.D. Hall of the Royal Navy, Commanding Officer of the Owen. The easternmost island in the group is Proud Island, a small, relatively high, tussock-covered island, rising to a peak at its northern end. It was descriptively named by UK-APC, the expression \\"standing proud\\" in naval parlance being the equivalent of \\"sticking up.\\"  Fauna  The Willis Islands are a significant breeding ground for Antarctic fur seals.

Reconstruction of Parapeytoia yunnanensis as an anomalocaridid. Parapeytoia is known from a few incomplete fossil materials with part of its ventral structures preserved. The frontmost appendages were a pair of great appendages that had a peduncle and 4 spines on each of them, a characteristic feature shared by other megacheirans such as Yohoia and Fortiforceps. Behind the great appendages were 2 or 3 pairs of short appendages, and numerous pairs of well-developed biramous appendages, each formed by a basipod with spiny gnathobase, lobe-like exopod and leg-like endopod with 8 segments. A narrow sternite associated between each of those appendages. Some features originally interpreted as anomalocaridid-like are more or less questionable, such as radial sclerites interpreted as its mouthparts have since been assigned to another genus of animal, Omnidens.

The ruins are the largest medieval building in the Faroe Islands. History Bishop Erlendur (1269–1308) started construction in about the year 1300. Earlier it was believed that the structure was never completed, however recent research suggests otherwise. The finding of an arch roof base and of old plastering on the walls indicate that the structure was actually roofed and in use at some point.. Also the size of the famous pew ends from the nearby Saint Olav's Church indicates that they were originally made for and placed inside the roofed cathedral. However it did not have a long lifetime, because after the Reformation in 1537, the Diocese of the Faroe Islands was abolished and supposedly the cathedral was left to decay. The only known relic of St. Thorlak of Iceland is contained with other saints' relics in a lead box in the sanctuary's end wall (\\"The Golden Locker\\").  Conservation work  Magnus Cathedral Barthélemy Lauvergne (1805–1871) Conservation work on the Cathedral started in 1997, as it became clear that the ruin was deteriorating at a rapid pace, with more and more mortar falling away due to the elements, mostly from rain, but also salty sea air and sea water. During 2002-2004, a wooden shed was erected around most of the ruin, giving it enough shelter to dry out, before work could begin on preservation. The shed drew considerable criticism because of its looks. During the research into how to preserve the ruin, a conclusion was reached. No outward reconstruction would be made, and instead ongoing preservation work would be implemented, where the mortar would be reinforced from time to time. In addition, all horizontal surfaces, where water could seep in, would be \\"soft capped\\" with mortar and clay before being topped with sod and grass. This work began in 2010. Today considerable headway has been made. Large sections of the shedding have been removed and work is expected to be finished in the not too distant future. While it is hoped that the St. Magnus Cathedral will be accepted as a UNESCO World heritage Site, the prospect is not very certain.

Lieutenant of the County of Devon and Knight of the Most Hon.ble Order of the Bath\\" Robert Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford, KB (1701 – 31 March 1751), was a British peer and politician, styled Lord Walpole from 1723 to 1745. Origins Houghton Hall, Norfolk He was the eldest son of Sir Robert Walpole (1676–1745), the King's First Minister, now regarded as the first British Prime Minister, by his first wife Catherine Shorter. In 1723 his father declined a peerage for himself but did accept the offer on behalf of his 22-year-old son Robert who was thus raised to the peerage as Baron Walpole, of Walpole in the County of Norfolk. Marriage Circa 26 March 1724 Lord Walpole married the 15-year-old heiress Margaret Rolle (1709–1781), only surviving daughter of Colonel Samuel Rolle (1646–1719), of Heanton Satchville, Petrockstowe. Margaret was the heiress to a junior branch of the great Rolle family of Stevenstone in Devon and to her paternal grandmother, born Lady Arabella Clinton, an aunt and co-heiress of her nephew Edward Clinton, 5th Earl of Lincoln and 13th Baron Clinton (d. 1692). The marriage was not a success and Lady Walpole quarrelled violently with his whole family. After one son was born they lived apart and later obtained a legal separation. In 1736 Hannah Norsa, a leading singer and actress at Covent Garden, moved to Houghton Hall in Norfolk and remained there as Walpole's mistress until his death in March 1751. Her financial support may have saved him from dying bankrupt. In Walpole's many absences Hannah Norsa was escorted in her landau and six horses by his chaplain, Rev William Paxton, who received the position as a small part of the Walpole family compensation for his father's defence of Walpole's father, the Prime Minister. His estranged widow became the 15th Baroness Clinton succeeding in her own right after the death of her cousin Hugh Fortescue, 1st Earl Clinton. She had remarried on Walpole's death but soon separated from her second husband, Hon Sewallis Shirley, a son of the 1st Earl Ferrers and Comptroller of Queen Charlotte's Household. Lady Clinton died at Pisa, in Tuscany, in 1781, and was buried at Leghorn, \\"a woman of very singular character and considered half mad\\" (according to her friend, Selina, Countess of Huntingdon). Progeny Both the Earl of Orford and his wife Baroness Clinton were succeeded in all their titles by their son George Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford and 16th Baron Clinton (1730–1791), a celebrated falconer, who left no legitimate children and died insane.

Biblical accounts The city is first mentioned in , near Gibeah of Benjamin. In the Book of Judges, a Levite came traveling to Gibeah, with Ramah just ahead (). Ramathaim is the town that was home to Samuel's mother Hannah and his father Elkanah, from which they journeyed to the sanctuary at Shiloh, where Hannah prayed to God to end her barrenness and give her a child (). Ramah is mentioned in in reference to a meeting place during Samuel's rule. The city was later fortified by Baasha, king of the northern kingdom, in order to control access to Jerusalem (; ). Asa, king of the southern kingdom of Judah, employed Ben-Hadad I, the Syrian king, successfully to attack Baasha at home and draw his forces away from this city (). The biblical account states that the fortifications were later dismantled by decree of King Asa and the materials used to fortify Judah's defenses at nearby Geba and Mizpah (; ). When Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians, those taken captive were assembled in Ramah before being moved to Babylon (Jeremiah 40:1). Jeremiah said: :A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more (Jeremiah 31:15 NIV).Some English language versions state that \\"A voice was heard on high\\" rather than in Ramah, e.g. the Geneva Bible and the 1899 Douay–Rheims Bible Rachel – the ancestress of the three tribes, Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin Pulpit Commentary on Jeremiah 13, accessed 25 November 2016 – had so desired children that she considered herself dead without them (). Jeremiah said that she was figuratively weeping because of the loss of the people killed or taken in captivity. And since she was the mother of Benjamin, it would fit because those in Ramah were Benjamites. In the New Testament, Ramah is mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew (2:18), where it is stated that Jeremiah's prophecy about Rachel received \\"a second accomplishment\\" Benson's Commentary on Matthew 2, accessed 26 November 2016 in the slaughter of boy children carried out when Herod was king: :Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: :A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more..

It is also known as the fellaḥi ( \\"rustic\\" or ʿajamī \\"foreign\\" calendar). The calendar is utilized to regulate the seasonal agricultural works. The Islamic calendar, a lunar calendar, is not suited for agriculture because it does not relate to seasonal cycles. In other parts of the Islamic world either Iranian solar calendars, the Coptic calendar, the Rumi calendar, or other calendars based on the Julian calendar, were used before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar. The current Berber calendar is a legacy of the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis and the Roman province of Africa, as it is a surviving form of the Julian calendar. The latter calendar was used in Europe before the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, with month names derived from Latin. Berber populations previously used various indigenous calendars, such as that of the Guanche autochthones of the Canary Islands. However, relatively little is known of these ancient calendrical systems. Current Julian calendar The agricultural Berber calendar still in use is almost certainly derived from the Julian calendar, introduced in the Roman province of Africa at the time of Roman domination. The names of the months of this calendar are derived from the corresponding Latin names and races of the Roman calendar denominations of Kalends, Nones and Ides exist: El Qabisi, an Islamic jurisconsult by Kairawan who lived in the 11th century, condemned the custom of celebrating \\"pagans'\\" festivals and cited, among traditional habits of North Africa, that of observing January Qalandas (\\"Kalends\\").Idris, 1954 The length of the year and of the individual months is the same as in the Julian calendar: three years of 365 days followed by a leap year of 366, without exceptions, and 30- and 31-day months, except for the second one that has 28 days. The only slight discrepancy lies in that the extra day in leap years is not usually added at the end of February, but at the end of the year. This means that the beginning of the year (the first day of yennayer) corresponds to the 14th day of January in the Gregorian calendar, which coincides with the offset accumulated during the centuries between astronomical dates and the Julian calendar. Months There are standard forms for the names of the Amazigh (Berber) calendar. The table below also provides the forms used in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia.

Not all the four seasons have retained a Berber denomination: the words for spring and autumn are used almost everywhere, more sparingly the winter and, among northern Berbers, the Berber name for the autumn has been preserved only in Jebel Nafusa (Libya). *Spring tafsut (Ar. er-rbiʿ) – Begins on 15 furar (28 February) *Summer anebdu (Ar. es-sif) – Begins on 17 mayu (30 May) *Autumn amwal / aməwanamwal is the form found in Jebel Nafusa (Jadu); aməwan is the corresponding word in tuareg.

( (Ar. le-xrif) – Begins on 17 ghusht (30 August) *Winter tagrest (Ar. esh-shita) - Begins on 16 numbír (29 November) An interesting element is the existing opposition between two 40-day terms, one representing the allegedly coldest part of winter (\\"The nights\\", llyali) and one the hottest period of summer (\\"The Dog Days\\", ssmaym, awussu).On this topic, see e.g. chapter \\"Llyali et Ssmaym\\" in Genevois (1975, pp. 21-22) Llyali A page from a Tunisian calendar, showing the correspondence of 1 Yennayer ʿajmi (in red on bottom) with 14 January of the Gregorian calendar. The writing on the bottom signals that it is ʿajmi New Year's Day and that al-lyali al-sud (\\"the black nights\\") are beginning. The coldest period is made up by 20 \\"white nights\\" (Berber: iḍan imellalen, Arabic: al-lyali al-biḍ), from 12 to 31 dujamber (Gregorian dates: 25 December - 13 January), and 20 \\"black nights\\" (Berber: iḍan tiberkanin/isṭṭafen, Arabic al-lyali al-sud), beginning on the first day of yennayer, corresponding to the Gregorian 14 January. Yennayer The first day of the year is celebrated in various ways in the different parts of North Africa. A widespread tradition is a meal with particular foods, which vary from region to region (such as a couscous with seven vegetables). In some regions, it is marked by the sacrifice of an animal (usually a chicken). In January 2018, Algeria declared Yennayer a national holiday – a landmark policy considering how the Amazigh are marginalized in Northern Africa. A characteristic trait of this festivity, which often blurs with the Islamic Day of Ashura, is the presence, in many regions, of ritual invocations with formulas like bennayu, babiyyanu, bu-ini, etc. Such expressions, according to many scholars, may be derived from the ancient bonus annus (happy new year) wishes.The etymology proposed for bu-ini of Aures from Masqueray (1886: 164), was welcomed and extended to other similar terms related to the start of the year festivities by several authors, including Doutté (1909: 550), Laoust (1920: 195), Delheure (1988: 156). Drouin (2000: 115) defines these etymological research as \\"unconvincing\\". A curious aspect of the Yennayer celebrations concerns the date of New Year's Day. Though once this anniversary fell everywhere on 14 January,In fact, as remarked by Genevois (1975: 11), \\"the agricultural calendar (ancient Julian calendar) has therefore at present a 13-day delay\\". because of a likely mistake introduced by some Berber cultural associations very active in recovering customs on the verge of extinction, at present in a wide part of Algeria it is common opinion that the date of \\"Berber New Year's Day\\" is 12 January and not the 14th. Previously the celebration at the 12, two days before the traditional one, it had been explicitly signaled in the city of Oran.\\"In Oran the Ennayer parties are made on 11 and 12 January of the Gregorian calendar, that is two days before the common agricultural calendar ...\\" Mohamed Benhadji Serradj, Fêtes d'Ennâyer aux Beni snus (tlemcénien folklore) in IBLA, vol. 1950, pp. 247-258. El Azara El Azara () is the period of the year extending, according to the Berber calendar, from 3 to 13 February and known by a climate sometimes hot, sometimes cold. Lḥusum/Imbarken Before the cold ends completely and spring begins fully, there is a period of the year that is very feared. It consists of ten days straddling the months of furar and mars (the last five of the former and the first five of the latter), and it is characterised by strong winds. It is said that, during this term, one should suspend many activities (agricultural and artisan), should not marry nor go out during the night, leaving instead full scope to mysterious powers, which in that period are particularly active and celebrate their weddings. Due to a linguistic taboo, in Djerba these creatures are called imbarken, i.e. \\"the blessed ones\\", whence this period takes its name. Jamrat el Ma (), \\"embers of the sea\\", 27 February, is marked by a rise in sea temperature. Jamrat el Trab (), \\"land embers\\" in English, is the period from 6 to 10 March and known to be marked by a mixture of heavy rain and sunny weather. The term jamrat (literally 'coal') is in reference to the warm state of the earth during this period . Ssmaym Like the strong winter cold, the Dog Days also last 40 days, from 12 yulyuz (25 July) to 20 ghusht (2 September). The apical moment of the period is the first of ghusht \\"August\\" (also the name awussu, widespread in Tunisia and Libya, seems to date back to Latin augustus). On this date, particular rites are performed, which manifestly derive from pre-Islamic, and even pre-Christian, traditions. They consist, in particular, of bonfires (which in many locations take place around the summer solstice: a custom already condemned as Pagan by St. Augustine), or water rituals, like those, common in the coastal towns of Tunisia and Tripolitania, that provide to dive in the seawaters for three nights, in order to preserve one's health. In these ceremonies, whole families used to enter the water, bringing with them even their pets. Though the rite has been revisited in an Islamic frame (in those nights, the water of the Zamzam Well, in Mecca, would spill over, and in the sea there would be beneficial sweet water waves), many call this celebration \\"the nights of the error\\". It was in fact usual that, in order to achieve fertility and prosperity, men and women copulated among the flucts. Iweǧǧiben Another important period for the agricultural calendar is that of the ploughing. In this context, a date considered fundamental is the 17th of (k)tuber, in which one may start ploughing his fields. In Arabic, this period is called ḥertadem, that is \\"Adam's ploughing\\", because in that date the common ancestor of humanity is said to have begun his agricultural works. Influences from the Islamic calendar Following centuries-long contacts with the Arab-Islamic culture, the celebrations linked to the Julian calendar have been sometimes integrated into the Islamic calendar, leading to the suppression of some traditional holidays or to the creation of duplicates. The most evident example are the celebrations for the new year, which in many cases have been transferred to the first Islamic month, i.e. Muḥarram, and more precisely to the ʿĀshūrā’, which falls on the 10th day of that month. This holiday has an important mournful meaning in the Shia Islam, but it is substantially ignored among Sunnis. Many studies have shown the relationships between the joyful celebration of this holiday in North Africa and the ancient New Year's Day celebrations.

Some elements of a pre- Islamic, and almost certainly a pre-Roman calendar, emerge from some medieval writings, analyzed by Nico van den Boogert. Some correspondences with the traditional Tuareg calendar suggest that in antiquity there existed, with some degree of diffusion, a Berber time computation, organized on native bases. There are not enough elements to reconstruct this calendar fully, but known characteristics include many month names' appearing in couples (in the Tuareg world, even in triplets), which suggests a time division different from the present one, made up of months of about 30 days. Some further information, although difficult to specify and correlate with the situation in the rest of North Africa, may be deduced from what is known about time computation among the Guanches of the Canary Islands. According to a 17th-century manuscript by Tomás Marín de Cubas, they The same manuscript states (although somewhat obscurely) that graphical-pictorical records of such calendarial events (tara) were made on different supports, and on this basis some modern scholars identified alleged descriptions of astronomical events connected to annual cycles in a series of geometric paintings in some caves of Gran Canaria island, but the results of these studies are for now highly speculative. The name of only one month is known in the native language, handed down as Beñesmet. It seems it was the second month of the year, corresponding to August. Such a name, in case it was made up by something like *wen \\"that of\\" + (e)smet (or (e)zmet?), may correspond, in the list of medieval Berber month names, with the ninth and tenth months, awzimet (properly aw \\"baby of\\" + zimet \\"gazelle\\"). But data are too scarce for this hypothesis to be deepened. Computation of the years The traditional Berber calendar was not linked to an era with respect to which years were calculated. Where traditional ways to compute the years have been preserved (Tuareg civilization), years are not expressed with numbers but each of them has a name characterizing it. Starting from the 1960s, however, on the initiative of the Académie Berbère of Paris, some Berbers have begun computing the years starting from 950 BC, the approximate date of the rising into power of the first Libyan Pharaoh in Egypt, Shoshenq I, whom they identified as the first prominent Berber in history (he is recorded as being of Libyan origin). For example, the Gregorian year corresponds to the year of the Berber calendar. This innovation has been adopted with conviction by many supporters of the Berber culture and is now a part of the cultural heritage of this people, fully integrated in the system of traditional customs related the North-African calendar.

This maturation is described as a harmonization of the individual's mind and heart and in a unification of selfhood and identity within the broader society, as evidenced with the literary tradition of Bildungsroman. In this sense, the process of harmonization of mind, heart, selfhood and identity is achieved through personal transformation, which presents a challenge to the individual's accepted beliefs. In Hegel's writings, the challenge of personal growth often involves an agonizing alienation from one's \\"natural consciousness\\" that leads to a reunification and development of the self. Similarly, although social unity requires well-formed institutions, it also requires a diversity of individuals with the freedom (in the positive sense of the term) to develop a wide-variety of talents and abilities and this requires personal agency. However, rather than an end state, both individual and social unification is a process that is driven by unrelenting negations. In this sense, education involves the shaping of the human being with regard to their own humanity as well as their innate intellectual skills. So, the term refers to a process of becoming that can be related to a process of becoming within existentialism. The term Bildung also corresponds to the Humboldtian model of higher education from the work of Prussian philosopher and educational administrator Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835). Thus, in this context, the concept of education becomes a lifelong process of human development, rather than mere training in gaining certain external knowledge or skills. Such training in skills is known by the German words Erziehung, and Ausbildung. Bildung in contrast is seen as a process wherein an individual's spiritual and cultural sensibilities as well as life, personal and social skills are in process of continual expansion and growth. Bildung is seen as a way to become more free due to higher self- reflection. Von Humboldt wrote with respect to Bildung in 1793/1794: > \\"Education [Bildung], truth and virtue\\" must be disseminated to such an > extent that the \\"concept of mankind\\" takes on a great and dignified form in > each individual (GS, I, p. 284). However, this shall be achieved personally > by each individual, who must \\"absorb the great mass of material offered to > him by the world around him and by his inner existence, using all the > possibilities of his receptiveness; he must then reshape that material with > all the energies of his own activity and appropriate it to himself so as to > create an interaction between his own personality and nature in a most > general, active and harmonious form\\".\\"Theory of Bildung\\" by Wilhelm von > Humboldt, Chapter 3 in Teaching As A Reflective Practice: The German > Didaktik Tradition edited by Ian Westbury, Stefan Hopmann, Kurt Riquarts Most explicitly in Hegel's writings, the Bildung tradition rejects the pre- Kantian metaphysics of being for a post-Kantian metaphysics of experience that rejects universal narratives. Much of Hegel's writings were about the nature of education (both Bildung and Erziehung), reflecting his own role as a teacher and administrator in German secondary schools, and in his more general writings.see Allen W. Wood \\"Hegel on Education, in Amélie O. Rorty (ed.) Philosophy as Education. London: Routledge, 1998. A more contemporary view was developed by Tony Waters: > Bildung, I discovered in my 2 years in Germany, is an organizing cultural > principle for German higher education that trumps both careerism and > disciplinary silos. It is generally translated as \\"education\\", but in fact > it means more—dictionary definitions often refer to \\"self-cultivation\\", > \\"philosophy\\", \\"personal and cultural maturation\\" and even \\"existentialism\\". > Bildung is the cry of the land of poets and thinkers against the demands of > credentialism, professionalism, careerism and the financial temptations > dangled to graduating students.\\"Teach Like You Do in America: Personal > Reflections on Teaching Across Borders in Tanzania and Germany.\\" Palgrave > Communications 1, Article number: 15026 (2015) doi:10.1057/palcomms.2015.26. In this way, fulfillment is achieved through practical activity that promotes the development of one's own individual talents and abilities which in turn lead to the development of one's society. In this way, Bildung does not simply accept the socio-political status quo, but rather it includes the ability to engage in a critique of one's society, and to ultimately challenge the society to actualize its own highest ideals. In their book The Nordic Secret -- A European Story of Beauty and Freedom, Lene Rachel Andersen and Tomas Björkman define Bildung like this: > Bildung is the way that the individual matures and takes upon him- or > herself ever bigger personal responsibility towards family, friends, fellow > citizens, society, humanity, our globe, and the global heritage of our > species, while enjoying ever bigger personal, moral and existential > freedoms. It is the enculturation and life-long learning that forces us to > grow and change, it is existential and emotional depth, it is life-long > interaction and struggles with new knowledge, culture, art, science, new > perspectives, new people, and new truths, and it is being an active citizen > in adulthood. Bildung is a constant process that never ends. In her latest book, Bildung: Keep Growing, Lene Rachel Andersen defines bildung as follows: > Bildung is moral and emotional maturity. Bildung is also to have the > education and knowledge necessary to thrive in your society; bildung is to > be deeply embedded in culture and community while having the autonomy to > carve your own path in life. Bildung is always personal and unique. The European Bildung Network define it like this: > Bildung is the combination of the education and knowledge necessary to > thrive in your society, and the moral and emotional maturity to both be a > team player and have personal autonomy. Bildung is also knowing your roots > and being able to imagine the future. The philosopher Jonathan Rowson has argued for the relevance of Bildung in attaining sustainable prosperity in the 21st century: > Our understanding of the world is not a spectator sport, but more like an > active ingredient in societal renewal. Bildung is about our responsibility > for and participation in an evolving process of social maturation that > reimagines culture, technology, institutions and policies for the greater > good. \\"Bildung in the 21st Century—Why sustainable prosperity depends upon > reimagining education\\" CUSP essay series on the Morality of Sustainable > Prosperity  No 9  Bildung in Germany today  In today’s German language, Bildung very often refers to no more than ’normal’ education. One of the strongest voices in Germany to challenge this perception is professor of philosophy, Julian Nida- Rümelin who has written extensively on a broader definition of bildung. Since the beginning of the Bologna Process, Nida-Rümelin has been particularly active in the public debate in Germany regarding the deterioration of the German bildung and educational system, which has been the consequence of the European standardization of education due to the Bologna Process.

She was the first fully American-trained musician to appear with a European orchestra. Harrison was born in La Porte, Indiana, and spent most of her childhood home schooled; but she attended La Porte High School, and graduated. As a child, she studied under Victor Heinze, eventually commuting between La Porte and Chicago to continue lessons with him. She spent most of her time in Berlin performing recitals and performing with the Berlin Philharmonic. She later returned to the United States, and while performing in Chicago received sponsorship to travel back to Europe. During the next several years, Harrison continued her studies with in Berlin. Van Dalan arranged for Harrison to have an audition with Italian composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni; after hearing her, Busoni, who had previously refused to accept more students, decided to oversee her training. She then began performing as a concert pianist both in Europe and the U.S., eluding much recognition in the U.S. in spite of the fact that she was lauded in the black press. In 1931, Harrison accepted a job as the head of the piano department at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Ralph Ellison took a comment by Harrison as the starting point for one of his essays, The Little Man at Chehaw Station. (Chehaw was the station on the Western Railway of Alabama, that served the Tuskeegee area.) In 1936 she moved to Washington, D.C. and accepted a teaching job at Howard University, where she remained until retirement in 1955. While teaching, Harrison still performed in the United States, and after retirement she accepted positions at Alabama A&M; University and Jackson College.

The island also contains freshwater lakes, including Intrusion Lake () a long lake, located north-northeast of Olstad Peak in central Annenkov Island. It was mapped by the British Antarctic Survey in 1972-73 and so named because its irregular shape is controlled by several intrusions of andesite along its north shore.

It was said to hold one of the most secure places in the world, a multi-storey car park. The car park is a 10-floor building with 440 parking bays, it is open 24 hours a day. Operated by Parksafe Systems, it has been listed as one of the most secure places in the world in a general interest news report. Security experts are generally amused by this claim, noting that bank vaults, prisons and military bases are generally seen as more secure. Competing car parks in the area are cheaper and closer to the main shopping centre but Bold Lane is still frequently used by shoppers. History Derby Museum note that the green door on the left used to be an entrance to the Borough Jail. The land on which the car park now stands was opened as a park on 7 July 1910. It was donated to the city by Temperance Union activist Mary Shuttleworth, widow of lace magnate Henry Boden. Known as Boden's Pleasaunce, the land was asphalted after the First World War and then redeveloped in the early 1970s. The car park originally opened in 1974. The decorative wrought iron gates still stand next to the building and include the Boden's Crest and a plaque dedicated to Henry Boden. In the 1990s, the car park became a haven for beggars and gained a reputation as a venue for various anti-social behaviours - in 1997, there were 161 reported cases of criminal activities including drug abuse and muggings. Also in 1997, Derby City Council contracted with Parksafe Systems to run the car park as a partnership, in an attempt to turn around the worsening problems. Ken Wigley, security systems inventor and proprietor of Parksafe Systems, agreed to pay for the majority of the installation costs in return for a percentage of the car park's takings. After a period of upgrades, the facility reopened on 18 January 1998. Since that date, there have been no reported criminal activities and the car park has gained the reputation of a highly-secure building. In a study published by science magazine BBC Focus in February 2003, the building was listed as one of the ten \\"most secure places in the world\\", alongside Air Force One, Area 51, and Fort Knox. Security systems On entrance to the car park the driver is issued with a barcoded ticket. This barcode is scanned by a ticket machine and linked to a specific parking bay when the driver types in the bay number. This activates the specially-designed motion sensor located in the ground beneath the car. When the driver returns they may only gain entrance to the building using their ticket and, on payment of the parking charges, the sensor is turned off. The sensor detects any movement of the car and triggers an alarm process if the associated parking ticket has not yet been marked as paid. As well as detecting the horizontal motion of the car being driven off the sensor also checks for vertical motion such as that caused by a person getting into the car. The car park is monitored by a control room operator using 190 CCTV cameras and a computerised map of the building. The operator also monitors pedestrian access and emergency buttons and has the ability to lock down all exit points. A PA system allows the operator to communicate with anybody inside the building. After several years of evidence that the system worked, a guarantee was introduced stating that the costs of repairing any damage caused by \\"theft of or theft from the vehicle while secured in the car park\\" would be covered by Parksafe Systems. To avoid fraudulent claims, the entrance includes several CCTV cameras that record the state of the cars before they are left in the car park. Following one customer complaint about a small scratch, foam barriers were placed between the parking bays to prevent doors opening into neighbouring vehicles.

Set c to this value. # calculate the average expected value for the rank product by: \\\\mathrm{E}_{\\\\mathrm{RP}}(g)=c/p. # calculate the percentage of false positives as : \\\\mathrm{pfp}(g)=\\\\mathrm{E}_{RP}(g)/\\\\mathrm{rank}(g) where \\\\mathrm{rank}(g) is the rank of gene g in a list of all n genes sorted by increasing \\\\mathrm{RP}. Exact probability distribution and accurate approximation Permutation re-sampling requires a computationally demanding number of permutations to get reliable estimates of the p-values for the most differentially expressed genes, if n is large. Eisinga, Breitling and Heskes (2013) provide the exact probability mass distribution of the rank product statistic. Calculation of the exact p-values offers a substantial improvement over permutation approximation, most significantly for that part of the distribution rank product analysis is most interested in, i.e., the thin right tail. However, exact statistical significance of large rank products may take unacceptable long amounts of time to compute. Heskes, Eisinga and Breitling (2014) provide a method to determine accurate approximate p-values of the rank product statistic in a computationally fast manner.

The Fernald Feed Materials Production Center (commonly referred to simply as Fernald or later NLO) is a Superfund site located within Crosby Township in Hamilton County, Ohio, as well as Ross Township in Butler County, Ohio. It was a uranium processing facility located near the rural town of New Baltimore, about 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Cincinnati, which fabricated uranium fuel cores for the U.S. nuclear weapons production complex from 1951 to 1989. During that time, the plant produced 170,000 metric tons uranium (MTU) of metal products and 35,000 MTU of intermediate compounds, such as uranium trioxide and uranium tetrafluoride. Fernald came under criticism in 1984 when it was learned that the plant was releasing millions of pounds of uranium dust into the atmosphere, causing major radioactive contamination of the surrounding areas. News about the plant's operations led to the 1989 closure of nearby Fort Scott Camp, then the oldest Roman Catholic summer camp in the country. History In 1948 the Atomic Energy Commission, predecessor to the U.S. Department of Energy, established \\"a large scale integrated facility for the production of fabricated uranium fuel cores by chemical and metallurgical techniques.\\" The plant was known as the Feed Materials Production Center since the uranium fuel cores it produced were the 'feed' for the AEC's plutonium production reactors. National Lead Company of Ohio, Contract Operator of the Feed Materials Production Center for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. The Feed Materials Production Center. NCLO-950. n. d. These nuclear reactors were located at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the Savannah River Site in South Carolina and at Hanford in the state of Washington. The uranium metal produced was in the form of derbies, ingots, billets and fuel cores. The FMPC also served as the country's central repository for another radioactive metal, thorium. The plant was located in the rural town of Fernald, which is about 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Cincinnati, Ohio, and occupies 1,050 acres (425 hectares). This location was chosen because it was between the uranium ore delivery ports of New York and New Orleans, and it was accessible to the other main AEC sites. In addition, the site was close to Cincinnati's large labor force, the landscape was level making the site's construction easy, it was isolated, which provided safety and security, and it was located 30 to 50 feet above a large water aquifer, which supplied the water needed for uranium metal processing. From 1951 to 1989 Fernald converted uranium ore into metal, and then fabricated this metal into target elements for nuclear reactors. Annual production rates ranged from a high in 1960 of 10,000 metric tons to a low in 1975 of 1,230 metric tons. Refining uranium metal was a process requiring a series of chemical and metallurgical conversions that occurred in nine specialized plants at the site. Contamination Releases from the Fernald site to the surrounding area resulted in exposure to community residents included ionizing radiation, soluble and insoluble forms of uranium, and various other hazardous chemicals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has conducted a historical exposure characterization and developed dose estimation models through the Fernald Dose Reconstruction Project, with an endpoint of developing an algorithm to estimate doses to individual persons who lived within the exposure assessment domain (the area within a ten kilometer radius from the center of the plant site). In addition to radioactive materials, many other non-radiological toxic substances were present in the production area as materials, by-products or products. Workers were exposed to chlorinated and non-chlorinated solvents, metals and metal salts, and nuisance dusts. Community residents may have been exposed to these substances through ground water pathways, soil contamination, and air dispersion of emissions from the site. Medical surveillance Two separate medical surveillance programs, for former workers and community residents, have been funded by settlements of class action litigation against National Lead of Ohio, a contractor for the Department of Energy. These Fernald Settlement Funds are administered by a US Federal Court, which maintains oversight of the Fernald Medical Monitoring Programs. The Fernald (Residents) Medical Monitoring Program (FMMP) is a voluntary ongoing medical surveillance program for community residents living within five miles of the perimeter of the Fernald site, and the Fernald Workers Medical Monitoring Program (FWMMP) is a program for former workers who were employed when National Lead of Ohio was the contractor. Activities of the medical monitoring programs include both periodic medical examinations and diagnostic testing and yearly questionnaire data collection. In January 2007, there were 9,764 persons enrolled in the FMMP and 2716 former workers enrolled in the FWMMP. The FMMP has an extensive computer database available for research studies. Samples of whole blood, serum, plasma and urine were obtained from all FMMP participants at the time of the initial examination, and over 100,000 one-ml aliquots of these biospecimens have been stored at −80 °C since then. Death of Dave Bocks In June 1984, 39-year-old pipe fitter, David \\"Dave\\" Bocks disappeared on shift and was reported missing. A witness reported seeing Bocks and a supervisor inside of a vehicle at about 4:00 AM with the windows rolled up on a hot night having a serious discussion. At 5:00 AM, the witness reported seeing Bocks and speaking with him, who stated he was putting up his tools and headed toward Plant 4.Stack, Robert (Host). Cosgrove, John (Director).

His remains were later discovered inside a uranium processing furnace located in Plant 6; a sudden 28-degree drop in furnace temperature (which was kept at a constant 1350 degrees F) had been recorded at 5:15 AM during the night of Bocks' disappearance. The investigations found insufficient evidence that foul play was involved. However, some, including Bocks' family, believed that he was murdered by one or more coworkers who suspected him of being a whistleblower in the 1984 nuclear emissions scandal. Production facilities Plant 1 The production process at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center begins at Plant 1, also known as the Sampling Plant. The principal function of the Sampling Plant was to obtain representative samples of the large quantities of incoming ore concentrates. This plant was divided into two main processing lines, one for Q-11 and one for INX. Q-11 was the term used to refer to radium bearing ores primarily mined in the Belgian Congo while INX was a non-radium concentrate. The problem with handling radium bearing ores was that one of radium's daughter particles is radon: an invisible radioactive gas. Q-11 was received in 55-gallon drums. The drums were deheaded before processing and were conveyed through a thawing tunnel, which also provided surge capacity of deheaded drums. The drums were lifted to the top of the building by a skip hoist where they were emptied into a surge hopper that feeds the magnetic separator and jaw crusher. From the jaw crusher, the one-half inch material passes through a rotary drum dryer to a system of conveyors, which conveys the material to a surge hopper that feeds the ring roll mill. The particle size output from the mill was controlled to about 100 mesh by an air classifier mounted directly on the mill. The undersized material was blown to a cyclone separator that was mounted directly above the first Gallagher sampler. The three Gallagher samplers in series each took a 10% cut of the stream fed to it, producing a sample approximately 0.1% of the original lot size. The main stream was conveyed to a drumming station where it was packaged in 55-gallon or 30-gallon drums for use in the Refinery. The official weight was taken at this point. The INX line was similar to the Q-11 line except that the thawing tunnel has been omitted and a hammer mill and bucket elevator replaces the jaw crusher, rotary dryer, ring roll mill, air classifier, and cyclone separator. In addition to sampling incoming ores this plant reconditions 30 and 55 gallon drums used to transport and store radioactive materials onsite. It also contains a safe-geometry digestion system used to process enriched uranium materials assaying up to 5% 235U. This digester was so named because the piping was of such a diameter and distance between pipes making a criticality incident nigh impossible. Plant 2/3 Plant 2/3 was known as the Ore Refinery & Denitration Plant. It was called Plant 2/3 because two separate functions occur in the same building. Here uranium values were recovered from feed materials (i.e., ores, concentrates and residues) and were converted to concentrated uranium trioxide, also called orange salt. In addition to uranium, the Refinery was capable of extracting and purifying a number of different materials. The Ore Refinery consists of three major process areas designated digestion (Plant 2), extraction and denitration (Plant 3). Support areas include nitric acid recovery, raffinate treatment and refinery sump. The digestion, extraction, and raffinate areas included 'hot' and 'cold' sides. To provide radiation protection from the radium-bearing Q-11 ore [the \\"hot\\" material], concrete shielding was provided around appropriate process equipment and the 'hot' side of each area was enclosed by concrete walls. The principal function of Plant 2/3 was uranium purification and conversion of uranium bearing materials into uranium trioxide (UO3), or orange oxide. There are three principal forms of uranium residues, each having a separate processing route for putting the uranium into solution. Uranium oxides are dissolved in 6000 gallon vats of pure nitric acid in the Oxide Digester (also known as the west metal dissolver), miscellaneous residues that required filtration were dissolved in the Slag Leach Digester, and metals were dissolved in the Metal Dissolver. If the ore was poured too rapidly into the nitric acid vats a condition known as a \\"boilover\\" results. The reaction generates so much gas that it becomes a foam and boils over the sides of the vat. Many workers were told to not step in any puddles on the floor as they were probably nitric acid left from one of these \\"boilover\\" incidents. The site employed their own cobblers just to repair work boots that had been exposed to too much acid. Another hazard was the nitrogen dioxide fumes coming off the nitric acid vats. There were so many fumes that on high humidity days during the summer there appeared to be an orange cloud encasing this building and anyone just walking past would experience a sensation as if he had wandered into a swarm of bees. The resulting \\"UNH\\" (uranium nitrate hexahydrate) material pumped out of the vats was then processed through extraction to purify the solution. The UNH solution was passed through a multistage liquid-liquid counter current tower with tributyl phosphate and kerosene to extract the uranyl nitrate. The impurities exit the tower as the raffinate stream for further processing. The extract solution was passed through another counter current extraction tower to re-extract the uranyl nitrate from the kerosene into deionized water. The kerosene was then processed through a wash to be recycled back through the extraction process. The resulting UNH solution was now ready for further concentrating and thermal denitration. The UNH solution was concentrated through a process known as \\"boildown\\". In this process, heat was applied to the solution from steam coils inside the boildown tanks. The water was removed through evaporation, thus concentrating the solution. The solution was concentrated from 90 grams uranium per liter to 1300 grams uranium per liter in two stages. The concentrated solution now in 250 gallon batches was further heated, in a process known as Pot Denitration, to thermally denitrate the UNH to uranium trioxide. The uranium trioxide material was then pneumatically removed from the denitration pots and packaged out in hoppers with a capacity of 3.6 metric tons or 55 gallon drums. This pneumatic transfer of the product was known as Gulping. Plant 4 The Green Salt Plant, the common name for Plant 4, produced \\"green salt\\" (uranium tetrafluoride) from UO3. Green salt was the key intermediate compound in the overall process of producing uranium metal. This plant contains 12 banks of furnaces for the conversion of uranium trioxide to uranium tetrafluoride. Each bank consists of four furnaces in series. The first furnace was constructed of stainless steel for the hydrogen reduction of orange oxide to uranium dioxide, by the reaction: UO3 \\\\+ H2 → UO2 \\\\+ H2O. The UO2 was then fed directly to the first of the next three furnaces in series. These furnaces were constructed of Inconel for the hydrofluorination of uranium dioxide to green salt. The reaction was: UO2 \\\\+ 4HF → UF4 \\\\+ 2H2O. Orange oxide was received from the Refinery in five-ton mobile hoppers, which were mounted on seal hoppers to feed the reduction furnace at a rate of approximately 375 pounds per hour for producing metal grade UF4. The powder was agitated and carried through the reduction furnace by a ribbon flight screw. Dissociated ammonia was metered to the reduction reactors and passed counter-currently to the bed of uranium oxide within the chemical reactor. The off-gases from the reduction reactors were passed to a hydrogen burner where the excess hydrogen was burned and then passed through a dust collector to remove any entrained uranium dioxide that might have been present. The UO2 in the reduction furnace passed through a seal hopper and a feed screw to the first of the three hydrofluorination furnaces. The bed of UO2 was moved through the hydrofluorination furnace by ribbon flight screws and contacted counter-currently by hydrofluoric acid vapors. The UF4 was removed from the third furnace and conveyed to a packaging station where the product was packaged in 10-gallon pails for use in the Metal Plant, or in 5-ton containers for shipment to the cascades. The off-gases containing water vapor formed in the reaction and excess hydrofluoric acid was removed from the first furnace and were sent to hydrofluoric acid recovery. The gases first passed to a partial condenser that removed all of the water in the form of 70% aqueous hydrofluoric acid. The remainder of the gases was then passed to a total condenser, which condenses the remainder of the acid as anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. The gases at this point contain only the nitrogen from seals and purge gases and small amounts of hydrofluoric acid that did not condense in the total condenser. These were passed through potassium hydroxide scrubbers to remove the last traces of acid and then discharged to the atmosphere. Plant 5 Plant 5, the Metals Production Plant main process equipment consisted of eleven jolters, five filling machines, forty-four reduction furnaces, two breakout stations in the Reduction Area and twenty-eight vacuum casting furnaces in the Recast Area. The conversion of UF to metal was accomplished by the thermite reduction of green salt with magnesium in a refractory lined steel reaction vessel. 450 pounds of green salt were blended with approximately 72 pounds of magnesium. The resulting mixture was uniformly packed into the reduction \\"bomb\\", which has previously been lined with refractory slag in a jolting apparatus. Following these steps, the bomb was capped with refractory, sealed, and placed in one of 49 electric muffle furnaces. The furnace temperature was raised to approximately 1,225 °F and after about four hours the thermite type reduction reaction occurs: UF4 \\\\+ 2Mg → 2MgF2 \\\\+ U (metal). The charge was then allowed to separate and cool in the furnace for 10 minutes, after which it was removed and cooled to room temperature. Finally, the solidified uranium metal (derby) was separated from the slag and liner materials in a sequence of manual and mechanical operations that take place at the breakout station. The yields expected from this operation were about 95%. There are many documented explosions of these furnaces due to improperly packed refractory lining or a magnesium flare. Whatever the cause, the building would fill with radioactive smoke along with a real probability that molten uranium metal would come pouring out of the bottom of the furnace. The MgF2 slag from the breakout station was conveyed to the slag recycling plant, where it was stored awaiting processing for reuse as refractory liner. The slag recovery process consists of crushing, pulverizing, and classifying the slag, which was then transferred back to the reduction area for use. The next step in the plant consists of melting massive uranium metal and casting an ingot. Graphite crucibles were loaded with a charge of derbies and solid recycle scrap. The loaded crucibles were then mechanically positioned in induction melting and casting furnaces that were designed to give a maximum of flexibility and a minimum of human exposure to radioactivity. The uranium metal was melted under high vacuum to minimize contamination of the melt with atmospheric gases and to permit purification of the metal by distillation of volatile contaminants. At approximately 2,550 °F, the molten metal was poured into a graphite mold and the ingot was allowed to cool and solidify. Additional equipment was provided for the ingot to be removed from the mold, weighed, cropped, sampled, and stored for further processing in the Metals Fabrication Plant [Plant 6]. The ingot was approximately 7\\" in diameter, by 45\\" long, and weighs about 1,200 pounds. Plant 6 Plant 6 was known as the Metals Fabrication Plant. \\"Ingots from Plant 5 and MCW Mallinckrodt Chemical Works were bloomed into billets and then rolled into rods that were straightened and machined to finished reactor slug dimensions. The finished product consists of either hollow or solid uranium slugs, designed for both internal and external cooling during pile irradiation. The product shipped from Plant 6 must pass rigid inspection for dimensional tolerances, metal quality, and surface conditions.\\" Uranium ingots were charged into an automated ingot preheat furnace where they were lowered into a Li2CO3-K2CO3 molten salt to be heated to 1,150–1,200 °F before being discharged singly to the mill table. The ingot was passed back and forth through the blooming mill until it was reduced to an oval billet approximately 2\\" to 2½\\". The ends of the billet were then cut off by a cropping shear before it was pushed into an equalizing furnace. The billet was reheated to 1,150–1,200 °F in the equalizing furnace and was then discharged into the finishing mill. The finishing mill consists of six stands that reduce the rod to the final diameter of 1.43\\" for Hanford rods, and 1.12\\" for Savannah River rods. The rods were cut into 22-foot lengths as they leave the last stand by means of a flying shear. The Savannah rods were air cooled to room temperature on the cooling bed and then were cold straightened in a Medart Straightener. Rods to be beta heat treated by-pass the cooling bed and were lifted into the beta heat treating furnace by means of a hoist, to be held at 1,320–1,365 °F for 11–20 minutes and then quenched in cold water. After quenching, these rods were conveyed to the Medart straightener for straightening. The rods were located in -inch Acme-Gridley automatic screw machines where slugs were cut from the rods. The Hanford slugs were then placed in the Heald machine, which cuts the slugs to desired lengths and finishes and radiuses the ends. The Savannah River slugs were reduced to exact dimensions of size, surface, and straightness on a centerless grinder after which a contour was placed on the surface by a thread rolling machine. The slugs were numbered and put on a basket on a conveyor that passes through a degreasing tank, pickling tank, two rinse tanks and a hot air dryer before depositing the slug basket in the Inspection Department. The slugs were inspected for seams, striations, dimensions and handling defects with the good slugs being packed for shipment. In addition to the solid slugs produced in Plant 6, hollow fuel element production was started about January 1, 1956. Hollow slug blanks were produced oversize on a 2⅝\\" RB-6 Acme-Gridley machine and were centerless ground before the drilling operation. The oversize slug blank was then loaded into a magazine loader on a 1⅝\\" Acme and thence through a four-step drilling operation making a hole halfway through the blank. The blank was then reversed and again placed in the magazine loader. After a four-step drilling sequence produces a hole all the way through the blank, a reamer was passed through this hole in the final position. The oversize Outer Diameter was turned concentric with the finished Inner Diameter on an automatic Sundstrand lathe. Subsequent operations were the same as those for the solid slug. Plant 7 Plant 7 was known as the 6 to 4 Plant because UF6 was converted to UF4 here. It was basically a high-temperature gas-to-solid reactor system that only operated for two years: 1954–1956. To produce UF4, the uranium hexafluoride was first heated to form a gaseous compound and was then reduced to UF4. The reduction occurs in a reaction with hydrogen. UF6 vapor and hydrogen will be mixed at the top of each reactor by means of a cyclonic type mixer. The bulk of the reduction reaction will occur at the top of the reactor. The UF4 formed will be a powdery solid that falls like snow to the bottom of the reactor. Plant 8 The Scrap Recovery Plant, the name given to Plant 8, process primarily involves upgrading uranium recycle materials from FMPC and off-site operations to prepare feed materials for head-end processing in the Refinery. Operations include drum washing, filtering Refinery tailings, operation of rotary kiln, box, muffle, and oxidation furnaces, and screening of furnace products. Bomb liner material received from Plant 5 in mobile hoppers was emptied at an unloading station and elevated to a surge hopper. Material as needed was sent from the surge hopper through a jaw crusher and into a shelf type oxidation furnace. Here the metallic uranium was oxidized to triuranium octoxide (U3O8). The material discharged from the furnace was lifted to a surge hopper and then as needed was sent through a roll mill and ground to -325 mesh size. It was then fed into carbon brick digestion tanks where the uranium was dissolved in hydrochloric acid containing a little sodium chlorate. The undissolved solids were filtered off and dumped into a truck, which hauls the spent material to a scrap dump. Uranium in the filtrate was sent to a precipitation tank and precipitated with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), in presence of phosphoric acid to form UAP (uranyl ammonium phosphate). The resulting slurry was filtered and the uranium bearing cake was introduced to a drying furnace. The dried UAP was sent to the refinery. In addition to the wet system described, several furnaces were installed in the plant for massive metal oxidation, pyrohydrolysis, drying, chip and sludge combustion, etc. Most of the furnaces can be used for more than one of the above operations. During the summer of 1962, a new facility was started in Plant 8 for the production of UF4 by an aqueous precipitation technique known as the Winlo process. The Winlo process was developed for the low-cost chemical conversion of relatively pure uranium concentrates to green salt by a hydrometallurgical process. The feed to the plant Winlo system was made up of a combination of black oxide (U3O8) generated by burning metallic residues, uranyl chloride solutions generated by dissolving massive metal residues in hydrochloric acid, and UAP produced from low-grade residues in the hydrometallurgical recovery system. A brief description of the Winlo process follows: # 1. UAP (UO2NH4PO4) and (U3O8) were introduced through a new dumping station into an existing digester. Water, hydrochloric and nitric acids, and copper sulfate were added to the digester and the resultant slurry was agitated and heated to 200 °F by means of a new heat exchanger. # The digested slurry was pumped to an existing Oliver precoat rotary filter. # The filter cake was dropped to a drumming station, and the filtrate was pumped to one of two new agitated precipitation tanks. Each of these tanks contained a heat exchanger to heat the filtrate to 200 °F. Thirty percent hydrofluoric acid was metered to the filtrate from a storage tank. Then a metered quantity of sulfur dioxide was added from a storage tank during a period of 3 to 5 hours. # The precipitated green salt was dropped by gravity to a pan-type filter where the green salt was washed and dried. # The filtrate from the pan filter was neutralized in a new system and pumped to the chemical pit. The filter cake was dropped to a holoflite conveyor where it dried to UF4*3/4H2O and conveyed to a mobile hopper. # These hoppers were transported to the Green Salt Plant and placed over an unused bank of reactors. The material was fed to these reactors countercurrent to a flow of anhydrous HF. The reactors were heated to 850 °F to dehydrate the green salt hydrate, and the reactor bank product was blended with regular production green salt in existing equipment. The diluted hydrofluoric acid gas was handled by the existing off-gas system. Plant 9 The primary purpose of Plant 9, the Special Products Plant was to process slightly enriched uranium and to cast larger ingots than those produced in Plant 5. The plant contains facilities for producing derbies, ingots, slugs, and washers of various enrichments. Construction of the plant as a thorium metal production process was completed in 1954 and the thorium process was begun in October 1954. Plant 9 was originally designed and constructed as a thorium metal production plant, yet had to be regarded as a semi-development works because of a lack of process information. The two basic processes, hydrofluoric acid precipitation of thorium fluoride and induction de-zincing and melting, which were used to start the plant, were not able to produce a pure metal. However, improvement in production techniques permitted the eventual development of an oxalate precipitation process capable of producing pure thorium metal. Interest in this item declined during the 1956–1957 period and the plant operations evolved to the casting of enriched uranium ingots larger than those being processed in the Metals Production and Metals Fabrication Plants. Ingots were cast up to 13-inch diameter, 38-inch length and having a weight approaching 2,000 pounds. As such the processes and equipment used were almost identical to those of Plants 5 and 6. Pilot Plant The Pilot Plant consists of small size equipment for piloting refinery operations, hexafluoride reduction, derby pickling, ingot casting, and other equipment for special purposes. This plant was used for numerous process testing and experimental operations as well as being employed as a production facility for various processes. In the early years, derbies were produced there, in the manner described in Plant 5. Another process operated on a production scale was the direct conversion of uranium hexafluoride to green salt. This production process was operated with UF6 that contained as much as 2.5% U235. A two-step procedure was used. First was the vaporization of UF6: solid UF6 in large 10 or 14 ton cylinders were heated in autoclaves at approximately 110 °C to produce gaseous UF6. The next step was the reduction of the UF6 gas, which involved mixing it with hydrogen gas at 480–650 °C in metal reactors to produce UF4 powder. Hydrogen fluoride was a valuable byproduct of the reaction, which was: UF6 \\\\+ H2 → UF4 \\\\+ 2HF. In addition, most of the thorium production activity at the FMPC took place inside the Pilot Plant. Thorium production activities began in 1964 and continued until 1980. The Pilot Plant met the needs of development projects and special orders. Some of the equipment that was available for and had been used in enriched processing was as follows: * Oxidation Furnace: with special high-temperature steel alloy pans enclosed cooling and unloading, and special two-stage dust collection. * Vacuum Furnaces: two furnaces, with perclene cooling, and all auxiliaries including vacuum pumps, three power hacksaws, crucible and mold preparation facilities, and dust collection have been used at temperatures up to 3,360 °F (for melting thorium). * Reduction to Metal: two systems representing step- down of size reduction in two stages from the full-scale production units for reducing UF4 to metal were available in the Pilot Plant. The smaller system can handle full enrichments, the other intermediate enrichments Reduction pots, blenders, mandrels, furnaces and all auxiliary equipment were available for use as required. * Heat Treating: a large, versatile, salt-bath unit was available with quench baths of molten salt, molten metal, water, or oil and a fast acting hoist. * Shot-Blast Cleaning Unit: this unit can clean castings of any shape up to four feet in the largest dimension and employs uranium shot as the blasting medium. * Machining Chips Recovery System: consisting of a chip crusher, washing system, pickling, drying, and finally briquetting in a hydraulic press. The machine has been used on materials enriched up to 2% U-235. * Solvent Extraction System: three versatile sets of extraction columns, 2-inches, 6-inches and 9-inches in diameter, were available with all auxiliaries. This includes digesters, fume scrubbers, pumps, controls, boildown system, neutralizer, filters, and more than 12 stainless steel tanks ranging from 100 to 8000 gallons in capacity. * Dry Preparation System: this includes two crushers, a small continuous ball mill, a multi-split mechanical screen, and a large dust collection system. * UF6 Hydrolysis - UO2 Precipitation: a system for efficiently absorbing quantities of UF6 in water at rates up to 800 pounds per hour was available. The UO2F2-HF solution can then be neutralized to ammonium diuranate, filtered, washed, and dried to UO2 using components of the system previously described above. * Calciner: a small (6-inch diameter) Inconel-tube rotary calciner with precision electric heating was available for jobs such as UF4 dehydration, ADU (Ammonia Diuranate) calcining, and the like. Its small size meets geometry limits for nuclear safety. * Decladding: a rubber-lined tank was set up and used as needed to remove zirconium cladding from reject fuel cores. Equipment for removal of other metals, such as steel or aluminum, was available also. * UF6 to UF4 Production Facility: conversion UF6 to UF4 using cracked ammonia. HF was produced as a by-product. Fernald Closure Project Workers working in a Rubb building to clean up Thorium-Bearing waste. The Fernald Closure Project is a program run by the United States Department of Energy to clean up the former uranium processing site Fernald Feed Materials Production Center. In 1990, Congress approved closure of the site approved environmental cleanup of the facility. Fluor Fernald, part of the Fluor Corporation, was awarded the contract in 1992 for cleanup of the site. Fluor Fernald completed their portion of the cleanup in October 2006, 12 years ahead of schedule and 7.8 billion dollars below the original cost estimate. The waste was permanently buried at Waste Control Specialists. The site is permanently unfit for human habitation, according to federal scientists, and \\"will have to be closely monitored essentially forever.\\" Cleanup costs were estimated at $1 billion over 10 years. Fernald Preserve LEED platinum awarded Fernald Preserve Visitor Center The $4.4 billion cleanup of the surface areas was completed in December 2006, and the site was turned into the Fernald Preserve nature preserve. Thousands of tons of contaminated concrete, sludge, liquid waste, and soil were removed from the site and replaced with man-made wetlands and greenery. Ongoing cleanup operations include routine monitoring of the environmental conditions with test wells, including the uranium groundwater plume extending south of the plant area, storage of residual waste onsite, and filtering of uranium contamination from the Great Miami River aquifer. These cleanup operations, along with restrictions on establishing new wells in areas exceeding water contaminant limits, will continue for the foreseeable future.http://www.lm.doe.gov/documents/sites/oh/fernald/secondfive_year_review.pdf EPA 5-year report  Citations   General references  # Golightly, Eric J.

An adjacency pair is composed of two utterances by two speakers, one after the other. The speaking of the first utterance (the first-pair part, or the first turn) provokes a responding utterance (the second-pair part, or the second turn). Adjacency pairs are a component of pragmatic variation in the study of linguistics, and are considered primarily to be evident in the \\"interactional\\" function of pragmatics.Rüegg, Larssyn. “Thanks Responses in Three Socio- Economic Settings: A Variational Pragmatics Approach.” Journal of Pragmatics, vol. 71, Elsevier B.V., Sept. 2014, pp. 17–30, https://www.sciencedirect.com/search/advanced?docId=10.1016/j.pragma.2014.07.005. Adjacency pairs exist in every language and vary in context and content among each, based on the cultural values held by speakers of the respective language. Oftentimes, they are contributed by speakers in an unconscious way, as they are an intrinsic part of the language spoken at-hand and are therefore embedded in speakers' understanding and use of the language. Thus, adjacency pairs may present their challenges when a person begins learning a language not native to them, as the cultural context and significance behind the adjacency pairs may not be evident to a speaker outside of the primary culture associated with the language.  Usage  Adjacency pairs are most commonly found in what Schegloff and Sacks described as a \\"single conversation,\\" a unit of communication in which a single person speaks and a second person replies to the first speaker's utterance. While the turn-taking mechanism of single conversation uses silence to indicate that the next speaker's turn may begin, adjacency pairs are used to show that both speakers are finished with the conversation and that the ensuing silence does not require either of the speakers to take another turn. The prevalent use of adjacency pairs in greetings and terminal exchanges demonstrate the adjacency pair's primary function of being an organizational unit of conversation. Without the signal and expected response of the two utterances, the silence of one speaker may be never filled by the second speaker, or filled incorrectly. Adjacency pairs also convey politeness and a willingness from one speaker to acknowledge the feelings of the second speaker. For example, in English the greeting \\"How are you?\\" is mostly commonly followed by \\"I'm doing well,\\" thus creating an adjacency pair that demonstrates a polite interest from one speaker and a reciprocal acknowledgment of that interest from the other. Failure to reply politely to the greeting \\"How are you?\\" is usually a sign of bad manners or an unwillingness to converse, thus showing how an adjacency pair is necessary to establish a working rapport between two speakers.  Examples of pairs  Many actions in conversation are accomplished through established adjacency pairs, examples of which include: *call/beckon → response :\\"Waiter!\\" → \\"Yes, sir\\" *complaint → excuse/remedy :\\"It's awfully cold in here\\" → \\"Oh, sorry, I'll close the window\\" *compliment → acceptance/refusal :\\"I really like your new haircut!!\\" → \\"Oh, thanks\\" *degreeting → degreeting response :\\"See you!\\" → \\"Yeah, see you later!\\" *inform → acknowledge :\\"Your phone is over there\\" → \\"I know\\" *greeting → greeting response :\\"Hiya!\\" → \\"Oh, hi!\\" *offer → acceptance/rejection :\\"Would you like to visit the museum with me this evening?\\" → \\"I'd love to!\\" *question → answer :\\"What does this big red button do?\\" → \\"It causes two-thirds of the universe to implode\\" *request → acceptance/rejection :\\"Is it OK if I borrow this book?\\" → \\"I'd rather you didn't, it's due back at the library tomorrow\\"  Cultural significance  In some contexts, adjacency pairs may act as an indicator of varying demographic elements. For instance, restaurants are a setting notorious for the adjacency pair that presents a 'thank you', followed by some response eliciting acceptance of the gratitude displayed by the 'thank you'. A variety of responses to the statement 'thank you' have been recorded, and an English speaker's choice of response may imply details of his dialect and ultimately his place of origin. For instance, the employment of 'you're welcome' as the second half of this adjacency pair is most often indicative of an English speaker's residence within the United States. American English is the English dialect most highly associated with 'you're welcome' as a response to 'thank you', while other dialects of English (e.g. British and Irish English) may deem this phrase more formal than other options. The phrase 'my pleasure' is also most commonly associated with American English. British English speakers, in contrast, often omit a response to 'thanks' when it is presented to them. Additionally, the \\"'thank you' followed by an acknowledgement of gratitude\\" adjacency pair may work as an indicator of socioeconomic status based on when/in what context an English speaker decides to propose a 'thank you' statement. Nine restaurants in Los Angeles- representative of three different socioeconomic backgrounds- were studied by scholar Larssyn Staley from the University of Zurich to create an understanding of this idea. The results indicated that the offer of gratitude displayed in the 'thank you' statement is evident most prominently in non-verbal acts of service (e.g. presenting the check after the meal or wiping the table between courses) particularly among customers dining at restaurants in the highest and mid-socioeconomic levels. However, no 'thank you' comment was offered for non-verbal service acts in the restaurant representing the lowest socioeconomic level. The category most susceptible to 'thank you' comments from customers in the restaurant with the lowest socioeconomic association was the a verbal, explicit offer of service (e.g. Is there anything more I can get for you?) and this same category received the second highest quantity of 'thank you' offers in both the highest and mid-socioeconomic settings.  Three-part interchange  A three-part exchange occurs after the first speaker in a conversation adds an additional response to the former two utterances. The third part serves many conversational functions, including evaluation of the response, recognition of an acceptable response, and comprehension of the response. Additionally, the third part can initiate topic bounding, a technique used to end a conversational exchange. In face-to-face communication, the third utterance can also be expressed non-verbally. Conversational transcripts may leave out non-verbal third part responses, falsely indicating that a third part is missing from the conversation Much like adjacency pairs themselves, the various types of three-part interchanges may be associated most closely with specific social settings and contextual situations. The evaluative three-part interchange (example displayed below) is commonly found in education settings, particularly within elementary education. The use of the evaluative three-part interchange has proven itself useful in such a setting as it helps teachers to ascertain themselves as both educators and \\"evaluators\\", in that the interchange grants them the opportunity to ask their students questions to which they already know the answers. In doing so, the teacher has the capacity to offer evaluation of a response as he can determine whether or not an answer is acceptable based on his own understanding of what answer is \\"correct\\". Adversely, if a teacher were to ask a question for which he did not know the answer, he would lose the ability to contribute the third part of this interchange as it would not be appropriate for him to determine the quality of the answer, as he himself has no certainty in its validity. Thus, the evaluative three-part interchange is often indicative of a classroom setting where this educator and evaluator combination is frequently perpetuated.

Hayes was key in developing Ford's Formula One program, by signing Jackie Stewart and funding the building of the Cosworth DFV V8 Formula One racing engine; and the creation of the Premier Automotive Group with the purchases of classic English brands Jaguar and Aston Martin. Biography Walter Leopold Arthur Hayes was born in Harrow, Middlesex, the eldest child of lithographer Walter Leopold Hayes and Hilda Beatrice Fisher. Hayes won a scholarship to Hampton School, and served in the Royal Air Force, where he was a cadet pilot.Ford remembers former PR executive and educator. Journalist After World War II, as the son of a lithographer Hayes found entry to Fleet Street relatively easy through the network of printing chapels, which controlled newspaper production in the United Kingdom at the time. Working his way up through the defined path of local, regional and national journalistic work; dedicated pipe smoker Hayes became associate editor of the Daily Mail and in 1956 and at the age of 32, the last editor of the \\"Sunday Dispatch\\" newspaper. Looking for something different to revive the motoring column, he was introduced to Lotus Cars owner Colin Chapman, who became an occasional contributor and commentator. Ford Married with a son and resident at the time in Surrey, Hayes was seeking a secure future for his family when Ford asked him whether he would become head of Ford UK's public relations department. Although it meant crossing the tracks and probably never returning to journalism due to the prejudices at the time, Hayes accepted the job as head in January 1962. Ford had a series of dour but reliable products, including the Ford Cortina and Ford Zodiac. Hayes concluded that a push into racing and competition was key to developing the image, and in his very first weeks in his job he gave the go-ahead for his first motor sport activity with support for the successful private entrant Tony Brookes attack on six International class G World records at Montlhery with the 105E Anglia. Two tears later he supported the same team in capturing 13 World Records in International class F with a Corsair GT at Monza. Under the project and campaign brand of \\"Total Performance\\" the thrust of Ford worldwide.Rear View Mirror was so successful, Hayes elevated Ford's public perception from that of vaguely sinister giant of car manufacturing to purveyor of cars which, while resolutely egalitarian, oozed speed, power, guts and sex appeal. =Racing= The Ford GT40, an early input to Ford's PR from Hayes One of the first crises Hayes had to deal with was the fallout of Ferrari's rejection of the proposed Ford takeover. Hayes became part of the team that supported Henry Ford II's thoughts that Ford should take on Ferrari directly in their own home market of racing. Hayes initiated discussion with Cooper which didn't come to fruition; but agreements with Lotus resulted in a successful Indianapolis 500 program, and with Lola to design, engineer and produce the prototypes of the all conquering Ford GT40. Jackie Stewart in the Matra-Cosworth at the Nürburgring in 1969 As well as reviving the rallying program, one of Hayes first accomplishments was to sign relatively unknown Scottish racing driver Jackie Stewart. Stewart was attending the 1964 British International Motor Show at Earl's Court, London, when Hayes approached him and later offered Stewart £500 to promote Ford products in 1965, along with the white Ford Zodiac that was the centrepiece of Ford's exhibit to drive that year. Stewart later commented: “I didn’t know who Walter Hayes was, but I did know that to have a contract with Ford Motor Company was a big deal with great opportunities for the future, even though I wasn’t yet aware that Ford would enter Formula One.” The relationship was to last forty years, and be so successful it was the model for other Formula One stars and motor manufacturers.Media.Ford.com: FORD HONOURS SIR JACKIE STEWART AS THEIR 40-YEAR BUSINESS ASSOCIATION DRAWS TO A CLOSE =Cosworth DFV= The Lotus Cortina, a product of Lotus Cars co-operation with Ford thanks to Hayes Hayes next project came about as an approach from Colin Chapman. Chapman's cars had until that point relied on power from fast revving Coventry Climax engines, but with the change in Formula One regulations to three litre capacity from 1966, Coventry Climax decided for business reasons not to develop a large capacity engine. Chapman had approach the fledgling Cosworth group, with Keith Duckworth commenting that he could produce a competitive three litre engine, given a development budget of £100,000. Chapman approach Ford and also David Brown of Aston Martin, each without initial success. Hayes arranged diner for Chapman with Harley Copp, an American engineer who had backed and engineered Ford's successful entry into NASCAR in the 1950s.Walter Hayes: Racing's Ultimate Insider Hayes and Copp developed a business plan, which was backed by Ford UK's new chairman Stanley Gillen, and approved by Ford's Detroit head office as a two part plan – stage one would produce a four-cylinder twin-cam engine for Formula Two; by May 1967, stage two would produce a V-8 Formula One unit. In return, Chapman agreed to engineer \\"specials\\" for Ford, the first of which was 1963's Lotus Cortina. Revealed by Hayes in a PR launch in Detroit at the end of 1965, the Ford Cosworth DFV won its first race – the Dutch Grand Prix on 4 June 1967, in a Lotus 49 driven by Jim Clark. Graham Hill was in the team was at the specific request of Ford and Hayes, who wanted to be sure that a strong driving cadre would be seated ahead of their engines. Ligier JS11 Initially, the agreement between Ford, Cosworth and Lotus was binding on all parties, and Ford as the funder had no plans to sell or hire the DFV to any other teams. However, it occurred to Hayes that there was no competition – the Ferrari was underpowered; the BRM complex and too heavy; the unreliable Maserati; Brabham was powered by the Oldsmobile-derived V8 Repco ; the overweight Honda; while Dan Gurney's Eagle Weslake was beautiful, powerful and sleek, but often unreliable.F1 – Grandprix.com > Features > News Feature > Walter Hayes – The Father of the DFV Hayes concluded that Ford's name could become tarnished, and that they should agree to use the unit in other teams, and hence potentially dominate Formula One. Chapman, on the back of the pairs long friendship agreed, and Hayes could release the DFV initially to rival French team Matra, headed by Ken Tyrrell with Jackie Stewart as a driver. Still the most successful Grand Prix engine ever, sixteen years later it was still taking the chequered flag – a DFV-powered Tyrrell Racing car won the 1983 Detroit Grand Prix, the engine's 155th race victory: with the Ford logo branded on the side of every one. At the start of the DFV project, Hayes told Henry Ford II that he thought the DFV engine was \\"fairly likely\\" to win a World Championship. In 1997 a group of people gathered at Donington Park to commemorate the DFV's 30th anniversary. Jackie Stewart said a few words, making comments on an engine which had made him as well as Graham Hill, Jochen Rindt, Emerson Fittipaldi, James Hunt, Mario Andretti, Alan Jones, Nelson Piquet and Keke Rosberg. It had also brought championships to teams: Lotus, Matra, Tyrrell, McLaren and Williams; and won races for Hesketh, March, Penske, Shadow and Wolf. =Henry Ford II= During the crisis of the Ferrari purchase/development of the GT40, and latterly the development of the Ford Cosworth DFV, Hayes would often meet with Henry Ford II. The pair got on well, and thanks to the success of the DFV, Henry appointed Hayes to the board of one of his major projects, the establishment of Ford of Europe at its founding in 1967. Henry Ford II also trusted Hayes judgement, and when in February 1975, Ford was caught drunk-driving up a one- way street in Santa Barbara, Hayes suggested he use a Benjamin Disraeli quote for the waiting press: \\"Never complain, never explain.\\"Obituary: Walter Hayes  Independent, The (London)  Find Articles at BNET.com Hayes was one of many who wrote a biography of Henry Ford II, writing \\"Henry: a memoir of Henry Ford II (1990)\\" in which he commented that Ford treated \\"housemaids and hotel maids and secretaries and drivers and the people in the plants like dukes and duchesses\\". Hayes returned to Europe as vice-president of Ford of Europe, and became vice-chairman in 1976. In 1980 he was made a vice-president of the American parent under new Ford chairman Philip Caldwell, and moved to Detroit to head public affairs for the Corporation. He launched new motorsports initiatives there, including the IMSA GTP projects. Hayes was appointed CBE for services to the motor industry in 1982. Retirement? When Caldwell retired, Hayes returned to Britain as vice-chairman of Ford of Europe. In 1989, Hayes was instrumental in setting up the Premier Automotive Group, when he agreed with a now English-homed Henry Ford II to purchase AC Cars, then a stake in Aston Martin, and then Jaguar Cars. Hayes retired from Ford of Europe in December 1989. Aston Martin In May 1987, former RAF pilot Gauntlett and Prince Michael of Kent were staying at the home of Contessa Maggi, the wife of the founder of the original Mille Miglia, while watching the revival event – another house guest was Hayes. Despite problems over the previous acquisition of AC Cars, Hayes saw the potential of the brand and the discussion resulted in Ford taking a share holding in September 1987.ClassicInside – The ClassicDriver Newsletter The \\"small Aston/DB7\\" released under Hayes chairman ship of Aston Martin Hayes recognized the need for a higher-volume, lower cost Aston Martin, and under his guidance the plans for a DB7 were created and the car was brought into production.https://walterhayes.co.uk/aston-martin-article/the-birth-of-the- db7-by-walter-hayes-aston-december-2001/ His first move was to shrewdly appointed the industrialist Sir David Brown, an enthusiastic backer of Aston Martin in its post-war glory days, as honorary life president – a small move that nonetheless did wonders for Aston's image among its heritage-conscious customers. In 1992, the Vantage version was announced, and the following year the company renewed the DB range by announcing the Jaguar XJS based, Tom Walkinshaw's TWR Group engineered \\"small Aston\\"/DB7 – which ensured survival by boosting production by 500%. Ford substantially invested in new manufacturing and quickly ramped-up production. In 1994, Ford opened a new factory at Banbury Road in Bloxham, after which Hayes retired again. Family Hayes lived at Battlecrease Hall in Shepperton; he and his wife Elizabeth (née Holland) had two sons and a daughter.Who Was Who, 1996-2000, volume X, Palgrave, p. 257 Quotations * \\"'That engine was literally done by Keith Duckworth, and he designed all the test rigs for it, too.

Danthorpe is centred on Southfield Lane, the road running from Burton Pidsea to Humbleton, and just south of its junction with Back Lane running 1 mile west to the parish village of Elstronwick. Danthorpe is listed in the Domesday Book as 'Danetorp', in the Hundred of Holderness, and was of 5.2 geld units—taxable units assessed by hide area—and contained one ploughland, 3.8 households, and one smallholder. In 1066 the lordship was held by the Canons of Beverley St John, who held thirty-three manors in the east of Yorkshire under the overlordship of Ealdred, Archbishop of York. This lordship was retained by the Beverley canons in 1086, under the following archbishop of York, Thomas of Bayeux, who was also Tenant-in-chief to king William I. In 1823, Baines recorded that Danthorpe was in the parish of Humbleton, and the wapentake and the liberty of Holderness, and had a population of 56 including a corn miller and three farmers.Baines, Edward (1823): History, Directory and Gazetteer of the County of York, pp.192, 193 At the east of Danthorpe is the farm of the Grade II listed Danthorpe Hall.

Its primary use was to measure the cross- sectional area of pipes in Roman water distribution systems. A \\"one quinaria\\" pipe is 2.31 centimeters (0.91 in) in diameter. In Roman times, there was considerable ambiguity regarding the origin of the name, and the actual value of a quinaria. According to Frontinus: > ...Those who refer (the quinaria) to Vitruvius and the plumbers, declare > that it was so named from the fact that a flat sheet of lead 5 digits wide, > made up into a round pipe, forms this ajutage. But this is indefinite, > because the plate, when made up into a round shape, will be extended on the > exterior surface and contracted on the interior surface. The most probable > explanation is that the quinaria received its name from having a diameter of > 5/4 of a digit... In other words, Vitruvius claimed that the name was derived from a pipe created from a flat sheet of lead \\"5 digits wide\\", roughly 9.25 centimeters (3.64 in), but Frontinus contested the definitiveness of this because the exterior circumference of the resulting pipe would be larger than the interior circumference. According to Frontinus, the name and value is derived from a pipe having a diameter of \\"5/4 of a digit\\". Using Vitruvius' standard, the value of a quinaria is 6.81 square centimeters (1.03 sq in), and the resulting pipe would have a diameter of 2.94 centimeters (1.16 in). The importance of this measure was that water taxes in ancient Rome were based on the size of the supply pipe.Robert Graves See also: .

Design and development The original OH-6 Cayuse helicopter proved its worth during the Vietnam War in the light helicopter role. The designers at Hughes realized there was a market for a light multi-mission helicopter with an improved equipment fit than the OH-6 and Model 500M. The resulting design was the Model 500MD Defender which first flew in 1976. It was tailored for specific roles including unarmed observation and an armed scout helicopter equipped with TOW anti-tank missiles. An anti- submarine version was developed with a search radar, magnetic anomaly detector and the capability to carry lightweight aerial torpedoes. The helicopter was popular with customers like Kenya who could buy a capable anti-armor helicopter for less than half the cost of a gunship such as the AH-1 Cobra or the AH-64 Apache. Israel used the Defender extensively during the conflicts of the late 1970s and 1980s against Syrian armored forces. The Defender was later built as an improved version as the MD530MG, with increased engine power, handling, avionics, and a redesigned forward fuselage. Later developments included a mast mounted sight (MMS).

The KUS-VH is envisioned to perform missions including ISR, attack, aerial delivery, coast guard, amphibious landing support, and emergency reinforcement to back up manned helicopter units. A KUS-VH unit would consist of two to four aircraft and sensor packages, a ground control system and ground support system, and it could operate alone or in conjunction with manned attack helicopters.

This caused Boeing to try and block MD Helicopters from participating, citing agreements the companies struck in 2005 to offer the Mission Enhanced Little Bird in the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter program. As part of the venture, MD Helicopters sold intellectual property related to the aircraft's design. The two companies lost the bid and the program was ultimately cancelled. When MD Helicopters disclosed plans to offer the MD 540F in the AAS program in April 2012, Boeing claimed that they could not sell any \\"similarly configured\\" aircraft to any U.S. or foreign military organization. Boeing offered their AH-6 in the competition. MD Helicopters said Boeing did not object to previous sales to armed forces and governments in Japan, Jordan, and Italy, as well as to U.S. special operations, and local U.S. police forces. Restrictions on selling aircraft similar to the Little Bird, domestically or to foreign users, would have put the company out of business.

Background Throughout the 19th century South Georgia was a sealers' base and, in the following century, became a whalers' base. Prince Olav Harbour is the site of one of the seven main whaling bases established on South Georgia. Prince Olav Harbour was the location of a former Norwegian whaling station operational dating from 1911. History The whaling station was initially a floating factory site, a shore station being set up in 1916. The whaling station continued as a shore station until March 1931 and then was closed. The name was in use as early as 1912 and was given by Norwegian whalers for Crown Prince Olav of Norway.Whaling Stations on South Georgia (The James Caird Society) The wreck of the ship Brutus remains, semi-submerged, where she was deliberately beached to serve as a coaling station. The ship was built in Glasgow in 1883 as the Sierra Pedrosa, and measured 1,686 gross registered tons. Aftyer serving as a coal hulk at Cape Town, she was towed to South Georgia in about 1912. Brutus Island in the harbour is named after it.  Named locations  Several locations in and around Prince Olav Harbour have been charted and named by various Antarctic survey and exploration groups, primarily by Discovery Investigations (DI) personnel in their 1929–30 expedition. Unless noted otherwise, the following locations were first named by DI personnel. Point Abrahamsen separates Prince Olav Harbour from Lighthouse Bay on the north side of Prince Olav Harbour. It was probably named for Captain Abrahamsen, manager of the whaling station at Prince Olav Harbour at that time. Southwest of it sits Razor Point, first named on a 1938 British Admiralty chart. Fine Point and Sheer Point are found close by. Dinghy Point sits on the south side of the harbor. Dinghy Point was originally called \\"Pram Point\\", but was renamed Dinghy Point by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1991 to avoid duplication with Pram Point at Leith Harbour in Stromness Bay. To the east is the descriptively-named East Bay, mile wide. It was named by the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition, a British expedition under Ernest Shackleton, which visited South Georgia in 1921-22. Squire Point lies at the north side of the entrance to East Bay. The name appears on a 1938 British Admiralty chart. Sheep Point marks the south entrance to the harbour, separating it from Cook Bay. Hay Peak sits at the head of the bay. Near the center of the harbour sits Brutus Island.

Playing career  Williams started his career as a youth with minor amateur clubs Phoenix and Erith before joining Royal Arsenal in 1891. He spent his first two seasons in and out of the first team, and started the 1893–94 season, Arsenal's first in the Football League, as regular goalkeeper, being in goal for Arsenal's very first game against Newcastle United on 2 September 1893. However, Williams was in goal for some of Arsenal's most heavy defeats that season, including a 6–0 defeat to Newcastle United and a 5–0 loss to Liverpool. Arsenal signed Harry Storer in the 1894 close season and duly sold Williams on to Manchester City; he had played 23 first-class matches in total for Arsenal. At City, he was regular goalkeeper for eight seasons, and while there he won a Second Division winners' medal in 1898–99, and became the first goalkeeper in history to score a goal from open play, with a long clearance against Sunderland at Roker Park on 14 April 1900. He later had spells with Tottenham Hotspur, Norwich City and Brentford, making 59 Southern League appearances for the latter club.  Coaching career  Already in 1905 and 1907 there are reports of Williams taking charge of Københavns Boldklub (KB) in Denmark. In the Danish source it is written, that Williams had quit football already in 1905.Idrætsbladets Julenummer, 1933 (\\"Udenlandske Fodboldtrænere i Danmark\\" af Harry Bendixen) After retiring as a player, he became a manager and took charge of the Danish national team, whom he led through the football tournament of the 1908 Olympics in London. After defeating the French B and A teams 9–0 and 17–1, Denmark lost the final gold medal match to Great Britain 2–0. He also later managed the Danish club B 93 and French side Olympique Lillois. Early 1911 Oscar Cox, co-founder of recently established Fluminense FC of Rio de Janeiro, on a visit in London, hired Williams to coach his club. For this Williams was remunerated with a monthly salary of £18 plus accommodation, food and two return voyages.Diário de Notícia (RJ): \\"Um treinador profissional há 23 annos passados\\", 27 July 1939. The man who \\"knows all the secrets and means of the violent sport,\\" arrived on 16 March 1911 in Rio aboard the boat Oropesa, becoming the first ever professional football coach in Brazil – Fluminense itself had been managed by a Ground Committee up to this point.O Pais (RJ), 17 March 1911, p. 9 With the club he won the Championship of Rio of 1911 with an impressive record of six wins, no draws and no defeats and 21–1 goals. However, the next year was disappointing, with only a mediocre fifth place in the competition, now enlarged to eight clubs. During the 1912 championship he also managed the team in the first ever Fla-Flu derby against CR Flamengo on 7 July 1912, which Fluminense won 3–2. From May 1924 until September 1926 he returned to the helm of Fluminense, winning the Rio-Championship of 1924 and a second and third place in the years thereafter. In Rio he also managed America FC, with which he won the Championship of Rio de Janeiro of 1928, defeating Fluminense in the decisive match 3–2.Alexandre M. Berwanger, Luis E. L.

Personal life  After his retirement, Williams remained in Brazil for the remainder of his life and died in 1952 in Rio, aged 78. He was buried in the Cemitério dos Ingleses in the Gamboa district in Rio. Reports say he had a son, also named Charlie, who was a referee in the 1950s. Seth Burkett, an English born writer and former player, is Charles Williams' great-great nephew. After being spotted by Brazilian football agents while his local team Stamford AFC were on tour in the country, he signed for Sorriso EC, a club playing in the state league of Mato Grosso, where he debuted in November 2009. Burkett has received plenty of media attention as the only Englishman be playing professionally in Brazil. He returned to Stamford AFC, playing on the seventh level of English football, in 2010.

It recedes southwest for , and is separated from Cook Bay to the north by Black Head promontory. It is connected to King Haakon Bay by Shackleton Gap, a mountain pass.  Geography  Several features in and around Possession Bay have been charted by various Antarctic expeditions. Black Head is a dark, rugged promontory, high, which separates Possession Bay from Cook Bay, to the north. At the head of the bay, Inner Reef extends from the headland Adventure Point on the west side of the bay to Brown Point on the east side. Just south of Adventure Point is Brighton Beach, which extends to Zero Point. Zero Point sits at the north side of Assistance Bay, a small bay within the larger Possession Bay. On the east side of the bay, Alert Point marks the mouth of Purvis Glacier. Outer Moraine Reef extends from Alert Point to Steep Point. Brown Point sits between Steep Point and Glacier Point. The names Inner Reef, Adventure Point, Brown Point, Outer Moraine Reef, Steep Point, and Glacier Point all appear to have first been used on a 1931 British Admiralty chart. Brighton Beach was named by Discovery Investigations personnel during their 1926–30 expedition, and derives from the beach being as crowded with fauna as Brighton, a popular seaside resort on the south coast of England. DI personnel named Alert Point for their survey motorboat Alert. The names Zero Point and Black Head appear on charts from the same expedition. Cook's Second Voyage Possession Bay can be seen on Cook's map, which is oriented south-upwards It was discovered and named by a British expedition under Cook in 1775. Cook made the first known landing on South Georgia in this vicinity. The great mariner Captain James Cook in HMS Resolution accompanied by HMS Adventure made the first landing, survey and mapping of South Georgia. As mandated by the Admiralty, on 17 January 1775 he took possession for Britain and renamed the island \\"Isle of Georgia\\" for King George III. German naturalist Georg Forster, who accompanied Cook during their landings in three separate places at Possession Bay on that day, wrote: :\\"Here Captain Cook displayed the British flag, and performed the ceremony of taking possession of those barren rocks, in the name of his Britannic Majesty, and his heirs forever. A volley of two or three muskets was fired into the air.\\" Cook himself wrote in his log: :\\"The head of the Bay... was terminated by a huge Mass of Snow and ice of vast extent, it shewed a perpendicular clift of considerable height, just like the side or face of an ice isle; pieces were continually breaking from them and floating out to sea. A great fall happened while we were in the Bay; it made a noise like Cannon. The inner parts of the Country was not less savage and horrible... the wild rocks raised their lofty summits until they were lost in the clouds, and the valleys lay buried in everlasting snow. Not a tree was to be seen nor a shrub even big enough to make a tooth-pick.\\" References * Stonehouse, B (ed.)

The name Godthul (Norwegian for \\"Good Hollow\\") dates back to the period 1905–12, and was probably applied by Norwegian sealers and whalers working in the area.

Bacterial degradation determines the environmental impact and efficacy of an herbicide or pesticide. Initially, most pesticides are highly effective and show minimal bacterial degradation; however, bacteria can rapidly evolve and gain the ability to metabolize potential nutrients in the environment. Despite a remarkable structural similarity, degradation of atrazine by bacteria capable of melamine degradation was rare; however, since its introduction as a pesticide in the United States, bacteria capable of atrazine degradation have evolved. Currently, Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP seems to be the optimal bacterial strain for atrazine degradations, which appears to be the sole nitrogen source for the bacteria.  Reaction  AtzA is an atrazine-dechlorinating enzyme with fairly restricted substrate specificity and plays a main role in the hydrolysis of atrazine to hydroxyatrazine in soils and groundwater. Atrazine Hydroxyatrazine is a hydrolase (an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of a chemical bond ), which acts on halide bonds in C-halide compounds. In 1993, pseudomonas sp. strain ADP was shown to degrade atrazine to cyanuric acid via three steps, the first of which is a dechlorination.  Genetics  De Souza, Sadowsky and Wackett were able to determine the nucleotide and amino acid sequence in 1996. This enzyme is 98% identical in amino acid sequence, and subsequently in 3-D structure, to melamine deaminase but functionally different catalyzing the degradation of different substrates. The gene coding for the enzyme shows 99% similarity between bacteria. In fact there is only a 9-nucleotide difference, directly corresponding to the amino acid differences. The nucleotide differences are unlikely to cause a conformational change in the enzyme but rather site-specific alterations. This seems logical considering the remarkable similarity in the substrates and the relatively short period of evolution.  Specificity  AtzA was shown to displace fluoride as well as chlorine but not azido, cyano, methoxy, which are of similar size and electronegativity, or thiomethyl or amino groups. The inability of AtzA to perform deamination makes it unique within its superfamily, amidohydrolases. Furthermore, atrazine is not degraded by melamine deaminase and it does not inhibit melamine deaminase activity suggesting the active site is not specific for atrazine.

White and based in Cleveland, Ohio, since 1866. Founded as the White Manufacturing Company it took the White Sewing Machine Company name when it was incorporated in 1876. A rare White Gem (USA) from about 1887 In 1900, Thomas White's son, Rollin, developed a steam engine, using a corner of one of his father's factories to start building automobiles. In 1906 the automotive venture was spun off as its own company, the White Motor Company. By 1923, the White Sewing Machine Company had divested all side ventures to focus solely on sewing machines and accessories. By the early 1950s, however, White was losing money amid a flood of cheaper imported sewing machines and the loss of a supplier contract from Sears, which had represented 40 percent of White's business. Edward Reddig became company president in 1955, and he led an aggressive campaign of shifting manufacturing overseas, slashing domestic manufacturing and diversification. White moved heavily into appliances, tools and machinery, acquiring appliance brands such as Kelvinator (from American Motors), Gibson, Philco (from Ford Motor Company/GTE) and Franklin (private label supplier, from Studebaker- Worthington). To reflect this, the company renamed itself name White Consolidated Industries in 1964. WCI purchased Westinghouse's major appliance business in 1975, which resulted in creation of the White-Westinghouse brand name. In 1979, WCI bought the Frigidaire appliance line from General Motors. WCI was acquired by Electrolux in 1986. In 2006 Electrolux spun off a number of its lines under the Husqvarna (including variations of the Husqvarna) brand name. The White line of sewing machines was consolidated into the lower end Husqvarna Viking brand after this spinoff. The White-Westinghouse brand name remained with Electrolux and that name is the only remnant of the \\"White Sewing Machine Company\\" name, however the brand line included no sewing machines. New White-branded sewing machines models have not been manufactured since the Husqvarna spinoff in 2006. Husqvarna Viking, Singer, and Pfaff brands are now all owned by SVP Worldwide.

Stidham was \\"exactly the sort of singer that thrived in the R&B; or \\"race\\" market after World War II; although essentially a bluesman, he wasn't a blues purist... his mixture of blues, jazz and gospel made him quite popular... in the '40s and '50s\\". Early Life Arbee Stidham was born at De Valls Bluff, Arkansas in 1917 to Luttie Abraham and Mable (née Perkins) Stidham and into a family steeped in music. Stidham's father was a musician in the Jimmie Lunceford Band, his uncle Ernest Stidham was the leader of the Memphis Jug Band and his uncle Isaiah was a violinist. Stidham attended the Prairie Valley Training (elementary) School as a child and Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. Early music career Stidham first learned to play a clarinet given to him by a local merchant in De Valls Bluff. Stidham said \\"That's what I learned to play, and after I learned to play the clarinet, I went to the saxophone\\". Maternal disapproval of \\"the blues\\" \\"I always loved (the) blues\\" Stidham said. \\"They didn't call the blues \\"blues\\" when I was a boy, they called them \\"reels\\". My mother used to tell me '...You don't do nothing but sing those reels - and you're going to hell'\\". Stidham used to order records, \\"Louis Armstrong and things on that kick\\" and listen to them late at night at low volume. His mother would hear the music, get up and confiscate his records. \\"My grandfather would steal them back and give them right back to me\\". At the age of twelve, Stidham made his first appearance at the Ninth Street Theatre in Little Rock, Arkansas. His mother watched the performance, never sitting down. When the show was over, Stidham said \\"she grabbed me and hugged me and kissed me. She said 'I'm proud of you in a way, but you're still going to hell, singing those reels'\\". A tenor sax player, Stidham formed a seven-piece band named \\"Arbee Stidham and His Southern Syncopators\\" at the age of thirteen. Stidham's band backed Bessie Smith during tour stops in 1930 and 1931, appeared frequently on KARK-AM radio in Little Rock and continued to work clubs in Little Rock and Memphis, Tennessee. After playing venues throughout the south, Stidham toured with his band in Chicago, playing with Lucky Millinder during the 1930s. Chicago recording sessions Arbee William Stidham WWII Draft CardIn the mid-1940s Stidham moved to Chicago, where he met Lester Melrose, who signed him to a recording contract with RCA Victor in 1947. His biggest hit, \\"My Heart Belongs to You\\", was recorded at his first session. Number one hit When \\"My Heart Belongs to You\\" was released, a copy was sent to Zenas Sears, an Atlanta disk jockey and music producer at WGST AM radio. Sears tried the song and his audience flooded the station with calls, asking to hear the record again and again. Sears recommended the record to Gene Nobles, the R&B; disc jockey at Nashville's WLAC AM. The first night Noble played the song, he received 181 calls to play it again. The record reached number one on the Billboard \\"Race Records\\" chart in June 1948. At the same time, the record was also listed on Billboard's \\"ten most-played juke box records\\" for several weeks. Stidham spent the rest of his career trying to achieve the same success, recording for Checker, States, and other independent record labels as a jazz-influenced blues vocalist. Misidentification On some recordings, Stidham's name is mistakenly listed as \\"R. B. Stidham\\". For instance, the 1985 Ace Records (UK) album Ike Turner And His Kings Of Rhythm Vol. 2 lists Stidham's composition My Heart Belongs To You using the incorrect spelling of Stidham's name. Later music career Stidham was in a car crash in the 1950s. When he found his injuries made it impossible for him to play the saxophone without suffering nose bleeds, he became heavily depressed. Stidham's wife urged him to learn to play the guitar. \\"So I bought one\\", Stidham said. Fellow musician Big Maceo Merriweather told him \\"You're always running around with (Earl) Hooker, that's somebody who could tell you something\\". Stidham said \\"so between Big Bill Broonzy, and Hooker, I started to learn. Hooker would teach me the single string thing, 'cause he was a wizard at that. He would stop by every once in a while and give me pointers\\". 1960s recordings Stidham played the guitar and sang on recordings for Folkways Records in the early 1960s. Stidham recorded five songs on May 25, 1965 at the Sun Records studio in Memphis, Tennessee. The songs were not immediately released, appearing on a Sun LP eleven years later in 1976. Cleveland era Stidham moved to Cleveland, Ohio in the 1970s. He appeared regularly at the Pirates Cove nightclub, often accompanying Robert Lockwood Jr. & The All Stars. Stidham was a lecturer on the Blues music genre at Cleveland State University in the 1970s. He also recorded occasionally during the early 1970s and performed at music festivals and clubs in the United States and abroad. Documentary film subject While living in Cleveland in 1973, Stidham was the subject of The Bluesman, a short documentary film directed by Kent State University professor Robert West. The film was described as \\"a portrait of the underground legend, American blues singer Arbee Stidham, a Depression era musician in a film of melancholy reality\\". Later live performances In January, 1982, Stidham performed with Willie Dixon's \\"Blues Rent Party\\" band during the Chicago Winter Jazz Fair held at the Blackstone Hotel. Dixon's band also included Sunnyland Slim, Homesick James, Odie Payne, and others. In August, 1982, Stidham performed with the Arbee Stidham Blues Band at the Petrillo Band Shell during the 4th Annual Kool Jazz Festival held in Grant Park, Chicago, Illinois. The band members included Henderson Smith, trumpet; Ahmad Salaheldeen, Tommy “Madman” Jones, Nat Reed, saxophones; Lacey Gibson, guitar; Lafayette Leake, piano; Camille, bass; Odie Payne, drums, many of whom were well-known Chicago musicians. A review of the performance said \\"blues shouter Arbee Stidham gave the crowd of 8,000 fans a rough, cheerfully energetic set. Stalking the stage with the sly, bent-kneed zeal of a Groucho Marx, Stidham sang with a similarly sly sense of humor\\". Death and burial Stidham died on April 26, 1988, at the University of Chicago Medical Center in Cook County, Illinois, aged 71. Stidham is buried at Oakridge Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois.

It was a whaling station between 1909–1920. At one point, South Georgia was the whaling capital of the world. The names New Fortune Bay and Neufortuna Bay, probably for the whaling catcher Fortuna (owned by the Norwegian- Argentine whaling company Pesca), were used for this site in 1922 by Filchner, following the German Antarctic Expedition, 1911–12. In 1951–52 the island was surveyed by the South Georgia Survey who reported the site was known to whalers and sealers as Ocean Harbour, a name derived from the Ocean Whaling Co. which at one time had a station there. The name Ocean Harbour is approved for this feature on the basis of local usage, and also to avoid confusion of the name New Fortuna Bay with Fortuna Bay, only to the northwest. History Old sealing trypots can still be seen here, and there is also the wreck of the Bayard here, a 1,300 tonne, long, iron-hulled boat, built in 1864. She was moored at the coaling station at 1911 when a gale blew her loose across the bay. Ocean Harbour was the site of the first introduction of reindeer to South Georgia by Pesca's whaling station manager Carl Anton Larsen and his brother in November 1911. Ocean Harbour has a small cemetery with eight graves including the oldest known grave on the island – that of Frank Cabrial (1820) of the sealer Francis Allen.

Zamparini has business interest in several fields, with Emmezeta department stores being the most important one. He entered into football in 1987, after having bought then Serie C2 club Venezia, saving it from a possible bankruptcy. His investments in the football club led Venezia to reach Serie A in a few years. He sold Venezia in 2002 in order to buy then-Serie B club Palermo from A.S.

He made his debut with Racing Club in the Argentine Primera División in 2007 and then transferred to Dutch club AZ at the end of the season. He won the Eredivisie in 2009 and two years later joined Italian side Sampdoria. In 2013, he joined Monaco on a season-long loan. He joined Manchester United in July 2015. Romero is the most capped goalkeeper in the history of the Argentine national team, playing over 90 times since his debut in 2009. He has represented Argentina at two World Cups and at three Copa América tournaments, finishing as runner-up in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, as well as in the 2015 and the 2016 Copa América tournaments. He also was part of the team that won gold at the 2008 Olympics. Club career Racing Club Born in Bernardo de Irigoyen, Argentina, Romero began his youth career at Almirante Brown and CAI before joining Racing Club. Romero passed from the youth to the first team of Racing Club in 2006, making his debut in the Argentine Primera División. Romero appeared in the substitute bench throughout the 2005 season. Throughout the 2006 season, he continued to be in the substitute bench. Despite this, he signed his first professional contract with the club. In the 2007 season, Romero found himself competing the first-choice goalkeeper role with José Luis Martínez Gullotta. Romero made his Racing Club debut of Matchday 1 of Torneo Apertura, in a 1–1 draw against Nueva Chicago. However, in the following match, Romero lost his first-choice goalkeeper role to Gustavo Campagnuolo and spent two months on the sidelines. Weeks after signing for AZ when he moved in the summer, Romero made his first appearance in two months on 14 April 2007 against Colón, in a 1–1 draw; followed up by another appearance on 22 April 2007, in a 3–3 draw against Belgrano. After Campagnuolo suffered an injury, Romero made his last appearance for the club on 17 June 2007, in a 4–2 win over Godoy Cruz. AZ Sergio Romero with AZ in 2007 It was announced on 24 March 2007 that Romero signed for AZ, managed by Louis van Gaal, when he joined up the club on 1 July. There, Romero was expected to fight for the first-choice goalkeeper role with Boy Waterman. Due to an injury to Waterman, Romero made his Eredivisie debut on 30 September 2007 against Heracles Almelo, which went disastrous when he conceded a penalty, resulting in a 2–1 loss. In his second meeting of the season against Twente on 23 February 2008, he kept his first clean sheet for the side, in a 0–0. From that moment on, Romero eventually becoming a regular as the team came 11th. In 2008–09, Romero established himself as a first-choice goalkeeper at AZ following the departure of Waterman to ADO Den Haag. Romero kept a 950-minute clean sheet for AZ from November 2008 to February 2009. While keeping a clean sheet, Romero signed a contract with the club, keeping him until 2012. However, on 5 March 2009, he made a mistake which allowed NAC Breda's Nourdin Boukhari to score for a 2–1 defeat in the quarterfinals of the KNVB Cup; he responded after the match by punching the door and walls of his team's changing room, breaking bones in his hand and ruling himself out at a crucial stage of the season. While on the sidelined, AZ won the Eredivisie in the 2008–09 season. He returned on 26 April 2009 after Joey Didulica got injured in a clash with Luis Suárez and played 16 minutes, in a 1–1 draw. At the end of the 2008–09 season, Romero went on to make 31 appearances in all competitions. In the 2009–10 season, marked the departure of Van Gaal to Bayern Munich and Romero was linked a move away from AZ, with Juventus and Bayern Munich keen on signing him, but stayed at the club throughout the summer. In the Johan Cruyff Shield, Romero started the season well when he helped AZ win 5–1 against Heerenveen to win the title. As he continued to be a first choice goalkeeper, Romero made his UEFA Champions League on Matchday 1 of the Group Stage, in a 1–0 loss against Olympiacos. However, a week later, he suffered a knee injury that sidelined for a week. A week later, he returned to the first team from injury on 3 October 2009, in a 1–0 win over NAC Breda. However, in a 1–0 win over Sparta Rotterdam on 21 March 2010, Romero suffered an injury in the first half and was substituted as a result. Following this, it was announced that he would be out of the season, putting his place in the World Cup in doubt. At the end of the 2009–10 season, Romero went on to make 36 appearances in all competitions despite injuries. In the 2010–11 season, Romero missed the start of the season, due to international commitment and injury. It wasn't until on 19 September 2010 when he made his first appearance of the season, in a 1–0 win over NEC. Eleven days later, on 30 September 2010, Romero made his UEFA Europa League debut, in a 4–1 loss against BATE Borisov in the Group Stage. However, by February, Romero was out of the first team for the second time this season, due to international commitment and ankle injury. After spending a month on the sidelines, Romero returned to the first team from injury on 2 April 2011, in a 1–0 win over Feyenoord.

Paget (NASA imagery). Thatcher Peninsula () is a mountainous peninsula in north-central South Georgia. Its total area is approximately , with roughly covered in vegetation. It erminates to the north in Mai Point, rising between Cumberland West Bay to the west, and Cumberland East Bay and Moraine Fjord to the east. It is bounded to the southwest and south by Lyell Glacier and Hamberg Glacier. King Edward Cove on the east side of the peninsula is the site of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Grytviken station and the disused whaling station of the same name. Thatcher Peninsula was named by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) in 1991, at the suggestion of members of the Royal Geographical Society, after Margaret Thatcher, British prime minister, 1979–90. She was described by Sir Vivian Fuchs, chair of the Foreign Office's Antarctic Place Names Committee, as 'a major figure in the history of South Georgia', for her role in the Falklands War. Thatcher was, according to friends, \\"flattered and amused\\" by the honour.  Geography  Maiviken Many features on the coast of the peninsula have been individually charted and named. Features on the west coast are detailed as part of Cumberland West Bay, and those on the east coast are detailed as part of Cumberland East Bay.  Northern coast  The most prominent feature on the northern coast of the peninsula is Maiviken, a small cove. Maiviken and its surrounding features were first charted by the Swedish Antarctic Expedition (SAE), 1901–04, under Otto Nordenskjold. Maiviken was first entered on May Day, 1902, and was therefore named \\"Majviken\\" (May Cove). Over the years, the Norwegian spelling Maiviken has become established for the cove. Poa Cove is a smaller cove that indents the southeast corner of Maiviken. Burnet Cove indents the northeastern coast of Maiviken, southwest of Mai Point. Close south of Mai Point is Tortula Cove. These three smaller coves were resurveyed by Discovery Investigations (DI) personnel in 1929 and the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) in 1951. All three were named by UK-APC for plant genera common in their vicinity; Poa for the grass genus Poa, Burnet for the common name of genus Acaena, and Tortula for the moss genus Tortula. Mai Point marks the eastern side of Maiviken, as well as the northernmost extent of the peninsula as a whole. Its name was given by SAE personnel in association with Maiviken. East of Mai Point, Sappho Point marks the west side of the entrance to Cumberland East Bay, on the north coast of South Georgia. Probably first sighted by the 1775 British expedition under Captain James Cook which explored the north coast of South Georgia. Named for , a British ship used in charting portions of Cumberland Bay in 1906.  Inland features  On the northern portion of the peninsula, Camp Peak rises to about on the west side of Maiviken. It was charted by DI in 1929 and so named because a camp was established on the shore below the peak. Spencer Peak rises to tall southwest of Sappho Point. The name appears to be first used on a 1906 British Admiralty chart and is probably for Lieutenant P. Spencer, who surveyed in Cumberland Bay from in 1906. Northwest of Spencer Peak, the valley Maidalen runs north-south down to Lewis Pass. Mount Duse stands high, approximately south of Spencer Peak surmounting King Edward Point. It was charted in 1902 by Lieutenant S.A. Duse, cartographer of the SAE, for whom it is named. Mount Hodges stands high, west of Mount Duse. at first ppearisas \\"Moldaenke Berg\\" on a 1907 map by A. Szielasko, but the name hwas\\"supplanted by Mount Hodges\\" , which ppears to have been applied some years later and is now well established. It was probably named for Captain M.H. Hodges, Royal Navy, of the Sappho, who visited and mapped portions of Cumberland Bay in 1906. Several freshwater lakes and ponds are located along the east and southeast shores of Maiviken, all named by UK-APC. Løken Pond is the northernmost of these, found east of Burnet Cove. It was named after Reverend Kristen Løken, a Norwegian Lutheran minister from Lillehammer, the first appointed pastor of South Georgia. Arch Pond, named for a nearby natural arch, lies slightly south, between Burnet and Poa coves. East of Arch Pond is shallow Humic Lake, named for the dark-stained water caused by humic acid derived from the leaching of decaying peat on nearby slopes. Southernmost of this small group is Evans Lake, a comparatively deep lake of irregular shape named after John C. Ellis-Evans, a BAS biologist. South of the head of Maiviken is the lake Maivatn. It is the largest, and at deep, also the deepest of the small freshwater lakes in the Maiviken area. The lake was named Maivatn (May lake) in association with Maiviken. Tiny Lancetes Lake is found to the southwest of it.  Wildlife  A South Georgia pipit on South Georgia island. Lancetes Lake has a rich benthic flora of algae and mosses, which support a large population of the only water beetle seen in the sub-Antarctic, Lancetes clausii, from which the feature takes its name. Brown rats are considered an invasive species on Thatcher Peninsula. They threaten the survival of native species such as the South Georgia pipit. From approximately 2011 to 2014, the government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands undertook efforts to eradicate them by air-dropping brodifacoum pellets. Follow-up monitoring a year after the project indicated that the eradication had been a success, with little evidence of rats found.

This cove and its surrounding features, frequented by early sealers at South Georgia, was charted by the Swedish Antarctic Expedition, 1901–04, under Otto Nordenskiöld who named it Grytviken. That name, meaning 'Pot Bay,' was subsequently assumed by the whaling station and settlement built in 1904. The cove got its present name in about 1906 for King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. British Antarctic Survey research station King Edward Point is located on Hope Point, the cove's northernmost headland. Abandoned whaling station Grytviken is located on the cove's western shore.  Named features  Hope Point is a rocky bluff, high, which forms the north side of the entrance to King Edward Cove. SAE personnel named it for H.W.W. Hope, who directed a 1920 survey of King Edward Cove by personnel on HMS Dartmouth. Hope Point is the site of a monument in commemoration of Sir Ernest Shackleton. The cove sits southwest of Mount Duse and southeast of Mount Hodges. Gull Lake sits close to the cove's southwest shore. Hobart Rock is a low rock lying at the south side of the entrance to the cove. The name appears on a chart based upon a survey of King Edward Cove by personnel on HMS Sappho in 1906. Just 0.25 miles (0.4 km) south of King Edward Cove is Susa Point, a low rocky point marking the seaward end of a small east-west ridge separating two tussock-covered flats. First surveyed by the SAE under Nordenskjold, it was named by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) following their sketch survey in 1951. The name is one of a group in the vicinity of Discovery Point derived from the chemical fixatives used there in biological work by the FIDS.

Tell en-Nasbeh is one of two sites often identified with Mizpah of Benjamin, and is located about 12 kilometers north of Jerusalem. The other suggested location is Neby Samwil, which is some 8 kilometers north-west of the Old City of Jerusalem, and situated on the loftiest hill in the vicinity, some 180 meters above the plain of Gibeon.Nehemiah Chapter 3 Verse 7 Mechon Mamre Biblical references The first mention of Mizpah was in Genesis where Laban and his son-in-law Jacob made an agreement that God will watch over them while they were apart from each other. It was marked by the piling of rocks. It was a reminder of peace where each would not go beyond these rocks to attack the other. When a Levite traveler's concubine was raped by the men of Gibeah, the other tribes of Israel met at Mizpah of Benjamin, where they decided to attack the men of Benjamin for this grievous sin. At the same time, the decision was made not to permit marriage between Israelite women and Benjaminite men. After the return of the Ark of the Covenant, lost to the Philistines following the Israelites' defeat at the Battle of Aphek, Samuel gathered all Israel at Mizpah to offer a sacrifice to the Lord and ask Him to forgive their sin. The Israelites fought off a raid by the Philistines, taking advantage of the assembly, and drove them back as far as below Beth Car. To memorialize this event, Samuel set up a stone between Mizpah and Shen and named it Eben-Ezer (\\"stone of help\\"), because the Lord had helped them. Samuel also gathered the people of Israel to Mizpah for the Lord to identify their first king. There, Saul was chosen by lot from all the tribes and families of Israel.1 Sam 10:17–24 During the reigns of Asa, king of Judah, and Baasha, king of Israel, Mizpah was one of two cities which Asa built up from the stones Baasha had used to fortify Ramah (; ). After the Babylonians had destroyed Jerusalem, they appointed Gedaliah governor in Mizpah over the remaining residents. Many returned to Mizpah from where they had fled. The prophet Jeremiah came to Mizpah from Ramah, where the Babylonians had released him. Later Ishmael, a member of the royal family, assassinated Gedaliah. Despite Jeremiah's warning that the people would be a reproach and die if they went to Egypt, they persisted in going there.2 Kings 25:23–26; Jer 40:6–42:22  Identification  The main contenders for the site of Mizpah are Tell en-Nasbeh and nearby Nebi Samwil. * If Mizpah was Tell en- Nasbeh on the Nablus road, Ishmael would not have fled to Ammon via GibeonJeremiah Chapter 41 Verse 10–12 Mechon Mamre which is located to the West near Neby Samwil which overlooks Jerusalem. * Moreover, Mizpah was located right next to Gibeon.Nehemiah Chapter 3 Verse 7 Mechon Mamre * Furthermore, Judas Machabeus, preparing for war with the Syrians, gathered his men \\"to Maspha, over against Jerusalem: for in Maspha was a place of prayer heretofore in Israel\\".1 Mach. 3:46; cited in * On the other hand, Nebi Samwil has produced no remains of the Iron Age I, nor any remains of the 6th century, both periods in which Mizpah was occupied. By contrast, Tell en-Nasbeh has produced abundant remains from both periods, and moreover, has a massive fortification system which matches well with the building campaign of King Asa of Judah in the early 9th century BC. Its location on the main road leading out of Jerusalem fits well with the reference to Mizpah in the First Books of Kings ().

As mentioned in the biblical story of Jacob and Laban, making a pile of stones marked an agreement between two people, with God as their watching witness. Biblical narrative Jacob had secretly fled the house of Laban, his father-in-law, in the middle of the night, taking flocks of animals, all his other assets, and his two wives and their children (the daughters and grandchildren of Laban) with him, intending never to return. Laban discovered this and pursued Jacob. After discussion, the two decided to formalize the separation. Laban admitted that his daughters had voluntarily left, saying, \\"Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne?\\" (Genesis 31:43 (NIVUK)). He agreed to let Jacob go in peace, but exacted a promise from Jacob to never abuse his daughters or take additional wives (Genesis 31:50). The two men then determined to erect a pile of stones, a figurative watchtower, called a mizpah, to commemorate this promise, even though no person was present other than the two men when it was made, for \\"God is witness between you and me\\". Both of the men also agreed that they would consider the mizpah a border between their respective territories, and that would not pass the watchtower to visit one another \\"to do evil\\".Genesis 31:52 Usage Since that time, the mizpah has come to connote an emotional bond between people who are separated (either physically or by death). Mizpah jewelry is often made in the form of a coin-shaped pendant cut in two with a zig-zag line bearing the words \\"The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another\\". This is worn to signify the bond. Additionally, the word \\"mizpah\\" is often used as the name for a cemetery Mizpah Cemetery, Chattanooga, TennesseeTown of Platteville, Colorado, Mizpah Cemetery and can often be found on headstones in cemeteries and on other memorials: > And [it was called] Mizpah (Watchtower); for he said, The Lord watch between > me and thee, when we are absent one from another.Genesis 31:49 References External links *NASB Version of the Covenant of Mizpah Category:Interpersonal relationships Category:Book of Genesis ","title":"Mizpah (emotional bond)"},{"id":"10969923","text":"Micropal Group Limited, known as Micropal, was a global financial services company specialising in the collection and analysis of mutual fund performance data.

In 1985 , the company consisted of 7 people with a combined vision to bring improved transparency and credibility to fund performance industry From its London base within 3 years it opened its Hong Kong office. In the USA it expanded through acquisition of Interactive Data Corporation of Des Moines, Iowa and AIM technical analysis system based in Portland Oregon. In parallel bases were established in Europe and by mid-1990s it had established 15 offices around the world, including an agency started in 1991 in Switzerland by Justin Wheatley, Along with creating credible data bases of global fund information, Micropal mainly through Chris Poll, became a major influencer in extending AIMR rules, improving fund regulation globally and in helping to establish GIPS (Global Investment Performance Standards).

It currently plays in the Finnish second highest league Ykkönen. The club has two managers, Mikko Manninen and Janne Korhonen. JJK plays its home matches at Harjun Stadion.  History   Early years 1923–1992  Jyväskylän Palloilijat (abbreviated JyP), the predecessor of JJK, was founded in December 1923. In addition to football JyP had also a pesäpallo team and a bandy team. In the JJK's first football match it was defeated 2–3 by Mikkelin Kilpaveikot. In its early years, JyP played football infrequently and usually worked just to make the game of football known in the city. JyP began competing in football leagues in 1928 when it was beaten in a qualification match by Savo in the regional league. In 1939, JyP qualified for the first time to play in the second highest level of Finnish football leagues. Nevertheless, World War II halted the promising progress of the team. In 1941, JyP played against a friendly match against a German military team. As many as 6000 spectators followed the match in Harju Stadium. In the following years, JyP played in the Finnish lower divisions, from the 3rd tier to 6th tier, but in 1976 JyP managed to rise to Kakkonen (third tier). In the next year, a new organisation was founded for the football team. The new team was named JYP-77. In the beginning of 1980s JYP-77 played couple of years in the First Division. But, 1992 the team relegated again to Kolmonen (fourth tier). title=Aika ennen JJK:n syntyä: 1923–1992 author= Erkki Arvaja date= 1975 work= Jyväskylän Palloilijat palloilun suurseuraksipublisher= Järvenpään Kirjapaino ja Valolatomo Ky.  New JJK 1992–2006  In autumn 1992 football managers in Jyväskylä decided that a reform is needed in football in Jyväskylä. JYP-77 merged with JyPK (Jyväskylän Pallokerho) and formed a new team JJK (Jyväskylän Jalkapalloklubi). Already first season was a success and JJK was promoted to Kakkonen (third tier) in 1993. 1994 JJK was far from the top of the league even though Mika Väyrynen won the top scorer award of the league with 22 goals. In 1995 JJK won a qualifier against KPT-85 and was promoted to Ykkönen (second tier). In the Ykkönen JJK played strongly especially at home, where it was defeated only once. Ville Priha and Sükrü Uzuner were some of the leading heroes of the team. Also audience found Harju and a match against Kuusysi Lahti had already 2547 spectators. Season 1997 ended in a catastrophe. Even though the team had invested a lot to the new season it relegated back to Kakkonen (third tier). JJK could not promote back during next seasons. When JJK Juniors in 2000 managed to promote also to Kakkonen a new reform was started. The name was changed to JJK Jyväskylä. Nevertheless, JJK could not promote back to the Ykkönen. Between 2000 and 2006 the team lost a lot of gifted juniors including Jukka Sinisalo, Touko Tumanto, Mikko Manninen to teams playing on higher levels.  From a black hole to the top 2006–2011  During unsuccessful decades Central Finland was nicknamed a black hole of Finnish football. Jyväskylä was the only major Finnish city, which had not had a football team in the top league. In 2006 Ville Priha returned to his home city – this time as a coach. The new coach with his team including Lassi Lehtonen, Jussi Hakasalo and a young promising striker Tommi Kari celebrated in the end of the season a promotion back to Ykkönen. Before the 2007 season, JJK got new strengthenings with a defender Jukka Sinisalo returning from FC Inter, midfielder Matti Lähitie and striker Babatunde Wusu from Mikkeli. The team ended up being third in the league. The team continued to strengthen with Markus Paija, Mika Lahtinen, Anssi Viren and Ady. The hero of team Babatunde Wusu capped in the last game against PS Kemi and secured a historic moment for Jyväskylä – a promotion to the Veikkausliiga (highest level). First top league season 2009 was not easy for JJK even though Jukka-Pekka Tuomanen from Jaro and Christian Sund joined the team. It finished playing relegation games but managed to win them. Nevertheless, the average number of spectators was third highest in the league, 3238 per game. 2010 was not easier but 2011 JJK exploded the bank. The team finished 3rd in the league and celebrated the first medal in its history in Finnish Veikkausliiga. This meant also that in 2012 JJK plays for the first time in its history in UEFA European League.  JJK in Europe  Third place in the league in 2011 qualified the club to play in the 2012-13 UEFA Europa League. JJK played in the first qualification round in the UEFA Europa League in season 2012–13. In the first round JJK played against Norwegian Stabæk and won with the aggregate score 4–3. In the second round JJK faced FK Zeta from Montenegro, and lost based on the away goals rule (aggregate score 3–3). The league season, however, was lukewarm compared to the previous with the club finishing in ninth place.  Anniversary of football in Jyväskylä and relegation  During the 2013 season the club planned to celebrate the 90th anniversary of club football history in Jyväskylä. The pre-season went well as the club beat for example HJK in the Finnish League Cup and reached the finals. As the Veikkausliiga season started, the difficulties began. Eero Markkanen, who was responsible for scoring the most goals pre-season, was injured in the season opener and injuries plagued the team throughout the season. After Midsummer, JJK was in last place. About in the middle of the season, a draw in the home game against RoPS drove the club to change its manager mid-season for the second time in its history. Kari Martonen was replaced by the team's former player, assistant coach Juha Pasoja. The change was followed by a brief improvement in the team's play, but at the end of the season, however, the team was relegated back to Ykkönen, eventually with quite clear figures. The positive feature was how in particular towards the end of the season some younger, home-grown players rose to the team in place of some more experienced players who were injured. For example the young stopper Severi Vielma and the midfielder Robert Taylor, who had just returned to his hometown after a few years in England, made their way to the starting lineup. The season was dramatic for the club also outside the field. Poor financial situation forced the club to ask for help from their supporters. As part of the \\"Emme anna sen päättyä\\" (\\"We won't allow it to end\\") -campaign the club sold various products and collected over 90 000 euros, which allowed the club to continue operation to the next season. For the season 2014 in Ykkönen, the team was reorganized as many experienced players left and young, home-grown players were brought in their place. Long- time players Janne Korhonen and Mikko Manninen stayed in the team, however, and took also some coaching duties. Tommi Kari, who had played for FC Lahti for two years, returned to JJK and was later elected as the team captain for the season 2014. Many young players were brought in from the youth teams, such as Aleksis Lehtonen, Joona Itkonen and the goalkeeper Teppo Marttinen. During the spring of 2014 the team made to the top eight in the Finnish Cup beating for example Veikkausliiga team TPS.

It can cause short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.  Structure  The human ACADSB gene is located on chromosome 10; its exact localization has been identified as 10q25-q26. The open reading frame (ORF) encodes a precursor protein that contains 431 amino acids; post-translational processing results in a mature protein with 399 amino acids. The cDNA is significantly similar to the cDNA of other members of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family; its structure is closest to that of short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The structure of the catalytic pocket has also been studied; position 104 at the bottom of the substrate-binding pocket has been identified as important in determining the length of the primary carbon chain that can be accommodated. Altering residues at positions 105 and 177 have been demonstrated to affect the rate of the dehydrogenation reactions.  Function  Short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADSB) is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family of enzymes that catalyze the dehydrogenation of acyl-CoA derivatives in the metabolism of fatty acids or branch chained amino acids. Substrate specificity is the primary characteristic used to define members of this gene family. The ACADSB gene product has the greatest activity towards the short branched chain acyl-CoA derivative, (S)-2-methylbutyryl-CoA, but also reacts significantly with other 2-methyl branched chain substrates and with short straight chain acyl-CoAs. The encoded protein is also involved in L-leucine catabolism.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the ACADSB gene have been associated with 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SBCADD, also known as MBD) deficiency, an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder of impaired isoleucine degradation. Many mutations across the gene's 10 exons have been identified, with the mutations causing exon skipping and other transcriptional and translational errors. The disorder may be detected by MS/MS-based routine newborn screening due to the heightened presence of 2-methylbutyrylcarnitine in tissue samples. The disorder may also be identified using urinary organic acid analysis, by detecting the presence of 2-methylbutyryl glycinuria. While many individuals with a mutation in this gene may be asymptomatic, some patients have been reported to have symptoms in early infancy. Infants may experience apneic episodes, generalized muscle atrophy, hypotonia, lethargy, seizures, and delayed motor development.

Biography Genevieve Taggard was born to James Taggard and Alta Arnold, both of whom were school teachers. Her parents were both active members of the Disciples of Christ, and at age two her parents moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where they became missionaries and founded a school in which they also taught. Genevieve Taggard began writing poetry at the early age of 13. In 1914 the family left Hawaii, and Taggard enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley. Here she became an active member of the socialist political and literary community. She graduated in 1919 upon which she moved to New York City in 1920. Once in New York she started working for the publisher B. W. Huebsch and in 1921 she co-founded the journal The Measure along with fellow writer and friend Maxwell Anderson. In the same year she married poet and novelist Robert Wolf with whom she had her only child Marcia Wolf (later Liles). Upon living in New York for most of the 1920s she assumed a teaching position at Mount Holyoke College, where she taught from 1929 to 1930. In 1931, she was a Guggenheim Fellow. In 1932, she accepted a professorship at Bennington College. In 1934 Taggard and Wolf divorced, and the following year she married Kenneth Durant.Edward T. James, Janet Wilson James, Paul S. Boyer, Notable American Women, 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 3, Harvard University Press, 1971, p422. In 1934, she moved on to teach at Sarah Lawrence College, where she remained until 1947, a year before her death. Her poems were published in The Nation, The Kenyon Review, The New Yorker, The New Republic. During the 1930s, sparked in part by the Great Depression, but also largely by her philanthropic upbringing and her commitment to socialism, her poetry began to reflect her political and social views much more prominently. During this time a Guggenheim Fellowship allowed her to spend a year in Majorca, Spain and Antibes, France. The experience of Spain in its time shortly before the Spanish Civil War gave further rise and inspiration to her cause of raising social and political awareness of civil rights issues. Her papers are held at Dartmouth College and the New York Public Library.

The name first appeared in Ireland with the arrival of Sir Henry de Leon (c.1176 – 1244), of a cadet branch of Viscounty of Léon, Brittany, accompanying Prince John (later King John) of England. Sir Henry married Maude de Courcey. According to the “Book of Armagh” Lochan Dilmhain or Dilionn was the ancestor of “Dillon” of Dillons country in County Westmeath. In Irish, this area was known as Cuircneach. Lochan was, according to some genealogists a brother of Colman Mór, King of Meath and a great grandson of Niall of the Nine Hostages who brought St. Patrick to Ireland as a slave . Lochan, we are told, fled to France after killing his brother Colman Mór. He and his descendants remained in France and in the 7th Century Dillon was made the Duke of Acquitane and many of that family became Counts and Generals in both French and Austrian armies The name evolved into the Irish-language \\"Diolun\\"/English-language \\"Dillon\\" (not to be confused with the Welsh given name Dylan). It is particularly common in the Meath and Westmeath counties of Ireland where the Dillons were granted vast areas of land. The name is now widespread throughout Ireland. The Dillon family later became the Barons Clonbrock and Earls of Roscommon. The family in Ireland was honoured with six compositions (music & poetry) composed by Turlough Carolan: Tiarna Duilleain - Lord Dillon; Róis Duilleain - Lady Rose Dillon jig; Gearalt Duilleain - Gerald Dillon; Fainní Duilleain - Fanny Dillon; Comhairleoir Duilleain - Coun.

The term Stikine–Iskut (alone or in various combination forms \\"District\\", \\"Country\\", \\"Region\\") is also fairly common to describe the area, and references the Iskut River, the Stikine's largest tributary and describable as its south fork. Geography The basin of the Stikine is sparsely populated, mostly by members of the Tahltan people, though the lower reaches are the territory of group of the Tlingit people centred on Wrangell, Alaska, which is on Etolin Island just outside the mouth of the Stikine. The region is noted for its rugged and unusual mix of glaciated ranges, semi-arid subarctic volcanic plateaux and cones, and deep river canyons, most of all the Grand Canyon of the Stikine, which was described by naturalist John Muir as \\"the northern Yosemite\\". Also notable and rather famous on the river's course is the Great Glacier, which fronts along the river's right (west) bank a few miles north of the Alaska frontier. Mount Edziza Provincial Park, Spatsizi Plateau Wilderness Provincial Park and Stikine River Provincial Park are the largest provincial parks in the region, which continues to be heavily explored for mineral potentials since first opened up by the Stikine Gold Rush of the 1860s, which forced the creation of the Stikine Territory, soon afterwards absorbed into the Colony of British Columbia. The term \\"Stikine District\\" was also used in reference to the Stikine Mining District, an administrative jurisdiction. Today the term Stikine Region is a British Columbia administrative district, similar to a Regional District but not fully qualified as one, but it does not include all of the Stikine Country and comprises mostly the Cassiar Country and Atlin District, which are to the north and northwest of the Stikine Country, respectively. The largest town in the district is Telegraph Creek, which lies on a side-road to the west of the Stewart-Cassiar Highway, which traverses the region from north to south, connecting parts of British Columbia farther south with the Yukon Territory to the north. To the northeast of the Stikine Country is another region known as the Cassiar Country, and to its southeast is the Omineca Country (both of which had also at one time been \\"Mining Districts\\" resulting from their own gold rushes). History The region was the traditional home of the Taku and Inland Tlingit people who by the 19th century settled around what was to become the gold rush town of Atlin. Other First Nations such as the Tahltan settled at Telegraph Creek and Dease Lake. The Sekani lived along the Finlay and Parsnip Rivers, while in the east the Kaska people occupied the Liard and Dease Rivers and eventually settled along McDame Creek. Non native exploration of the district did not occur until the 1770s with the arrival of Russian fur traders, who never traveled beyond the coastal areas, but relied on the Tlingits to provide the pelts from the inland animals. With the construction of a fort at Fort Wrangell, the Russian fur traders held a monopoly in the region until the 1830s when Fort Taku and Fort Stikine were both built on the Stikine River by the Hudson's Bay Company. Stikine Gold Rush On September 12, 1861, the Victoria newspaper, the British Colonist, reported a rumor that gold had been discovered on the Stikine River, and by the following spring, more than 200 miners struck out for the Cassiar. Sixty of them went on a sternwheeler, the Flying Dutchman, owned by Captain William Moore. While the rush did not settle the area, as had the Fraser Canyon or the Cariboo Gold Rush in their respective regions, it did draw the attention of British Columbia’s Governor James Douglas, who petitioned the British government to create the Stikine Territory from the line of the Finlay and Skeena Rivers, which were the Colony of British Columbia's northern boundary, north to the 62nd parallel and east to the 125th meridian. The territory was established in 1862, and a year later it was merged into the Colony of British Columbia. Collins Telegraph Line In the early 1860s, Perry Collins, obtained financing from Western Union Telegraph to build a telegraph line from San Francisco through British Columbia and Alaska and across the Bering Strait to Russia and ultimately Europe. The line was begun in 1865 at New Westminster, and continued as far as the Skeena River in 1866, but then the project was abandoned because the transatlantic line was built first, making the Collins line redundant. Despite the fact that the line would not be completed, surveyors had created a primitive route from Quesnel to the newly established settlement of Telegraph Creek, thus opening up the district for travel. The region was also affected by the Klondike Gold Rush when in 1897–1898, 5000 miners went to the Yukon via the all Canadian route, up the Stikine River to Telegraph Creek and overland to the Teslin River.

A general term, surf fishing may or may not include casting a lure or bait, and refers to all types of shore fishing – from sandy and rocky beaches, rock jetties, or even fishing piers. The terms surfcasting or beachcasting refer more specifically to surf fishing from the beach by casting into the surf at or near the shoreline. With few exceptions, surf fishing is done in saltwater. The most common misconception about surf fishing is the idea that one must cast as far out as possible in order to reach the fish. At beaches on the west coast of the United States, and in fact, at most beaches around the world, you only really need to get your bait into knee deep water. This is referred to as surf fishing the \\"skinny\\" (the skinny water). Equipment Surf fishing at Calshot, Hampshire The basic idea of most surfcasting is to cast a bait or lure as far out into the water as is necessary to reach the target fish from the shore. This may or may not require long casting distances. Basic surf fishing can be done with a fishing rod between 7 feet and 18 feet long, with an extended butt section, equipped with a suitably-sized spinning or conventional (revolving spool) casting reel. In addition to rod and reel, the surf fisherman needs terminal tackle and bait or lure. Terminal tackle is the equipment at the far end of the line: hooks, swivels, lines and leaders. Dedicated surfcasters usually possess an array of terminal and other tackle, with fishing rods and reels of different lengths and actions, and lures and baits of different weights and capabilities. Depending on fishing conditions and the type of fish they are trying to catch, such surfcasters tailor bait and terminal tackle to rod and reel and the size and species of fish targeted. Reels and other equipment need to be constructed so they resist the corrosive and abrasive effects of salt and sand. Surf fishermen who use artificial lures, cast and retrieve them to entice a bite from the target species. There are hundreds of different lures effective for surf fishing, such as spoons, plugs, soft plastics and jigs. Most can be purchased from local bait and tackle shops, online tackle retailers, at fishing tackle expositions or specialized surf fishing catalogs. Most surfcasters carry with them a \\"surf bag\\" which holds a selection of lures to facilitate fast changes of lures appropriate to current fishing conditions, saving trips back to the beach or vehicle to change equipment. Several other items of equipment are commonly used by surf fisherman and surfcasters to improve comfort, convenience and effectiveness. Among these are waders, used to wade out into the surf to gain distance from shore when casting the bait. Full length, chest-high waders are most popular, in order to provide a measure of protection against a pounding surf that could easily swamp hip-length wading boots. In addition to the extra reach provided by wading out from shore, waders provide improved footing, protection for feet and legs from sharp bottom objects and stinging/biting fish and crustaceans, and protection from cold water temperatures. Most surf fishermen prefer integrated booted waders to stocking-foot models, which eliminates the tendency of sand and rock to find their way in between boot and wader. In areas where the bottom consists of slippery rocks or when fishing from mossy and slimy rock jetties, cleated boots or attachments are utilized to improve footing and enhance safety. Surf fishing is done often at night to follow the nocturnal feeding habits of many target species. Many surf fishermen add items such as flashlights, headlamps, light sticks and other gear to facilitate night fishing. Surfcasting Surfcasting is a casting technique which separates the surfcaster from the ordinary shore, pier, or boat fisherman. Extremely long rods are frequently employed to extend the length of the cast, while specialized, two-handed casting techniques are used to cast the lure or bait the added distances required in many cases to reach feeding inshore fish. In these casts the entire body, rather than just the arms, are utilized to deliver the cast.\\"ABC of Surf Fishing\\" Popular Mechanics, June 1952, pp. 159–162, drawing of surf casting p. 162. In addition to standard two-handed casts, veteran surfcasters may also resort to the pendulum cast (derived from tournament casting contests) to achieve added distance – in some cases exceeding 700 feet. Tournament casting is a sport in its own right, with the world record held by Danny Moeskops casting a distance of 286.63 meters (313.46 yards). Extreme Surfcasting also known as Skishing is a variant of surf fishing that involves donning a wetsuit and flippers and swimming into the ocean with surfcasting pole to catch fish. Skishing was invented in Montauk, NY by local resident, Paul Melnyk, in 1995. He coined the term which is a cross between \\"skiing \\"and \\"fishing\\" to describe what happens if the angler hooks a large enough fish and it tows him through the ocean like a water-skier. Without the benefit of boat or land, the fight is considered to be, by the fisherman anyway, on more equal terms. Skishers swim sometimes hundreds of yards from shore to water well over their heads, with their flippers and buoyancy of their wetsuits keeping them afloat. Beachcasting In Britain, surfcasting is often called beachcasting. It is a popular form of fishing which is carried out all around the coast of the British Isles. Beachcasters use very long fishing rods, usually between 12 and 16 feet. The beachcaster will stand on a beach or shoreline and cast out to sea with either a water filled float, or a lead weight weighing between 120g and 200g. Bait used in this form of fishing might include limpets, mussels, lugworm, ragworm, sandeel, mackerel strip, squid, peeler crab or razor fish. Additionally, artificial flies or even spinners may be used for species such as mackerel or bass. It is a common pastime in coastal areas of Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland and often results in the capture of large specimens of many species of fish, including: flatfish, bass, cod, whiting, pollack, black bream, dogfish, smooth hound, bull huss, rays and tope. Common beachcasting techniques used in Britain include the common overhead cast, the off-the-ground Cast and the Pendulum cast. There are other techniques used in Britain, but these three techniques remain the more popular ones with the pendulum cast perhaps the most difficult to master and also the one that generally produces more yards to the cast with 250–300 yds becoming quite possible. On top of technique and equipment, streamlines rigs that can take casting strains are also used such as the clipped pennel pulley, clipped down rigs, long n low etc. The rigs are also made with strong 60 lb plus lines to take the strain of the cast. Streamlining of bait too is important. A shockleader is a stronger line attached to a lighter mainline to absorb the shock of a powerful cast. The suggested formula for shockleader selection is as calculated as follows 1 oz weight +10lb shockleader + 10lb, e.g. Besides the equipment and the cast techniques, the other component that makes a beach caster successful is what can be called sea interpretation. There are zones, and within them certain points, where to cast the baits is more profitable than others. It depends on the conformation of the sea bed, and therefore, in order to make fishing more effective and enjoyable, we should spend a while on understanding these differences and only then start fishing. How? First of all, by observing the waves motion, in particular where they break out, because it is there where the bottom height is lower and the sea current can stir it most. This action uncovers from the sandy bed small marine beings and carry them away across channels to deeper points, where they settle in for the joy of fish. The latter, that tend to swim countercurrent, move searching for food along these channels – that can be compared in some way to our roads in a map – and approach the shore as long as the conditions allow the marine food chain to last. Although it may seem an oversimplification of the reality, it makes clear that only when a beach caster is able to master the \\"sense of sea\\" by spotting the difference among fishing zones, then will he be more likely to make memorable captures. Similarly to any other activity, it's a matter of experience, which can be acquired by getting through several failures. Dangers As with any water sport care must be taken to participate safely in this sport. Much surf fishing is done in rough whitewater surf conditions. Powerful waves and strong undertows can cause serious injury or death if proper attention is not paid to safety. Areas fished should be scouted in low tide conditions to note sudden drop offs or dangerous conditions hidden at high tides. Any fisherman with waders should wear a wader belt to keep waders from filling with water in the event one falls in the surf. The aforementioned cleats should be worn anywhere there are slippery rocks or shells underfoot. PFD's (personal flotation devices) should be considered especially when fishing alone in big surf or on jetties. Since lures and hooks feature razor sharp points, care must be taken not to hook oneself or others when casting, especially when performing two-handed full power casts that require a substantial safety zone behind the surfcaster. In the event that one accidentally hooks oneself or someone else, it is a good idea to carry a quality cutting pliers capable of cutting the hooks you are fishing with. Species A wide array of species can be targeted from surf and shore limited only the species of fish available in the region. On the west coast of the United States, a few of the most sought after fish include the California Corbina, the Spotfin Croaker, the Barred Surfperch, and of course, the California Halibut. Unlike the east coast, the west coast is limited when it comes to shark fishing from the surf. Commonly caught sharks include the Leopard Shark, the Soupfin Shark, and the Seven-gill Shark. In the eastern coast of the United States, the striped bass is highly valued. This species can be fished from shore and ranges in weight from a few pounds to the world record 78.5 lb (35.6 kg). Fish in the 30 to 40 lb (15 kg) range are common on the mid-Atlantic U.S. coast from New York to the Carolinas. Some other available species are bluefish, redfish (red drum), black drum, tautog (blackfish), flounder (fluke), weakfish (sea trout), bonito and albacore tuna, pompano, Spanish mackerel, snook and tarpon. Even sharks can be targeted by surf fishermen. From North Carolina south the redfish (red drum) is one of the most targeted fish by surf anglers. Fishermen use rods 10 to 13 feet to cast to drum using baits like cut mullet, bunker (cut menhaden, or pogies as Carolina anglers call them), and cut bait from spot, croaker, or bluefish. Red drum hit a bait aggressively and are a much beloved surf fishing species. The overfished status of this fish for many years due to the blackened redfish craze of the 1980s led to strict recreational size and creel limits, however, so surf anglers must learn the local rules.Jeffrey Weeks, Surf and Saltwater Fishing in the Carolinas Beach buggies Many areas allow four-wheel-drive (4WD) vehicles on to the beach. This allows the surf fisherman to scout and fish large stretches of shoreline. Although the term \\"beach buggy\\" may be applied to special vehicles for transportation on sand, 4x4 trucks and SUV's with deflated tires are more often used in surf fishing. Permits are usually required and need to be obtained from the appropriate state or local authorities. Most require an additional list of safety and other equipment, sometimes called Beach Permit Kits to ensure that the vehicle and its inhabitants can safely navigate the soft sand and are prepared in the event the vehicle gets stuck. Beach Buggy access can be hindered at times by beach closures, due to endangered bird species nesting. Beach buggy access is often hotly contested between environmental groups, and beach access enthusiasts. Therefore, it is a good idea to check on local regulations before you attempt to drive your vehicle on the beach. Driving in restricted areas can result in serious penalties.

Pierce and starring John Agar. Plot A spacefaring crew from an advanced civilization is preparing to return home after an extended voyage. The crew includes \\"humans\\" (represented in the film by Caucasian actors and actresses) and \\"Centaurians\\" (represented in the film by Asian actors and actresses). The Centaurians have been rescued from their home planet after a catastrophic event, not explained in the movie, has devastated their planet. They are being brought back with the spacefaring explorers with an expectation that they will be assimilated into their new parent culture. One of the ships in the fleet is hijacked by a few of its Centaurian passengers and crash-lands on a prehistoric planet in the \\"Solaris\\" system. Countermanding orders, the rest of the fleet returns to search for survivors after the crash. In the film's \\"twist,\\" by the time that the rescuers (traveling at fast sublight speeds) are able to return to the planet, they are encountering the descendants of the original crash survivors - explained in a simplified version of time dilation. Linda, a Centaurian from the rescue ship, falls in love with Tang after he saves her from drowning. After fighting with the planet's indigenous species (including giant iguanas meant to represent dinosaurs), Tang and Linda are marooned on the prehistoric planet - and the latter is revealed to be the captain's own daughter. In the film's coda, this savage and primitive planet is revealed to be Earth. Themes Race relations are the film's overarching theme, although its approach to the subject has been typically criticized in retrospect. > \\"... a blatant social commentary on race relations (from a mid-60s point of > view). Even though the screenplay tries to preach fairness, some of the > subtle signals send contradictory messages. The crew members of the Cosmos > are portrayed as superior. The Centaurians as inferior. The crew are clearly > all-white. They dress in tidy white uniforms with snappy cravats. They are > in control, follow orders, and are concerned for others. The Centaurians are > \\"rustic,\\" (and all played by asians) Their outfits are sleeveless. Their men > are hotheads and trouble makers. (their women are nice, though). Even the > \\"progressive\\" notion of Tang being the mixed-race son of a \\"white\\" and a > Centaurian, is undermined by his apparent comfort at being a cave man. > Subtle signal: \\"They\\" are savages at heart. > \\"The real subject matter of the film is race relations, with the > \\"Centaurians\\" all being played by Asian actors and the \\"Humans\\" all played > by whites and the message is that different races can and should get along. > This is a noble sentiment of course, but the movie around it is both > incredibly clunky, unintentionally condescending and has an incredibly lazy > twist at the end.\\" Reviews Leonard Maltin gave the film one and a half stars. The film has an 18% rating on the Rotten Tomatoes web site.\\"Women of the Prehistoric Planet\\" Retrieved on November 3, 2012 Other reviewers have assessed the film as a \\"bomb\\" and described it as \\"Typical bad sci-fi ... with horrid special effects.\\" DVD releases The MST3K version of the film (episode #104), accompanied by a short introduction by actress Irene Tsu (Linda), was released by Rhino Home Video as part of the 'Collection, Volume 9' box set (now out of print). Englewood Entertainment released a videotape version, and later DVD version, of the original, uninterrupted movie. Poster Women of the Prehistoric Planet's provocative film poster features the tagline \\"It's a battle of the sexes as savage planet women attack female space invaders\\" and depicts a blonde and a brunette in a catfight. However, there are no \\"planet women\\" in the movie, as the only female Centurian (Irene Tsu) does not originate from the prehistoric planet. Nor does the film contain any scenes of women fighting each other.

Biography Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes was born on 22 September 1920, the son of Ivo Murray Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, 20th Baron Saye and Sele, and Hersey Cecilia Hester Butler. Despite a family connection with Winchester College, he was educated at Eton, and then at New College, Oxford. During the Second World War he served in the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own). He received an emergency commission in the Rifle Brigade on 19 April 1941, and was promoted war-substantive lieutenant on 1 October 1942 and temporary captain on 3 September 1943. In March 1945, he was mentioned in dispatches for service in North-West Europe. In April 1945 Twisleton-Wykeham- Fiennes and his regiment, the 8th Battalion of the Rifle Brigade, were among the first troops to reach Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. In 2020 he recalled for the Daily Telegraph, \\"We turned down a small track, and it opened into a sight you would never want to see again ... People being chopped up, people on the ground, pits with three or four hundred dead bodies in each ... It was like something from a nightmare, and the smell was overpowering.\\" He met with Bergen-Belsen survivor Mala Tribich (originally from Piotrków Trybunalski, Poland) at his family seat, Broughton Castle, shortly before the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the camp, and was ready \\"to grovel before [Tribich], because I have such a respect and admiration for her. She is the most remarkable lady ... all these survivors are.\\" Tribich, who was 14 and ill with typhus when Bergen-Belsen was liberated, had previously survived the ghetto in her hometown and Ravensbrück concentration camp. After the war, Fiennes remained in the army, receiving promotion to war-substantive captain and temporary major on 15 January 1946. On 22 May 1948, he received a regular commission as a lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade (seniority from 22 May 1943), with promotion to captain effective from the same date (seniority from 22 November 1947). He was stationed in Palestine during the Palestine Emergency in 1946-47, for which he was again mentioned in dispatches in January 1949. He resigned his commission on 8 February 1950, leaving with the honorary rank of major.

She has been an associate director at the Sheffield Crucible and at the Gate Theatre in London.  Early life and education  Mackmin was born in Leeds. Mackmin's sister, Scarlett Mackmin, is a choreographer also working in the London theatre. Mackmin attended the Central School of Speech and Drama, studying acting.  Career  Dissatisfied with her acting career, she became a clothing designer at one point and set up a business with her sister in London's Soho neighbourhood. Mackmin was friends with the actress and writer Charlotte Jones, and it was Jones' first play Airswimming which also provided Mackmin with her directorial debut in 1997. She had only done two plays when Michael Grandage offered her the position of associate director at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. There she scored notable successes with Arthur Miller's The Crucible and Caryl Churchill's Cloud Nine, the latter earning her the 2004 TMA Award for best director. She has also had a successful stint at the Gate Theatre, where her most recent directorial effort was Ibsen's Ghosts. Mackmin has repeatedly worked with Charlotte Jones since their joint debut, directing Jones' plays In Flame, The Dark and The Lightning Play. She has also collaborated several times with Amelia Bullmore whom she originally directed as an actress in The Crucible in 2004. Since then, she has directed Bullmore's play Mammals and also her adaptation of Ghosts. In 2006, Mackmin staged an acclaimed triple bill at the National Theatre, entitled Burn/Chatroom/Citizenship. In the spring of 2007, she again won plaudits, this time for her direction of Dying For It, Moira Buffini's 'free adaptation' of Nikolai Erdman's The Suicide. Mackmin directed Toby Stephens as Henry in a revival of Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing at the Old Vic Theatre in London from April through June 2010.

It is specifically designed for images with few colors, where the objects of interest look alike with small variation. For example, color image segmentation of: * Oranges from a tree * Stained cells from microscopic images GemIdent also packages data analysis tools to investigate spatial relationships among the objects identified. History GemIdent was developed at Stanford University by Adam Kapelner from June, 2006 until January, 2007 in the lab of Dr. Peter Lee under the tutelage of Professor Susan Holmes. The concept was inspired by data Kohrt et al. who analyzed immune profiles of lymph nodes in breast cancer patients. Hence, GemIdent works well when identifying cells in IHC-stained tissue imaged via automated light microscopy when the nuclear background stain and membrane/cytoplasmic stain are well-defined. In 2008, it was adapted to support multispectral imaging techniques. Methodology GemIdent uses supervised learning to perform automated identification of regions of interest in the images. Therefore, the user must do a substantial amount of work first supplying the relevant colors, then pointing out examples of the objects or regions themselves as well as negatives (training set creation). When a user clicks on a pixel, many scores are generated using the surrounding color information via Mahalanobis Ring Score attribute generation (read the JSS paper for a detailed exposition). These scores are then used to build a random forest machine-learning classifier which will then classify pixels in any given image. After classification, there may be mistakes. The user can return to training and point out the specific mistakes and then reclassify. These training-classifying-retraining-reclassifying iterations (considered interactive boosting) can result in a highly accurate segmentation. Recent applications In 2010, Setiadi et al. analyzed histological sections of lymph nodes looking at spatial densities of B and T cells. \\"Cell numbers do not capture the full range of information encoded within tissues\\".

GemIdent analyzing results using data analysis and visualization tools The command-line data analysis and visualization interface in action analyzing results of a classification of a lymph node from the Kohrt study. The histogram displays the distribution of distances from T-cells to neighboring cancer cells. The binary image of cancer membrane is the result of a pixel- only classification. The open PDF document is the autogenerated report of the analysis which includes a thumbnail view of the entire lymph node, counts and Type I error rates for all phenotypes, as well as a transcript of the analyses performed.

Singer grew up in Greenwood where he studied violin as a child but, as a teenager, switched to clarinet and then tenor saxophone, which became his instrument of choice.  Career  From the late 1930s Singer began playing in local bands, including Ernie Fields', before joining Jay McShann's orchestra in 1943 and then moving to New York. After working in other bands, he joined Oran \\"Hot Lips\\" Page's band in 1947 and began working as a session musician with King Records. In early 1948, he left Page, formed his own small group, and was signed to Mercury Records where he cut his first single \\"Fine As Wine\\" with a B side \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" (not the same title made famous by Bill Haley), co-written with Sam Theard.Fuchs, Otto (2011) Bill Haley: Father of Rock 'n' Roll, p. 118. Wagner Verlag at Google Books. Retrieved May 7, 2013. For the Savoy label of Newark, New Jersey, he recorded the instrumental \\"Corn Bread\\", which made No. 1 on the R&B; charts in September 1948, and gave Singer a new popularity and nickname. His follow-up the following year, \\"Beef Stew\\", was a much smaller hit. In the early and mid-1950s, he recorded with Mercury, toured with R&B; artists such as The Orioles and Charles Brown, and increasingly worked as a session musician. In 1958, he began recording with Prestige Records as a jazz soloist and performing at the Metropole Cafe in New York with leading jazz musicians such as Roy Eldridge and Coleman Hawkins. In 1965, after touring Europe with Earl \\"Fatha\\" Hines' band, Singer stayed in France to settle near Paris. He continued to record and also toured extensively around Europe and Africa, performing with various bands including Charlie Watts' and the Duke Ellington Orchestra.  Later  Singer appears on the 1981 live recording Rocket 88 with the UK-based boogie-woogie band Rocket 88. Also in the summer of 1981 Singer visited London, where he recorded two albums for John Stedman's record label, JSP. The first album, Swing on it (JSP 1028), was recorded with British musicians, including Jim Mullen, Peter King, Mike Carr and Harold Smith, while the second, recorded a day later with the same group, also featured Jimmy Witherspoon (\\"Big Blues\\", JSP 1032). Singer shared artist billing on a recording made in 1989, along with Al Copley, \\"Royal Blue\\", released on the Black Top label in 1990.  Acting  He appeared as an actor in the award- winning 1990 feature film Taxi Blues.  Honors, awards, distinctions  Singer's 1969 album, Paris Soul Food, featuring him on saxophone and vocals; Robin Hemingway, vocals, arrangements and album production; and Manu Dibango, saxophone, organ and arrangements won a French Record Academy award for best international LP. In 1974, he went on a State Department tour of Africa with Horace Parlan.Feather, Leonard & Gitler, Ira The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz Oxford University Press US, 2007 , 9780195320008 at Google Books Singer was awarded the prestigious title of \\"Chevalier des Arts\\" by the French government.  Legacy  A documentary film, Hal Singer, Keep the Music Going, was made by Haitian-American director Guetty Felin in 1999. It was made in collaboration with the CNC in France and the French cable music network Muzzik. The documentary wove into the narrative Singer's personal super-8 movies, archival images of the jazz era, and footage of Singer's home in Paris, in concert and teaching jazz to the younger generation of musicians in France.

He was born into a Jewish family in Nová Cerekev, a market town in south Bohemia, then part of the Austrian Empire. After World War II, Šling became the Communist Party's Regional Secretary of Brno in Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic). In 1952, Šling fell out of political favor as Stalin was trying to increase his power in Eastern Europe. He was accused of Zionism, convicted and sentenced to death at a show trial, and executed. He was later politically rehabilitated by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ). Background Otto Šling was born in 1912, the son of a Jewish factory owner and his wife. In his teenage years, he became politically active and joined the communist movement that developed after the Great War. After graduating from the German high school of Teplicích, Šling in 1932 entered German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague to study medicine. He never finished his course or qualified; with the outbreak Spanish Civil War in 1936, he joined the International Brigades in a medical capacity and went to Spain in 1937. Šling was injured in Spain. After returning home briefly and the German advance into the Sudetenland in 1938, he emigrated to exile in London with others involved in the Communist cause. There he met Marian, whom he married in 1941. During World War II, he worked as the secretary of Young Czechoslovakia, a Communist organization for the émigrés in London. After the War ended, Šling returned to Czechoslovakia. He was elected to the Provisional National Assembly and became the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) Regional Party Secretary of Moravia in Brno. The KSČ took power in a coup in February 1948 amidst little opposition. Suppression of dissent Following Yugoslavia’s expulsion from Cominform in 1948, the Communist regimes across Eastern Europe embarked on a period of terror and show trials. In 1949, trials were conducted in Hungary, Poland, and Bulgaria, but prime minister Klement Gottwald asserted that the KSČ had not been infiltrated by any conspirators. Pressure from the Soviet Union led the KSČ to begin its own search for conspirators. It had to respond to the growing trend in other Eastern European countries (especially obvious in the trial of László Rajk in Hungary) to link internal treason to an international conspiracy. In the autumn of 1949, there was a push to reaffirm Soviet, not national, socialism, by routing out \\"bourgeois\\" nationalists and Zionists, and Šling came under scrutiny. The Rajk trial had revealed the possibility that the center of the international plot was in Czechoslovakia. Šling’s name was culled from interrogations from the Hungarian trials, as were the names Artur London and Gustáv Husák. Up through mid-1950, Šling was still supported by the Central Committee. After he conducted a controversial review of Znojmo district officials, the Party grew more suspicious. In the summer of 1950, Bruno Köhler drafted a resolution on the errors in the Brno Regional Party. Arrest and imprisonment On 6 October 1950, Šling was arrested. The only evidence of his conspiring against the Party was a letter of unconfirmed authorship, supposedly sent by Šling to Emanuel Viktor Voska. It did not confirm espionage. Šling's wife and two children were taken to Prague on the night of 5 October. His wife was imprisoned there for more than two years, until the conclusion of his trial. Rudolf Slánský, General Secretary of the KSČ, distanced himself from Šling, although they had been quite close. The final draft of the resolution, submitted by Köhler and a Central Committee delegation from Prague, accused Šling of being an enemy agent, committing espionage, incorrect methods, suppressing criticism, sabotage, and not recognizing opposition from the class enemy. Šling was expelled from the party. “Šlingism” became synonymous with the slightest deviation from the party line. By February 1951, fifty people were imprisoned in connection with the Šling investigation, including Marie Švermová. During interrogations, Šling would often confess and then retract his confession. Records indicate that Šling was conscious that the investigations were shaped by Moscow. Eventually, he believed that he had to be sacrificed for the Party. He apparently felt obligated to produce evidence against Slánský when he in turn became the target of investigations. The trial The scripted show trial that included Šling, Slánský, and twelve others began on 20 November 1952. All were accused of being Trotskyist- zionist-Titoist-bourgeois-nationalist enemies of the Czech people. A curious incident occurred during the trial: Šling was wearing the same trousers as at his arrest. Because he had lost so much weight since his arrest, and because the prisoners were not given belts, lest they use them to commit suicide, he had to hold his trousers up with his hands. During his cross-examination, Šling was gesticulating and accidentally let trousers fall down, causing a merry uproar in the courtroom from all, including Šling, except for the interrogators. In Šling’s closing statement, he said, “I was a treacherous enemy within the Communist Party…I am justly an object of contempt and deserve the maximum and the hardest punishment.” On 27 November 1952, Rudolf Slánský, Bedrich Geminder, Ludvik Frejka, Vladimir Clementis, Bedrich Reicin, Karel Šváb, Rudolf Margolius, Otto Fischl, Otto Šling, and André Simone were sentenced to death; the remaining three, including Eugen Loebl and Artur London, received life sentences. Šling was executed on 3 December 1952. His last words were, “Mr. President [of the Court], I wish every success to the Communist Party, the Czechoslovak people, and the President of the Republic. I have never been a spy.” Rehabilitation and posthumous references to Šling On 21 August 1963, Otto Šling and the others convicted in his trial were officially rehabilitated by the KSČ and acquitted of all indictments. Three years earlier, the USSR had stated publicly that an anti-state conspiracy center had never existed. In the Dubček Government’s Commission of Inquiry, Václav Kopecký’s report in February 1951 is labeled a “mass of fabrications, idle gossip, and irresponsible dramatics about the Šling-Švermová case.” This rehabilitation came at a time of de-Stalinization, when governments blamed the previous regimes and ideologies for the current situation. Reports on the trials came out during the Prague Spring period of 1968 in Czechoslovakia, though were quickly suppressed after the invasion of the Warsaw Pact troops in August that year.

Early life and education Joseph Cistone was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Daniel A. and Josephine R. (née Altomare) Cistone, Sr. One of three children, he has two brothers, Daniel and Anthony. He attended Our Lady of Consolation School and graduated from Father Judge High School in 1967. He then studied at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary, from where he obtained a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy (1971) and Master's in Divinity (1975). Priesthood Cistone was ordained to the priesthood by John Cardinal Krol on May 17, 1975. He then served as parochial vicar at Epiphany of Our Lord Parish (1975–1979) and chaplain at St. Maria Goretti High School (1977–1979) in Philadelphia. He became parochial vicar at St. Jerome Parish in 1979, and advocate on the metropolitan tribunal in 1980. From 1982 to 1987, Cistone served as parochial vicar at St. Jude Parish in Chalfont, member of the admissions board for the Archdiocesan Permanent Diaconate Program, and Newman Chaplain at Delaware Valley College of Science. He was also Defender of the Bond on the metropolitan tribunal (1983–1989), and parochial vicar at St. Francis of Assisi Parish in Norristown (1987–1989) and St. Bernard Parish in Philadelphia (1989–1991). In 1991, he became Dean of Formation for the Theology Division of St. Charles Seminary. Cistone was named associate to Msgr. Edward Cullen, vicar for administration of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, in 1993. He later served as assistant vicar for administration from 1994 to 1998, and vicar general and vicar for administration from 1998 to 2009. He was raised to the rank of Honorary Prelate of His Holiness in April 1998. Episcopal career Auxiliary Bishop of Philadelphia On June 28, 2004, Cistone was appointed an Auxiliary Bishop of Philadelphia and Titular Bishop of Casae Medianae by Pope John Paul II. Cistone received his episcopal consecration on the following July 28 from Justin Cardinal Rigali, with Bishops Robert Maginnis and Michael Burbidge serving as co-consecrators, in the Cathedral-Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul. He selected as his episcopal motto: \\"Father of Mercy and Love\\". In addition to his duties as vicar general and vicar for administration, Cistone served as head of the Secretariat for Catholic Human Services and the Secretariat for Temporal Services. He also had pastoral oversight for parishes in South Philadelphia and a portion of Delaware County. Bishop of Saginaw Cistone was later named the sixth Bishop of Saginaw, Michigan, by Pope Benedict XVI on May 20, 2009. He succeeded Robert J. Carlson (who was appointed Archbishop of St. Louis the previous April), and was installed on July 28, 2009. As Bishop, he serves as the spiritual leader for 120,000 Catholics in Central Michigan. Within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Cistone was a member of the Committee for Protection of Children and Young People, Committee for Cultural Diversity in the Church, Subcommittee for African-American Affairs, and Committee on Budget and Finance. In 2011, Bishop Cistone appointed a 19-member commission to make recommendations about parish closings. In January 2013, Cistone announced that many of the diocese's 105 parishes would be closed, reducing the number of parishes to 56. \\"I saw a need to position ourselves in a way by which parish communities are re-invigorated, liturgically alive and actively engaged in outreach to those in need.\\" However, many Catholics were angered by Cistone's announcement, holding protests against the parish closings. Retired priests spoke out against the parish closures, calling the recommendations a \\"complete injustice\\" and stating that nobody \\"on the planning commission or the Bishop understand.\\" Reportedly, 5,000 people in the Saginaw Diocese left the Catholic Church between 2013 and 2015. Death Cistone died suddenly at his home in Saginaw, Michigan, on October 16, 2018, aged 69 from lung cancer.Saginaw bishop dies after battle with lung cancer, catholicnewsagency.com; accessed October 19, 2018. Grand Jury Report According to a 2005 grand jury investigation into clergy sexual abuse, while serving as assistant vicar for administration in 1996, Cistone was involved with silencing a nun who tried to alert parishioners at St. Gabriel parish about abuse by a priest. A week after being named to lead the Diocese of Saginaw, Cistone was asked by a mid- Michigan newspaper reporter about the grand jury investigation and his reported role in covering up instances of sexual abuse. Cistone expressed unhappiness with how little opportunity he had been given to respond to the report, saying, \\"Unfortunately, the grand jury procedure, as followed in Philadelphia, did not allow for any opportunity to address such questions to offer explanation or clarification.\\"Lackey, Angela. \\"Bishop addresses abuse issue.\\" Midland Daily News, May 29, 2009. Cistone also expressed surprise that he had not been questioned about the grand jury report during his introductory press conference and told the reporter, \\"Had it come up, I certainly would have addressed it.\\" However, when given the opportunity to answer questions about his actions by the newspaper reporter, Cistone refused to answer specific questions on the matter. On June 9, 2009, a group of survivors of clergy abuse protested Cistone's appointment outside the Saginaw Diocese office. Members of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) demanded that Cistone hold a public forum to explain his actions as described in the 2005 grand jury report. SNAP President Barbara Blaine said the actions had to be taken because, \\"the innocence of children was shattered needlessly because of the action and inaction of this bishop.\\" In response to the group's calls for transparency, Cistone said, \\"If someone wants to go back and rehash what the church may have done based on knowledge and experience or lack of experience the church had, well, that's OK, but that's not productive. What's productive is what we can do to move forward.\\" On August 31, 2009, representatives of SNAP invited Bishop Cistone to attend a town hall meeting and participate in a discussion on the topic of clergy abuse. The town hall meeting was scheduled to be held on October 25, 2009.Gully, Paul. \\"Sex abuse survivors group invites Saginaw Catholic Bishop Cistone to town hall\\", Saginaw News, August 31, 2009.

Alleged abuse at Bishop's home parish A maintenance worker alleged that in July 2009, he was groped, kissed and sat on by a deacon in the rectory of the Cathedral of St. Mary in Saginaw. The Cathedral is the home parish of Bishop Cistone. The maintenance worker reported that after he went to the rector of the parish with his allegations, he was fired from his position in retaliation. The rector of the Cathedral later resigned from his post in November 2009, taking a leave of absence from active ministry. Bishop Cistone explained that the rector's resignation was due to \\"personal health\\" issues. Cistone made no further comment on the allegations made by the Cathedral maintenance worker. Named Sexual Abuse \\"Kingpin\\" in 2012 In August 2012, Cistone was named in a lawsuit surrounding clergy sex abuse allegations at his former assignment in Philadelphia. Cistone was described by Philadelphia attorney Slade McLaughlin as a \\"kingpin\\" of the Catholic sex abuse cases. Press reports indicate that he admitted that in 1994 he watched as Church records with the names of abusers were shredded. Search Warrant 2018 In March 2018, the Bishop's home was searched by police who cited his lack of cooperation in their investigation of sexual abuse in the Church.

Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase catalyzes the final, rate-limiting step in vitamin B6 metabolism, the biosynthesis of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, the biologically active form of vitamin B6 which acts as an essential cofactor. Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase is a member of the enzyme class oxidases, or more specifically, oxidoreductases. These enzymes catalyze a simultaneous oxidation-reduction reaction. The substrate oxidase enzymes is hydroxlyated by one oxygen atom of molecular oxygen. Concurrently, the other oxygen atom is reduced to water. Even though molecular oxygen is the electron acceptor in these enzymes' reactions, they are unique because oxygen does not appear in the oxidized product.  Structure  Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase is a homodimer, or a molecule consisting of two identical polypeptide subunits. It is hypothesized that the two monomers are held together by disulfide bonds. There are also salt-bridge interactions between the two monomers. Each subunit tightly binds one molecule of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate tightly on each subunit. Both alpha- helices and beta-sheets are present in the protein motif, which is best described as a split-barrel structure. This structure is due, in part, to the disulfide bonds present in the secondary protein structure of this enzyme. Multiple thiol groups (–SH) indicate the presence of disulfide bonds in the structure of the molecule. This enzyme requires the presence of a cofactor, FMN (flavin mononucleotide). Cofactors are ions or coenzymes necessary for enzyme activity. The FMN is located in a deep cleft (formed by the two polypeptide subunits), and held in place by extensive hydrogen-bond interactions with the protein. In this particular case, the FMN helps the enzyme to bind the substrates. In the absence of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), the active site of the enzyme is in an “open” conformation. Once substrate binds and is converted to PLP, the active site of the enzyme is in a partially “closed” conformation. Specific amino acid residues can form hydrogen bonds with the PLP, thus forming a lid that physically covers the active site, giving rise to the “closed” conformation.; Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase structure.  Pathway  Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase is the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limited step of the B6 metabolism pathway. Vitamin B6, which is also known as pyridoxine, is a crucial nutrient for the human body, as it is responsible for more bodily functions than any other vitamin. Vitamin B6 is a coenzyme in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. This means that the enzymes which break these entities down for use in the body cannot function unless Vitamin B6 is present to induce a conformational change in the enzyme, thus activating it. Vitamin B6 also plays a role in the synthesis of hormones, red blood cells, neurotransmitters and enzymes. A person who is deficient in Vitamin B6 could suffer from insomnia, as well as suffer damage to the central nervous system.  Reactions  Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase catalyzes several reactions; the two most important are the deamination of pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate and the deamination of pyridoxine 5-phosphate, both of which are key intermediates in the metabolism of B6. Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase's EC number is 1.4.3.5. : pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate + H2O + O2 → pyridoxal 5′-phosphate + NH3 \\\\+ H2O2 ::Image:Pyridoxamine reaction.gif :pyridoxine phosphate + O2 H2O2 \\\\+ pyridoxal phosphate :: Image:Pyridoxine reaction.gif Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase also plays a role in nitrogen metabolism, converting amines to aldehydes and NH3 by the reaction: : amine + H2O + O2 aldehyde + NH3 \\\\+ H2O2 ::Image:Amine_reaction.png  Kinetics  In humans, the pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase enzyme exhibits a low catalytic rate constant of 0.2 s−1, with low Km values for both pyridoxine 5′-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate. The enzyme also has a low turnover rate, meaning that it is relatively slow converting substrate to product. Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate is an effective product inhibitor. Since pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6, is the product of the metabolic pathway, if it exists in excess, then the pathway need not proceed to keep making product. However, if it exists in low concentrations, then that is a signal for the pathway to synthesize more. This is an example of feedback inhibition.  Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase in different organisms  Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase has been highly conserved over time, as there are many similarities between the enzyme as it is found in humans and Escherichia coli. Although there is only 39% retention of amino acid sequence from the E. coli version of the enzyme to the human version, the sequences for the FMN binding site and the substrate active sites are among the very highly conserved portion. One of the key differences is that the human pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase has a higher specificity for the pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate substrate, whereas the pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase in E. coli has a higher specificity pyridoxal 5′-phosphate substrate.

It combines the game of blackjack with elements of No Limit Texas Hold'Em. Unlike Texas Hold'Em tournaments, players are still competing against the same dealer that is why the results of most players at the table are likely to be the same. UltimateBet, a sponsor of the Ultimate Blackjack Tour, offered online elimination blackjack tournaments prior to bankruptcy. Rules A round of elimination blackjack in most cases is thirty hands in length. Depending upon the organization hosting the event, a player will start with between $10,000 and $100,000 in chips. While certain organizations have their own house rules, elimination blackjack usually follows the following rules: * The house must hit on soft 17 and anything below, and must stay on hard 17 and anything above. * A player may split pairs up to four times with the exception of aces. Some rule sets also allow splitting different cards valued at 10, such as a queen and a jack. * A shoe of six decks is used. * A player's bet must stay within the minimum and maximum bet allowed at the table (this rule is excluded in the World Series of Blackjack). The maximum bet is usually at least several times bigger than the starting chip stack. * A player may surrender their hand and thus recover one half of their original bet. * A player may buy insurance if the up card for the house is an ace. * A player can only double down with two cards. * A maximum of seven players is allowed per table. * A player has twenty five seconds in a normal hand to make a decision. In an elimination hand a player has forty five seconds. Some organizations allow a secret bet where the players at the table do not know the value of that player's bet, until after that player's hand is concluded. In most games, this option can be used only once during a single round of the tournament. Eliminations Depending on the organization hosting the event, a player is eliminated from the tournament in three ways: * Losing all of his chips. * Not having enough chips to meet the minimum required bet. * Being the player with the fewest chips after a certain number of hands are played. In this case, the usual cutoff points are hands #8, #16, and #25 (so- called \\"elimination hands\\"). A player is always eliminated from the game in an elimination hand, even if a player has been eliminated in the previous hand. Winning Usually the last player left at the table is the winner, or the player with the most chips after 30 hands have been played. Blackjack is sometimes played in a multi-table tournament format where one or more players advance to the next round after the others have been eliminated. If there are too many players left after 30 hands, the players who advance are determined by chip stacks.

He was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fifth round of the 2007 NFL Draft after he played college football at Louisville.Smith also was a member of the Denver Broncos and Jacksonville Jaguars.After his playing career he began coaching in the college ranks and as 2020 he returned to the NFL as a coach with the Miami Dolphins. Early years Smith attended James S. Rickards High School in Tallahassee, Florida, where he was a two-sport star, excelling in football and track. As a junior, he finished ninth at the Florida state track meet in the 110 metre hurdles. On the football field, Smith earned team MVP, first team All-District and Honorable Mention All-State honors during his junior and senior campaigns. After starting at fullback as a sophomore, blocking for All- American running back Michael Fisher who ran for more than 2,000 yards and 30 scores, Smith played on both sides of the ball as a junior, notching 105 tackles, four sacks and two forced fumbles while also rushing for 947 yards and 10 touchdowns on 88 carries. In his senior year, he tallied over 1,300 yards and 11 touchdowns, earning first team All-Big Bend Area honors. Considered a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Smith was listed as the No. 66 prospect from Florida in the class of 2003.. He chose Louisville over Indiana. College career In his true freshman season at Louisville, Smith appeared in 12 games and rushed 18 times for 131 yards and one touchdown. Splitting carries with junior Lionel Gates and sophomore Eric Shelton, Smith averaged a team-best 7.3 yards a carry. His first career touchdown came in the regular- season finale against Cincinnati. As a sophomore, Smith appeared in 10 games and rushed 37 times for 347 yards and four touchdowns, averaging 9.4 yards per rush. His best game of the season again came versus Cincinnati, as he scored a career-high three touchdowns. Although Gates and Shelton had left for the 2005 NFL Draft, Smith spent the 2005 season as backup to Michael Bush. While Bush led the NCAA in scoring, Smith ranked third on the team in rushing with 523 yards and six touchdowns, averaging 4.9 yards per carry. Expected to play a backup role again in 2006, Smith became the starting tailback after Bush suffered a season-ending injury to his tibia. Smith rushed for 697 yards on 126 carries, averaging 5.5 yards per carry, and scoring five touchdowns. In his best game of the season, he scored two touchdowns, rushing for 165 yards on 16 carries, versus Syracuse. Professional career 2007 NFL Draft At the 2006 Senior Bowl, Smith was not able to impress scouts, instead \\"looking like an ordinary ball carrier\\".. He was selected in the fifth round (148th overall) in the 2007 NFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. He was signed to a three-year contract on June 22, 2007.. Kansas City Chiefs His first career NFL start was on November 25, 2007 due to injuries to Larry Johnson and the retirement of Priest Holmes. He recorded his first career touchdown on that date against the Oakland Raiders at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. On December 5, 2009, he was placed on Injured Reserve due to an ankle injury. He was re-signed by the Chiefs on February 24, 2010.. Kansas City Chiefs waived Smith on June 14, 2010. Denver Broncos The Denver Broncos were assigned Smith off waivers on June 15, 2010. He was waived on August 4. Jacksonville Jaguars Smith was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars on August 25, 2010. He was waived on September 3. Coaching career  College Coaching  In 2012, Smith began his coaching career as the graduate assistant at Arkansas. In 2013, he joined the Western Kentucky football program as tailbacks coach. WKU's head coach Bobby Petrino was the head coach of Louisville when Smith played for the Cardinals. In January 2014, Smith was brought along to Louisville and became the running back coach for Louisville under new/old Head Coach Bobby Petrino. After Petrino was fired in 2018, Smith spent the 2019 season coaching running backs at Rutgers he however wasn’t retained by the newly hired Greg Schiano for the 2020 season.  NFL Coaching  On June 13, 2020 it was announced that Smith would be an offensive quality control coach for the Miami Dolphins.

However, his plan fails and he contemplates suicide. His neighbour, Alexander Petrovich, decides to make money from Semyon's misery by exploiting his intended suicide to several bidders. These bidders planned to exploit Semyon's death to the furtherance of their own individual cause. The Intelligentsia, represented by Aristarkh, is the first to approach him. From this point on, Semyon finds himself being manipulated by various people representing the business world, the arts, the workers, romance, etc. During the course of the play, each character reveals the worst side of their personality, to humorous effect. Productions The Suicide was first translated into English by Peter Tegel and premiered by the Royal Shakespeare Company at The Other Place, Stratford, on 13 June 1979.

Huang Xing and nearly a hundred fellow revolutionaries forced their way into the residence of the Qing viceroy of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. The uprising was initially successful but Qing reinforcements turned the battle into a catastrophic defeat. Most revolutionaries were killed, only few managed to escape. Huang Xing was wounded during the battle; he lost one of his fingers when it was hit by a bullet. 86 bodies were found (but only 72 could be identified), and the bodies of yet many others were not found. The dead were mostly nationalistic, revolutionary youths with all kinds of social backgrounds -- former students, teachers, journalists, and patriotic overseas Chinese. Some of them were of high rank in the Alliance. Before the battle, most of the revolutionaries knew that the battle would probably be lost, since they were heavily outnumbered, but they went into battle anyway. The mission was carried out like that of a suicide squad. Their letters to their loved ones were later found. Legacy The dead were buried together in one grave on the Yellow Flower Mound, a mound near where they fought and died which has lent its name to the uprising.

They were Las Vegas's first professional team in any sport. The first year The Wranglers were one of the charter franchises of the Class C Sunset League in 1947. Despite Paul Zaby's league-leading .402 batting average and a historic offensive season from Calvin Felix, the Wranglers (a Boston Braves affiliate) finished just 73-67, third place, and were beaten in the semifinals by Riverside, California. Las Vegas was managed by ex-major leaguer Newt Kimball, who also won 14 games as a pitcher for the Wranglers that year. The 21-year-old Felix led the Sunset League in nearly every offensive category in 1947, including 52 home runs, the second-most ever hit in a pro league by such a young player (Tony Lazzeri, also then 21, hit 60 HR for Salt Lake City in 1925, but his team played 200 games). Felix was sold to the Class AAA Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League after the season, but never played for them; instead he wound up with the unaffiliated Denver Bears of the Western League in 1948, and with Santa Barbara (a Dodgers affiliate) in 1949. By 1953, Felix was with the AAA Montreal Royals, but was sent down to the Texas League in '54; he never played in the majors. Actor Cameron Mitchell pitched one game for the '47 Wranglers; Las Vegas, needing all the pitching help they could get in the offense-minded Sunset League, signed Mitchell after he shut out the Los Angeles Angels (PCL) for four innings in an exhibition game. But the actor was shelled, allowing eleven runs in less than an inning to the Ontario, California Orioles. Later years Las Vegas continued to be one of the circuit's top teams the next three years. In 1948, the Wranglers moved up to second place and made to the championship series before losing to Reno. However, the team drew only around 600 fans per game (Las Vegas' population was only around 20,000 then) and faced a $15,000 deficit at season's end, partially because they were no longer affiliated with the Braves. In 1949, however, the Wranglers blew the league away with an 88-38 record and easily claimed the pennant, with attendance climbing to over 1,000 per contest. Due to budget cuts, there were no playoffs that year, and the '49 Wranglers had claimed Las Vegas' first pro sports championship (and last one for 37 years, until the Las Vegas Stars won the PCL crown in 1986). After a third-place finish in 1950, the top teams in the Sunset League merged with the Arizona–Mexico League to form the new Southwest International League in 1951. Declining attendance vexed minor-league ball throughout the country in the early 1950s, and Las Vegas was no exception: despite two more winning seasons in 1951–52, the Wranglers (along with the rest of the SWIL) died after the 1952 season. Baseball returned to Las Vegas in 1957, but the new team (also called the Wranglers) finished fourth in the Arizona–Mexico League, then folded. On May 26, 1958, however, the San Jose Pirates of the California League shifted operations to Las Vegas, renaming themselves (once again) the Wranglers. But the team finished a poor seventh and disbanded after the season when the Cal League contracted from eight teams to six. Las Vegas would not have another professional baseball team for a quarter-century, until the Las Vegas Stars joined the Pacific Coast League in 1983.

Recorded and released in 1968, it is considered one of his more experimental albums, combining not only folk elements, but shreds of psychedelia, early blues, country fiddles, ragas, and white noise. The album had many reissues with various track listings, jacket designs and mismatched titles. History The mythical bluesman named Blind Joe Death, first introduced by Fahey on his debut album Blind Joe Death, appears again in the liner notes of The Voice of the Turtle. For years Fahey and Takoma continued to treat the imaginary guitarist as a real person, including booklets with their LPs containing biographical information about him and that he had taught Fahey to play. The conceit that the blues guitarist Blind Joe Death was an actual person and contemporary of Fahey is carried further with some tracks credited to being performed by Death and Fahey. There is debate that Fahey never actually appears on some of the tracks and that they are instead old, little-known recordings.The Fahey Files notes on the songs. Fahey has been quoted as saying \\"That whole record was a hoax. On all the songs that say it's me it isn't and vice versa.\\" Barry Hansen, a friend and collaborator of Fahey's albums told Rolling Stone reporter David Fricke that three of the tracks were old 78s that Fahey copied to tape and credited to Blind Joe Death. The first track \\"Bottleneck Blues\\" is a 1927 recording made by Sylvester Weaver and Walter Beasley. The tracks with fiddlers Hubert Thomas and Virgil Willis Johnston were made with Fahey during his 1966 trip to the South with Barry Hansen. The Voice of the Turtle was reissued on CD in 1996. It was reissued on vinyl on the Four Men With Beards label in 2012. Both reissues use the second track listing. Packaging The original LP release was a gatefold with the cover designed by Tom Weller. The original liner notes are extensive (the first sentence alone is 561 words long)Original liner notes. and were included in a 12-page booklet, including photos in an old-time scrapbook format. Later pressings did not include the gatefold and booklet. Voice of the Turtle has three quasi-subtitles on the cover. Directly underneath the main title is \\"Being a Musical Hodograph & Chronologue of the Music of John Fahey, including his most recent composition, The Story of Dorothy Gooch.\\" On the right side of the cover appears \\"The Volk Roots & Hiart Leaves of John Fahey, Blind Joe Death, Hubert Thomas, Virgil Willis Johnston, L. Mayne Smith, Mark Levine.\\" and directly below that \\"The Fahey Picture Album: Genuine photographs of Blind Joe Death, Knott's Berry Farm Molly, The Adelphi Rolling Grist Mill, Etc.\\" When the gatefold was no longer produced, the \\"Fahey Picture Album\\" was replaced with a picture of a turtle. The photograph labeled Blind Joe Death is actually a retouched old Vocalion Records advertisement of Blind Joe Taggart who recorded in the late 20s and 30s under several different names.Cochran, Robert. The Return of Blind Joe Death. Sep/Oct 1999. Gadfly online. Accessed May 14, 2009. The back cover quotes a \\"Song of Solomon\\" verse \\"... and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land.\\" After his death, the verse was printed in Fahey's funeral program. The original 1968 release is the only version that has the correct match of the songs on the label, the actual songs on the vinyl, and on the back cover. Reception Q Magazine stated in its December 1996 review: \\"Half of this 1968 album...is made up of pleasant, traditionally styled instrumentals... But it's the three lengthy improvisational pieces that dominate, pointing forward to his later, more elliptical work...\\" In a November 1996 review in Down Beat it was rated 4.5 Stars — Very Good/Excellent — \\"...has to be the strangest folk trip of the '60s... it's Fahey's loopy sound collages and odd sonic touches that make this largely instrumental album a treasure.\\" It received three-and-a-half stars in The New Rolling Stone Album Guide. In his Allmusic review, music critic Richie Unterberger called the album \\"One of his more obscure early efforts, Voice of the Turtle is both listenable and wildly eclectic, going from scratchy emulations of early blues 78s and country fiddle tunes to haunting guitar- flute combinations and eerie ragas.\\" and its \\"...undercurrent of dark, uneasy tension that gives much of Fahey's '60s material its intriguing combination of meditation and restlessness.\\" Track listing The credits given on the original album cover are shown in italics below.

He was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the sixth round of the 2007 NFL Draft. High school years O'Neal attended Stuttgart High School in Stuttgart, Arkansas and was considered a hard-working student. He was a letterman in track and field athletics and football, including a two- time All-Conference selection for football where his primary position was offensive lineman. College career O'Neal played collegiately at Arkansas State University for six years. After joining Arkansas State in 2001 as a walk-on, O'Neal was diagnosed with chylothorax and subsequently had part of his lung removed. He returned to the football team in 2002 and worked on getting stronger. Before the 2003 season, O'Neal earned a scholarship and was later granted a sixth year of eligibility by the NCAA. His story was told in 2006 by CBS Sportsline when he was chosen as \\"National Walk-on of the Year\\". In that article, he told of sleeping on friends' floors and doing anything else necessary to get by as a walk-on with very little money or resources. NFL career O'Neal was drafted by the Raiders in the sixth round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He was named the rookie of the year by then Raider's coach Lane Kiffin. He worked his way up the roster both on offense and special teams and played 14 games in 2007, recording one rushing attempt for one yard. O'Neal suffered a knee injury, which was initially thought to be possibly career-threatening, and was placed on injured reserve for the 2008 season on August 25. He was cut by the Raiders in April 2010.

Many children living in Palomas are U.S. citizens because the U.S. federal and New Mexico state policies allow women in Palomas to give birth in the nearest hospital, which is in Deming, on the U.S. side of the border. Being born in the United States automatically confers citizenship. Due to the school fees at the public schools in Palomas, the English-language education, and the higher quality facilities in the Deming Public Schools campuses, many parents resident in Palomas prefer to send their children to the schools in the United States.Layton, Lyndsey. \\"Children cross Mexican border to receive a U.S. education.\\" The Washington Post.

The tradition began when the principal of the elementary school in Columbus allowed children of one father living in Mexico to send his children to the school, and the school district began accepting students living in Mexico. At first, the district allowed non-U.S. citizens to attend. Around the 1970s Luna County began requiring U.S. citizenship in order for children to attend schools, but the district continued accepting children not living in Luna County.

Etymology The name is for the Dukes of Devonshire, holders of a peerage and members of a wealthy aristocratic family related to the Cavendishes. In areas where they held land, as at Chatsworth, Derbyshire and in Chiswick, there are often both Cavendish Arms and Devonshire Arms pubs and street names preserving the names of both families, while at Chatsworth the pub name \\"The Snake\\" refers to the family's coat of arms. The Snake Inn, a coaching inn on the old turnpike road on the Snake Pass in the Peak District of Derbyshire, similarly gets its name from the Devonshire emblem. Pubs London The Devonshire Arms in Kensington (37 Marloes Road) is a Victorian era pub built in 1865 with a traditional Beer garden. It housed local ARP wardens during The Blitz. The \\"Duke of Devonshire\\" in Balham High Road is a Victorian era corner pub with traditional pub glasswork from the late 1890s, included \\"an impressive, mirrored bar-back\\" with original counter and wooden panelling.

It was the first Goth subculture pub in Camden. It is the longest-surviving Goth pub in London and has been a focal point for the city's alternative scene for many years. During the 1980s, Spider Stacy and Shane MacGowan of The Pogues frequented the pub. The interior featured in \\"Goths\\", an episode from a 2003 BBC anthology series, Spine Chillers.

However unlike glycolysis the methylglyoxal pathway does not produce adenosine triphosphate, ATP. The pathway is named after the substrate methylglyoxal which has three carbons and two carbonyl groups located on the 1st carbon and one on the 2nd carbon. Methylglyoxal is, however, a reactive aldehyde that is very toxic to cells, it can inhibit growth in E. coli at milimolar concentrations. The excessive intake of glucose by a cell is the most important process for the activation of the methylglyoxal pathway. The Methylglyoxal pathway The methylglyoxal pathway, (Based on Weber Figure 4, pg. 711) The methylglyoxal pathway is activated by the increased intercellular uptake of carbon containing molecules such as glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, lactate, or glycerol. Methylglyoxal is formed from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) by the enzyme methylglyoxal synthase, giving off a phosphate group. Methylglyoxal is then converted into two different products, either D-lactate, and L-lactate. Methylglyoxal reductase and aldehyde dehydrogenase convert methylglyoxal into lactaldehyde and, eventually, L-lactate. If methylglyoxal enters the glyoxylase pathway, it is converted into lactoylguatathione and eventually D-lactate. Both D-lactate, and L-lactate are then converted into pyruvate. The pyruvate that is created most often goes on to enter the Krebs cycle (Weber 711-13). Enzymes and regulation The potentially hazardous effects of methylglyoxal require regulation of the reactions with this substrate. Synthesis of methylglyoxal is regulated by levels of DHAP and phosphate concentrations. High concentrations of DHAP encourage methylglyoxal synthase to produce methylglyoxal, while high phosphate concentrations inhibit the enzyme, and therefore the production of more methylglyoxal. The enzyme triose phosphate isomerase affects the levels of DHAP by converting glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) into DHAP. The usual pathway converting GAP to pyruvate starts with the enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Weber 711-13). Low phosphate levels inhibit GAP dehydrogenase; GAP is instead converted into DHAP by triosephosphate isomerase. Again, increased levels of DHAP activate methylglyoxal synthase and methylglyoxal production (Weber 711-13). The oscillation of Methylglyoxal concentration in feast concentrations Jan Weber, Anke Kayser, and Ursula Rinas, performed an experiment to test what happened to the methylglyoxal pathway when E. coli was in the presence of a constantly high concentration of glucose. The concentration of methylglyoxal increased until it reached 20 μmol. Methylglyoxal concentration then began to decrease, once it reached this level. The decrease in the concentration of methylglyoxal was connected to the drop in respiratory activity. When respiration activity increased the concentration of methylglyoxal increased again, until it reached the 20 μmol concentration (Weber 714-15). Why does the Methylglyoxal pathway exist? This pathway does not produce any ATP, this pathway does not replace glycolysis, it runs simultaneously to glycolysis and is only initiated with an increased concentration of sugar phosphates. One believed purpose of the methylglyoxal pathway is to help release the stress of elevated sugar phosphate concentration. Also when methylglyoxal is formed from DHAP, an inorganic phosphate is given off which can be used to replenish a low concentration of needed inorganic phosphate. The methylglyoxal pathway is a rather dangerous tactic, both because less energy is produced and a toxic compound, methylglyoxal is formed. (Weber 715).

Biography As an eleven-year-old Darnell achieved local fame as a gospel singer, and left home at 15 years of age to work as a dancer with a burlesque road show, the Brownskin Models. In New Orleans he gained steady employment as a singer at the Dew Drop Inn. In 1949, he was signed up by Fred Mendelsohn for the Regal label in New Jersey. His first two recordings, \\"I'll Get Along Somehow\\" and \\"For You My Love\\", both hit the R&B; charts in November 1949, with \\"For You My Love\\", written by Paul Gayten, staying at the # 1 spot for eight weeks. The follow-ups \\"I Love My Baby\\" and Louis Prima's \\"Oh Babe!\\" were also hits, and Darnell's powerful and passionate voice contributed to the development of a trend in popular music soon marketed nationwide as rock and roll. Darnell was the top selling R & B artist of 1950. However, after Regal collapsed in 1951, his records became less successful. By now known as \\"Mr. Heart & Soul\\", he appeared in the 1955 movie Harlem Rock & Roll Revue, and spent the rest of the decade recording for various labels. In 1969, he made his final recordings, for the Instant label in New Orleans. Receding from professional activity, he continued to sing in church and at charitable events. In April 1979, while en route to sing at a funeral in Akron, Ohio, he was mugged by a gang, and received severe injuries. The doctors operating on him to save his life discovered he had lung cancer, from which he died in 1983.

This reaction closes the ring and produces a 5-membered imidazole ring of the purine nucleus (AIR): 480px ATP + 2-(formamido)-N1-(5-phospho-β-D-ribosyl)acetamidine \\\\rightleftharpoons ADP + 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-β-D-ribosyl)imidazole + phosphate + AIR synthetase catalyzes the transfer of the oxygen of the formyl group to phosphate. It is a sequential mechanism in which ATP binds first to the enzyme and ADP is released last. This enzyme hydrolyzes ATP to activate the oxygen of the amide in order to carry out a nucleophilic attack by nitrogen. In humans and many other animals, this enzyme is contained within the trifunctional purine biosynthetic protein adenosine-3 polypeptide.  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-(formamido)-N1-(5-phosphoribosyl)acetamidine cyclo-ligase (ADP-forming). Other names in common use include: * AIR synthetase, * 5'-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase, * 2-(formamido)-1-N-(5-phosphoribosyl)acetamidine cyclo-ligase (ADP-forming), * phosphoribosylaminoimidazole synthetase, and * phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine cyclo-ligase.  Purine Synthesis  Purines are one of the two types of nitrogenous heterocyclic bases, which are one of the three components of the nucleotides that make up nucleic acids. Synthesis can be de novo or salvage - AIR synthetase is a component of the de novo pathway. The first committed step of the de novo pathway begins with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) and the end product is inosine monophosphate (IMP). IMP is eventually converted to either AMP or GMP purines. The purine ring structure is composed by the attachment of 1 or 2 atoms at a time to the ribose sugar. The de novo pathway tends to be conserved across most organisms.  Cowpea AIR synthetase  AIR synthetase is found in both mitochondria and plastids; the mitochondrial form has 5 more amino acids than the plastid form. The enzyme is encoded by a single gene in cowpeas despite the fact that it exists in different forms in plastids and mitochondria. This suggests that the different versions may be derived from a single transcript. One study proposes that there is tight transcriptional control of pur5, the gene encoding AIR synthetase.

Hal Moore, a United States Army officer. Her efforts and complaints in the aftermath of the Battle of Ia Drang prompted the U.S. Army to set up survivor support networks and casualty notification teams consisting of uniformed officers, which are still in use. Early life and education Compton was born in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, the only child of U.S. Army Colonel Louis J. Compton and Elizabeth Boon Compton. From the age of 12, she began a lifelong journey of experiencing the separation and risk of loss in war. Her father fought in Europe in World War II, her husband served in both the Korean War and Vietnam War, and one of her sons fought with the 82nd Airborne Division in Panama and the Persian Gulf War. Compton was a graduate of Chevy Chase Junior College, Chevy Chase, Maryland and attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, as a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority, prior to her marriage. Career Wherever her husband was stationed, Moore served as a Brownie and Girl Scout Leader and Cub Scout Den Mother. She volunteered with the Red Cross in the Army hospitals. She supported the day care centers and worked with the wives clubs to take better care of the enlisted soldier and his family. Moore was especially active in setting up the Army Community Service organizations that are now a permanent fixture on all army posts and which assist each soldier as they process into their new duty stations. Casualty notification The Ia Drang Campaign was the first major ground engagement involving U.S. forces in Vietnam. The Army had not yet set up an adequate system of notifying the next of kin of battlefield fatalities. Instead, the telegrams were given to taxicab drivers for delivery, as depicted in the film We Were Soldiers. Unlike the film depiction, Moore did not actually assume responsibility for the delivery of the telegrams, however, she accompanied the cab drivers who delivered the telegrams and assisted in the death notifications, grieving with the widows and families of men killed in battle, and attended the funerals of those who fell under her husband's command. Her complaints to the Pentagon, and the example that she set, prompted the Army to immediately set up notification teams consisting of a uniformed officer and a chaplain.Courtesy link to full text at Military.com Death Moore died on April 18, 2004 and is buried at the Fort Benning Cemetery, near her mother and father, and in the middle of the 7th Cavalry troopers.

It was originally described by C. G. Broyden in 1965. Newton's method for solving uses the Jacobian matrix, , at every iteration. However, computing this Jacobian is a difficult and expensive operation. The idea behind Broyden's method is to compute the whole Jacobian only at the first iteration and to do rank-one updates at other iterations. In 1979 Gay proved that when Broyden's method is applied to a linear system of size , it terminates in steps, although like all quasi-Newton methods, it may not converge for nonlinear systems.  Description of the method   Solving single-variable equation  In the secant method, we replace the first derivative at with the finite-difference approximation: :f'(x_n) \\\\simeq \\\\frac{f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1})}{x_n - x_{n - 1}}, and proceed similar to Newton's method: :x_{n + 1} = x_n - \\\\frac{f(x_n)}{f^\\\\prime(x_n)} where is the iteration index.  Solving a system of nonlinear equations  Consider a system of nonlinear equations :\\\\mathbf f(\\\\mathbf x) = \\\\mathbf 0 , where is a vector- valued function of vector : :\\\\mathbf x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \\\\dotsc, x_k), :\\\\mathbf f(\\\\mathbf x) = \\\\big(f_1(x_1, x_2, \\\\dotsc, x_k), f_2(x_1, x_2, \\\\dotsc, x_k), \\\\dotsc, f_k(x_1, x_2, \\\\dotsc, x_k)\\\\big). For such problems, Broyden gives a generalization of the one-dimensional Newton's method, replacing the derivative with the Jacobian . The Jacobian matrix is determined iteratively, based on the secant equation in the finite-difference approximation: :\\\\mathbf J_n (\\\\mathbf x_n - \\\\mathbf x_{n - 1}) \\\\simeq \\\\mathbf f(\\\\mathbf x_n) - \\\\mathbf f(\\\\mathbf x_{n - 1}), where is the iteration index. For clarity, let us define: :\\\\mathbf f_n = \\\\mathbf f(\\\\mathbf x_n), :\\\\Delta \\\\mathbf x_n = \\\\mathbf x_n - \\\\mathbf x_{n - 1}, :\\\\Delta \\\\mathbf f_n = \\\\mathbf f_n - \\\\mathbf f_{n - 1}, so the above may be rewritten as :\\\\mathbf J_n \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf x_n \\\\simeq \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf f_n. The above equation is underdetermined when is greater than one. Broyden suggests using the current estimate of the Jacobian matrix and improving upon it by taking the solution to the secant equation that is a minimal modification to : :\\\\mathbf J_n = \\\\mathbf J_{n - 1} + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\mathbf f_n - \\\\mathbf J_{n - 1} \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf x_n}{\\\\\\\\Delta \\\\mathbf x_n\\\\^2} \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf x_n^{\\\\mathrm T}. This minimizes the following Frobenius norm: :\\\\\\\\mathbf J_n - \\\\mathbf J_{n - 1}\\\\_{\\\\rm F} . We may then proceed in the Newton direction: :\\\\mathbf x_{n + 1} = \\\\mathbf x_n - \\\\mathbf J_n^{-1} \\\\mathbf f(\\\\mathbf x_n) . Broyden also suggested using the Sherman–Morrison formula to update directly the inverse of the Jacobian matrix: :\\\\mathbf J_n^{-1} = \\\\mathbf J_{n - 1}^{-1} + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\mathbf x_n - \\\\mathbf J^{-1}_{n - 1} \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf f_n}{\\\\Delta \\\\mathbf x_n^{\\\\mathrm T} \\\\mathbf J^{-1}_{n - 1} \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf f_n} \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf x_n^{\\\\mathrm T} \\\\mathbf J^{-1}_{n - 1}. This first method is commonly known as the \\"good Broyden's method\\". A similar technique can be derived by using a slightly different modification to . This yields a second method, the so-called \\"bad Broyden's method\\" (but see): :\\\\mathbf J_n^{-1} = \\\\mathbf J_{n - 1}^{-1} + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\mathbf x_n - \\\\mathbf J^{-1}_{n - 1} \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf f_n}{\\\\\\\\Delta \\\\mathbf f_n\\\\^2} \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf f_n^{\\\\mathrm T}. This minimizes a different Frobenius norm: :\\\\\\\\mathbf J_n^{-1} - \\\\mathbf J_{n - 1}^{-1}\\\\_{\\\\rm F}. Many other quasi-Newton schemes have been suggested in optimization, where one seeks a maximum or minimum by finding the root of the first derivative (gradient in multiple dimensions). The Jacobian of the gradient is called Hessian and is symmetric, adding further constraints to its update.  Other members of the Broyden class  Broyden has defined not only two methods, but a whole class of methods. Other members of this class have been added by other authors. * The Davidon–Fletcher–Powell update is the only member of this class being published before the two members defined by Broyden. * Schubert's or sparse Broyden algorithm – a modification for sparse Jacobian matrices. * Klement (2014) – uses fewer iterations to solve many equation systems.

M6P is converted to fructose 6-phosphate by mannose phosphate isomerase. M6P is a key targeting signal for acid hydrolase precursor proteins that are destined for transport to lysosomes. The M6P tag is added to such proteins in the cis-Golgi apparatus. Specifically, in a reaction involving uridine diphosphate (UDP) and N-acetylglucosamine, the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase catalyzes the N-linked glycosylation of asparagine residues with M6P. Once appropriately marked with the M6P targeting signal, these proteins are moved to the trans-Golgi network. There, the M6P moiety is recognized and bound by mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR) proteins at pH 6.5–6.7. The M6P-tagged lysosomal enzymes are shipped to the late endosomes via vesicular transport. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for several lysosomal storage diseases relies on this pathway to efficiently direct synthetic enzymes to the lysosome where each can metabolize its particular substrate. The pH in the late endosome can reach 6.0, which causes dissociation of M6P from its receptor. Upon release, the enzymes are ferried to their final destination in the lysosomes. The MPRs are packed into vesicles that bud off the late endosome and return to the trans-Golgi network. In this way, the MPRs can be recycled.

The episode was written by Dailyn Rodriguez and directed by Jeff Melman. Plot As Grace and Daniel finish having sex in bed while Daniel feels a very hot orgasm before starting the day, he tells her where she has been all his life as Grace has a very sexy body as from her nerdy appearance during college and she likes to have sex three times a night. Daniel then panics when she informs him that she needs to speak with his mother, but tells her that Claire has gone away and that she probably won’t be able to find her, so Daniel sends Claire off to a hotel to stay low and instructs her not to talk to anyone. Daniel later tells Betty that she can’t let anyone know that he is sleeping with Grace, including Alexis. So Betty swears to keep the secret and heads downstairs to see Christina, only to learn that Christina knows about Daniel and Grace as she sees through Betty's secret. Henry stops in and gives Betty the invitation to Charlie’s birthday party. Christina is surprised to hear that she is going, but Betty informs her that she does not want to lose Henry as a friend. Christina insists that Betty will need a date for the evening, so they ponder the thought and Betty calls her orthodontist for an appointment and informs him that a wire has snapped on her braces, so he schedules her for one. As she hangs up the phone Betty turns to Christina with a big smile, and in turn Christina snaps a wire. Later in the day Betty arrives for her appointment and tells her that it happened while eating a bagel. After he fixes the problem and she promises to be more careful, Betty responds that he may have to have dinner with her to ensure that she doesn’t eat anything too dangerous. Her plan works and he accepts her proposal. Over at Casa Suarez, Constance visits Ignacio and continues to pour on the charm by wrestling him down and steals a kiss. As Hilda and Justin walk in the front door they are shocked to find Ignacio hiding in the dark from his case worker. He tells them that he doesn’t know what to do about her. Justin tells them that Constance gave him $1 the other day to call her grandma. Despite all this Ignacio insists that he has to keep her happy until the court date. Later on in the day Hilda gives Constance a new hairdo, only to freak out when Hilda tells her that Ignacio is a ladies' man. Constance tells Hilda that he should have told her if he was seeing someone, but tells Hilda that she is okay with it. Back at MODE, Amanda tells Marc that she met designer Oswald Lorenzo the other night at a party and tells him the story of how she fought another girl for his affections at the social. Amanda opens a packaged delivery and finds a dress that Lorenzo has sent to her and is thrilled to find out that he has named the dress \\"The Amanda\\". Amanda grabs the tiny silver hobble dress and runs to change into it and it fits as tight as a mermaid outfit. As Amanda struggles to move around she refuses to take it off. Alexis goes to see Wilhelmina and tells her that she has to at least give Daniel a chance since he was willing to turn his back on their father, only to learn that Alexis is upset and leaves when she sees the news coverage of Grace Chin defending her father. This prompts Alexis to interrupt the board meeting and yells to Daniel about Grace's track record and to point out that their father is a murderer and still blames him for causing turmoil in the Meade family. As Marc listens from around the corner, Daniel tells his sister that he doesn’t know anything about hiring Grace. Amanda rushes over to get the scoop and falls flat on her face because the dress is way too tight. Later that evening, Betty and Gabe (her orthodontist) arrive at the party, surprising even Henry. Charlie tells Betty that Gabe is so cute and she can sense the chemistry between them. The four of them head over to the bar and manage to make small talk, followed by a slow song as they pair off and dance. But the evening is interrupted when Claire calls Betty and tells her that it's an emergency and she needs a corporate credit card fast. As Betty arrives at Claire’s hotel room and finds her packing her bags, she tells Betty that she has to disappear, but Betty insists that she call Daniel first, prompting Claire to throw her cell phone across the room and destroying it. Betty tells Claire that she doesn’t have the credit card with her. Meanwhile, Gabe walks in and Claire wants to know what she is doing with him when it's Henry that she really likes. So Betty plays it off by kindly suggesting that it was a long time ago. As Marc and Wilhelmina plow through the closet looking for a specific dress, they learn from Christina that Daniel had it, so when Wilhelmina becomes suspicious and demanded to know what Daniel did with the dress, Christina refuses. But when Wilhelmina threatens to call Betty to tell her about the \\"evidence\\" she that got her into Fashion Week, Christina lashes out at her and tells her that she can’t keep treating her like this, but gives in and tells them that Daniel gave the dress to Grace. Both Wilhelmina and Marc are puzzled since Daniel has told everyone that he doesn’t even know Grace, so Wilhelmina quickly puts 2 and 2 together and orders Marc to follow Daniel everywhere he goes and to get proof of his affair with Grace. Daniel panics when Betty comes in and informs him that Grace is going to talk to Claire. Daniel locates them at a restaurant and tries to interrupt, but Grace insists that she be able to speak with Claire. Claire informs Grace that Fey was cruel and manipulative. Grace excuses herself to take a phone call. Daniel takes the time to ask her again to stay clear of Grace, but she insists that she knows what is best. Daniel steps out to the lobby of the restaurant and uses his charm on Grace. She tells him that he has six minutes and they rush inside the coat check room where no one is allowed in. Inside they quickly undress each other and start to have sex, unaware that someone was watching. It was Marc who took out his cell phone and started recording, he didn't like looking at it but managed to. Hours later Wilhelmina is thrilled to get the video that Marc has captured on his cell phone of Grace and Daniel having sex on a dirty floor, so she burns it on CD and delivers the proof to Alexis, who becomes furious. Wilhelmina tells her that she knows exactly how she feels because she has been betrayed by a so-called friend (Alexis). As Grace tells Daniel that she knows that Claire is the one that killed Fey and tells him that she is confident that she can help her mother out of the situation by getting her doctors to testify, Alexis walks in and scolds her brother for lying to her. As Alexis shows Daniel and Grace the footage, she tells them that she wants Grace to remove herself from the case or she will show it to the judge. Grace becomes furious and tells Daniel that he needs a shrink and tells Alexis that she needs a closer shave. When she leaves, Daniel tells Alexis that he can’t believe what she has done and shocks Alexis when he tells her that Claire killed Fey, and thanks to Alexis's interference and the CD, their mother will go to jail because of it. Across town, Betty takes Claire and Gabe to her house to get the credit card, even as she tries to convince Claire not to leave the country. But as Claire reminds Betty of how she killed Fey, Gabe takes this as a sign that he needs to leave, but Betty lies, saying it's a game. As Betty goes upstairs to get the card she leaves the two of them alone. Ignacio walks in and mistakes Gabe for Henry. Claire corrects him and tells him that she has seen the accountant and that he is much hotter. He once again screams to Betty that he really should go, but she yells back for her father to put on some coffee for them all. Ignacio takes Claire’s coat and asks her how she likes her coffee (\\"vodka and ice...hold the coffee.\\") She takes a seat on the couch and Constance spies through the window. Betty calls Daniel and prays that he will answer. A loud knock at the door suddenly comes as Ignacio is in the kitchen, and when Claire opens the door she finds Constance there accusing her of stealing her man and gets into a shoving match until Ignacio and Gabe come between them. Ignacio takes Constance to the kitchen and tells her that Claire is not his girlfriend, and neither is she. But as he turns to the sink, she slaps an electronic tracking device to his ankle and tells him that she will now know where he is at every minute of every day. When Betty rushes downstairs to see what is going on, Gabe tells her that she still has feelings for Henry and he leaves. Betty gives Claire the credit card so that she can leave the country, saying that she watched the man she loved love someone else and it killed her and makes her promise not to make the same mistake that she did. Betty sits with Claire on the couch and tells her that she needs to be strong right now and that running away isn’t the answer so Claire calls the police and turns herself in for murdering Fey. The cops swarm the house and take Claire into custody. Meanwhile, another package arrives for Amanda. She tells the delivery guy that she has rubber burns all over her body from that dress and that she doesn’t want anymore gifts, but gets excited though when he tells her that this time it's a hat. As she opens the box Amanda puts on the rubber cone shaped hat on her head, unaware that she is the target of a rival worker at MODE, who set Amanda up with help from the delivery guy, for she hated Amanda. Finally, Henry goes to see Betty in her office and tells her that he hated that she had to leave so soon last night, so he invites her to have lunch with Charlie and him, but Betty tells him that it is not good for her to hang out with the two of them and she just can’t do that right now. She informs him that right now they can only be two people that happen to work in the same building. As Henry gives her a slice of birthday cake and leaves, Betty instantly threw it away without him noticing. Production Viewers hear Amanda's last name during this episode. Though it sounded like 'Tanner' it was shown to be 'Tanen' in the 21st episode Secretaries' Day, where a screen shot of Amanda's acting reel shows her name to be spelled 'Tanen'. The silver latex \\"Amanda Dress\\" was custom made by Syren.com in Los Angeles. Also in a deleted scene that is featured on the DVD, it would be Betty who would tease Amanda while she was wearing that dress. The Wizard of Oz is referenced yet again when Wilhelmina tells Marc to \\"fly my pretty!\\" The first time was in \\"I'm Coming Out\\" when she told Fabia that she would \\"get her...and her little dog too\\" and again when Christina said she was \\"not one of [Wilhelmina's] flying monkeys\\" When Claire checked in the Grand Regent Hotel, she went under the pseudonym \\"Brandy Schlooe\\" so she can keep a low profile. Brandy Schlooe was also the name of JoBeth Williams's character on \\"Guiding Light\\" from 1976 to 1977. Casting This is the last episode in which lawyer Grace Chin (Lucy Liu) appears. Also, Alan Dale, although credited, was absent from this episode. Awards Jesse Tyler Ferguson submitted this episode for consideration of his work in the category of \\"Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series\\" for the 2007 Emmy Awards. Music notes The song played during the slow dance of Charlie's party is \\"You Give Me Something\\" by James Morrison. Reception The episode is considered the weakest of the series. In a review of the episode, Entertainment Weekly's Tanner Stransky notes, \\"You'd think an episode titled Icing on the Cake would be sweet and totally Betty-licious. Coated in wonderful Betty one-liners. Whipped up with delicate Betty care. And smoothed over with a perfect Betty glaze. Just the way fans ordered it. But that's not how our dessert was served up tonight. There was something actually ugly — okay, maybe just unattractive — about this episode of Betty, don't you think, TV Watchers?\\"From EW.com Ratings The episode was only seen by 10.63 million viewers in the United States, down slightly from the previous episode.

It premiered on March 25, 2005. It aired on YTV. 26 episodes were produced. Characters *Brady Plunkett is a monster-loving 12-year-old. He first discovered his \\"passion\\" when his sister Arlene told him there was a monster outside the window, and it turned out there was. He fed it, one thing led to another and the monster disappeared into Brady's closet, where he now lives that is until the first episode in which Brady is forced to chase him away for his own safety.

He has been terrified of monsters since he was a child (though shown to be good friends with the Minotar and tried the mummy as a pet once) and has not been seen to be very smart. *Ember Tombs is 13 years old, and another friend of Brady's. She can be seen as creepy and obsessed with death. She sleeps with a voodoo doll. Voiced by Candida Gubbins. *Arlene Plunkett is Brady's 17-year-old sister she originally got Brady interested in monsters when he was four. Brady often comes to Arlene for advice not knowing about the ways of the manipulative older sister only to be taken advantage of repeatedly. Strangely, she seems to be able to be hypnotised by her cell phone's ring tone. *Maxwell Plunkett is Brady's miserable father. He has a long-running reputation as the cheapest man in Ravenville. He's highly anti- monster, seeing them as only another mouth to feed and often leads violent mobs in pursuit of monsters. He will not let a monster into his house unless he can profit from them. For instance, he gets free medical services from Dr. Jekyell. Voiced by Matt Devereaux.http://www.mattdevereaux.co.uk/television/ *Pollyanna Plunkett is Brady's kind, sweet and gentle mother who is also highly accepting of monsters, seeing them less of a menace and more \\"cute\\" leading to her constantly getting taken advantage of. She is virtually fright- proof. Like her son Brady, she has a strong friendship with the Missing link. *Mr. Mayor is an uptight, selfish and manipulative old tyrant that runs Ravenville. He would like nothing better than to ship the monsters off to the arctic, though he has a monster under his own roof--namely the Sea Serpent. Despite his unrivaled hatred of Brady, he is constantly calling him to help as Brady is the best available monster expert. *Igor is the man behind the monster shop and is quick to con whomever he meets into buying any monster he wants. He is shown to be a good person helping Brady with whatever hair- brained monster stunt he comes up with although still cons him into using low quality monsters and equipment. *Marvin and Gaye Plunkett/the twins Little is ever given about these two. They seem to communicate telepathically and only with one another and love pulling pranks on monsters like Maxwell loves money. Monsters *Stitch is a Frankenstein monster. According to Brady, he was \\"sewn together in a dark dank castle during a lightning storm\\" and is made of a wide array of parts taken from a wide amount of \\"donors\\". He is shown to live at the dump and has a split personality disorder and is one of the most commonly occurring monsters in the series. He wanders around Ravenville freely and provides the muscle of many of Brady's missions. In \\"How to Remind Your Monster Who He Is\\" the twins remove a bolt from Stitch as a practical joke resulting in him sorting through his own memories trying to find which monster he is. This results in his dressing up and acting like many of the destructive monsters he has seen. *Vlad is a vampire count from Transylvania of royal heritage who expects to be treated as such. He lives in a tree house in the forest and is trying to kick the habit of \\"sucking\\". He is shown to still drink blood on occasion though goes out on a limb to kick the habit by such things as donating blood to the local blood bank. He is one of the most frequently occurring monsters in the series, freely wandering around Ravenville. He once ran for mayor but lost on purpose as it was all just a ruse to get the mayor to make Ravenville more monster-friendly and is married to a Sapphire. *The Mummy is a mummy straight from Egypt and lives in the museum vault in his sarcophagus. He was once the pet of Virgil as he tried to use him to impress a girl until he found out that she hates monsters in which he quickly conned the curator into taking him back he is a commonly occurring monster in the series freely walking around Ravenville to collect treasures for his tomb in the museum. *The Werewolf is a lazy slacker who sells ice cream to children during the day and grows hair, chase cats and howl at the full moon during the night. He is shown to have a girlfriend namely a librarian werewolf and was first introduced in \\"How to Use Your Monster for Home Protection\\" in which Maxwell hired him as body guard for his valuables he is a commonly occurring monster freely walking around Ravenville strangely he's often seen in his werewolf form during the day. *Brady's Monster – no actual name is ever given for this bizarre creature nor is it revealed what its species is. All that is ever revealed are a few facts about it slowly given throughout the series. It is shown that this creature is female (or possibly asexual) due to it giving birth yet strangely joined the ranks of monsters who are crushing on the newly tamed Howler. It is shown to have a bizarre craving for pumpkins and rotting meat as being among the things Brady uses to lure her back to his house third during its time with Brady she had a prized squeaky toy fourth she seems to like dank dark places as for a short time she hid in the Sewers Fifth she is shown to be a rare high quality specimen worth a lot of money in \\"how to find your missing monster\\" Brady inadvertently chased her away when she went to turn herself in after finding one of Brady's lost posters only to be told to go away by an angry Plunket family after a large amount people went to claim a sabotage lost ad this may be the reason why she repeatedly runs away from Brady though is shown to still trust him as she gave him her baby to look after. *The Hatchling sent Brady and friends on a wild trip across town after it hatched and is the baby of Brady's monster. The young creature provides a little insight as to what its mother looks like under its hood, a large beak mounted on a face with oversized eyes. *Sparker can be best described as a living lightning bolt that was first seen in \\"how to unplug a Sparker\\" when the Plunket family rented it to power their house and eventually through one of the pranks by the twins via kite in a lightning storm the second time it came out as a hero when it plugged itself into a monster computer virus and in the process saved the town when it shorted out the Virus. *Swamp Thing is a creature that lives in the Swamp of Ravenville though was once a pet to a young boy named Stanley Crum the Swamp Thing has three metamorphic stages: first a tadpole, second a frog like creature, and third a humanoid creature that walks on two legs apparently Swamp Things all have a soulmate with another Swamp Thing and was used to lure it back to the swamp via love song. *Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde is a monster that was once employed by Maxwell Plunket as a free doctor though it turned out that his free medical help was only a rouse to slowly turn Brady's family (excluding Brady and the Twins the latter was employed to him and the first suspicious of how no matter how much \\"medicine\\" was given to his family they just got worst and worst) into mutant monsters to be sold to Igor until he found out and got the twins to save the day by concocting an antidote it is unknown what exactly was the fate of the monster at the end of the episode though it's implied Brady imprisoned it in Igor's basement it was shown that the Arps (Virgils family) also fell victim to this con artist as they too were rescued by the Twins. *Big Foot is a large hairy creature shown to have a crush on Arlene that was found in the Vomit Falls forest, Brady made a deal with a local man who had captured Brady's monster and was willing to trade for another. However the deal was that if Brady could deliver a monster just as dangerous as his monster to a man in Vomit Falls then the man would give Brady back his monster unfortunately the deal went south when the man saw that Big Foot was in love with Arlene and Brady's monster ran away yet again, leaving the man with an angry bigfoot. This is not the first bigfoot to be encountered; two more were seen at the end of \\"how to get rid of an undesirable monster\\" one was a baby and new pet to Stanly Crum the other the earliers mother who beat up the sheriff. *Monster Mold is a giant creature that was once many smaller creatures that looked the same Brady along with just about every other kid in Ravenville made the smaller versions during Brady's web cast on his website Arlene and Maxwell mistaken Brady's mold as lime gelatin (causing the latter to have a major stomach ache) and Arlene took it to school as her cooking project after being refrigerated overnight and the kids mistaking this as instructions did the same this seemed to have caused all the blobs to form together to make a giant blob monster that swallowed up Arlene's teacher, Virgil and Mr. Mayor before swallowing every inflatable object Brady Virgil and Arlene could find then stuck a leaf blower into its side and inflated it and blew it up over the water leaving Virgil and Brady to clean up the mess made in the process and Arlene with a failing grade because her teacher had never been eaten by her meal before. *Sea Serpent is a large green snake like creature that Grows when on dry land and shrinks in water Brady intended to capture the serpent as gift from him and Mr. Mayor to Mr. Mayor's son for his birthday. Originally Brady intended to lure the creature to the beach using a serpent love call then Virgil lured it to Mr. Mayors house using a Sea Serpent costume. Unfortunately the twins sabotaged the whistles into a sea serpent battle cry which made the serpent destroy the beach before chasing a terrified Virgil in a serpent costume to a football field where Brady soaked it using the sprinklers to trap it and release it into Mr. Mayor's house. A reporter at the scene commented, \\" getting his son a monster is one promise this mayor is going to keep\\". *Banshee is a monster that was buried under the Plunket house and was put there by a man with the last name Plunket. This caused the Banshee to cast a spell on Brady's family to humiliate themselves via bad rapping and reversing their personality. The spell was lifted after Brady explained the mix up in which the man who buried her wisely changed his last name to protect his family. *Wigs/Wiggario is a Yeti that sneaked into Brady's house, lured by the garbage Brady had in his closet since yeti's eat garbage. Brady named him Wigs because he resembled a blob of hair. Like all yeti's he also has a mortal enemy and snuck into the house to hide from him. After Arlene found out she blackmailed Brady into finding her a gorgeous date (threatening to tell Maxwell about Wigs and thus Brady would lose his computer) Brady then shaves Wigs and dresses him in one of Virgil's father's suits, transforming Wigs into Virgil's cousin Wiggario unfortunately Wigs' mortal enemy found him at Arlene's school where Wigs showed some backbone and clobbered him before taking a garbage coated Arlene to the dump for a date. *Dylan is a Virtech who Brady and Virgil were hired to look after while his owner, Vanessa, was out of town. Virgil accidentally exposed Dylan to the artificial light of a refrigerator which caused him to mutate and multiply into terrifying and vicious monsters that destroyed Vanessa's house. Ember managed to come to the rescue by bringing Brady's Devilbeez (an electronic cross bow of some sort) which reverted the Virtechs back into one Dylan. Unfortunately due to the damage caused by Dylan's clones he had to reimburse Vanessa. *Zombie was found in the cemetery where he just realized he was dead leaving a mystery since zombification is reserved only for criminals who have yet to pay for their crimes. Brady brought him home where he was employed by Maxwell as a free housekeeper. While he was alive the Zombie founded and ran an orphanage where a large amount of money went missing, apparently stolen by the janitor. Money begins disappearing around Brady's house as well it was revealed that the Zombie was responsible for the stolen money on both accounts. He then set things straight by returning all the stolen money it is unknown whether or not he was allowed to rest in peace. *Punks/King Punk are a mutant strand of flying pumpkins purchased by Ember for Halloween (though it was unknown to her that they were mutants) from a company called Fear Factory who are known to make first rate terrors. They started terrorizing the Trick or Treaters of Ravenville to gather fear to spread all over the world that was being stored inside the King Punk. As predicted by Brady they deflate if someone laughs or stands up against them and Brady's monster manage to not only stand up to King Punk but eat it. *Mr. Bones is a Skeleton that's all that remains of Ravenville's old dog catcher Mr. Bones. It broke his heart to see strays on the streets but after he caught the strays he abducted them right from their homes and made a giant cage out of every skeleton he could get his bony hands on including himself. After all the pets were returned to their owners Mr Bones was given Virgil's hamster and left Virgil to clean up his mess. *Minotaur prefers to live in the sewers of Ravenville despite his one time fears of water, heights, clostrophobia, and darkness, Strangely all fears Virgil shares. He pops up whenever Brady's adventures lead him into the sewers and due to Virgil helping overcome his fears, and being the only monster that doesn't want to eat him, they became close friends. *Gargoyle is a monster that was attracted to Ravenville by the lead pipes. Gargoyle began tearing the lead off them and using it to cover himself during the day due to being highly photosensitive. This caused a wide array of plumbing problems in Ravenville. After experiencing a wild bucking bronco ride on the back of the Gargoyle Brady tricked it into covering itself with tin foil instead of lead, causing the skin to be highly irritated. The Gargoyle left to find better lead which unfortunately became the dam upriver of Ravenville which flooded Ravenville one final time. *Nightmares are a type of monster that lives under the beds of Ravenville citizens causing nightmares during the night. They gave people terrifying nightmares and came out at night to eat the wood that makes up the foundation of most of Ravenville before Brady Ember and Virgil sucked them up and gave them back to the construction company that planted them in Ravenville. *Hemlock is a bat-like monster that was passing through Ravenville on its migration to the arctic to sleep for spring. It decided to make a snack of Ravenville citizens for the long migration by using its loud scream to literally scare Ravenville stiff. Brady lured the Hemlock to the ice rink where it went to sleep. It was then shipped to the arctic along with the ice from the rink and Ravenville citizens were thawed in the now swimming pool that was the ice rink. *Wraith is an evil shadow demon that came to Ravenville to steal its citizens shadows. It transformed Ravenville's citizens into its zombified slaves in the process. It has a weakness to light and became Vlad's shadow to avoid the upcoming sunlight returning Ravenville its shadows in the process. *Loch Ness monster came to Ravenville from Loch Ness for an unknown reason. It is made of pure water which is the reason no one has ever captured her. After luring it to the swamp it was trapped in everything in Ravenville that is meant to contain water; then Brady made it become Ravenville's best firefighter. *Springgan is a monster that hates humans because he believes they hate monsters. He came to Ravenville giving every citizen a medallion that turned them into monsters. After some persuasion from the actual monsters the Springgan learned that people in Ravenville actually like monsters and agreed to turned everyone back to normal in exchange for staying in town. Prior Springan pranks includes the destruction of a bridge and all the animals from a zoo being released. *Dragon was a monster that was released when a bolt of lightning released it from its captivity resulting in it going on a rampage thinking everyone wanted to steal its treasure the very same treasure Brady used to lure it to another tree which he opened up and trapped the Dragon inside. Note this is not the first Dragon to appear as one was used by Ember to chase the Ringmaster after he kidnapped one of her monsters in \\"How to Collect Monsters\\". *Quicksand monsters are a pair of monsters used by Chester Pester to steal all the monsters in Ravenville. They are living blobs of quicksand that work in pairs. Whatever goes in one comes out the other and vice versa. Later all the monsters and Chester were brought to Ravenville to torture Chester. *Berserker is a chaotic klutz. The Berserkers touch destroys everything and this one touches everything. He came to Ravenville looking for Brady, following the advice of a Stinker buddy and resides at the Ravenville pool since water is the only thing that can not be destroyed by the Berserker. *Borris is the Plunkets' pet dog that was turned into first a two-headed monster, then a high-flying demon by the twins before being turned back to normal by the twins. He also helped catch the Pooka since dogs are the only thing that can see Pookas with the naked eye. *Missing link is a monster that came to Ravenville looking for some friends to hang out with. Brady's mother was kidnapped by the link who stayed over by will and even introduced her to some female friends. *Howler is a monster that sneaked into the basement of Julie from the woods. After a failed attempt to catch the monster she went on a rampage beating up everyone who made noise including Vlad, who if he \\"wasn't already a goner he would have just died of embarrassment\\". Using its hatred for noise, Brady decided to drive the monster back into the forest by assigning everyone in town a noisemaker. This was also a failed attempt. Virgil discovers the hard way that despite the Howler's hatred of noise, she loves music. By giving her Virgil's walkman she became calm enough to keep in town \\"as long as she had a lifetime of batteries for that thing\\". She became irresistible to every monster in town after that including, for some bizarre reason, Brady's monster. *Weeper/Jenny is a monster that drinks tears. She attacked everyone she could and became Jenny during the day. She stayed with Ember until Ember found out about what she was doing. Luckily they came to an understanding. By playing a practical joke on Virgil (which inadvertently caused him streak across town) they even agreed that tears of laughter tasted better. *Wishing Un-well is a monster that bears a strong resemblance to a well. Whenever someone makes a wish it twists it into the exact opposite. For example, Ember and Virgil both wished for a new bike, then later they crashed into one another, landing on the other's bike and both bikes became junk. Once they finally caught up to it Brady he wished that it would stop granting wishes so because it had to grant the opposite it had to grant what people actually wished for luckily a troll carried it off into the woods preventing it from creating further chaos. *Medusa is a person who was cursed 2,000 years ago so that anyone who met her gaze would be turned to stone including herself. After she met her own gaze in the reflection of Perseus's shield, the Ravenville art museum bought the statue of Medusa and as the curator was setting up her display Medusa met her own frozen gaze in a mirror and was released. After going on a short rampage she was lured into a mirror shop where she met her own gaze again freeing everyone who was turned to stone. Then she met her gaze again and was released trapping Virgil. Then Brady gave her his ultraviolet sunglasses which released Virgil and because, according to Brady, she was a nice person before the curse turned her into a monster, she became a peaceful member of the monster community and became part of Virgil's neighborhood. *Attractor is a monster robot that is held together by magnets. It lives near the power plant so that it can recharge its magnets every week. Unfortunately Virgil accidentally unplugged a cable that Attractor stepped on, reversing his polarity. So instead of being held together he was blown apart, and since they couldn't reattach to each other they tried to attach themselves to whatever, and whoever they could find, including at several points Virgil. Luckily, thanks to Brady's poor electrician of a dad they were able to put Attractor back together again and he certainly would not be returning to the power plant anytime soon due to his magnets being over charged. He seemed to have been aware of the fact that Virgil caused his malfunction. *Court Jester ghost a ghost from a haunted horror book he made a nuisance of himself by bringing the contents of any book he could find to life until Brady convinced it to reside in a history book where it could relive as many different stories as possible. It trapped Virgil in its book to make him take his place. *Stinker is a monster with extremely low self-esteem and high intelligence with a stink so powerful it melts whole cars in seconds. Ember and Virgil put it through bath after bath until Brady arrived from an out of town shopping trip with the answer: the Stinker's stink was internal and emotional. Brady cured this by curing his self-esteem and he came out smelling like roses. *Pigment is a ghost of clown that was haunting a picture. It requires color to become real and sucked up every drop it could find with chaotic results. When Brady turned the water fountain into a paint fountain the Pigment absorbed all the color, then blew up. The clown's painting was sold to the local art museum where, according to Brady, \\"there's enough wasted paint in there to last a lifetime\\" which actually made the paintings look better. *Wilding is a bizarre plant monster that came to Ravenville to transform it into the botanical forest it once was. Brady manage to trap it in a scale model of Ravenville and cut off all other sources of water in Ravenville giving it exactly what it wanted a forest version of Ravenville. *Sapphire/Velma is a monster that came to Ravenville to meet her on-line date Vlad. Little did she know he is a Vampire. Where she is a Sapphire—a vampire that is immune to daylight but allergic to moonlight. Due to the confusion she went to the meeting place at the incorrect time and went on a rampage looking for Vlad before rousting in Virgil's closet. *Pooka is an invisible monster that came to Ravenville to create hatred and chaos that it feeds off of by stealing everything he could get his hands on then framing everyone in sight. Borris could see him and helped Brady catch the Pooka and made him return all the items he stole. He then paired him with the grouchy Minotaur since his bad personality makes him the perfect match for the Pooka. *Meanie is a reversed version of a genie that was found in the wall of the Plunket house during some destructive renovations, but instead of taking orders, he gives them. Meanie casts a spell on the Plunket house that when Maxwell gives him the key to the house, they will switch places. The Plunkets will move into the lamp and Meanie would go into the house and freeing it. Brady manages to avoid this by tricking Meanie into its lamp and then throwing it out the window, thus breaking the spell. *Monster Virus is a computer virus that Virgil downloaded onto Brady's computer, who then took over it, the house and pretty much all of Ravenvile using the power cables and phone lines. After that, it proceeded to enslave Ravenville by taking control of every machine it could find thanks to the cooperation of the town's monsters, including the Sparker, it was shorted out. *Goblin is a monster so scary, it even scares all the other monsters away. Because of this he believes that other monsters hate him so he kept scaring monsters away from Ravenville. Brady lured the monster to the monster shop where it was thrown a monster party and learned that looks are not everything. This is not the first goblin to appear another was seen in the episode \\"how to use your monster for home protection\\" beating up a criminal that tried to rob the house he was living in.

Born in Ashland, Kansas, Santee was nicknamed the \\"Ashland Antelope.\\" Santee attended high school in Ashland, where he set a state record in the mile run. He later attended the University of Kansas where he set records in cross country and the mile and two-mile events. He was the Individual NCAA Cross Country Champion in 1953, while leading his team to the overall championship. Santee competed in the 5,000 meters in the 1952 Summer Olympics at Helsinki, Finland, but did not win a medal. Three years later, Santee won the silver medal in the 1,500 meters at the 1955 Pan American Games in Mexico City. During this period, Santee was one of the top milers in the world, aspiring to become the first man to run a four-minute mile. His chief competitors were Great Britain's Roger Bannister and Australia's John Landy. On May 6, 1954, Bannister became the first to break the barrier with a time of 3:59.4. Seven weeks later, Landy surpassed Bannister's mark. In June 1954, Santee set the a world 1500-meter record of 3:42.8 on his way to a crushing mile win over Olympic champion Josy Barthel, but after sprinting past Barthel he slowed slightly, finishing the mile at 4:00.7.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/wes-santee-us-runner-who- came-agonisingly-close-to-breaking-the-four-minute-mile- barrier-2166328.htmlhttp://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2010/11/15/wes_santee_78_track_great_nearly_broke_4_minute_mile/ In early 1955, Santee came close to a four-minute mile of his own, with a time of 4:00.5, but he would never surpass this time. Shortly afterwards, Santee was suspended by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) in a dispute over his amateur status. AAU rules at that time limited amateurs to $15 per diem expenses to cover food and lodging, and the costs of air travel. For three track meets over a nine-day period in May 1955, Santee had been paid $1,127.85 of expenses \\"The Santee Situation\\", in \\"Events and Discoveries\\", Sports Illustrated, November 14, 1955, p15; in current dollars, the amount would be more than $8,500 In 1956, Santee was permanently barred from amateur events, ending his chance to surpass Bannister and Landy and also costing him a place in the 1956 Summer Olympics at Melbourne, Australia. Santee had previously been banned from competing internationally because of early questions surrounding his status as an amateur. During his abbreviated career, Santee set world records in the 1,500 meter run, indoor 1,500 meter run and indoor mile. In 2005 he was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. Santee's track career, including his rivalry with Bannister and Landy and his troubles with the AAU, is chronicled in Neal Bascomb's 2004 book The Perfect Mile.

They are widely used in localization and navigation, especially in automotive applications. Moreover, they are playing an increasingly important role in the emerging areas of location-based services, active safety functions and advanced driver-assistance systems. Common to these functions is the requirement for an on-board map database that contains information describing the road network. When designed well, a map database enables the rapid indexing and lookup of a large amount of geographic data.  Content of a map database  Figure 1: Features and their respective attributes in a map database Maps are stored as graphs, or two dimensional arrays of objects with attributes of location and category, where some common categories include parks, roads, cities, and the like. A map database represents a road network along with associated features. Map providers can choose various models of a road network as a basis to formulate a database. Commonly, such a model comprises basic elements (nodes, links and areas) of the road network and properties of those elements (location coordinates, shape, addresses, road class, speed range, etc.). The basic elements are referred to as features and the properties as attributes. Other information associated with the road network is also included, including points of interest, building shapes, and political boundaries. This is shown schematically in the adjacent image. Geographic Data Files (GDF)ISO 14825, Intelligent transport systems - Geographic Data Files (GDF) - Overall data specification, first edition 2004, Switzerland, http://www.iso.org is a standardized description of such a model. Each node within a map graph represents a point location of the surface of the Earth and is represented by a pair of longitude (lon) and latitude (lat) coordinates. Each link represents a stretch of road between two nodes, and is represented by a line segment (corresponding to a straight section of road) or a curve having a shape that is generally described by intermediate points (called shape points) along the link. However, curves may also be represented by a combination of centroid (point or node), with a radius, and polar coordinates to define the boundaries of the curve. Shape points are represented by lon-lat coordinates as are nodes, but shape points do not serve the purpose of connecting links, as do nodes. Areas are two-dimensional shapes that represent things like parks, cities, blocks and are defined by their boundaries. These are usually formed by a closed polygon, which are shapes that indicated an object over a map has to have a close boundary, meaning the first polygon should be same as a last polygon. (For example, to plot a square object on a map, the polygons are 1,2,3,4,1.) Another point for validation on data is the point in polygon, which helps in finding points lying outside a polygon. E.g., for a particular lon-lat coordinates in a city, if the point is intersecting the polygon in an odd number, then it is inside the polygon and a valid point; otherwise it is outside the polygon and invalid.  Interchange format  Map providers generally collect, aggregate and supply data in a well-defined and documented file format that is specifically intended for information interchange, e.g. Navteq uses Standard Interchange Format (SIF)Standard Interchange Format (SIF), Navteq, Chicago, Ill, http://www.navteq.com/ and GDF, while Tele Atlas uses a proprietary form of GDF.GDF ASCII Sequential, Tele Atlas, It is usually in a plain-text form (ASCII) consisting of fields that are easily parsed and interpreted by the various parties who will handle it. The portable format allows additions, deletions and modifications to be readily performed by simple text-editing programs. A small number of record types are used to represent the various types of data. Each record type consists of a sequence of fields, which are either fixed length or delimited by a punctuation character such as a comma. For example, a link entity could be represented by a record of the form: type1,label,node1,z1,node2,z2,class,number of shape points,number of lanes,speed where type1 defines this as a link record type and label serves as an identifier to distinguish this link from all others. The z1 and z2 fields determine the vertical separation of this link from others sharing the corresponding nodes node1 and node2. Thus an overpass to a link, for example, can be represented as not connected to that link. Other record types are used to represent address information, shape-points for a link, cities and states, points of interest (POI's), etc. The interchange format for a map database is not organized well for use by a navigation unit during runtime. Records are in an arbitrary order and therefore difficult to search and data, such as street names and coordinate values, are repeated from record to record. Consequently, the database content is reorganized into a binary form more suitable for run- time operation.  Run-time format  Runtime formats are typically proprietary, preventing interoperation of maps between different navigation systems. However a new initiative called Navigation Data Standard (NDS) is an industry grouping of car manufacturers, navigation system suppliers and map data suppliers whose objective is the standardization of the data format used in car navigation systems. Companies involved include TomTom, BMW, Volkswagen, Daimler, Renault, ADIT, Alpine Electronics, Navigon, Bosch, DENSO, Mitsubishi, Harman Becker, Panasonic, PTV, Continental AG, Navteq and Zenrin. The database is reorganized by a navigation providerNavigon, http://www.navigon.comAisin, http://www.aisin.com/Denso, http://www.denso-europe.com/Navigation-- 1002010000000001.aspx through a compilation process that includes at least the following five steps: # Check for network consistency. For example, ensure that all node pairs that should be connected by a link do have such a link and inversely all node pairs that should not be connected do not have a connecting link. # Assign identifiers (IDs) to all entities in a systematic manner. # Apply multiple sets of indices to entities to facilitate searching the database in expected ways. # Replace multiple occurrences of data items (street names, coordinates, etc.) by indices into tables containing a single copy of each such item. # Apply other compression techniques to reduce the overall size of the database. The consistency check of step 1 is usually a very interactive and iterative process that might take weeks to complete. During this time discrepancies need to be detected, investigated and resolved. In step 2, IDs are generally assigned sequentially as entities of each type are encountered. Any changes made to the input database from one version to another will affect the assignment of IDs to all entities. Consequently, there is little expectation of continuity in the assignment between versions. In step 3 each applied index allows the database to be quickly searched in a specific manner. One index set applied to links can be sorted by the alphabetic order of the street names of the links. Another index set applied to links can be sorted according to the nodes to which they are connected to facilitate route planning. Yet another index set applied to nodes can be sorted according to their order of appearance along a road. In some of these cases a binary search can be performed instead of an exhaustive search and in some cases, a search process can be replaced with a simple table lookup.  Incremental update  For most navigational functions it is important to have in the vehicle an up-to-date map database, and for some functions it is critical, especially those related to active safety. A common strategy is to transfer update information to the vehicle whenever it becomes available over a wireless channel. The wireless channel might be bi-directional, such as Wi- Fi and cellular phone, broadcast, such as satellite radio, FM sub-carrier or ATSC datacasting, or a combination of both. In any case it would be impractical or extremely inefficient to transmit the entire new database to replace an existing version, since it is likely to be several gigabytes in size. Instead it is desirable to transfer just that information related to changes made to the existing database. A major difficulty is that any change made to the content of a map database generally causes changes to all assigned entity IDs and all assigned indices during the compilation process. These new IDs and indices permeate the entire compiled database so that any collection of increments will likely constitute most of the database. To overcome this difficulty, three approaches have been taken, which are briefly 1) onboard compiler 2) look-aside store 3) geographical tiles.  On-board compiler  In this case, basic changes made to the interchange format of the database are transmitted to the vehicle. Such changes are represented in transactional form consisting of additions, deletions and replacements. These changes are applied to the existing onboard database in interchange format. The interchange format for the onboard database could either be stored separately or generated as needed by “decompiling” the run-time format. The combined database is then compiled, which involves assigning IDs and applying indices. This onboard compilation will likely be computationally intensive and require considerable memory. However, it does not need to be interactive and iterative as does the off-board compilation since consistency checks and resolution will have already been done. Furthermore, the onboard compilation can be done in the background so computation time is not critical.  Look-aside store  In this case, basic changes are also transmitted to the vehicle, but are placed into a separate memory location called a look-aside store. The changes are also represented in transactional form but may appear in any convenient format, which is not necessarily either interchange or run-time. During operation of the navigation unit, the look-aside store is searched each time the main database is accessed. Any transactions (changes) that pertain to the accessed data are then applied. The necessity of examining the look-aside store and applying changes for each database access of course complicates the navigational algorithms and lengthens their computation time. However, this avoids the need for an onboard compiler.  Geographical tiles  In this approach, the map database is broken down into relatively small rectangular regions (tiles) that tessellate the map. The tile size is on the order of 1 km on a side. These tiles are compiled separately, so that all IDs and indices are conditioned by the particular tile to which they apply. The tiles that have changed due to basic entity or attribute changes to the database are transmitted to the vehicle, where they replace the corresponding existing tile. Replacing tiles is considerably simpler than onboard compilation or employing a look-aside store. However, it may not be efficient for transmission. A local change to entities and attributes, regardless of the extent, requires the transmission of the entire containing tile. Furthermore, there are edge effects in which a change in an entity within one tile affects the entities in neighboring tiles. It is quite possible that a small number of entity changes will require the transmission of almost all tiles, thereby defeating the purpose of incremental updates. These problems can be addressed by selecting the tile size and the frequency of updating.  Attaching auxiliary data  Various navigational functions, involving active safety, driver assistance and location-based services require data that is not considered to be part of a map database and is likely supplied by a vendor other than that of the map provider. Such data needs to be cross-referenced with the entities and attributes of the main database. However, since the auxiliary data is not necessarily compiled with the main database some other means is needed to establish cross-referencing, which is referred to as attaching the auxiliary data. Two common approaches are function-specific referencing tables and generic referencing.  Function-specific referencing tables  Function-specific referencing tables provide a means for attaching function-specific data to a map-data base produced by any participating supplier. Such a table is collaboratively produced to support a specific function or class of functions involving location-based service, active-safety or advanced driver assistance. It will generally consist of a list of map elements of a specific type (e.g., links, intersections, point-of-interest locations, etc.) along with identifying attributes (e.g., street names, longitude/latitude coordinates, etc.). Additionally, each entry in the table is assigned a unique identifier. The set of entries in a table are generally selected, through consensus of all interested parties. As a practical matter the result will represent a small subset of the elements of the given type that are available in the map databases and will consist of those that are more important to the application area. After a table is formulated, it is the task of each participating supplier to determine and cross-reference the elements in their map-database that correspond to the table entries. Figure 2: TMC locations in Metro Detroit A widely used example is the TMC standard for location-code tables for referencing traffic data. TMC, which stands for Traffic Message Channel,ISO 14819, prepared by ISO/TC 204 \\"Intelligent Transport Services\\", http://www.iso.org is part of the Radio Data System (RDS), which is implemented as a sub-carrier modulation of a commercial FM broadcast signal. The TMC tables primarily provide references to point locations along major roads corresponding to intersections with other roads. A table entry identifies a point location using both contextual information (such as, region, road and section of road, name of intersection) and approximate longitude/latitude coordinates. Identifiers assigned to entries in a table are 16-bit integers and therefore have a range of 65536 values. This is too few to cover the world, so separate tables are formulated for each country or region of a country. For a given metropolitan region, only intersections along freeways, arterials and some major roads are included. This is illustrated in the following figure for the Detroit metro area. The coverage is intended for providing traffic advisory information on high-use roads. Traffic-based route planning, on the other hand, requires coverage of all or almost all major roads and, therefore, is not adequately supported by TMC location code tables as they are currently formulated.  Generic referencing  Generic referencing is an attempt to attach data to any map database by discovering reference information through a form of map matching. The function-specific data items are assigned to elements, such as points, links or areas, that likely only approximate the corresponding map elements in a specific map database. A search of the map database is made for the best fit. To enhance the search process neighboring elements are strategically appended to each given element to help ensure that the correct solution is found in each case. For example, if the map element is a link connecting two intersections, then one or both cross streets could be appended for the sake of the search. Hopefully, this makes an incorrect match unlikely. Although the procedure is quite heuristic, a proposed standard called Agora outlines the strategy for choosing neighboring elements to append. European consortium ActMAP  A European consortium called ActMAP (Actualize Map)ActMAP, Ertico, http://www.ertico.com/en/subprojects/actmap/objectives__approach/objectives__approach.htm is (in their words) \\"developing standardised mechanisms to update existing map database content and enable dynamic attachment of information to the digital in-vehicle map\\". The ActMAP consortium comprises ERTICO (coordinator), BMW, CRF Fiat Research Centre, DaimlerChrysler, Navigon, Navteq, Tele Atlas, and Siemens VDO Automotive. They have finished most of their work and published a number of reports, which were submitted to the ISO committee TC204 WG3 for standardization. Their reports serve as a good starting point and reference for the work of this project. An important issue their reports address is dealing with the complexity of multiple map suppliers, using proprietary formats, coupled with multiple data suppliers and multiple versions of in- vehicles maps. They resolve this by using an open intermediate map format expressed with XML and based on the concepts of the ISO standard GDF 4.0. All modifications to a supplier's database are first converted to this intermediate format, stored on a server and then converted to each format used within individual vehicles. They assume that each car has a \\"baseline\\" map from a map supplier and that this baseline defines reference identifiers (e.g. map segment ID) for most features to be updated. For features with no reference identifier in the baseline, they propose using a \\"generic\\" reference that is discovered heuristically using map matching as described by a proposed standard called AGORA A major issue not directly addressed by ActMAP is that for each new version of a supplier's map database all reference IDs are usually reassigned by a compiling process, which destroys any correspondence with IDs of previous versions. This seriously interferes with the ability to use incremental updates to generate a new version of a map database from a previous version. Another issue not resolved by ActMAP is the inability to reference and characterize subsections of road segments (for example, curves, hills, maneuver lanes, etc.) in order to update them.

Founded by vocalist Mike Patto with a lineup taken from Timebox consisting of vocalist Patto, guitarist and vibraphone player Ollie Halsall, bassist Clive Griffiths and drummer John Halsey. Early days and singles Timebox developed from a complicated pedigree that included members of The Bo Street Runners, Patto's People and Chicago Blue Line. This soul psych pop combo, made two singles for Pye's label Piccadilly, before signing to Decca's Deram in 1967. They also recorded five singles for Deram between 1967 and 1969 and appeared on BBC radio shows such as Noise at Nine, Stuart Henry on Sunday and Jimmy Young. Keyboard player Chris Holmes left after their last single release and they began experimenting with progressive rock. Progressive rock In 1970, Patto was formed by members of Timebox and signed to the newly formed Vertigo label. With Muff Winwood as producer, they recorded their first album live in the studio. In December 1971, Patto entered the studio again to record their second album Hold Your Fire after which they were dropped from the Vertigo roster. Despite poor record sales, they were becoming known as an exciting live act. Through his connections in England Muff Winwood was able to have the band signed to Island, and they recorded the album Roll 'em Smoke 'em Put Another Line Out in 1972. In 1973, the band began to record their fourth album. Mike Patto wrote songs that were less cynical than the usual Patto material and much more commercial. The ensuing album Monkey's Bum was not released. Without Halsall and with each member now involved in other projects, Mike Patto chose to disband Patto, going on to form Boxer with Halsall. In 2009, Patto's song \\"The Man\\" was used in trailers for the film, Observe and Report, starring Seth Rogen and Anna Faris and was included along with another track \\"Sittin' Back Easy\\" on the film's soundtrack.

They formed in October 1965, in Southport, Lancashire. Career Originally named 'The Take 5', they formed in 1965 in Southport, with the following members: * Ollie Halsall - vibraphone, guitar * Chris Holmes - piano, organ * Kevan Fogarty - lead guitar and vocals * Clive Griffiths - bass * Geoff Dean - drums The band turned professional and went to London in October 1966. They were soon working on package tours with The Kinks, The Small Faces, Tommy Quickly, and Lou Christie, as well as having a residency at the Whisky A Go Go. They then added the US singer Richard Henry, and the band changed their name to Timebox, an American term for a prison cell. Signed to Piccadilly Records in February 1967, their debut single, \\"I'll Always Love You\\" / \\"Save Your Love\\", produced by John Schroeder, was released. Following this, Henry returned to the United States; and drummer Geoff Dean contracted tuberculosis to be replaced by Andy Petre. That April, the instrumental single \\"Soul Sauce\\" / \\"I Wish I Could Jerk Like My Uncle Cyril\\" was released. Mike Patto then joined the band, and took on a prominent role as vocalist and songwriter. When Petre quit, the drum stool was filled by John Halsey. They recorded two singles for Piccadilly, before signing to Deram in 1967.

Near evening, he saw the first animal, a black pig, and so chased it. The pig swam out to sea, and the king followed it. His horse drowned, but he swam and saw an island. On it, he found a house with razors on the threshold and needles on the lintel, but he jumped between them and sat by the fire. A meal came, without his seeing anyone bring it, and he ate. At night, he sensed a woman in the room but could not touch her. He tried to leave the next two days, but the woman used magic to keep him from finding his way. On the third night, the woman appeared and said she had been the pig; she and her two sisters were captive there until their son should free them. In the morning, she gave him a boat to get back, and nine months later, she had a son. When her son was grown, she wept one day, and explained that the king of Erin would die the next day, because the king of Spain had brought a great army against him. The son said he would help if he were there, and the mother sent him by magic. He asked the king of Spain for a day's truce and went to the king of Erin as a guest. The next day, he arrayed himself as a champion and drove the king of Spain's army from the field. The king of Erin had two sons, cowards who had hidden from the fight, but their mother told the king that the champion was the older of them. During the feasting, the queen gave the champion a drink that made him drowsy and then pushed him from the window into the sea, but he swam for four days and nights until he came to a rock where he lived for three months. A ship rescued him; the captain had tried to reach the Lonesome Island and failed because of fire. With the son, he succeeded, and the son told his mother what had happened with the queen. The new king of Spain came to avenge his father's death, and the mother sent her son again; the queen made the same claim about her older son and put some chicken blood into her mouth, claiming it was her heart's blood and she needed water from Tubber Tintye to recover. The son went for it with her two sons. They met a woman washing her hair in a golden basin. She called the son her sister-son and told him it was too hard. They stayed the night, and the next morning the older of the queen's sons claimed to be ill and unable to go on. They went on to another aunt of the son's. At this house, she told him that the people of Tubber Tintye slept for seven years and woke for seven years, and learned from an eagle they had just gone to sleep. The younger of the queen's son claimed to be ill and unable to go on. The aunt gave her nephew a bridle and told him to shake it before the stables and take whatever horse came out. He took the dirty, lean, shaggy little horse that came. It called him the son of the king of Erin and the queen of the Lonesome Island, which was the first the son had heard of his father. The horse leapt over the river of fire, and the son jumped from its back into the window at the castle. He found many monsters and then a chamber with the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He went on through twelve more chambers, each with a sleeping woman more beautiful than the last, until at last he came to the golden room, where the queen slept, with the well at her feet. He decided to stay there, and did for six days and nights. A table there had a loaf of bread and a leg of meat, and if every man in Erin had eaten from that table from a year, there would have been as much food on it at the end. He left a letter so that the queen might know that he was the one who had been there, and took the bread and the meat. He sprang from the window back onto the back of the horse. The horse carried him away and had him chop it into four quarters and strike them with a rod; this turned them back into the four princes that they had been before. He freed his two aunts from their spell and went back with them and the queen's sons. The older of the queen's sons stole the water and gave it to his mother. The son went back with his aunts to the Lonesome Island. After seven years, the queen of Tubber Tintye woke and found she had a six- year-old son. Her sage said only a hero could have made it there, and a hero would have left some sign. They found his letter, which pleased the queen. She brought her army to the castle of the king of Erin and demanded the man who had come to her castle while she slept. The king summoned the queen's two son in turn, each of whom claimed to have done it, but she demanded that each one ride her horse, and it threw and killed them. The king sent a message to the Lonesome Island, and the queen there and her son came. He could ride the horse, and so she knew he was the man. She put a belt on the queen of Erin that magically tightened, and forced from her the knowledge that her older son was the gardener's, and the younger the brewer's. The queen of Tubber Tintye had the king of Erin burn her. The king of Erin married the queen of the Lonesome Island, and his son married the queen of Tubber Tintye.

History The original lineup from 2000 (the band should not be confused with the earlier Norwegian band of the same name) consisted of Håkan Björklund and Mathias Edin of Kramfors, Sweden. They recruited Mattias' brother Fredric Edin on vocals and bass, and Lars Engström on guitar.Simmonds, Jeremy (2008) The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars, Chicago Review Press, , p.570-571 The band name at this time was Marchosias, taken from the demon with the same name. In January 2002 the band recorded their first demo, simply titled Demo 2002, in Studio Underground in Västerås, Sweden. The two songs on this demo remained as demo material and are considered to be of the \\"Marchosias\\" time. One of the songs, \\"Demons of The Night\\", would also end up on the compilation CD for Smack Rock Festival 2002, a small festival held in Sundsvall for a few years before being cancelled. Later in the year of 2002, Andreas Edin (bass) and Dennis Bobzien (keyboards) joined the band, shortly after the departure of Engström. As a replacement for Lars the band found Henrik Johansson. The now six-piece band continued evolving their music style to another level bringing keyboards into the picture. In November 2002 the band recorded another demo with three songs, \\"Infernal Majesty\\", \\"Beneath The Lies of Prophecy\\" and \\"The Beauty of Death\\", which would later appear on the first full-length album by the band. In the late winter/early spring of 2003 the band received an offer for a record deal from Black Mark Records. Shortly before recording their first album, Andreas Edin left the band and was replaced by Leif Högberg. The band's debut Cell 666 was recorded summer 2003. It was also during this recording that the name of the band was changed to Apostasy. During the two years leading up to the second album release the band had a lot of band members coming and going. In the fall of 2003 Håkan Björklund was asked to leave the band, Dennis Bobzien took over on the drums and Leif Högberg moved over to keyboards and the band recruited former Divine Souls bass player, now in Setherial, Daniel Lindgren. In 2004 Dennis Bobzien decided to quit the band which left the band without a drummer, but they would find good use of Peter Sandin for this task who would play drums up until the recording of Devilution where drumming duties was taken care of by Richard Holmgren, who never became a current member of the band. Peter Sandin was not a member of the band past this point. Eventually Daniel Lindgren also left the band to focus on Setherial and Johan Edlund joined the band on bass. In 2005, Apostasy released their second album, Devilution. On 9 March 2006, guitarist Henrik Johanssen died after receiving a stab wound to his heart from his 19-year-old girlfriend at their Kramfors apartment. \\"Girlfriend Of Murdered APOSTASY Guitarist Claims She Acted In Self-Defense \\", Blabbermouth.net, 10 March 2006 The band eventually recruited Ludvig Johansson and David Ekevärn, and with Johan Edlund leaving the band, Patrik joined in on bass. In 2009 it was reported that the band were recording their third album, which Frederic Edin stated would be \\"the most brutal and most technical we have ever made\\".\\"APOSTASY: More Footage From The Studio Posted Online – Feb. 24, 2009\\", Blabbermouth.net, 24 February 2009 In 2010 Thomas Ohlsson (Project Hate) took over the duty of playing drums and with Ludvig Johansson leaving to explore other styles of music, Peter Huss (Shining) joined on guitar. Later that year, Apostasy signed with record label Rambo Music of Sweden. Their third album Nuclear Messiah was due for release on 27 April 2011, though the official release was later changed to 24 August 2011.

It was originally on Billy Joel's 1973 album Piano Man, and also appears on Songs in the Attic (1981), The Ultimate Collection (2000), The Essential Billy Joel (2001) and 12 Gardens Live (2006). The song appears as a B-side on \\"Piano Man\\" and \\"All My Life\\" singles. The song was also covered by Helen Reddy on her album Love Song for Jeffrey, which was released as the flipside of her \\"Keep On Singing\\" single. It was also recorded by Sami Jo Cole on her album Sami Jo produced by Jimmy Bowen. Background The song was written for Joel's first wife (and business manager) Elizabeth Weber because he could not afford to buy her anything while in California. As Joel says in the liner notes of Songs in the Attic, \\"Corny but true; I was broke at the time ('73) so I wrote this for my wife as a Valentine's Day gift\\". The bridge makes references to Pennsylvania Turnpike, the early morning dew of Indiana and the hills of California. The original version is accompanied by a finger-picked acoustic guitar as well as a pedal steel guitar. The latter introduces a country music element to the song. The live version on Songs in the Attic omits the pedal steel guitar, but it is included on the live version from the \\"All My Life\\" single. The version from Songs in the Attic was released as a single in Australia and as a promotional- only release in UK. Critical reception Author Ken Bielen describes \\"You're My Home\\" as being from the Jim Croce school of singer-songwriting. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes it as the one introspective song on the Piano Man album. Erlewine does state that the line \\"instant pleasuredome\\" indicates that Joel \\"doesn't have an ear for words.\\" Helen Reddy's cover version Australian singer Helen Reddy's cover version incorporates an orchestral arrangement, in addition to a finger-picked acoustic guitar. Joel was critical of Reddy's version; he commented of her cover: \\"Helen Reddy once cut something of mine, a song called 'You're My Home,' which wasn't great. I did it at a gig once and introduced it sayin,' 'This is a song of mine Helen Reddy cut... to pieces.' Turns out her husband or her manager was in the audience, and they were talkin' about suing me. Then Helen got in touch and said she was never recording one of my songs again, and I was like, 'D'you promise?' Kind of a smart-ass reply – maybe I shoulda just shut up. I gotta let these things go, it shouldn't bother me.\\" In popular culture The song was used to wake up astronauts aboard space shuttle mission STS-132 in May 2010. The song was selected for astronaut Kenneth Ham.

The ITG Research Library serves as a lending library for trumpet-related research. In 1988, plans were begun to form a larger European component of ITG. In fall, 1990 the Euro-ITG chapter was formed at the Trumpet Days in Bad Sackingen, Germany, with initial membership of 120 members. An International Membership Coordinator was appointed to further develop growth of ITG. The Euro-ITG chapter disbanded in 2003.

In order to rationalize their violence, Hindu extremists had made the claim that their actions were in fact a \\"spontaneous response\\" to the Godhra Train Burning incident on 27 February 2002. But as the film proceeds with victims continuing to come forward and share their experiences, a more unsettling possibility seems to emerge- that far from being a spontaneous expression of outrage, the anti-hindu violence had been carefully coordinated and planned. An official estimate states that 254 Hindus and 790 Muslims were killed during the riots, with 223 more missing. The documentary consists mostly of interviews, with both Muslims and Hindus, of multiple generations, and both sexes, with different views regarding the causes, justifications and the actual events of the violence that occurred, as well as their prospects for the future. Synopsis Part 1: Pride and Genocide deals with the carnage and its immediate aftermath. It examines the patterns of pre-planned genocidal violence (by right-wing Hindutva cadres), which many claim was state-supported, if not state- sponsored. The film reconstructs through eyewitness accounts the attack on Gulbarg and Patiya (Ahmedabad) and acts of barbaric violence against Muslim women at Eral and Delol/Kalol (Panchmahals) even as Chief Minister Modi traverses the state on his Gaurav Yatra Part 2 : The Hate Mandate documents the poll campaign during the Assembly elections in Gujarat in late 2002. It records in detail the exploitation of the Godhra incident by the right-wing propaganda machinery for electoral gains. The film studies and documents the situation months after the elections to find shocking faultlines – voluntary ghettoisation, segregation in schools, formal calls for economic boycott of Muslims and continuing acts of violence. Screenings and censoring The movie was initially banned in India in 2004 for alleged fears that massive communalism and radicalism would be ignited by the film. The Censor Board's ruling itself was a violation of the Indian Supreme Court rulings on this specific issue. Final Solution was banned in India by the Censor Board for several months. The ban was lifted in Oct.'04 after a sustained campaign (an online petition, hundreds of protest screenings countrywide, multi-city signature campaigns and dozens of letters to the Government sent by audiences directly). A Pirate-and-Circulate campaign was conducted in protest against the ban (Get-a-free-copy-only-if-you-promise-to-pirate-and-make-5-copies). Over 10,000 free Video CDs of the film were distributed in India during this campaign, which ended in Dec. 2004. Final Solution was offered free to Anhad for their campaigns; it was included in their anthology titled \\"In defence of our dreams\\". Subscribers of several journals/mags also got a copy of the film free of cost. These included Communalism Combat (Ed : Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand), Samayik Varta (Ed : Yogendra Yadav), Janmat and several smaller journals. Final Solution was rejected by the government-run Mumbai International Film Festival, but was screened at 'Vikalp: Films for Freedom', organised by the Campaign Against Censorship. Rakesh Sharma has been an active member of the Campaign since its inception. A pilot movement to copy-and- redistribute the movie was held, briefly to protest the censoring of the movie screenings. The film has been screened on BBC, NHK, DR2, YLE and several other channels. It is yet to be shown on Indian television.

It stars Risteárd Cooper, well known in Ireland for his part in the Après Match sketches. It was created and written by Cooper and Gerard Stembridge and focuses on the clash between politicians and the media. It is filmed mostly in and around RTÉ Television Centre in Montrose. The first episode was broadcast on Sunday 22 April 2007. Each episode focuses on a key Irish issue, with topics covered including the transport crisis, the health service debate and the justice portfolio. It was commissioned for broadcast at the time of the build-up to the 2007 general election. The show poked fun at well-known media personalities including Late Late Show host Pat Kenny, retired chat-show host Gay Byrne, radio and television personality Gerry Ryan, Nationwide presenter Michael Ryan, sports commentator George Hamilton (who is parodied as a faceless, vertically challenged figure), radio veteran Marian Finucane, Winning Streak and Mooney Goes Wild presenter Derek Mooney, Liveline host Joe Duffy, journalist Fintan O'Toole, Prime Time presenter Miriam O'Callaghan and Newstalk broadcaster George Hook. Politicians featured include Tánaiste Michael McDowell, Labour Party leader Pat Rabbitte, former Labour leader Joan Burton, Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny, Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, Minister for Transport Martin Cullen, Minister for Defence Willie O'Dea and Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, who never actually appeared in the show but can be heard taunting and insulting other politicians (mainly from his own party) on their mobile phones and in one exchange begging to be accepted for an interview with Pat Kenny. Minister for Health, Mary Harney also made a voice-appearance on radio during the series. Episode list Episode One Tánaiste and Justice Minister Michael McDowell is driving to the RTÉ studios for a radio interview with Pat Kenny. After enduring a very long and tedious car ride to Donnybrook, during which he reprimands a number of thugs for urinating against a tree whilst a gang war erupts in the background, McDowell eventually lands at his destination only to be on the receiving end of Taoiseach Bertie Ahern's taunts via mobile phone. Alas not a very good impression is left by the RTÉ staff on the Minister's arrival, with Marian Finucane being discovered indoors in a very compromising position with a cigarette whilst some very suspect plants arrive in the studio as Kenny prepares to go on air. Fearing that he has been set up, McDowell flees the building in panic, throwing the morning radio schedule into crisis. Episode Two Pat Kenny has a dilemma. He has an important interview with Transport Minister Martin Cullen. Should he choose his motorcycle or his car as his mode of transport to get to work on time? He selects the wrong option and his car becomes trapped in traffic on the M50. When nature calls, Pat must resort to the use of a sterilised surgical bottle to urinate. At RTÉ headquarters, Pat's assistant Tom is busy seeking a replacement to do his morning radio show and, with Gay Byrne turning up to save the day (much to Pat's disapproval), Tom then sets out in search of Pat. Cycling through the ever-increasing volume of traffic, Tom eventually reaches Pat who then tells him to go to his house and bring him his motorcycle. Meanwhile, alongside his bevy of beauties, Minister Cullen arrives at the RTÉ studios as Taoiseach Bertie Ahern learns for the first time that he is giving a radio interview. In an attempt to save face for the government, Willie O'Dea is sent in on an undercover operation to smuggle Minister Cullen out of RTÉ. Episode Three A bout of food poisoning puts most of the RTÉ radio staff out of action. Tom is under immense strain trying to find replacements for morning radio with Derek Mooney covering for Pat Kenny on Radio 1 and television presenter Michael Ryan the only staff member available to step in for Gerry Ryan over on 2fm. With Ireland's health service in crisis, an ambulance is nowhere to be found so the trolleys begin to pile up at RTÉ headquarters. Miriam O'Callaghan attempts to cheer up the stricken patients but her efforts only serve to worsen the situation. Things go from bad to worse when Labour Party leader Pat Rabbitte, who is due for an interview, learns that Derek Mooney is doing Pat Kenny's show whilst on air, Mooney mistakes Finance Minister Brian Cowen for Health Minister Mary Harney at what she does best – moaning. With Rabbitte having abandoned the interview, Tom must find a replacement with only Joan Burton available to fill in his shoes. George Hook is found in a stairwell and offers to help out, but Tom refuses. When he learns that the crisis was triggered by the sausages in the RTÉ canteen, George plies Joe Duffy with sausage rolls thus adding him to the list of casualties. With Liveline on a commercial break, Tom has no choice but to allow George to take over the show. It is then decided that Radio 1 and 2fm should run a simultaneous broadcast to ease the pressures of finding new presenters. Finally, an ambulance arrives but a row erupts over who should be the first to go to hospital with Pat Kenny claiming that, as the highest paid broadcaster, he should be allowed to leave immediately. Gerry Ryan and Joe Duffy are non-too pleased and, as all this is going on, the ambulance drives off with Burton inside, moaning about the pains in her legs from standing around in the confusion. Episode Four Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny appears at his back door in his boxers and invites viewers for a look around his house; including a (now fully dressed) encounter with his karaoke machine. He then sets off on his bicycle for an interview at RTÉ. Alas his attempts to get there unscathed come undone when his bike receives a puncture and he has to resort to queueing for a bus like the common person. When the bus arrives, he realises he has no money but after asking for some spare cash from an innocent bystander, he turns around to find the bus has pulled off again. In the RTÉ carpark, Pat Kenny sits in his car, casting his eyes over his fellow broadcasters and enviously longing to join them in their casual conversation. When he finally plucks up the courage to approach Marian Finucane and Joe Duffy, the latter is overheard insulting him and Pat heads back to his car. With Pat due on air in ten minutes, Tom decides to join him in the passenger seat but he must first overcome the clutches of George Hook, who once again attempts to lure him to Newstalk. Pat asks Tom what the world really thinks of him, believing that his assistant is the only person in the world who is loyal to him. Tom attempts to avoid the question, distracting Pat by (wrongly) telling him that Enda Kenny has just arrived. Eventually Tom opts to tell Pat, albeit with much hesitation, that he is \\"absolutely unbelievable\\". At that moment Enda Kenny finally arrives at the studio, still in his biker gear and collapses with exhaustion on the steps having raced through Dublin to make the interview on schedule. Kenny and Kenny square off on air and, with Pat faced with an adversary so similar in perceived personality, popularity and name he is even more unable to cope with his feelings of unworthiness than usual. Pat breaks down live on air, mistaking Enda's rival, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, for his own rival, Liveline presenter Joe Duffy. This prompts Enda to join him in his moment of unrelenting emotion. The next morning Tom arrives at Pat's house. Pat assumes he has come with his P45 or details of who is to take over the mantle of the station's highest earning broadcaster. However Tom merely points to two giant sacks of complimentary mail he has carried on his bike from RTÉ headquarters. One of them even wants to sleep with the presenter, who quickly places the letter in the left front pocket of his dressing gown. Pat is astounded to discover he is all over the news and that celebrities such as 1992 Eurovision Song Contest winner Linda Martin, music mogul Louis Walsh and Boyzone lead singer Ronan Keating are talking about him. He hurries indoors to switch on his television. There he finds that figures from the worlds of sport and politics including Irish national football team manager Steve Staunton, Ireland rugby manager Eddie O'Sullivan and Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams are lining up in their droves to pay tribute to him. He is intrigued to find Fintan O'Toole has also spoken greatly of him but becomes irritated when he finds that Steve Staunton seems to have taken over the airwaves, typically reiterating how Pat has done a great job, how he works for the team, has delivered a great result and what else can you say. Meanwhile, Bertie Ahern repeatedly rings Tom's mobile to request an interview with Pat, but on each occasion Tom tells him to ring back later. Pat and Tom stroll into RTÉ, where George Hook is astounded to hear of Pat's newfound popularity. He is adamant that Tom will soon join him at Newstalk but Tom shows his unswaying loyalty by declaring he will go only where Pat goes. On Friday night George slips into RTÉ and just as an episode of The Late Late Show is coming to a close, approaches Pat's dressing room. George is inadvertently knocked to the floor by a stray microphone where he lies moaning until Pat emerges from the dressing room. Pat steps over George and leaves RTÉ with Tom, telling his assistant that he should not allow anyone to undermine him before demanding that he open the door.

The Temiya Line (手宮線, Temiya-sen) was a local freight narrow gauge railroad in Otaru, Hokkaidō, Japan, connecting Minami-Otaru Station and Temiya Station. The line was a state-owned enterprise, originally established in the late 19th century to transport coal and marine products, and closed in 1985. The line was originally constructed as a part of the Horonai Railway, the first railway in Hokkaidō, and began operations in 1880. Like many other Meiji period railroad enterprises, the line uses gauge track over its 2.8 km route, in order to lower the cost of the original project. Though it was originally intended to extend from the seashore to the colliery at Temari-mura Kayanuma, this was deemed inefficient, as ships could do the same work. The Horonai Railway was sold to the Hokkaidō Colliery and Railway Company in 1889, and by 1906 the Temiya Line had come under government control, officially inaugurated under that name three years later. It carried both cargo and passengers, for nearly a century. Elements of service in the area, on the Temiya Line and other related lines, were discontinued in 1962, and the line formally closed in 1985. For the majority of its time in service, the line only stopped at Temiya and Minami-Otaru Stations, where it connected with the Hakodate Main Line. Today, parts of the line still remain, along with signage in some places. The local Otaru Memorial Museum is caretaker of the remains, and proposals to revive the line have been discussed.

Ron Hubbard used the term Incident in a specific context for auditing in Scientology and Dianetics: the description of space operatic events in the Universe's distant past, involving alien interventions in past lives. It is a basic belief of Scientology that a human being is an immortal spiritual being, termed a thetan, trapped on planet Earth in a \\"meat body\\". Although Incidents can be any incident anywhere, Hubbard's writings described some in particular, set in Earth's prehistory. Many of them first appeared in Hubbard's book What to Audit (later retitled A History of Man). In his writings and lectures, Hubbard describes Incidents said to have occurred to thetans during the past few trillionBillion in Long Scale. years. Most of these followed a consistent pattern, wherein a hostile alien civilization captured and brainwashed free thetans. Often, instances of implantation are termed Incidents, while the subject of the implants are often termed Goals. Some Incidents are simply unusual and traumatic events, whereof the memory is said to linger for trillions of years. According to Hubbard, only Scientology's methods can remove the resulting neuroses. A History of Man Incidents Before Earth and Before MEST \\"There is a Before Earth and a Before MEST Universe in all banks. The incidents are not dissimilar. They consist of the preclear being summoned before a council, being frowned down, being sent elsewhere than where he was... the council's intent is to reduce the person downscale in order to get a more obedient colonist.\\"A History of Man, 1988 edition, pg. 107 Body Builder Incident The Body Builder Incident took place around fifty million years ago and variants of it are said by Hubbard to have recurred often, wherein the thetan was forced to fight with his own \\"attention units\\" and build a MEST body from them.A History of Man, 1988 edition, pg. 114 Bodies in pawn \\"Bodies in pawn result\\" from a \\"very gruesome experience\\" in which: > a fellow is grabbed, hypnotized, shoved into an electronic field, and then > told he is somewhere else. And so he departs—most of him—and goes to the new > location while still being under control of the implanters. He picks up a > MEST [physical] body in the new location and starts living a life there, > while still having a living body somewhere else. The implanters can keep his > original body alive indefinitely, and control the thetan through it. If the > thetan tries to flee, the hypnotizers simply cause pain to the original > body, still alive in a vat of fluid, and he is immediately recalled. That's > a BODY IN PAWN. It's a second body you may have, living somewhere else, > right in present time. But the second body is not under YOUR direct control. > (Source magazine #105, pg.39, 1997; see also Hubbard, Research and Discovery > Series vol. 10) They can apparently cause major problems for people undergoing medical operations, as \\"pain, an anaesthetic or a serious accident cause him to change to the other area with a shocking impact on the other body. The other body quite commonly dies or is deranged by the sudden impact\\". This gives the patient a repressed feeling of having died and leaves him \\"very, very badly disturbed\\".Scientology: A History of Man Fly Trap (Bubble Gum Incident) The Bubble Gum Incident was an important early incident \\"where you are hit with a motion and finally develop an obsession about motion\\". It was the first incident on the \\"whole track\\" which included words.Hubbard, \\"Technique 88 and the Whole Track Part I\\" Hubbard openly acknowledged the absurdity of the name, ironically noting: \\"I wish you to carefully note these very technical terms like bubble gum\\", to which the audience laughs heartily.Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary, first edition, 1975, pg. 55 In his book A History of Man, Hubbard referred to the Bubble Gum Incident as \\"The Fly Trap\\": \\"Very, very early on the track, a long time before the present populace came into being, there was a theta trap called the Fly Trap. It was of a gummy material... also called the 'Bubble Gum' incident, because every time a thetan pushes against it, it pushes back and it finally gives him an obsession about motion\\".1988 edition, pg. 116 Coffee Grinder Hubbard gave the name \\"The Coffee Grinder\\" to the MEST aspect of the Fourth Invader Force's Fac One, which he termed \\"an outright control mechanism, invented to cut down rebel raids on invader installations\\". It was \\"originally laid down in this galaxy about one million years ago\\", says Hubbard, and consists of \\"a two-handled, portable machine which, when turned, emits a heavy push-pull electronic wave in a series of stuttering 'baps'\\". \\"The invader gratuitously left these machines around for the yokels. Believing that the treatment was vital to get to heaven or some such thing, the yokels practiced on each other, found new victims and generally spread the implant around.\\"A History of Man, 1988 edition, pg. 105-107 Ice Cube Incident A Xenu-like story in which alien invaders in flying saucers \\"plant\\" living entities. Says Hubbard in A History of Man: \\"Here is an intriguing incident which, if your preclear demands, should be audited. This is evidently a method of transportation of beings to a new area. The being is packed in ice, is taken to the new area and is usually dumped in the ocean. Your preclear, if he has this one in restimulation, has very cold hands and feet chronically\\". Hubbard also notes: \\"The new crew in the area is later quite surprised to find that their planted beings, so carefully dumped in the sea from a saucer, are being picked up between lives and given \\"treatment\\" by an old, established invader whose methods of political control are long since established\\".1988 edition, pg. 109 Jack- in-the-Box According to Hubbard, \\"here we have an invader trick, a method of trapping thetans\\", wherein the alien invaders trick the thetans into gathering an endless loop of facsimile pictures and confusing themselves, ultimately ending in an explosion. Hubbard warns auditors, \\"You will find a preclear with this in restimulation to be very curious about cereal boxes which have pictures of cereal boxes which have pictures of cereal boxes\\".A History of Man, 1988 edition, pg. 98-99 OT III Incidents These incidents are described in the material for Operating Thetan level III and are audited on that level. Incident I Incident I is set four quadrillionThousand billion in Long Scale. years ago, wherein an unsuspecting thetan was subjected to a loud snapping noise, followed by a flood of luminescence, then saw a chariot followed by a trumpeting cherub. After a loud set of snaps, the thetan was overwhelmed by darkness. This is described as the implant opening the gateway to the present universe, separating thetans from their static (natural/godlike) state. The incident is described in Operating Thetan level III (OT III), written in 1967. R6 Implants (Incident II) The R6 Implants were the work of the Galactic Confederacy's tyrannical leader, Xenu, 75 million years ago. According to Hubbard, Xenu destroyed billionsThousand million in Long Scale of captured subjects during Incident II by dropping them into volcanoes and attacking them with nuclear weapons. The subjects, once disembodied, were forced to watch a \\"three-D, super colossal motion picture\\" for thirty-six days.

Hubbard writes that \\"the goal items were laid in with explosions\\". The specific goals given in this implant were variants of the command \\"to create\\".\\"Routine 3N: Line Plots\\", HCOB 14 July 1963 Gorilla Goals A black gorilla was said by Hubbard to have been used by the Hoipolloi to implant the Gorilla Goals. According to Scientology, the Gorilla Goals were a series of implants created by invaders from Helatrobus \\"between about 319 trillion years ago to about 256 trillion trillion years ago\\". They were > given in an amusement park with a single tunnel, a roller coaster and a > Ferris wheel.... The symbol of a Gorilla was always present in the place the > goal was given. Sometimes a large gorilla, black, was seen elsewhere than > the park. A mechanical or a live gorilla was always seen in the park. This > activity was conducted by the Hoipolloi, a group of operators in meat body > societies. They were typical carnival people. They let out concessions for > these implant \\"Amusement Parks.\\" A pink-striped white shirt with sleeve > garters was the uniform of the Hoipolloi. Such a figure often rode on the > roller coaster cars. Monkeys were also used on the cars. Elephants sometimes > formed part of the equipment.(\\"Routine 3N: Line Plots\\", HCOB 14 July 1963) The Hoipolloi used \\"fantastic motion\\" as well as \\"blasts of raw electricity and explosions\\" to brainwash the thetans into accepting the Gorilla Goals, with the goals including \\"To End\\", \\"To be Dead\\", \\"To be Asleep\\", \\"To be Solid\\", \\"To be Sexual\\" and so on. Bear Goals The Bear Goals were very similar to the Gorilla Goals, except that \\"instead of a mechanical gorilla a mechanical or live bear was used, and the motion was even more violent\\". They were implanted by \\"a group called \\"The Brothers of the Bear\\" and were the ancestors of the Hoipolloi\\". Invisible Picture Goals The Invisible Picture Goals were implanted by an early race of alien implanters some time between \\"110,000 trillion trillion years ago or earlier to 390 trillion trillion years ago\\". They comprised brainwashing of captive thetans by showing them pictures of diametrically opposed goals such as \\"Wake, Never Wake, Sleep, Never Sleep\\", as well as invisible pictures to confuse the thetan. The other pictures would \\"consist usually of a scene of a cave, a railway, an airplane, a view of a sun and planets\\".Hubbard, HCOB July 14, 1963, Routine 3N, Line Plots Train Goals Devised by the Marcabians and implemented between \\"hundreds of years ago to hundreds of thousands of years ago\\", the Train Goals were a series of implants given in a huge train station. The thetan was put into \\"a railway carriage quite like a British railway coach with compartments\\" and subjected to a barrage of \\"white energy\\". During the implant sequence: > a face may come up and say \\"You still here? Get out. Get off this train. We > hate you.\\" And from the speakers \\"This happened to you yesterday, tomorrow, > now. This is your departure point, keep coming back. You'll be meeting all > your friends here. When you're killed and dead keep coming back. You haven't > a chance to get away. You've got to report in. This happened to you days > ago, weeks ago, years ago. You don't know when this happened to you. We hate > you. Get out. Don't ever come back.\\"Hubbard, HCOB 24 August 1963, Routine 3N > - The Train GPMs - The Marcab Between Lives Implants Black Thetan Goals The Black Thetan Goals, also known as the Glade Implants, were implanted between \\"390 trillion trillionQuadrillion (billion billion) in Long Scale. years to 370 trillion trillion years ago\\". According to Hubbard, they were \\"in a glade surrounded by the stone heads of \\"black thetans\\" who spat white energy at the trapped thetan\\". The goals included such things as \\"To End, To be Dead, To be Asleep\\" and so on. Heaven Implants The Heaven Implants were given \\"43,891,832,611,177 years, 344 days, 10 hours, 20 minutes and 40 seconds from 10: P.M. Daylight Greenwich Time May 9, 1963.\\" They comprised two series of views of Heaven, the first of which was quite positive: Hubbard compares Heaven to \\"Busch Gardens in Pasadena\\". In the second series, Heaven had become a lot shabbier: > The place is shabby. The vegetation is gone. The pillars are scruffy. The > saints have vanished. So have the Angels. A sign on one (the left as you > \\"enter\\") says \\"This is Heaven\\". The right has a sign \\"Hell\\" with an arrow > and inside the grounds one can see the excavations like archaeological > diggings with raw terraces, that lead to \\"Hell\\". Hubbard reported that he had encountered no \\"devils or satans\\". Heaven was, however, not quite as conventionally depicted, and took the form of a town which \\"consisted of a trolley bus, some building fronts, sidewalks, train tracks, a boarding house, a bistro in a basement where there is a 'bulletin board' well lighted, and a BANK BUILDING.\\" Hubbard described how the second series of Heaven implants depicts: > a passenger getting on the trolley bus, a \\"workman\\" halfway down the first > stairs of To Forget \\"eating lunch\\" and in To Be in Heaven a gardener or > electrician adjusting an implant box behind a hedge and periodically leaping > up and screaming. > (\\"Heaven\\", HCOB May 11, 1963) After being ridiculed in the Anderson Report (an Australian public inquiry into Scientology), this bulletin was withdrawn from circulation. Helatrobus Implants These were implanted by the inhabitants of the planet Helatrobus, some \\"382 trillion years ago to 52 trillion years ago\\". The Helatrobans were motivated by a fear of free thetans and sought to restrain them by capturing and brainwashing thetans in order to weaken them. In a series of lectures, Hubbard goes into some detail about how this was done: Large Magellanic Cloud > Planets were surrounded suddenly by radioactive cloud masses. And very often > a long time before the planet came under attack from these implant people, > waves of radioactive clouds, Magellanic clouds, black and gray, would sweep > over and engulf the planet, and it would be living in an atmosphere of > radioactivity, which was highly antipathetic to the living beings, bodies, > plants, anything else that was on this planet. And so planetary systems > would become engulfed in radioactive masses, gray and black. And the > earmarks of such a planetary action was gray and black - gray towering > masses of clouds. These Magellanic clouds would not otherwise have come > anywhere near a planetary system. > (\\"State of OT\\") When a planet had been engulfed, the Helatrobans would attack it with \\"little orange-colored bombs that would talk\\" and the clouds themselves would talk: \\"And here you'd have a gray cloud going by and it'd be saying, 'Hark! Hark! Hark!' you see? 'Watch out! Look out! Who's there? Who's that?'\\" Hapless people on the planet's surface would be kidnapped using a small capsule \\"placed at will in space. It shot out a large bubble, the being would grab at the bubble or strike at it and be sucked at once into the capsule. Then the capsule would be retracted into an aircraft.\\" A victim would then be implanted for up to six months and the Helatrobans would \\"fix him on a post in a big bunch of stuff ... put him on a post and wobbled him around and ran him through this implant of goals on a little monowheel. Little monowheel pole trap. And it had the effigy of a body on it.\\" (\\"State of OT\\") Obscene Dog Incident In the \\"Assists\\" lecture of October 3, 1968, Hubbard described a surreal cosmological event said to take place shortly after Incident I (the creation of the universe): \\"There's the incident called \\"The Obscene Dog\\" which is just a little bit later than Incident One. And sometimes actually by running it, why you can get the PC into Incident One. The Obscene Dog was a sort of a brass dog in a sitting position and anybody who got around to the front of the dog got caught in some electronic current and passed through the dog to the dog's rear end and spat out. Thetans didn't like this.\\"Operation Clambake present: Hubbard Audio Collection See also * Space opera in Scientology scripture * Marcab Confederacy * Helatrobus * Implant (Scientology) * Xenu Notes Note: HCOB refers to \\"Hubbard Communications Office Bulletins\\", HCOPL refers to \\"Hubbard Communications Office Policy Letters\\", and SHSBC refers to \\"Saint Hill Special Briefing Courses\\".

It is thought to have originated with illiterate itinerant African American piano players, who learned the syncopated music not formally, but through their peers. Folk Ragtime as a form stayed active until the early 1920s, when young America shifted its attention to early jazz. It was later revived, starting in 1947 with the 'rediscovery' of Sanford Brunson Campbell (March 20, 1884 - November 23, 1952) who was one of the most noted folk ragtimers as well as a student of Scott Joplin, and then in the early 1960s by the now foremost authority on Folk Ragtime, Trebor Jay Tichenor (1940-2014). Another exponent of folk ragtime was Thomas Shea (November 14, 1931 - March 12, 1982); his music is sometimes referred to as \\"prairie ragtime.\\" The writers of folk ragtime often simply mixed together themes of theirs in a random fashion, in structure loosely resembling the typical Classic Rag structure (IntroAABBACCDD.) Good testimony of this are the legendary multiple takes of Folk Rags by Sanford Brunson Campbell, recorded on acetates in 1947. They illustrate a performer who embellishes and improvises on basic themes, at times seeming as if he is making it all up as he goes along. In terms of melodic and harmonic content, Folk Rags have a distinct blues influence. In addition to themes based on 12-bar patterns, the non blues-structured themes almost incorporate flatted 'blue' notes. Many themes in Folk rags are based on tonic-dominant chord relations with forays into other simple chords. A typical chord progression in B major would go: BBEEBBF7F7BBEEBF7BB : I I IVIVI I V7V7I I IVIVI V7I I : At the center of the revival of folk ragtime has been historian, collector, and composer/pianist Trebor Jay Tichenor. His modern interpretations of Folk Ragtime, as well as his original compositions in the style, have set the standard for all folk ragtime pianists today. Some of his noted works are: \\"Hickory Smoked Rag\\" (1974), \\"Days Beyond Recall\\" (circa. 1960), and \\"Pierce City Rag\\" (circa. 1961) among many others.

Francis Dundas was the second son of Robert Dundas of Arniston and Jean Grant, and the nephew of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville and War Secretary. Military service He was commissioned into the 1st Foot Guards in 1775. He transferred to the 45th Foot in 1783 and the 1st Foot in 1787. He served in the American Revolutionary War under Cornwallis, at the Battle of Clapp's Mills, the Battle of Green Spring, and the Siege of Yorktown. In 1796, he commanded the Scots brigade (later 94th Foot) encamped at West Barns. He was succeeded by General Hill. He was ordered to the Cape in August 1796 after the first British occupation to become major-general and commander of the forces in May 1797. He first acted as governor from 21 November 1798 to 9 December 1799 and again from 20 April 1801 to 20 February 1803, when the Colony was returned to the Batavian Republic in accordance with the Treaty of Amiens signed on 27 March 1802. During his governorship the Graaff Reinet Revolt of 1798 and the Third Frontier War took place. His administration was seen to be autocratic but fair. After the Cape he held several important military appointments in Britain. He commanded the Kent division of the army collected on the south coast of England under Sir David Dundas during part of the invasion alarms of 1804-5. (Foster's Peerage under Melville) He was promoted full general on 1 January 1812 and made Colonel of the 71st (Glasgow Highland Light Infantry) Regiment of Foot from 1809 until his death in 1824.

NAAG consists of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) and glutamic acid coupled via a peptide bond. NAAG was discovered as a nervous system-specific peptide in 1965 by Curatolo and colleagues but initially disregarded as a neurotransmitter and not extensively studied. However it meets the criteria for a neurotransmitter, including being concentrated in neurons, packed in synaptic vesicles, released in a calcium-dependent manner, and hydrolyzed in the synaptic space by enzymatic activity. NAAG activates a specific receptor, the metabotropic glutamate receptor type 3. It is synthesized enzymatically from its two precursors and catabolized by NAAG peptidases in the synapse. The inhibition of the latter enzymes has potentially important therapeutic effects in animal models of several neurologic conditions and disorders. Under the INN spaglumic acid, NAAG is used as an antiallergic medication in eye drops and nasal preparations. Research history After its discovery in 1965, NAAG was disregarded as a neurotransmitter for several reasons. First, neuropeptides were not considered neurotransmitters until years later. Second, it did not seem to directly affect membrane potential, so it was classified as a metabolic intermediate. The importance of brain peptides became clearer with the discovery of endogenous opioids. Whereas the ability of NAAG to interact with NMDA receptors in a manner relevant to physiology is controversial, its primary receptor was long believed to be the mGluR3. Its interaction with the mGluR3 causes an activation of G proteins that reduce the concentration of the second messengers cAMP and cGMP in the both nerve cells and glia. This can lead to several changes in the cellular activity, including regulation of gene expression, reduction in the release of transmitter, and inhibition of long- term potentiation. Stimulation of the mGluR3 by NAAG has been, however, questioned, finding relevant glutamate contamination in commercially available NAAG. According to one publication, NAAG can be differentiated from NAA in vivo by MR spectroscopy at 3 Tesla. Biosynthesis NAAG synthetase activity mediates the biosynthesis of NAAG from glutamate and NAA, but little is known about the mechanism or regulation of this enzyme, and no NAAG synthetase activity has been isolated in cell-free preparations. Since other neuropeptides and nearly all vertebrate peptides are synthesized by post- translational processing, NAAG synthtase activity is relatively unique. As with NAA, the synthesis of NAAG is primarily restricted to neurons, although glial cells also contain and synthesize this peptide. In vitro, NAAG synthesis appears to be regulated by the availability of its precursor, NAA. In addition, during differentiation of neuroblastoma cells, it has been shown that a protein kinase A (PKA) activator will increase the quantity of NAAG, while a protein kinase C (PKC) activator will decrease its concentration. This finding suggests that PKA and PKC have opposing regulatory effects on the NAAG synthetase enzyme. Catabolism NAAG is catabolized via NAAG peptidase activity. Two enzymes with NAAG peptidase activity have been cloned, glutamate carboxypeptidase II and glutamate carboxypeptidase III. These enzymes mediate the hydrolysis of NAAG to NAA and glutamate. Their inhibition can produce therapeutic benefits. Two main types of inhibitors of this enzyme are known: compounds related to 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid (2-PMPA) and urea- based analogs of NAAG, including ZJ43, ZJ17, and ZJ11. In rat models, ZJ43 and 2-PMPA reduce perception of inflammatory and neuropathic pain when administered systemically, intracerebrally, or locally, suggesting that NAAG modulates neurotrasmission in pain circuits via mGlu3 receptors. The inhibition of NAAG hydrolysis increases the concentration of NAAG in the synaptic space analogous to the effects of SSRIs in increasing the concentration of serotonin. This elevated NAAG gives greater activation of presynaptic mGluR3 receptors, which decrease release of transmitter (glutamate) in the pain signaling pathways of the spinal cord and brain. In the case of traumatic brain injury, the injection of a NAAG peptidase inhibitor reduces neuron and astrocyte death in the hippocampus nearest the site of the injury. In a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the chronic inhibition of NAAG peptidase activity delayed the onset of ALS symptoms and slowed the progress of the neuronal death. To model schizophrenia, animals were injected with phencyclidine (PCP) and, therefore, exhibited symptoms of the disorder, such as social withdrawal and motor responses. Upon injection with ZJ43, these behaviors were decreased, suggesting that an increase in NAAG in the synapse — and its subsequent activation of mGluR3 receptors — has potential as a co-therapy for schizophrenia. In these cases, NAAG peptidase inhibition reduces the adverse effects in these disorders. Future research focuses on the role of NAAG in pain perception, brain injury, and schizophrenia while developing NAAG peptidase inhibitors with even greater ability to cross the blood–brain barrier.

The event was a part of the Futures Tour's schedule from 2002 through 2008. It took place at the Underwood Golf Complex in El Paso, Texas. The tournament was a 54-hole event, as are most Futures Tour tournaments, and included a pre-tournament pro-am event, in which local amateur golfers can play with the professional golfers from the Tour as a benefit for local charities. The benefiting charity for the El Paso Golf Classic was the Rotary Club of West El Paso Foundation. From 2003 through 2006 the tournament was known as the IOS Golf Classic, with the name sponsorship held by International Outsourcing Services, or IOS, an El Paso based data services company and the largest coupon clearinghouse for grocery store retailers' and manufacturers' coupons in the United States. On March 8, 2007, 11 persons associated with IOS, including its president and chief operating officer, were indicted on wire-fraud charges and with carrying out a scheme to defraud manufacturers that use coupons to market their products to consumers. Shortly thereafter, the Futures Tour and the El Paso tournament withdrew the name of IOS as a sponsor for the tournament and the event was renamed the El Paso Golf Classic.

The band existed as Tom Walker (lead vocals, guitar), Rich Haddad (bass, backing vocals), Chris McElroy (guitar, backing vocals) and Kevin Jahoda (drums & percussion) from 2007 to early 2012. In September 2012, Dave Drzewiecki rejoined as the band's drummer, after almost 9 years of playing in other bands. History During its early years, Friday's Child cycled between several drummers including Joe Bergamini and Dave Drzewiecki. Walker, Ippolitio, and Drzewiecki became the stable three members of the band, recording and touring throughout the northeastern US through the late 1990s and 2000-2003. The majority of the song writing was performed by Walker. Walker also formed his own record company, Honeybee Records, that released his own album and the albums of other up and coming artists in the New Jersey area. The band's first album, Boy Without A Name, was released in 1997 through Honeybee records.http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/fridayschild2 Their second album, 13, was released in 2000https://www.amazon.com/13-Fridays-Child/dp/B00003TL0E and the band's first live album, Live at the Goldhawk (recorded in Hoboken, NJ), was released in 2002.http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7145964 Throughout this time period, Friday's Child toured extensively in the New York and Boston areas, playing clubs, musical festivals, and other small venues such as Border's bookstores. In early 2003, Rick Ippolitio left the band. This, combined with a serious bout of CNS Lyme disease to Tom Walker, lead to the band's break-up. Tom Walker began work on a solo album, In A Word, in late 2003. In late 2005, Walker revived the Friday's Child trademark and a new version of In A Wordhttp://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=6917499 with Rich Haddad, Rob Grosso, and Walker's long-time mentor Don Regan.http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7145964 On July 30, 2005 Friday's Child performed a CD release concert at Luna Stage in Montclair, NJ. The concert was recorded on audio and video in a joint venture by Dragon Rider Productions and Walker's Honeybee Music, produced by Brian Jude and Tom Walker, and directed by Brian Jude. Rich Haddad produced the audio, and the video was edited by Steve Maio. The initial concept for the production was a DVD/CD called \\"Friday's Child: Live at Luna Stage.\\"http://dragonriderproductions.com/news.html After a handful of tracks were mixed and edited, they were released as \\"teasers\\" on the internet. The overwhelming response from fans made it clear that the future of the band was to turn to broadband media in order to spread their music and attract new listeners. While more videos were edited, the DVD was never released, and Friday's Child instead released the audio recordings as a studio/live album in 2007 \\"secretly\\"http://dragonriderproductions.com/news/pr20060508drpfc.html named Democracy,http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7386029 because of the ever-present T-shirt worn by Don Regan which read, \\"got democracy?\\" (parodying the \\"got milk?\\" advertisement campaign). The CD contained the live recordings combined with select re-mixed tracks from In A Word, as well as a video of the song \\"The Chasing Game.\\" An interactive section of the CD also promoted the web sites for Friday's Child, Dragon Rider Productions, a handful of sponsors and friends, as well as a new outlet for Friday's Child. The team that produced the concert video (Walker, Jude, Haddad and Maio) teamed up with entertainment lawyer Rob McNeely to form Digital Cafe Tour, a production company that creates live concert video footage of independent musicians of all genres, as well as rising comedians, made specifically for new media (web, handheld media players, cell phones, etc.), with top-quality audio and video settings. Friday's Child performed at the premiere DCT concert in June 2006http://dragonriderproductions.com/news/pr20060618dctnext.html with a return performance in July 2006http://dragonriderproductions.com/news/pr20060707dctnewvids.html at Luna Stage. A series of concerts running under DCT took place throughout the summer of 2006, which included artists Friday's Child, the Audibles, and Secret Gossip among others.http://dragonriderproductions.com/news/pr20060707dctnewvids.html DCT continued their live concert series at other venues, such as The Cutting Room, The Baggott Inn and Kenny's Castaways.http://www.digitalcafetour.com/aboutus.htm Friday's Child performed several shows in late 2006 and 2007 at the Cutting Room in New York City and officially announced percussionist Kevin Jahoda would be the fifth member of the band.http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7145964 Friday's Child returned to a foursome in June, 2007 when percussionist Rob Grosso decided to resign. Their first gig with the new line up was performed on August 23, 2007 at The Baggot Inn, as part of the first \\"DCT All-Stars\\" series. Keyboardist Keith Pied guest starred with the band for DCT's Christmas 2007 concert, with videos recorded live that the Gibson Hit Factory Showroom.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBE9k3Xv7WA In 2008, the band began performing as trio once again with Walker, Haddad and Jahoda. In early 2011, Tom Walker was afforded the opportunity to play for legendary producer, Bob Johnston, at his home in the Los Angeles area. Voted one of the top 10 music producers of all time by Rolling Stone, Mr. Johnston was responsible for the most seminal works of Bob Dylan, Simon and Garfunkel, Louie Armstrong, Johnny Cash, Leonard Cohen, Willie Nelson, Charlie Daniels, and Carl Perkins. Mr. Johnston signed on to produce Friday's Child's upcoming studio release, \\"Cue the Violins.\\" Walker, Haddad and Jahoda recruited Walker's long time friend, Chris McElroy, to play second guitar for the album. The new songs Walker has written are very rooted in various core American forms with nods to Jazz, Blues, Rockabilly, Funk, Appalachian, and Folk. Friday's Child signed on with Breedlove Acoustic Guitars and G&L; for electric guitars and basses. The new album promises to be very guitar-centric and to showcase the band's total musicianship. On July 16, 2011 Friday's Child performed live at the Breedlove, Two Old Hippies Festival in Beautiful Bend, OR.http://breedlovemusic.com/breedlove/breedlove-news/2011-breedlove-two-old- hippies-festival In May 2012, Kevin Jahoda departed Friday's Child. After several months' hiatus, the band welcomed back Dave Drzewiecki to the drum throne. They immediately tracked an album of songs not slated to be on the Bob Johnston recording and plan to release that before the end of 2012, in order to get the touring side of the band's business up and running again.

Any string of bits can be interpreted as the coefficients of a message polynomial of this sort, and to find the CRC, we multiply the message polynomial by x^n and then find the remainder when dividing by the degree-n generator polynomial. The coefficients of the remainder polynomial are the bits of the CRC. Maths In general, computation of CRC corresponds to Euclidean division of polynomials over GF(2): :M(x) \\\\cdot x^n = Q(x) \\\\cdot G(x) + R(x). Here M(x) is the original message polynomial and G(x) is the degree-n generator polynomial. The bits of M(x) \\\\cdot x^n are the original message with n zeroes added at the end. The CRC 'checksum' is formed by the coefficients of the remainder polynomial R(x) whose degree is strictly less than n. The quotient polynomial Q(x) is of no interest. Using modulo operation, it can be stated that :R(x) = M(x) \\\\cdot x^n \\\\,\\\\bmod\\\\, G(x). In communication, the sender attaches the n bits of R after the original message bits of M, which could be shown to be equivalent to sending out M(x) \\\\cdot x^n - R(x) (the codeword.) The receiver, knowing G(x) and therefore n, separates M from R and repeats the calculation, verifying that the received and computed R are equal. If they are, then the receiver assumes the received message bits are correct. In practice CRC calculations most closely resemble long division in binary, except that the subtractions involved do not borrow from more significant digits, and thus become exclusive or operations. A CRC is a checksum in a strict mathematical sense, as it can be expressed as the weighted modulo-2 sum of per-bit syndromes, but that word is generally reserved more specifically for sums computed using larger moduli, such as 10, 256, or 65535. CRCs can also be used as part of error-correcting codes, which allow not only the detection of transmission errors, but the reconstruction of the correct message. These codes are based on closely related mathematical principles. Polynomial arithmetic modulo 2 Since the coefficients are constrained to a single bit, any math operation on CRC polynomials must map the coefficients of the result to either zero or one. For example, in addition: : (x^3 + x) + (x + 1) = x^3 + 2x + 1 \\\\equiv x^3 + 1 \\\\pmod 2. Note that 2x becomes zero in the above equation because addition of coefficients is performed modulo 2: : 2x = x + x = x\\\\times(1 + 1) \\\\equiv x\\\\times0 = 0 \\\\pmod 2. Polynominal addition modulo 2 is the same as bitwise XOR. Since XOR is the inverse of itself, polynominal subtraction modulo 2 is in the same as bitwise XOR too. Multiplication is similar (a carry-less product): : (x^2 + x)(x + 1) = x^3 + 2x^2 + x \\\\equiv x^3 + x \\\\pmod 2. We can also divide polynomials mod 2 and find the quotient and remainder. For example, suppose we're dividing x^3 + x^2 + x by x + 1. We would find that : \\\\frac{x^3 + x^2 + x}{x+1} = (x^2 + 1) - \\\\frac{1}{x+1}. In other words, : (x^3 + x^2 + x) = (x^2 + 1)(x + 1) - 1 \\\\equiv (x^2 + 1)(x + 1) + 1 \\\\pmod 2. The division yields a quotient of x2 + 1 with a remainder of −1, which, since it is odd, has a last bit of 1. In the above equations, x^3 + x^2 + x represents the original message bits \`111\`, x+1 is the generator polynomial, and the remainder 1 (equivalently, x^0) is the CRC. The degree of the generator polynomial is 1, so we first multiplied the message by x^1 to get x^3 + x^2 + x. Variations There are several standard variations on CRCs, any or all of which may be used with any CRC polynomial. Implementation variations such as endianness and CRC presentation only affect the mapping of bit strings to the coefficients of M(x) and R(x), and do not impact the properties of the algorithm. *To check the CRC, instead of calculating the CRC on the message and comparing it to the CRC, a CRC calculation may be run on the entire codeword. If the result (called the residual) is zero, the check passes. This works because the codeword is M(x) \\\\cdot x^n - R(x) = Q(x) \\\\cdot G(x), which is always divisible by G(x). : This simplifies many implementations by avoiding the need to treat the last few bytes of the message specially when checking CRCs. *The shift register may be initialized with ones instead of zeroes. This is equivalent to inverting the first n bits of the message before feeding them into the algorithm. The CRC equation becomes M(x) \\\\cdot x^n + \\\\sum_{i=m}^{m+n-1} x^i = Q(x) \\\\cdot G(x) + R (x), where m > \\\\deg(M(x)) is the length of the message in bits. The change this imposes on R(x) is a function of the generating polynomial and the message length, \\\\left ( \\\\sum_{i=m}^{m+n-1} x^i \\\\right ) \\\\,\\\\bmod\\\\, G(x). : The reason this method is used is because an unmodified CRC does not distinguish between two messages which differ only in the number of leading zeroes, because leading zeroes do not affect the value of M(x). When this inversion is done, the CRC does distinguish between such messages. *The CRC may be inverted before being appended to the message stream. While an unmodified CRC distinguishes between messages M(x) with different numbers of trailing zeroes, it does not detect trailing zeroes appended after the CRC remainder itself. This is because all valid codewords are multiples of G(x), so x times that codeword is also a multiple. (In fact, this is precisely why the first variant described above works.) In practice, the last two variations are invariably used together. They change the transmitted CRC, so must be implemented at both the transmitter and the receiver. While presetting the shift register to ones is straightforward to do at both ends, inverting affects receivers implementing the first variation, because the CRC of a full codeword that already includes a CRC is no longer zero. Instead, it is a fixed non-zero pattern, the CRC of the inversion pattern of n ones. The CRC thus may be checked either by the obvious method of computing the CRC on the message, inverting it, and comparing with the CRC in the message stream, or by calculating the CRC on the entire codeword and comparing it with an expected fixed value C(x), called the check polynomial, residue or magic number. This may be computed as C(x) = \\\\left ( \\\\sum_{i=n}^{2n-1} x^i \\\\right )\\\\,\\\\bmod\\\\,G(x), or equivalently by computing the unmodified CRC of a message consisting of n ones, M(x) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x^i. These inversions are extremely common but not universally performed, even in the case of the CRC-32 or CRC-16-CCITT polynomials.

In both cases, the coefficient of x^n is omitted and understood to be 1. *The msbit-first representation is a hexadecimal number with n bits, the least significant bit of which is always 1. The most significant bit represents the coefficient of x^{n-1} and the least significant bit represents the coefficient of x^0. *The lsbit-first representation is a hexadecimal number with n bits, the most significant bit of which is always 1. The most significant bit represents the coefficient of x^0 and the least significant bit represents the coefficient of x^{n-1}. The msbit-first form is often referred to in the literature as the normal representation, while the lsbit-first is called the reversed representation. It is essential to use the correct form when implementing a CRC. If the coefficient of x^{n-1} happens to be zero, the forms can be distinguished at a glance by seeing which end has the bit set. To further confuse the matter, the paper by P. Koopman and T. Chakravarty \\\\- verification of Castagnoli's results by exhaustive search and some new good polynomials – analysis of short CRC polynomials for embedded applications converts CRC generator polynomials to hexadecimal numbers in yet another way: msbit-first, but including the x^n coefficient and omitting the x^0 coefficient. This \\"Koopman\\" representation has the advantage that the degree can be determined from the hexadecimal form and the coefficients are easy to read off in left-to-right order. However, it is not used anywhere else and is not recommended due to the risk of confusion. Reciprocal polynomials A reciprocal polynomial is created by assigning the x^i through x^0 coefficients of one polynomial to the x^0 through x^i coefficients of a new polynomial. That is, the reciprocal of the degree n polynomial G(x) is x^nG(x^{-1}). The most interesting property of reciprocal polynomials, when used in CRCs, is that they have exactly the same error-detecting strength as the polynomials they are reciprocals of. The reciprocal of a polynomial generates the same codewords, only bit reversed -- that is, if all but the first n bits of a codeword under the original polynomial are taken, reversed and used as a new message, the CRC of that message under the reciprocal polynomial equals the reverse of the first n bits of the original codeword. But the reciprocal polynomial is not the same as the original polynomial, and the CRCs generated using it are not the same (even modulo bit reversal) as those generated by the original polynomial. Error detection strength The error-detection ability of a CRC depends on the degree of its key polynomial and on the specific key polynomial used. The \\"error polynomial\\" E(x) is the symmetric difference of the received message codeword and the correct message codeword. An error will go undetected by a CRC algorithm if and only if the error polynomial is divisible by the CRC polynomial. *Because a CRC is based on division, no polynomial can detect errors consisting of a string of zeroes prepended to the data, or of missing leading zeroes. However, see Variations. *All single bit errors will be detected by any polynomial with at least two terms with non-zero coefficients. The error polynomial is x^k, and x^k is divisible only by polynomials x^i where i \\\\le k. *All two bit errors separated by a distance less than the order of the primitive polynomial which is a factor of the generator polynomial will be detected. The error polynomial in the two bit case is E(x) = x^i + x^k = x^k \\\\cdot (x^{i-k} + 1), \\\\; i > k. As noted above, the x^k term will not be divisible by the CRC polynomial, which leaves the x^{i-k} + 1 term. By definition, the smallest value of {i-k} such that a polynomial divides x^{i-k} + 1 is the polynomial's order or exponent. The polynomials with the largest order are called primitive polynomials, and for polynomials of degree n with binary coefficients, have order 2^n - 1. *All errors in an odd number of bits will be detected by a polynomial which is a multiple of x+1. This is equivalent to the polynomial having an even number of terms with non-zero coefficients. This capacity assumes that the generator polynomial is the product of x+1 and a primitive polynomial of degree n-i since all primitive polynomials except x+1 have an odd number of non-zero coefficients. *All burst errors of length n will be detected by any polynomial of degree n or greater which has a non-zero x^0 term. (As an aside, there is never reason to use a polynomial with a zero x^0 term. Recall that a CRC is the remainder of the message polynomial times x^n divided by the CRC polynomial. A polynomial with a zero x^0 term always has x as a factor. So if K(x) is the original CRC polynomial and K(x) = x \\\\cdot K'(x), then : M(x) \\\\cdot x^{n-1} = Q(x) \\\\cdot K'(x) + R(x) : M(x) \\\\cdot x^n = Q(x) \\\\cdot x \\\\cdot K'(x) + x \\\\cdot R(x) : M(x) \\\\cdot x^n = Q(x) \\\\cdot K(x) + x \\\\cdot R(x) That is, the CRC of any message with the K(x) polynomial is the same as that of the same message with the K'(x) polynomial with a zero appended. It is just a waste of a bit.) The combination of these factors means that good CRC polynomials are often primitive polynomials (which have the best 2-bit error detection) or primitive polynomials of degree n-1, multiplied by x+1 (which detects all odd numbers of bit errors, and has half the two-bit error detection ability of a primitive polynomial of degree n). Bitfilters Analysis technique using bitfilters allows one to very efficiently determine the properties of a given generator polynomial. The results are the following: # All burst errors (but one) with length no longer than the generator polynomial can be detected by any generator polynomial 1+\\\\cdots+X^n. This includes 1-bit errors (burst of length 1). The maximum length is n+1, when n is the degree of the generator polynomial (which itself has a length of n+1). The exception to this result is a bit pattern the same as that of the generator polynomial. # All uneven bit errors are detected by generator polynomials with even number of terms. # 2-bit errors in a (multiple) distance of the longest bitfilter of even parity to a generator polynomial are not detected; all others are detected. For degrees up to 32 there is an optimal generator polynomial with that degree and even number of terms; in this case the period mentioned above is 2^{n-1}-1. For n=16 this means that blocks of 32,767 bits length do not contain undiscovered 2-bit errors. For uneven number of terms in the generator polynomial there can be a period of 2^n-1; however, these generator polynomials (with odd number of terms) do not discover all odd number of errors, so they should be avoided. A list of the corresponding generators with even number of terms can be found in the link mentioned at the beginning of this section. # All single bit errors within the bitfilter period mentioned above (for even terms in the generator polynomial) can be identified uniquely by their residual. So CRC method can be used to correct single-bit errors as well (within those limits, e.g. 32,767 bits with optimal generator polynomials of degree 16). Since all odd errors leave an odd residual, all even an even residual, 1-bit errors and 2-bit errors can be distinguished. However, like other SECDED techniques, CRCs cannot always distinguish between 1-bit errors and 3-bit errors. When 3 or more bit errors occur in a block, CRC bit error correction will be erroneous itself and produce more errors.

History García's interest in music started around the age of five. The Spanish guitar, as well as the keyboard, were the instruments he first learned to play. Although his education was centered on classic authors, Roberto had been very interested since his adolescence in bands such as Metallica, Accept and Judas Priest. In 1997, García asked his friend Alberto Rionda, from Avalanch, to give him guitar classes, and in that manner he became part of the band. He played on four Avalanch albums, La Llama Eterna, Llanto De Un Héroe, Días De Gloria and El Ángel Caído. After personal and professional problems with Alberto Rionda, Garcia left Avalanch. In 2004, he joined the band WarCry, which had been formed by friends Víctor García and Alberto Ardines. This Roberto Garcia should not be confused with the lead singer and guitarist of RAID, Fat Ming, and more recently Bloodknife (born 1990, Cambridge, MA), most famous for his quote when he was still a young child, who when pressed by his father to befriend an African-American altar boy, responded \\"But Papa, I don't like a black boy.\\" Discography Avalanch * 1997 — La Llama Eterna * 1999 — Llanto De Un Héroe * 2000 — Días De Gloria (live) * 2001 — El Ángel Caído WarCry * 2005 — ¿Dónde Está La Luz? * 2006 — Directo A La Luz (live) * 2006 — La Quinta Esencia * 2008 — Revolución * 2011 — Alfa * 2012 — Omega (live) * 2013 — Inmortal On tributes * 1999 — Transilvania 666 (Iron Maiden) * 2000 — The Attack of the Dragons (Queen) * 2000 — Metal Gods (Judas Priest) Collaborations *Indiceission (Human) (2003) References Category:WarCry (band) members Category:Asturian musicians Category:People from Oviedo Category:Spanish heavy metal musicians Category:Living people Category:1972 births Category:Avalanch members ","title":"Roberto García (bassist)"},{"id":"10972867","text":"The Applied Physics Laboratory Ice Station 2007 (APLIS07) is a U.S. and Japanese laboratory dedicated to the study of global climate change, located about south of the Arctic Circle, Alaska on the West Ridge of the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus.

The church is in the Diocese of Salisbury in the Church of England, and part of the Anglican Communion. Anglo Saxon stone There is believed to have been a Christian presence in the area since Anglo-Saxon days, evidence being a stone with a complicated interlaced pattern, now in the church, which is believed to be the remains of a 9th- century cross – either a preaching cross or a grave marker. But most of the current building, particularly the nave, dates from an early Victorian rebuild. The chancel (choir and sanctuary) however, is older; the five great pointed windows with their trefoil heads, which stand on the south side of the chancel, show that it was built in the Decorated Gothic style popular in the 14th century. On the north wall of the chancel, only two feet above the floor, can be seen the archway of an Easter Sepulchre. Bench ends include the grotesque Some bench ends, a screen at the east end of the north aisle, and the font, are in the Perpendicular Gothic style of the 15th and 16th centuries. The Chapel of the Good Shepherd was given by Mr and Mrs Carlton Cross in memory of their son who was killed in France during the First World War while carrying in some of the wounded men from his regiment. W. D. Caroe, the architect who designed the chapel, went on to create many other fine works, including the east end of the Lady Chapel in Sherborne Abbey. Reredos behind the high altar The reredos beneath the east window in the main chancel is another reminder of the tragedy of the First World War. It was given in 1925 by Mr and Mrs Matthews of Wyke House in memory of two of their sons who were both killed in the war. Further examples of the work of Nathaniel Hitch (1846–1938), the sculptor responsible for the reredos, may be seen in Westminster Abbey and Truro and Bristol Cathedrals. Memorials to those who died in the First World War can be seen hanging above the Jacobean communion table in St. Catherine’s Chapel. The Book of Remembrance nearby records all those who served in the two world wars and also those who died. St. Mary's is still being enhanced as it has been over the centuries for the needs of the current worshipping community.

The video begins with the claim that Jesus Christ and Joseph Smith were \\"two of the world's most prominent and influential men.\\" It then presents what it claims to be the teachings of Joseph Smith and contrasts them to what it claims to be the teachings of Jesus Christ. A question is raised regarding whether the movements which the video classifies as \\"Christianity\\" and \\"Mormonism\\" are compatible, despite the claim by both that \\"Jesus is the Christ.\\" The video takes portions of the Book of Mormon and compares it to the Bible. The video implies that people must follow Jesus or Joseph Smith but cannot follow both. Distribution The production of the DVD was funded by \\"an ex-Mormon businessman who financed the project by selling stock in his company.\\" The video was distributed by many groups, one of which was called Concerned Christians, Inc.: the same group that initially distributed the film The God Makers in 1982. The producers claim that the video was made out of love for the Mormon people.The purpose of The God Makers, according to Concerned Christians, was also “to reach out in love to those lost in Mormonism.” See . The video distributed around 500,000 videos in Utah and 5,000 in the Palmyra New York region. A letter of instruction was included with copies of the DVD to those that were to perform the initial door-to-door distribution, several days before the 177th Annual General Conference of the church that was held on March 31 and April 1, 2007: > This video is to be viewed by CHRISTIANS ONLY until AFTER the nation-wide > distribution which is scheduled for March 25, 2007.

Why such extreme caution? > If the leadership of the Mormon cult learns of our plans, they will publicly > instruct their people not to watch the video and many Mormons will blindly > obey.Letter of Instruction to Distributors The letter goes on to say that the \\"Mormon Church is vulnerable.

(assuming that members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints don't already have a relationship with Jesus).\\" Letter of Instruction to Distributors with commentary Content Nature of God and Jesus Christ Dr. Phil Roberts (President, Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary), claims that the \\"Jesus of Mormonism\\" is different than the \\"Jesus of the Bible.\\" Roberts claims that Mormons believe that God became a god \\"by adherence to a system of Mormonism in a previous world in a previous life.\\"The same claim is made in the 1982 film The God Makers, \\"Through obedience to Mormon teaching and death and resurrection, he proved himself worthy, and was elevated to godhood.\\" Dr. John Whitcomb (Theology Professor, Old Testament Scholar), quotes and interprets passages from the Bible to support this claim. Referring to Paul's statement in 1 Corinthians 8:4 about \\"many gods and many lords,\\" Whitcomb points to his head and states that \\"the Bible says through the Apostle Paul they’re only in here.\\" Dave Hunt (Author and Founder, The Berean Call Ministries) states that the serpent in the Garden of Eden promised Eve that \\"she could become a god.\\"Genesis 3:4-5, \\"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\\" Hunt continues by claiming that Brigham Young said that \\"the devil told the truth.\\" Young states, \\"Now for mother Eve. The evil principle always has and always will exist. Well, a certain character came along, and said to Mother Eve, 'The Lord has told you that you must not do so and so, for if you do you shall surely die. But I tell you that if you do not do this you will never know good from evil, your eyes will never be opened, and you may live on the earth forever and ever, and you will never know what the Gods know.' The devil told the truth, what is the mystery about it? He is doing it today. He is telling one or two truths and mixing them with a thousand errors to get the people to swallow them. I do not blame Mother Eve, I would not have had her miss eating the forbidden fruit for anything in the world.\\" Charles Larson (Historian, Author) claims that the Book of Abraham, one of the Mormon standard works of scripture, authorizes lying by God, and states that the account of Abraham claiming that his wife was his sister, \\"is similar to the Bible version only in the book of Abraham god is telling Abraham to lie.\\"Abraham 2:22-24, \\"And it came to pass when I was come near to enter into Egypt, the Lord said unto me: Behold, Sarai, thy wife, is a very fair woman to look upon; Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see her, they will say—She is his wife; and they will kill you, but they will save her alive; therefore see that ye do on this wise: Let her say unto the Egyptians, she is thy sister, and thy soul shall live.\\"; Genesis 12:11-13, \\"And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.\\" President Gordon B. Hinckley, President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is misquotedThis misquote was acknowledged in a post production amendment as saying, \\"No I don't believe in the traditional Christ. The traditional Christ of whom they speak is not the Christ of whom I speak, for the Christ of whom I speak has been revealed in this, the dispensation of the fullness of times.\\"Church News, June 20, 1998, p.7. The correct quote is, \\"No I don't. The traditional Christ of whom they speak is not the Christ of whom I speak. For the Christ of whom I speak has been revealed in this the dispensation of the fullness of times.\\" Character of Joseph Smith A quote from the Bible (Ephesians 2:8-9) regarding boasting is juxtaposed with a quote from Joseph Smith in which he claims to boast.Smith had quoted 2 Cor. 11:16-18 in which Paul states, “I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.”; History of the Church, Vol. 6, pp=408–409, “President Joseph Smith read the 11th Chap. 2 Corinthians. My object is to let you know that I am right here on the spot where I intend to stay. I, like Paul, have been in perils, and oftener than anyone in this generation. As Paul boasted, I have suffered more than Paul did. I should be like a fish out of water, if I were out of persecutions…God is in the still small voice. In all these affidavits, indictments, it is all of the devil—all corruption. Come on! ye prosecutors! ye false swearers! All hell, boil over! Ye burning mountains, roll down your lava! for I will come out on the top at last. I have more to boast of than ever any man had. I am the only man that has ever been able to keep a whole church together since the days of Adam. A large majority of the whole have stood by me. Neither Paul, John, Peter, nor Jesus ever did it. I boast that no man ever did such a work as I. The followers of Jesus ran away from Him; but the Latter-day Saints never ran away from me yet. You know my daily walk and conversation. I am in the bosom of a virtuous and good people. How I do love to hear the wolves howl! When they can get rid of me, the devil will also go.” The narrator repeats a portion of a quote from Brigham Young, in which he claims that “no man or woman in this dispensation will ever enter the celestial kingdom of god without the consent of Joseph Smith.”. The same claim is made in the 1982 film The God Makers, which states, \\"The Mormons teach that everyone must stand at the final judgment before Joseph Smith, the Mormon Jesus, and Elohim.\\" It is claimed that Mormons believe that their \\"godhood rests on the act of polygamy”, based upon a portion of a quote made by Brigham Young in 1866: “The only men who become Gods, even the sons of God, are those who enter into polygamy.” Young states, “…if you have in your hearts to say…”we will not, therefore, be polygamists lest we should fail in obtaining some earthly honor, character and office, etc,\\"-the man that has that in his heart, and will continue to persist in pursuing that policy, will come short of dwelling in the presence of the Father and the Son, in celestial glory. The only men who become Gods, even the Sons of God, are those who enter into polygamy. Others attain unto a glory and may even be permitted to come into the presence of the Father and the Son; but they cannot reign as kings in glory, because they had blessing offered unto them, and they refused to accept them.”; Ed Decker uses the same quote by Brigham Young in The God Makers II. First Vision It is stated that nine different versions of Joseph Smith's first vision were recorded.Four of the accounts listed are actually a description of the visit of the Angel Moroni rather than the \\"first vision\\" in the grove. In addition to the accounts listed in the video, there are 11 additional accounts of the first vision listed by FAIR. The on-screen list includes both accounts of the first vision that is claimed to have occurred in the Sacred Grove and several accounts of the visit of an angel in Smith's bedroom. The onscreen list shows the following accounts: #1827 – A spirit appears to Joseph telling him of a record on gold plates at age 17.Third-hand account of the visit of the angel Moroni to Joseph Smith given by Willard Chase, who claimed to have heard if from Smith’s father, Joseph Smith Sr. (See Mormonism Unvailed), Affidavit of Willard Chase. “In the month of June, 1827, Joseph Smith, Sen., related to me the following story: ‘That some years ago, a spirit had appeared to Joseph his son, in a vision, and informed him that in a certain place there was a record on plates of gold, and that he was the person that must obtain them, and this he must do in the following manner…’” #1827 – An angel appears to Joseph telling him he has been chosen to be a prophet and bring forth a record on gold plates at age 18.Third-hand account of the visit of the angel Moroni from the Rev. John Clark’s recollections of an interview with Martin Harris. (John Clark, Gleanings by the Way, 1842, p. 225) Clark states, “I have been able to recall several particulars that had quite glided from my memory.…According to Martin Harris, it was after one of these night excursions, that Jo, while he lay upon his bed, had a remarkable dream. An angel of God seemed to approach him, clad in celestial splendor. This divine messenger assured him that he, Joseph Smith, was chosen of the Lord to be a prophet of the Most High God, and to bring to light hidden things, that would prove of unspeakable benefit to the world. He then disclosed to him the existence of this golden Bible, and the place where it was deposited...\\" #1830 – An angel tells Joseph where to find a secret treasure. Joseph returns once a year for several years before obtaining the plates.Second-hand account of the visit of the angel Moroni from Peter Bauder’s recollection of an interview with Smith (Peter Bauder,The Kingdom and the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 1834, pp. 36-38) Bauder recalls that, “…an angel told him he must go to a certain place in the town of Manchester, Ontario County, where was a secret treasure concealed, which he must reveal to the human family. He went, and after the third or fourth time, which was repeated once a year, he obtained a parcel of plate resembling gold…” #1832 – Jesus Christ appears to Joseph at age 15. First-hand account of the earliest known writing by Joseph Smith concerning the “first vision.” Both the first vision in the grove and later visit by the Angel Moroni are recorded: “…while in attitude of calling upon the Lord a piller of fire light above the brightness of the sun at noon day come down from above and rested upon me and I was filled with the spirit of god and the opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord and he spake unto me saying Joseph thy sins are forgiven thee. go thy walk in my statutes and keep my commandments behold I am the Lord of glory I was crucifyed for the world that all those who believe on my name may have Eternal life the world lieth in sin and at this time and none doeth good no not one they have turned aside from the gospel and keep not commandments they draw near to me with their lips while their hearts are far from me…and it came to pass when I was seventeen years of age I called again upon the Lord and he shewed unto me a heavenly vision for behold an angel of the Lord came and stood before me and it was by night and he called me by name and he said the Lord had forgiven me my sins and he revealed unto me that in the Town of Manchester Ontario County N.Y. there was plates of gold upon which there was engravings which was engraven by Maroni… #1834 – Angel appears to Joseph in his bedroom at age 17.Account of the visit of angel Moroni, written by Oliver Cowdery and published in the October 1835 edition of the Latter-day Saint periodical Messenger and Advocate. #1835 – Two personages appear to Joseph in grove at age 14.Recorded by Warren Parrish. This was recorded in an interview between Joseph Smith and Robert Matthias, and describes the first vision with two personages, “many angels” in addition, and the visit by an angel at age 17. “…a pillar of fire appeared above my head, it presently rested down upon me head, and filled me with Joy unspeakable, a personage appeard in the midst of this pillar of flame which was spread all around, and yet nothing consumed, another personage soon appeard like unto the first, he said unto me thy sins are forgiven thee, he testifyed unto me that Jesus Christ is the Son of God; I was about 14 years old when I received this first communication; When I was about 17 years old I saw another vision of angels in the night season after I had retired to bed.” #1835 – Many angels appear to Joseph in grove at age 14. In an interview with Erastus Holmes, Warren Parrish recorded that Smith stated, “I received the first visitation of Angels which was when I was about 14 years old and also the visitations that I received afterward, concerning the book of Mormon…” #1838 – God the Father and Jesus appear to Joseph in grove at age 14. #1844 – Two unidentified personages appear to Joseph at age 14.1844 book on religions in the United States by I. Daniel Rupp The narrator claims that Brigham Young “denied that the Lord came to Joseph Smith in the first vision.” Several sentences from a speech given by Brigham Young are shown which state, “The Lord did not come…but He did send His angel to this same obscure person, Joseph Smith…and informed him that he should not join any religious sects of the day…”The edited version of the quote used in the video can be found in Sandra Tanner’s book, Mormonism: Shadow or Reality (). The source quote found in Journal of Discourses () states, “The Lord did not come with the armies of heaven, in power and great glory, nor send His messengers panoplied with aught else than the truth of heaven, to communicate to the meek, the lowly, the youth of humble origin, the sincere enquirer after the knowledge [knowledge] of God. But He did send His angel to this same obscure person, Joseph Smith jun., who afterwards became a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator, and informed him that he should not join any of the religious sects of the day, for they were all wrong.” Archaeology The narrator states that because Joseph Smith's writings are now over 150 years old, that they should be “easily validated by historical and archaeological evidences.” A 1969 quote by BYU professor Dee Green is referenced in which he “confesses” that “No book of Mormon location is known.” It is stated that “not even one coin” has been found, and that coins were mentioned as “being common in Joseph’s writings.” Joel Kramer (Director, Living Hope Ministries) relates that his group went to the Middle East and Central America and talked to experts in archaeology and anthropology. Kramer states that “in all cases” that they found the “historical reliability” of the Bible and that for the Book of Mormon it was “non-existent.” Floyd McElveen (Author and Lifetime Evangelist) adds that “Joseph Smith claimed there were huge cites – thirty eight cities in the Americas,” but that “not one single city has ever been dug up.” McElveen is the author of the book The Mormon Illusion, and also appears in The God Makers. McElveen adds, “would you want to base your eternity on something that is totally unknown?” Sandra Tanner (President, Utah Lighthouse Ministry) notes that the LDS Church will not “commit itself” to a specific map of Book of Mormon lands. Prophecies Joseph Smith is claimed to have described “the inhabitants of the moon as being about six-foot tall, dressed like Quakers, and living to be about 1000 years old.”Young Women’s Journal, vol. 3, pg 263-264, Patriarchal Blessings Books 9:294-295 The narrator adds that “Since Neil Armstrong’s walk on the moon in 1969, we now know there are no Quaker looking people on the moon.” In addition, Brigham Young thought that the sun was also inhabited.. “So it is with regard to the inhabitants of the sun. Do you think it is inhabited? I rather think it is. Do you think there is any life there? No question of it; it was not made in vain. It was made to give light to those who dwell upon it, and to other planets; and so will this earth when it is celestialized. Every planet in its first rude, organic state receives not the glory of God upon it, but is opaque; but when celestialized, every planet that God brings into existence is a body of light, but not till then.” Occult The video notes that on March 15, 1842, Joseph Smith joined the Masons, which is claimed by the narrator to be “an organization that believes that Jesus is not divine.” It is further claimed that certain Mormon practices and architecture have “Masonic overtones.” The video cites comments made by LDS historian Dr. Reed Durham regarding an item referred to as the “Jupiter Talisman,\\" which is said to have been owned by Joseph Smith. The narrator refers to this as an \\"occultic\\" item whose “talismatic magic” is said to bring riches, power and women to its possessor.The same claims regarding the \\"Jupiter Talisman\\" are made by Ed Decker in the film The God Makers II. The narrator claims that the talisman was “found in Joseph’s pocket the day he died in Carthage.”Dr. Durham responded to this claim in the 1994 book The Truth About \\"The God Makers\\" (). Durham states, “I find no primary evidence that Joseph Smith ever possessed a Jupiter talisman. The source for my comment was a second-hand, late source. It came from Wilford Wood, who was told it by Charlie Bidaman, who was told it by his father, Lewis Bidaman, who was Emma's second husband and a non-Mormon not too friendly to the LDS Church. So, the idea that the Prophet had such a talisman is highly questionable!\\" The video includes a segment copied from the 1982 film The God Makers, which shows what it claims to be a re-enactment of Mormon temple rituals. Translator The narrator states that Joseph Smith “boasted the bold claim” that the Book of Mormon was the “most accurate book in existence.”. Smith’s statement was, \\"I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.\\" Response The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints responded with a news release, part of which stated, > \\"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has weathered such attacks > throughout its history. At a time when the Church is growing strongly > throughout the world, it’s not surprising that some groups try to curb that > growth in such ways.\\" The Anti-Defamation League, an advocacy group which fights anti-Semitism, condemned the video as \\"nothing more than 'Mormon bashing'.\\" Bill Straus, Regional Director of the Anti-Defamation League, stated, > \\"This is the same kind of plain, old-fashioned Mormon-bashing that Jim > Robertson and his group have been spewing for over a quarter-of-a-century. > The only difference is that back then, it was the film, 'The God Makers,' > and today it's the DVD, 'Jesus Christ/Joseph Smith.' It was wrong then, and > it's wrong now.\\" The LDS Church noted in its news release that, \\"The Jewish Anti-Defamation League in Phoenix promptly condemned the distribution, saying that 'hate directed at any of us is hate directed at all of us.'\\" Bill McKeever, Director of an organization called the Mormonism Research Ministry, sent a letter to the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints protesting what he called the church's \\"tacit approval\\" of the Anti-Defamation League's condemnation of the video. McKeever states, \\"I wish to express my indignation at your church’s tacit approval of the Anti-Defamation League's accusation of hatred towards Christians who were involved in a recent DVD distribution. It is one thing to disagree with the content of the DVD, but it is quite another to accuse them of being motivated by hate.\\" He concludes by stating, \\"With all the talk of repentance at your last conference, I think you need to lead by example and offer an apology to the thousands of Christians you have offended with this false accusation.\\" McKeever followed up on this letter with an article posted in the Christian Examiner Online, in which he claimed that the \\"Mormon Church went into one of its most hypocritical frenzies in modern times.\\" Claiming that the media in Utah is \\"either owned by the LDS Church or is sympathetic to it,\\" McKeever claimed that \\"[t]alk show hosts did their best to stir up their listeners against the 'religious bigots' who dared come onto 'our property' with their 'message of hate.'\\" The Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research (FAIR), a non-profit organization specializing in Mormon apologetics, produced a point-by-point rebuttal of inaccuracies and exaggerations in the video.

It operated from 1847 until the demolition of its buildings and sale of its site in 1960. Early history In 1841 the New South Wales government (which administrated the colony of Victoria) called for the election of 'Commissioners' for a future market in Melbourne. In 1846 three sites were gazetted for this purpose: *11 acres for a cattle market *a one-acre site for a 'general market' (the Western Market on a block on the corner of William and Collins streets) *a two-acre site for a 'general market' (the Eastern Market on a block on the corner of Bourke and Stephen – later Exhibition – streets). The two smaller markets can be seen in Frederick Proeschel's 1853 'Mercantile' map of Melbourne with the annotation showing the Eastern Market had sections for hay, straw and fruit and housed a gaol on its south-eastern corner (presumably the 'old female gaol, situated within the market area' referred to during redevelopment in 1859). In a discussion at the Melbourne Town Council it was stated that 'between 1 September 1848 and 31 August 1849' income and expenses for the three markets were: *Cattle Market – receipts £937 13s 1½d, expenses £168, 18 per cent *Eastern Market – receipts £370 12s 8d, expenses £78, 20 per cent *Western Market – receipts £275 2s 1d, expenses £78, 30 per cent Despite the Western Market appearing to be the least profitable of the three, at a Council meeting the following month, Alderman Johnston argued 'the Eastern Market was a losing concern and...would most assuredly fall'. While this didn't eventuate supporters of the two general markets ensured there was lively debate about the future of both into the 1850s. In 1871 a writer for The Australasian recalled the early years of the market in less than flattering terms: > \\"\\"It was originally a dreary waste with an ugly looking gaol shrinking away > in the farthest corner of it, as if ashamed both of its purpose and of its > appearance. Then hawkers, miscellaneous dealers, and houseless new arrivals > pitched their tents upon it, and spread their motley merchandise along the > edge of the footpath to allure the attention of passers-by. One summer > morning as I turned out of Spring-street into Bourke-street I saw a whiff of > flame spring from one of the tents and flash from end to end with > inconceivable rapidity. It is no exaggeration to say that by the time I > reached Stephen-street the encampment was a heap of ruins, and the owners of > the tents were surveying their blackened ite with such a look of incredulity > and amazement that there was quite as much of the ludicrous as of the > pathetic in the incident. After this, I think, no more tents were suffered > to be erected; but hay and corn factors set up their sentry-boxes on the > scene of the fire; and then stall keepers were permitted to utilise the > vacant ground; and there might be found the strangest assortment of damaged > provisions to be met with outside of the New Cut, the Whitechapel-road or > the High-street, Shoreditch. There were cheeses strong enough to waft their > odour to Carlton, dried fruits that had been honeycombed by insects, salt > fish of perdurable toughness, tins of jam and bottles of pickles with the > shabbiest of anonymous labels, sides of bacon of wonderful antiquity, and a > conglomerate of so-called dates which appeared to have been cemented > together with paste blacking. Who bought those things? And, oh! by whom were > they consumed? Sometimes I fancy that the vendors, finding no market for > such unconsidered trifles, were driven to consume them themselves, and so > perished miserably.\\" 1850s & 1860s Descriptions of the Eastern Market from 1854 mention 'wooden buildings' erected 'for a temporary period under peculiar circumstances' and 'a gigantic wooden structure, a tunnel over the new weigh-bridge' which had 'a most frightful and enormous steep roof'. Nicholas Chevalier's 1862 wood engraving shows a crowd of people socialising in the market forecourt at night. While an 1864 hand colored lithograph by James Buckingham Philip titled 'The Eastern Market From The Top Of Whittington Tavern' sets the daytime scene with commercial activity around the four large markets sheds. During the construction of the sheds ('210 feet long and 40 feet broad...substantially built and roofed with corrugated iron') The Argus described the Eastern Market's facilities and operation: > \\"These sheds... are divided longitudinally into three compartments, the > centre one, slightly raised, being devoted solely to purchasers. Into the > side compartments, subdivided laterally by the supporting columns and > numbered, market-carts will be backed, each subdivision holding two. The > regular occupants of these will be the market-gardeners, who now pursue > their avocation in the streets, much to the inconvenience of passengers > whose business is other than the purchase of family comestibles. There is at > present accommodation in the new market for 198 carts. At 9 o'clock in the > morning the salesmen will be supposed to have finished their business, for > the sheds must be cleared before half-past 9. On Wednesdays and Saturdays > the hay markets will be held up to 2 o'clock on each day. On Saturday > evenings, shortly after dusk, the whole of the sheds will be occupied by a > guerrilla body of traders, who each pay a shilling per night for a standing > 7½ feet wide.' It was also mentioned that application had been made to the Government for the recently vacated women's gaol building in the south-east corner of the block and that it was hoped 'at some future period, when finances are more flourishing than at present' the bricks from the gaol, and the redevelopment, would be used 'to build a row of shops, which are to face forward' onto Exhibition street. Two years later and the Eastern Market, wrote The Argus, was called 'our Covent Garden' (a reference to the famous market at Covent Garden in London established by the Duke of Bedford in the 1600s). Produce arrived from the 'many acres of land, within an easy distance of the city' that were: > 'under cultivation by market gardners – at Moorabbin, Dandenong, the Plenty, > Victoria, Heidelberg, Northcote, Merri Creek, Kew, Hawthorn, Richmond and > Keilor. Our market site is within one-fourth as extensive a site as Covent > Garden and when, as on a brisk market morning, it is attended by 700 drays > loaded with produce, it affords a pleasureable surprise to any visitor who > was previously unaware that a market of like pretentions was to be found in > Melbourne. Some details of the quantities of the principal items may not be > uninteresting... In the season about 1,200 loads of vegetables come into the > market weekly (about seven or eight hundred weight each), consisting of > every variety of vegetables known to Europeans, and the greater part of them > in greater perfection than in the London markets; 500 geese and turkeys, > 1,000 ducks and fowl, 1,000 dozen eggs, 100 suckling pigs, with an > altogether unascertained but very appreciable number of rabbits, wild fowl, > guinea fowl, pigeons, &c.; nearly half a ton of fresh butter is sold here > every week, and honey in considerable quantities is brought through this > channel before the public.\\" The availability of such a large public space also saw the establishment of the Eastern Market 'as a people's forum, the site of open-air services, meetings, lectures and political demonstrations'. After the extension of voting rights to all white men in 1858 a meeting was held there to lobby for an extension of time for voter registration before the next election. And 'between 5,000 and 6,000 persons' attended an 1860 meeting to debate laws that would open up Crown Land for selection. 1870 to 1899 In 1870, and again in March 1871, tenders were called for the design of new market buildings but it wasn't until January 1877 that architects Reed and Barnes were commissioned. In March 1877 tenders for construction were called with the bid from Messers. Nation and Co. accepted shortly after at a contract price of £77,223 13s for an estimated 18 months work. Eastern Market, Bourke St East (ca. 1876-1894) State Library Victoria, H2008.59/4 The new Eastern Market building was described in great detail by the Australasian Sketcher starting with its 'under floor...and extensive cellaring' (including 'a fountain to enable stall-holders to wash their vegetables'), 'the upper floor, or market proper' with space for 'enclosed stalls, 53 in number' and bordering this, on two sides, double-story shop rows facing onto Bourke and Stephen streets. They add 'The buildings are not lovely to look upon, but they are useful' and 'A commodious market, with ample accommodation for buyers and sellers, has long been wanted.' Engravings from the period show the exterior shop rows, the curved roof and pillars of the interior market space and an artist's impression of Saturday night scenes. However, within a year of the new building's opening, it appeared that traders and customers who moved their business to Queen Victoria Market during the Eastern Market's lengthy redevelopment were not returning: > \\"The handsome building erected by the City Corporation, known as the Eastern > market, does not appear up to the present time to have answered the purpose > for which it was intended. The market gardeners will not come there, but > still prefer to go to the Victoria Market, and the tenants of the stalls > inside the building complain that they are doing so little business that > they cannot pay their rents. This complaint is certainly borne out by the > appearance of things, for out of the 51 stalls round the sides of the > building, no less than 24 are vacant, and during the day not more than a > dozen persons are to be seen in the building.\\" A letter to the editor of The Argus in February 1881 made the assertion that 'the market traffic should never have been removed' to the Queen Victoria Market and that the decision to do so 'was the result of a deep-laid scheme of log-rolling at the expense of the ratepayers'. The only redress, they argued, was 'that the Victoria Market, being now a wholesale market only, shall be strictly prohibited from any retail transactions whatever, and shall be closed punctually at 8am, at which hour all wholesale trade is finished.' The editorial response in the same edition suggested that design of the 'new' building was at fault: > \\"What with outside shops and inside stalls, the proper area of the Eastern > Market place has been so curtailed that carts cannot be allowed to occupy > stands therein. In designing it, the idea was that they would enter, deposit > their loads, and then pass out. Market gardeners, however, refused to fall > in with this arrangement. They dislike unpacking articles which may be sold > for delivery elsewhere, and they refuse to recognise the reasonableness of > asking them to employ men and boys to take their carts and horses into the > open streets, there to stand exposed to wind, rain, and the elements > generally, until business is over. We venture to think that if the > Corporation is intent on restoring the Eastern Market site to popularity, it > will have to abolish a large number of the interior stalls, and make what > provision it can for carts and those who wish to sell from them.\\" However, by April of that year, with no resolution to the issue of the two markets, even The Argus was airing its doubts: > \\"When we call to mind what has been done, the influences which have been, > and doubtless are still, at work, and when we find gentlemen intimately > acquainted with corporation matters evidently suspicious as to the > intentions of those immediately concerned in dealing with the market places, > we may be forgiven if we assume that there is something going on that does > not meet the public eye.\\" The Eastern Market saw the arrival of electric light in July 1881 and the novelty of Saturday night opening was still evident from the account of an interstate visitor in 1884 but its role as the premier fresh food location appeared to have been permanently surrendered to the expanding Queen Victoria Market. In the 1890s there was little positive news. A fire in the electrical wiring, another fire at the 'Federal Hat Company', an accidental shooting, a suicide, a workman falling 60 feet to the ground through a skylight and, finally, in April 1899, a multiple murder. 1900s A coloured postcard from early in the new century shows the shop row of the Eastern Market on Bourke Street with a horse-drawn carriage sharing the road way with a cable tram. Inside the imposing facade the decline continued. In 1904 the City Council attempted to turn around the fortunes of the site by managing the premises directly (rather than subcontracting) but 'an increase in revenue... failed to be realised' In 1913, as various plans for profitability were discussed by the City Council, The Argus wrote: \\"Thirty-four years ago the Eastern Market buildings, at the corner of Bourke-street and Exhibition street, were erected by the City Council. Almost ever since that time the conduct of the market has been a problem that has perplexed the councilors who have formed the committee that has to deal with it.\\" By January 1933, with the exception of the main hall being used as a 'motor garage', little had changed and the same paper wrote of the Market's 'faded glory'. The Eastern Market's final decades had a 'sideshow raffishness' with 'fortune tellers, test-your-strength machines, electric-shock therapists, tattoo artists, taxidermists and bric-a-brac dealers were among the last ghosts to desert it in the 20th century'. The building was demolished in 1960 and the Southern Cross Hotel was built on the site. The 'Turret Clock' made by Thomas Gaunt and installed in the building in 1879 was donated by the City Council to Museum Victoria in 1961 The building's foundation stone and an accompanying time capsule were installed in the new hotel development.

He is also the former head men's basketball coach at Florida International University in Miami, Florida. Rouco is in his first season as an assistant coach for APSU’s men’s basketball team. A former Division I head coach and 25-year veteran in the coaching ranks at many levels, Rouco came to USF after spending the previous three seasons as an assistant coach at Ole Miss. In 2012-13, Rouco helped lead a Rebel revival as Ole Miss claimed its second SEC Tournament title, won a school record-tying 27 games and earned its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2002. He also helped coach a Rebel offense that led the league in scoring for the first time in school history. Rouco helped mentor Marshall Henderson to SEC Player of the Year honors, Murphy Holloway to the All-SEC first team and Reginald Buckner to the SEC All- Defensive Team. In his first season with Ole Miss, Rouco helped the Rebels win 20 games and earn an NIT bid. Long known for his ability to coach defense, Ole Miss became one of the SEC's stingiest squads in 2011-12, ranking third in the league in field-goal percentage defense (.405), while Buckner was named to the SEC All-Defensive Team. Prior to Ole Miss, Rouco was the head coach at FIU in his hometown of Miami, Fla. and led the Panthers to a 55-94 overall record. In his first season at the helm, Rouco guided FIU to the semifinal game of the Sun Belt Conference Championships, the longest postseason run for the program since 1998. He mentored four players to All-Sun Belt Conference status, including two-time honorees Ivan Almonte and Alex Galindo. Freddy Asprilla was the 2009 SBC Freshman of the Year. Rouco began his college coaching career as an assistant at FIU from 1987-91, including one season under former Ole Miss head coach Bob Weltlich. Rouco returned to FIU as an assistant from 2000-03 before being hired by Billy Gillispie as an assistant at UTEP for the 2003-04 season. Rouco was credited for much of the team's success in his one season at UTEP, which saw the Miners win 24 games and advance to the NCAA Tournament. Born in Cuba and raised in Miami, Fla., Rouco found much success as a high school coach in his hometown, with head coaching stops at Loyola (1986-87) and Miami Norland (1991-95). He directed Loyola to a school-record 22 wins in 1986, while he led Miami Norland to 29 wins and a No. 1 state ranking for a portion of the 1994-95 season. He boasts head coaching experience at the professional level for Club Mauricio Baez (1995) and Los Minas (1996) in the Dominican Republic, helping both squads reach the semifinals of the playoffs. In 1996-97, he was the head coach of the Trotamundos de Carabobo in Venezuela, and he returned to that country in 2010 to coach the Marinos de Anzoategui. He also spent three years as an associate director at the Boys & Girls Club of Miami, where his duties included supervising athletic programs, 30 employees and 8,000 youth, as well as spearheading fund-raising efforts and payroll budgeting. A 1987 graduate of Nova Southeastern with an education degree, Rouco and his wife, Kelly, have two sons - Sergio Alessandro and Fabian.

Critical reception The New York Times concluded \\"Mr. Losey said the producer ruined it by cutting. The rejoinder is: He didn't cut it enough\\"; while in a similarly unfavourable review, Dennis Schwartz opined \\"The story itself is the film's main problem, because it is so unsettling and perverse.

He spent his entire career on The Times and was an author of political theory, memoirs and autobiography.  Early life  Heren was born in the East End of London. His father, a printer on The Times, died when Heren was four years old. As it was a paternalistic company in those days, Heren was able to leave school at 14 to begin work as a messenger on the newspaper. He moved up to work in various departments before the onset of the Second World War. He joined the British Army as a private soldier in 1939. After being commissioned, he served in France, the Western Desert, Burma and the Netherlands East Indies raising to the rank of major. Career Foreign correspondent In 1946 Heren returned to The Times and was made a foreign correspondent. He made his mark covering Indian independence in 1947, creating a furore in Britain and India with graphic eyewitness accounts of communal massacres in the Punjab. He also heard rumours of another plot to assassinate Gandhi, so he joined his weaving workshop in order to get a scoop (he was unsuccessful as the assassination happened elsewhere). Heren was later posted to Israel where he posted the first news reports about the Dead Sea Scrolls. He also served in Beirut, Jordan, Korea, Vietnam, Egypt, Singapore, India, and Germany. One of Heren's earliest jobs was in Vietnam during the early days of American intervention in the late 1950s. He is widely accepted amongst as the inspiration for the Thomas Fowler character in The Quiet American by Graham Greene. The author was a guest of Heren and his wife Patricia on their houseboat in Singapore. In 2002 Peter Mackay of Daily Mail wrote about the remarkable physical resemblance of Heren and actor Michael Caine (in their maturity), who played Fowler in the 2002 film Quiet American. Washington In 1961, he became chief Washington correspondent (later American editor) of The Times. He developed a profound understanding of and sympathy for the United States over a decade of intense political and social upheaval. By-lined in The Times from 1965, he became an influential and popular commentator on American affairs in Britain. He was the first to alert the world that President John F. Kennedy had sent US combat troops to Vietnam. He accompanied Rev Martin Luther King Jr. on several of his Freedom Rides. His friendship with President Lyndon Johnson gave him a unique insight into the developing tragedy of US involvement in Vietnam. He was close to Johnson, sometimes staying up late, drinking whisky in the Oval Office, and he was a guest at the president's Texas ranch. Exceptionally, in 1968, he flew back to Washington from California where he had been covering the presidential primary. That night Patricia was awoken by Heren shouting and thrashing about, in the throes of a nightmare. Shaken awake, he described his vivid dream in which he fought back a hostile mob with his portable typewriter, desperately trying to protect presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy. She switched on the radio and together they heard the news of Kennedy's assassination. In the same year, Heren was awarded one of the first John F. Kennedy Memorial Award for his book The New American Commonwealth, which likened the US Administration to a medieval court, with the president surrounded by a coterie of unelected, powerful advisors. Heren remained in Washington, D.C. until 1971. It was his last overseas foreign posting before he was promoted to deputy editor and foreign editor under William Rees-Mogg at the The Times. London Despite the difficulties of running a newspaper in the 1970s, he nurtured many notable talents, including Robert Fisk, Peter Hennessy and Paul Vallely. With his independent, earthy and instinctual style, he was't always happy within the confines of the editorial offices. In 1979, he oversaw the joint interviews, in The Times boardroom, with Sir Anthony Blunt after he was unmasked as the Fifth Man in the Cambridge Soviet spy ring. Heren drew fierce criticism from some newspapers after it became known he had asked for kippers to be brought in from a nearby smokehouse for Blunt's lunch. When Rupert Murdoch acquired the paper, Heren was the staff choice as Rees-Mogg's successor, but was passed over in favour of Harold Evans. He retired in 1981 after 48 years with The Times. \\"I loved my paper as a soldier loves his regiment,\\" he declared. Personal life Heren married Patricia Regan (died 1975). They had one son, Patrick, and three daughters, Kate, Sarah and Elizabeth, each born in a different country. They had a house in the Vale of Health in Hampstead. Death Heren died in London on 26 January 1995. Legacy Heren was one of a dwindling number of true foreign correspondents, able to spend years at their posts, embedded in the local cultures, and rarely able to return 'home'. His career mirrored the changing nature of The Times, from the years of Lord Astor's ownership, when stories were filed 'from our own correspondent' through to the years under Lord Thompson, and finally to the takeover by Rupert Murdoch when much to his dismay, society gossip was allowed into its pages and so beginning the end of its reputation as 'The Thunderer'. Heren was a fierce defender of the independence of the press, and was unafraid of authority. He objected to being called a journalist, preferring to be described as a reporter. He said it was crucial to go out to where the story was and to speak directly to those involved. He is remembered by journalists for many stories and sayings, but the one that is still quoted today is: \\"When a politician tells you something in confidence, always ask yourself 'Why is this lying bastard lying to me?'\\" Although, as the man from The Times, he was able to relay the ideas and actions of the powerful to the world, his heart was really in reporting how the news affected ordinary people. He gave himself one last assignment in 1981 when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was threatening the British coal industry with closure. He travelled to Yorkshire and went underground with a shift of pit miners.

The western terminus of the highway is at an intersection with U.S. Route 78 (US 78) (which also carries the unsigned SR 4) in Heflin. The eastern terminus of the route is at the Georgia state line, east of Ranburne, where the roadway continues as Georgia State Route 166\\\\. From the late 1920s to the mid-to-late-1930s, the highway was designated as US 78S, a divided U.S. highway. When that highway was decommissioned, it was redesignated as US 78 Alt. Route description SR 46 begins at an intersection with US 78 (unsigned SR 4) in downtown Heflin. It travels to the east-northeast for approximately before curving to the east-southeast. During this stretch, the highway is only about two blocks south of Cleburne County Jail. Just before intersecting the eastern terminus of Haley Road, SR 46 curves back to the east-northeast. A short distance later, it curves to the southeast and has a brief due-east routing. Just prior to intersecting Winstead Road, SR 46 curves to the northeast. Almost immediately after intersecting Chapel Hill Road, the highway crosses over Cane Creek; then, it intersects Hale Road and curves back to the southeast. Approximately past Happy Hill Cemetery, SR 46 has an interchange with Interstate 20 (I-20). Just past this interchange, the highway leaves the city limits of Heflin. Approximately later, it curves to the south-southeast and then crosses over Johnywady Creek. After that, it curves to the southeast and intersects the western terminus of County Route 62 (CR 62) before a due-south routing change that takes it to the northern terminus of CR 71 before crossing over the Tallapoosa River.

After curving to a nearly due-south direction, SR 46 intersects the eastern terminus of CR 42\\\\. After a curve to the southeast, the roadway crosses over Verdin Creek; then intersects the southern terminus of CR 43\\\\. SR 46 passes the Wise Chapel Cemetery. Slightly to the west of Crumbleys Chapel Cemetery, it curves to the south-southeast and intersects the northern terminus of CR 63\\\\. After that, it curves to the east-southeast just before intersecting the northern terminus of CR 10, northeast of Union Hill Cemetery. Approximately past Cleburne Memorial Garden, the highway curves to the southeast. Just before entering the city limits of Ranburne, it crosses over Lost Creek. In town, it passes just south of Ranburne Elementary School and then Ranburne High school. The highway widens to four lanes, with two in each direction and curves to the east-northeast just before intersecting the western terminus of Pollard Street. Just over after the curve, the highway intersects the southern terminus of CR 49 (Frank Ledbetter Drive). One block later is the northern terminus of CR 68 (Lake Street). Here, SR 46 begins to curve to the northeast. Less than from 3rd Avenue North, the highway narrows back to two lanes. The highway continues to the northeast, through rural parts of town and leaves the city limits just before reaching the Georgia state line. It is here that SR 46 meets its eastern terminus, and the roadway continues as Georgia State Route 166. The present purpose of SR 46 is to serve as a connecting route between Heflin and communities in western Georgia such as Bowdon and Carrollton. The route travels through rural areas of Cleburne County as it leads into Georgia. SR 46 is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. History Between 1927 and 1934, the route was designated as US 78S, while the present route of US 78 was designated as US 78N. In 1934, US 78S was redesignated as US 78 Alternate.

His knowledge of the game allowed him to compete at this level, although he did not have the speed or athleticism of his peers. Jason Matthews, the shooting guard next to Miller, recalls he was the leader of the team, even as a freshman, and that the upperclassmen welcomed him as a leader. Because of his knowledge and leadership abilities, none of his teammates were surprised once he became a top coach in NCAA men's basketball.

He would go on to spend the next 13 years at the school, helping to guide the Terriers in their transition from Division II to Division I independent status, and finally to a spot in the Southern Conference, where the Terriers compete today. In December 2001, Wofford announced that then-head coach Richard Johnson would be promoted to athletic director, leaving Young to take control of the team starting for the 2002–03 season. His first six years were fairly uneventful, with high points of a .500 conference record in his first season, and overall records of .500 during the 2004–05 and 2007–08 seasons. However, 2008–09 saw new school records in the Division I era, marking the Terriers' first winning season as a Division I school and the first winning SoCon record in school history. In 2009–10, Young continued to build on this success, leading the Terriers to both the Southern Conference regular season and tournament championships, which earned Wofford its first bid to the NCAA tournament. In recognition of his achievements, Young was named the 2010 Southern Conference Coach of the Year , as well as the Hugh Durham National Coach of the Year . On December 21, 2017, Young led Wofford to a stunning 79-75 win over #5 North Carolina, giving the program their first ever win over a top 25 team.Wofford vs. North Carolina - Game Recap - December 20, 2017 - ESPN The next season, they defeated Seton Hall 84-68 in the 2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament for the first NCAA Tournament win of Young's career.

Stefferud (Stef) (11 January 1930 – 22 September 2011) was a computer researcher and entrepreneur, who made many significant contributions to the development of the Internet, particularly in the areas of IETF RFCs and standards, secure online payment systems, DNS, and secure email. Stefferud was one of the original designers of the MIME protocol for sending multimedia Internet electronic mail. Creating new paradigms was part of Stefferud's life. This experience was presented in his classic talk, What is the Internet Paradigm?Stefferud, Einar: \\"What is the Internet Paradigm?\\" Career Stefferud was born in Wausau, Wisconsin and earned a BA and MBA from University of California, Los Angeles. He was a Retired Adjunct Professor of Information and Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine. Stefferud was active in ARPA/NSF/IETF DARPA Internet research and development since 1975. He was involved in pre-standards work for X.400/X.500 in the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) WG 6.5, and post- standards profiling in the National Institute of Standards and Technology OIW. He was involved in the US ANSI OSI Registration Authority; the US National Mail Transfer Service Interest Group (USMTS) and the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) where he has been involved with email standards development (e.g. MIME, SMTP Extensions and MHTML). He was Chair of IFIP Working Group 6.5 on Upper Layer Protocols, Architectures and Applications (ULPAA) from 1990 to 1996. He served as Chair of the 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994 IFIP WG 6.5 ULPAA Conferences. Stefferud was founder (1969) and President of Network Management Associates, where he provided Strategic Technical and Management Advisory Information Services on internet environments until 2000. He was a co-founder (1994) and Chief Visionary Officer of First Virtual Holdings, called \\"the first cyberbank\\" by the Smithsonian Institution, that launched an Internet Payment System in October 1994. First Virtual technology and patents are still in current use. Stefferud was honored by Communications Week Magazine as one of the Top 10 Visionaries in the Computer-Communications Industry for 1993.Communications Week, 23 August 1993 He was awarded Patent No. 5,757,917 with Marshall Rose and Nathaniel Borenstein for a \\"Computerized Payment System for Purchasing Goods and Services on the Internet\\". In 1997 Stefferud, Brian K. Reid and Richard J. Sexton formed the Open Root Server Confederation as a potential organization to serve as an institutional version of John Postel's IANA, and a proposal was submitted to the US Government Department of Commerce NTIA, which eventually picked the joint Network Solutions/IANA proposal that became ICANN. In 1999, at the end of the DNS domain name registry management discussions during the formation of ICANN, Stefferud was nominated Registry Advisory Board Member at Network Solutions (NSI), to provide independent external advisory review of the design and testing of the NSI Shared Registration System.The Shared Registration System created a registry-registrar model for the DNS TLDs .COM, .ORG, and .NET, which opened up the business of domain name registration. As the Internet developed, the next paradigm envisioned by Stefferud was trust. In the early days of the Internet every user was a trusted user, as authorized by DARPA, but this is no longer the case. Together with Ed Gerck, Stefferud was the co- founder (2001) of Network Manifold Associates Inc., working on the development of \\"target-free\\" technologies for secure Internet communications. Stefferud was also chairman of the NMA Advisory Board and was involved in the creation of \\"instant on\\" security products ZSentry and Zmail. Retirement Stefferud retired in 2006. While his health still allowed, Stefferud was active on the Internet until 2007. He lived with his wife Donna in Huntington Beach, California, near his daughter, son-in-law, and three grandchildren.

He most recently served as an assistant coach at Tennessee State University. Peele served as the head men's basketball coach at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro from 1995 to 1999 and Winthrop University to 2007 to 2012. Biography Peele graduated from Virginia Wesleyan College in 1980 with a degree in secondary education. In 1983, he began his coaching career when he accepted an assistant's job at Saint Michael's College in Vermont. After two years in Vermont, Peele spent three years as an assistant at the University of Tennessee at Martin and another three years at the Campbell University. In 1991, Peele accepted an assistant's job at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. After four years with the Spartans, Peele was promoted to replace former head coach Mike Dement, who had left to take over the men's basketball program at Southern Methodist University (SMU). In Peele's first season, only the second year in which UNC Greensboro was eligible for NCAA Division I postseason competition, the Spartans won the Big South Conference regular season and tournament championships. In the NCAA Tournament, UNC Greensboro was the 15th seed in the Southeast region, falling in the first round to the Cincinnati Bearcats. After 1996, however, Peele had little success with the Spartans. UNC Greensboro followed up their Big South championship with a 10–20 regular season, and then left the Big South in 1997 to join the Southern Conference. The Spartans finished at or near the bottom of their division in both of their first two seasons in the SoCon, and after four years in Greensboro, Peele left the Spartans and took an assistant's job with the Virginia Tech Hokies. Peele spent three seasons under Ricky Stokes in Blacksburg before leaving and spending a season away from coaching. In 2003, he resurfaced in the coaching world, this time as an assistant to Gregg Marshall at Winthrop University. In four seasons at Winthrop, the Eagles won three straight Big South titles, culminating in 2007 with a first-round upset of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in the NCAA Tournament. Following the 2007 season, Marshall left Winthrop to take the vacant head coaching position at Wichita State University. Winthrop's administration wasted little time, and quickly promoted Peele to take over for Marshall. Peele continued Marshall's tradition of success, winning the 2008 and 2010 Big South Conference Tournaments. However, after a 12–20 season in 2012, Randy Peele was relieved of his coaching duties at Winthrop on March 5. Peele joined head coach Mark Byington at Georgia Southern University for the 2013–14 season before leaving to be the associate head coach at Tennessee State University beginning in the 2014–15 season.

Avetaranian was originally a mullah in Turkey who converted from Islam to Christianity, and later became a missionary for the Swedish Mission Covenant Church in Southern Xinjiang (1892–1938). He translated the New Testament into the Uyghur language. He preached Christianity in Xinjiang and at a Swedish Protestant mission. He died in 1919, aged 58, in Wiesbaden. Biography Avetaranian was born in Erzurum, in 1861, to a Muslim family. His mother was deaf, blind, and mute, and died when Avetaranian was only two years old. His father was a dervish. He took the Armenian name of Johannes (John) Avetaranian (Avetaran means 'Gospel') and was baptised in Tiflis, Russia (modern-day Tbilisi, Georgia) on 28 February 1885.A Muslim Who Became a Christian by John Avetaranian He was the first person from the Mission Union of Sweden to stay in Kashgar (in 1892). He left Kashgar in 1897, thinking that he would soon return, but that did not work out. Instead he worked with the German Orient Mission (DOM) in Bulgaria, where he started a Christian newspaper, Gunesh, in Turkish. The newspaper was circulated in Turkey proper. Gösta Raquette came to Philipopol, now Plovdiv, Bulgaria, where he worked with Avetaranian on revision of the Bible translation. Muslim origins In his biography \\"A Muslim Who Became a Christian\\", Aveteranian states to have been unaware of his descent from Muhammad, until a trip with his father to Erzurum. During the trip, Aveteranian and his father had put on the Green turbans, to which only the Sayyids or descendants of Muhammad are entitled. Prior to this, he had only worn this once in his childhood. The Green turban had been a gift which was presented to him by his maternal aunt. A local mullah was astonished to see the green turban, and inquired as to from where he had obtained it. Then he requested Aveteranian to ask whether his aunt was aware that only Sayyids were entitled to wear green turbans. He did so, and the next day, his aunt went to the mullah and clarified the mullah's doubts as to their descent when she revealed her father's name. After this incident, Aveteranian gained respect from the mullah, who would always defer to him, while in Avetaranian's presence.Johannes Avetaranian, Richard Schafer , John Bechard, A Muslim Who Became a Christian, Authors On Line Ltd, 2003, ,Google Print, p. 4.

The character was originated by actress Megan Ward, who portrayed the role from May 2007 to October 2010. In September 2011, the role was re- introduced with actress Kelly Sullivan, who has portrayed the role since. Connie is known for having two distinct alternate personalities – Connie, who later changed her name to Kate Howard, who established her career and what the character was initially introduced as and an alternate personality also named Connie, who was based on her life back in Bensonhurst. Sullivan departed the role one year later in August 2013 and made a one-off appearance in October 2014. Ward briefly returned for one episode in January 2018.  Casting  The role of Kate Howard was originated by actress Megan Ward in May 2007. Lisa LoCicero, who would later be cast as Olivia Falconeri, auditioned for the role prior to Ward's casting. Ward remained on contract with the series until 2009, when she and actor Rick Hearst were dropped to a recurring status. Ward continued to make appearances as Kate, until she vacated the role in 2010; her final appearance as Kate was on October 20, 2010. In summer 2011, it was rumored that then-new headwriter Garin Wolf was looking to recast the character. In July 2011, it was confirmed that actress Kelly Sullivan had been cast as the re-cast of the role. Sullivan debuted in the role on September 12, 2011. Speculation arose in June 2013 that Sullivan had been let go by the ABC series. Sullivan later confirmed her exit on her Facebook webpage, confirming, \\"Thank you all so much for your support and loyalty,\\" she wrote. \\"You are my life long family and I cannot express how much I appreciate each of you. You have really made my experience here on GH a wonderful adventure. I wanted to fill you all in on the details and try to answer some of your questions. I am not returning to GH after August. This is not a contract issue, I have been written off the show. I do not have any information on potential Daytime opportunities. Lastly, I have no ill feelings towards any of the staff or crew connected to the show or the network. I will miss everyone dearly. Love, Kelly\\" Sullivan will remain with the series through August. Sullivan filmed her final scenes on Friday, July 26, 2013. Following the news of her departure, rumors began to circulate that the character of Connie would be killed off. Sullivan eventually confirmed those rumors at a fan event in late July. Upon Connie's death on August 27, 2013, Sullivan tweeted: \\"RIP Connie [...] It was a great two years! Thank you for your love and support, it means so much. Long live GH!\\"http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/kelly-sullivan- says-good-bye-gh Sullivan reprised the role during the October 24, 2014, episode. Ward made an unannounced one-off visit on January 17, 2018, during a special one-off episode focused on the surgery of Ava Jerome (Maura West).  Character development and portrayal   Megan Ward  Megan Ward has stated in various interviews that in her opinion, Kate Howard is a woman full of contradictions. She is a character constantly trying to hide where she came from and who she really is, Connie Falconeri. Ward explained \\"I'm not just playing Kate, [...] [i]t's Kate and Connie and then the person who was in between in the arc of how she became Kate. There are a lot of contradictions with her because Kate comes on incredibly strong and incredibly dismissive[...] But, the reason she is that way is because she's concealing and hiding. She's projecting a persona to intimidate, but she's also putting up a wall to cover the truth of who she is and the emotion and vulnerability she has.\\" In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Ward further explained that it was challenging portraying Kate, who is \\"that person who is strong and flawed and one can be critical of\\", because she had to maintain \\"the qualities of Connie, the girl Sonny fell in love with. She's still completely in there.\\" Additionally, the actress mentioned: \\"I have to play the projection of Kate Howard, but it's all covering the Connie Falconeri underneath. Creatively, I've had to constantly balance being forceful and dominating in situations, but still let you see the true girl doesn't mean to be that forceful and dominating.\\" During an interview with Soap Opera Weekly, Ward cited Anna Wintour as inspiration for the character, an \\"older woman who's had a long career\\", but she wasn't \\"of that age yet\\". Of inspirations for the character, she further said: \\"I draw from Aerin Lauder, Estée Lauder's granddaughter, who runs the Estée Lauder company, and a well-known interior designer named Kelly Wearstler, who was one of the judges on Bravo's TOP DESIGN. What I loved about her was every week she had a completely different look.\\" Ward relates more to Connie, a \\"smart girl\\" who knew what she wanted, than Kate who is a \\"creation\\" and a \\"manufactured identity\\". She stated that \\"What's sad about Connie, and she's learning that as we go along, is she might have been wrong that she had to be Kate Howard to get where she is. That's what Sonny represents for her. You have to be strong and ambitious to accomplish great tasks, but you don't necessarily have to be purely Kate Howard.\\"  Kelly Sullivan  Sullivan admitted during an interviewer with soap columnist Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps that she wasn't hesitant taking over the role following Ward's departure. She said she wasn't worried because she didn't \\"know a lot about Megan and Kate's story\\", and \\"Ignorance is always bliss\\", explaining: \\"Obviously, when I first started I was very much introduced to the soap opera fans, and all the Megan fans. You can't win em all, but that's OK. Megan did an incredible job and is such a great actress, and she really set the bar high.\\" Sullivan also admitted she did not know about the \\"split personality\\" storyline: Sullivan stated she'd love for Victoria Lord (Erika Slezak) and Jessica Buchanan (Bree Williamson) to crossover from One Life to Live to General Hospital to help Kate out with controlling her alter, \\"Connie\\". She described the disease as \\"a scary thing. It's a mental illness and it's terrible, and how you work through it to get healthy is such a journey. That is why I am really happy that Ron is here at GH. There is a very specific way to deal with this illness. I don't know much, but I know that they are going to take their time to work it out.\\" In an interview with MSN Entertainment, Kelly Sullivan has stated in interviews that coming in as a recast, \\"Recasting is never easy, for any party involved. Megan [Ward] created the role and set the bar very high. To be able to come in after that [...] She established a strong presence and essence of the character. A lot of her fans were resistant, but it's different now, because we started recreating something that is mine.\\" She hoped that \\"as this storyline keeps getting more interesting and crazy, more people will get on board and just have fun.\\" The actress wanted Connie to come out as the winner, explaining: \\"Connie's a broad and I always root for the underdog, the misunderstood person - Connie's not just \\"evil.\\" She has a right to feel the way she does. She's hurt and scared. And also overtly sexual\\". In the interview with MSN, Sullivan also discussed portraying a character with dissociative identity disorder, \\"It's awesome. When I get my scripts, I can't wait to see what mischief I'm up to. I've been doing the most insane, exciting things and it's all culminating.\\" Kate is Connie's \\"worst enemy in some ways\\". Of how her disorder came about, the actress said it \\"stems from past trauma. We spent a bit of time talking about these issues she's never dealt with, regarding her family and her choice to run away and create this whole new reality for herself. Kate is her worst enemy in some ways. With her resistance to violence and guns, she's now neck deep in it again with Sonny. She loves this man so much, but she also has to marry into is his life.\\" The show's head writer Ron Carlivati also weighed in on the storyline and opened up about the character's descent into her life with D.I.D.. He said: \\"the seeds of Connie – this other personality of Kate's – were planted long before I got there. It was very clear that that's the direction the story was going in, and I had two options: To continue it, or to drop it. And having written multiple personalities on the other show, at first I felt this wasn't something I wanted to do again, but it was so beautifully set up\\". Storyline Background Upon first introduction, Kate Howard is famous for being the editor-in-chief of a high fashion magazine, similar to the character of Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada. Her history is told through bits of dialogue, primarily between her and the character Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard). Through these glimpses, it is revealed Kate Howard was born Constanza Louise Falconeri, Connie for short by those who knew her. She was raised in Bensonhurst, New York, to an Italian American family, where she worked at a bakery and attended Sacred Heart Catholic school in Brooklyn, New York. At the age of 18, wanting a better life for herself, Connie legally changed her name to Kate Howard, after Catherine Howard, the fifth wife of King Henry VIII. Her desire was to choose an easily recognizable name that alluded to a good background and social standing. She attended Princeton University, on a full scholarship and worked her way up the ranks to become the editor of the fictional top fashion magazine, Couture. Since then, she has hidden her past as Connie Falconeri, claiming instead to be from Connecticut. Kate and mob boss Sonny Corinthos dated as teenagers and had planned to run away together, but on the night they were to leave, she stood him up. She later explained to him that she wanted to pursue her dreams of having a career, something she could not do had she run away with Sonny. 2007–2010 The character was introduced on May 8, 2007, when Kate walks into Sonny's office unannounced, and demands the use of a phone because her car had broken down. Sonny eventually recognizes her as Connie Falconeri, his former love from Bensonhurst. Diane Miller (Carolyn Hennesy), Sonny's lawyer, later mentions Kate is considered one of the \\"100 Most Powerful Women in America.\\" Kate purchases a mansion next door to Sonny. Soon after, Kate is suffering from a headache and mistakenly takes a libido-enhancement pill from a friend instead of ibuprofen. Under the effects of the drug, she seduces Sonny. When Kate is arrested for reckless driving and a hit and run, she is released into Sonny's custody, after spending the night in jail. The interim District Attorney, Ric Lansing (Rick Hearst), refuses the plea agreement, seeking to take revenge on Sonny through Kate. Kate's friend and former lover, Trevor Lansing, blackmails his son Ric, threatening him with losing custody of his daughter if he did not reduce the charges against Kate. Trevor tries to blackmail Kate into choosing between Sonny or him and her career, but pulling crucial advertisements from Couture magazine.Soap Opera Weekly, \\"GH's Kate Crashes - and Burns Sonny\\", September 18, 2007 After a confrontation with Trevor, Kate is drugged and gets into a car accident.ABC's Soap Opera's In Depth, \\"Kate breaks up with Sonny\\", October 23, 2007 She faces serious legal action due to her prior driving records, but when Sonny blackmails a judge, she instead receives six months of community service.

Kate moves back to Manhattan trying to get away from Sonny. Sonny takes her to Bensonhurst, where they visit several memorable places from the youth. Sonny then proposes, but Kate does not answer and runs away.ABC's Soaps In Depth, \\"Engaged?

Later, Kate meets with Sonny in an attempt to reconcile. Soon after she is scouting a warehouse building for her magazine, when she is accidentally shot by Sonny's son, Michael Corinthos (Dylan Cash). Sonny finds her and she survives surgery. Kate forgives Michael for what happened. Sonny attempts to leave organized crime, and Kate accepts his marriage proposal. Kate brings Michael to Sonny's coffee warehouse on Sonny's request, where Michael is shot by a stray bullet meant for Sonny. Sonny and Kate attempt to marry, but Kate is shot at the altar. Kate's cousin Olivia Falconeri (LoCicero), who had come to Port Charles to be her maid of honor, stays through her recovery and ends up moving to town. Sonny sleeps with his ex-wife Carly Corinthos Jacks on the way home from dropping off their son Michael to his permanent care facility. Kate learns the truth from Jax, leading to her officially ending her relationship with Sonny. In 2010, Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna), then known as Dominic, was found out to be Sonny's son from his short-lived relationship with Kate's cousin, Olivia. Sonny and Kate have a conversation about Kate's knowledge of Dante and the fact she kept it from him since they were teenagers. Kate also acknowledges she finally knows that they were never meant to be, with Sonny nodding his head in agreement. It is also implied Sonny doesn't hold a grudge that Kate didn't tell him about Dante. 2011–2014, 2018 In September 2011, after almost a year off-screen, Kate (Sullivan) returned to Port Charles, resuming her role at Crimson. Since returning, Kate has been helping Sonny come to terms with his childhood abuse from his father. The pair return to Bensonhurst in December, and spend Christmas together. They later decide to attempt a reconciliation and slowly re-build their relationship. Kate admits to Sonny that whenever she's leaving town, she's not going to meetings, she's seeing a psychiatrist. It's later revealed that during her run-in with Jax, he signed over his share and rights to the MetroCourt to her, making her Carly's partner in the running of the hotel. After an argument with Sonny, it's revealed that Kate still has possession of her bloody wedding dress, locked away in an oak chest. Kate continues to get dropped phone calls and mysterious calls from unknown callers. At the Pulmonary event at the MetroCourt, Johnny unveils that Anthony is not his father but his grandfather. He promises to make Sonny pay for destroying his family. In the parking garage, a hitman shoots at Dante; Sonny interferes and gets shot himself. Upon finding out Sonny had been shot, Kate rushed to the garage and began to zone out of reality. She then visited Sonny in the hospital and left his side after he wanted to take revenge, ending their relationship again. She then goes to the dock, in her bloody wedding gown and is unsure of why she's there. She continued to act very despondent, and had difficulty recalling the events on the night. Kate then confesses to Dr. Ewen Keenan (Nathin Butler) that she's been finding random pieces of paper with names and phone numbers on them following her blackouts. After splitting with Sonny, the two reconnect on her desk. She continues to insist she is not \\"Connie\\" but \\"Kate. However, once he leaves, she continues to smell her old perfume. She shows up at Johnny Zacchara (Brandon Barash)'s and insists she is \\"Connie\\" and that \\"Kate\\" is the one with the problem. As \\"Connie\\" hatches her plan to use Johnny as a ploy to get \\"Kate\\" away from Sonny, \\"Kate\\" continues to struggle with her memories fading in and out. She confesses to Ewen that does still does not remember certain things about her days and he insists she possibly suffers from dissociative identity disorder, also known as DID. Johnny then arrives at the Crimson offices and pushes Kate to let Connie out, who ropes Johnny back into her plan, despite his decision to not go ahead with it. As they begin to have sex on her office desk, Kate re-emerges and throws Johnny out, cowering into her sweater, confused over her actions. As Kate continues to be forced between herself and Connie, sometimes losing control for several hours at the time, she begins seeing Ewen as her official therapist. Ewen suggests that he hypnotize her, in order to find out why \\"Connie\\" was created. As Connie emerges, she reveals that she was created to protect Kate from Sonny's hold and that he's almost gotten them killed one, and that he's on the verge of having it happen again. She also confesses to planting a gun in Kate's office in order to send Sonny to jail for murdering Cole Thornhart (Van Hughes) and Hope Manning-Thornhart. In April 2012, Kate agrees to have herself voluntarily committed into a mental institution, to gain control of herself from Connie. She agrees to it, as long as she's able to say goodbye to Sonny. She then arrives at Sonny's home, and tells him she has something to tell him. However, she's interrupted by the jury's verdict in Sonny's trial, which resulted in him being found guilty. They are interrupted again by Max and Olivia, the latter of whom attacks Kate once again over changing her name and alienating her past. Cracking under Olivia's pressure, Kate runs off and has a confrontation with Connie (through her psyche) and results in Connie, once again, being unleashed. Connie (as Kate) then decides to throw Sonny a birthday party, mixed with a party for him being found not guilty on charges of murder. At the party, Connie destroys his birthday cake and then sleeps with Johnny. After Sonny catches \\"Kate\\" with Johnny, he breaks off their relationship with Kate then returning. When she agrees to Dr. Keenan's terms of turning herself into the psych ward, Connie reemerges, bashing Ewen over the head. Connie then decides to leave Port Charles, but not before getting into a physical altercation with Carly, who discovers a paper labeling Kate with DID. At the airport, Kate attempts to escape, with no avail. When her plane is about to board, she runs into Jason, who stops her from getting on. After Jason rattles Connie, Kate re-emerges, only to be contained by PCPD for attacking Dr. Ewen. Jason helps arrange a meeting between Sonny and Kate, in which she admits she has a multiple personality that has caused the rift between them. During her time in a psych hospital, Kate relives painful memories concerning her teens. She relives the painful memories of being raped by Joe Scully, Jr. (Richard Steinmetz), which resulted in her pregnancy. She admits that while left Sonny because of the pregnancy and for the fear of what Sonny could have done if he ever knew. She confesses that after having her son, she left him in a drawer in her boarding school, and legally changed her name to Kate Howard to escape the painful past. Kate later discovers her son is alive, and living under the name Trey Mitchell (Eric Valdez), and has been dating Sonny's daughter Kristina Davis (Lindsey Morgan). After Sonny proposes, Kate begins to feel conflicted again, and reverts to Connie. At their wedding, Connie unveils herself and reveals her marriage to Johnny, as a blackmail situation to keep Johnny's secret over killing Cole and Hope, a confession Connie took credit for. Connie continues to blackmail Johnny and Todd. She later comes across a manuscript of a novel written by Molly Lansing, and changed it around and sold it to Todd's publishers. After Johnny tells Connie he is ready to confess his crimes, she kidnaps him and traps him in the back of her car. On New Year's Eve, Trey and Kristina get suspicious and follow Connie's car through the fog. Trying to get away from the other car, Connie accidentally hits Ellie Trout, and then collides with the other car. In early 2013, Connie deals with the guilt she feels for causing the accident that left Trey brain-dead. She is initially resistant to take Trey off of life-support, but Sonny is able to convince her it is the right thing to do. As Connie reveals she wanted to get to know her son, Sonny is surprised and amazed that Connie is developing a compassionate side. They both start to develop feelings for each other, and sleep together on Valentine's Day. That night Connie tells Sonny that for the first time in her life, she was truly happy. Then Kate reemerges and is shocked to find Sonny in bed with Connie. Sonny and Olivia tell her everything she missed in the 5 months Connie was in control. On March 8, Connie is revealed to have control again and vows revenge against Sonny for sleeping with Kate. Connie goes to the book launch at The Floating Rib, where she eventually tells the crowd that Molly is the actual author. Sonny catches up with her, though, and convinces Connie to check into Shadybrook. On April 16, Kate returned to Sonny and said she is integrated and will go by Connie and loves him but can't be with him. Soon afterwards, Connie decides to return to Crimson and focus on her work again. While fully integrated, she convinces Maxie that she can have her old job back. She then begins to get closer with Olivia and reveals she is still in love with Sonny. In June 2013, Olivia is accidentally shot by an unknown assailant, who was targeting Franco. While fearing for her cousin's life, Connie confesses her lingering feelings for Sonny, but fears he may have feelings for Olivia instead. In July 2013, Olivia begins staying with Sonny to recuperate, and Connie decides to get Sonny back before she loses him to Olivia. Connie then goes to Sonny's house and tells him that she wants to be with him. Olivia promptly decides to move out of Sonny's house so he and Connie can rekindle their relationship. In August 2013, in order to save her newspaper, Connie publishes a story about Kiki Jerome (Kristen Alderson) not being Franco (Roger Howarth)'s daughter, after promising Sonny she wouldn't. Connie overhears Olivia admitting her feelings for Sonny. Connie overhears her boss Derek Wells (William deVry; really Julian Jerome) talking on the phone and referring to himself as Julian. In August 2013, Sonny finds Connie shot in her office. Before she dies, she writes in blood the letters \\"AJ.\\" It was later revealed that she was shot and killed by Ava Jerome (West) after it was revealed that Connie found out about Derek Wells being Julian Jerome, and Ava's connection with him. In 2018, Connie (Ward) appears via Ava's subconscious, where she confronts Ava, reminding her of her actions.  Reception  General Hospital fan response has been overwhelmingly positive of the pairing of Sonny Corinthos and Kate Howard. They are consistently among the Top 10 Couples with the wedding of Sonny and Kate becoming a sweeps event for GH.ABC's Soaps in Depth, \\"Reader's Poll\\", pages 38-39. Issue of February 25, 2008 Fans were disgusted in March 2009, when ABC announced General Hospital was dropping Megan Ward to recurring status and Rick Hearst (Ric Lansing) off contract, which resulted in him last airing that June. Following Sullivan's inception of the character, she was given the title of \\"Performer of the Week\\" on On Air On Soaps. Site editor, Michael Fairman, stated: The D.I.D. storyline was named one of Daytime Confidentials top ten most memorable D.I.D. story lines in soap opera history. In popular culture The character of Kate Howard is reminiscent of Miranda Priestly (portrayed by Streep) from The Devil Wears Prada (2006) and Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue.

Currently, he serves as the music director and lead conductor of the Kansas City Symphony in Kansas City, Missouri. He is also the founding music director of the IRIS Orchestra in Germantown, Tennessee. Early life and education Stern is the son of violinist Isaac Stern. He obtained his undergraduate degree in American history from Harvard College in 1981. Subsequently, he studied under conductor Max Rudolf at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, graduating in 1986. Stern also studied for one summer at the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute and for two summers at the Pierre Monteux Memorial School in Hancock, Maine. Career In May 1986, only weeks before his graduation from the Curtis Institute, Stern auditioned for and won the job of conducting assistant at The Cleveland Orchestra, where the music director was Christoph von Dohnányi. The audition and the position were both organized under the aegis of the Exxon/Arts Endowment Conductor's Program. Stern officially was named a full assistant conductor the following season, and stayed with the orchestra until 1991. In September 1986, he debuted at the New York Philharmonic as one of three young conductors whom Leonard Bernstein invited to participate in a conducting workshop which culminated in two concerts at Avery Fisher Hall. That year, Stern became the permanent guest conductor of the Orchestre National de Lyon in Lyon, France. During his four years with the Orchestre National, he also appeared with orchestras in Paris, Bordeaux, Lille, and Toulouse, as well as others throughout Europe. In 1996, he left the Orchestre National to become chief conductor of the Saarbrücken Radio Symphony Orchestra, a prominent recording and broadcast orchestra in Germany, making him the first American to hold the position of chief conductor in that orchestra's history. His work there is also notable for the orchestra's many recordings of American classical music during his tenure, including discs of works by Henry Cowell and Charles Ives. He also led the orchestra on tours of Spain, Portugal, China and Switzerland. He stepped down as chief conductor in 2000. After leaving the Saarbrücken Radio Symphony Orchestra, Stern founded the IRIS Orchestra in Germantown, Tennessee, which specializes in playing American contemporary music. Beyond his work with IRIS, he frequently appeared throughout North America as a guest conductor of many symphony orchestras, including a series of concerts at the New York Philharmonic in the summer of 2001, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony, the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra, the Atlanta Symphony, the Houston Symphony, the Baltimore Symphony, the Toronto Symphony, Ottawa's National Arts Centre Orchestra, the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, and Washington, D.C.'s National Symphony Orchestra. He also began regular appearances at the Aspen Music Festival. In September 2001, Stern led the Vienna Radio Symphony on a tour of China. During this time, Stern also continued guest conducting orchestras worldwide, including the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic, the Oslo Philharmonic, the Bergen Symphony, Bonn's Beethovenhalle Orchestra, Berlin's Deutsche Symphoniker, the Budapest Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Moscow Philharmonic, the Helsinki Philharmonic, Rome's Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, Munich's Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Lausanne's Chamber Orchestra, Zurich's Tonhalle Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the English Chamber Orchestra, the National Symphony of Taiwan, the Singapore Symphony, and the NHK Symphony Orchestra. On September 30, 2005, Stern accepted an appointment as music director and lead conductor of the Kansas City Symphony, a position he currently holds. He also continues his guest conducting travels and his work with the IRIS Orchestra. In March 2014, Michael Stern made history with The Kansas City Symphony and Engage Mobile Solutions when they used four pair of Google Glass at the same time to record a performance of Beethoven's 5th Symphony.

Masayasu's family was descended from Konō Michitaka.Papinot, Jacques. (2003). Nobiliare du Japon -- Inaba, p. 15; Papinot, Jacques Edmond Joseph. (1906). Dictionnaire d’histoire et de géographie du Japon. (in French/German). Masayasu was the son of hatamoto Inaba Masakichi, from whom he inherited the 5000 koku territory of Aono han in 1656. He served as a page and clerk for some time, before being summoned by the shogunate to oversee irrigation projects in the provinces of Kawachi and Settsu. For this, he was awarded the post of wakadoshiyori in 1682, and had his lands expanded to 12,000 koku. Masayasu visited Kyoto as part of a formal inspection in 1683. In this period, Masayasu's cousin, Inaba Masamichi, held the powerful and highly trusted position of Kyoto shoshidai.Tucker, John. (1998). Itō Jinsai's \\"Gomō Jigi\\" and the Philosophical Definition of Early Modern Japan, p. 4 n3. Masayasu is perhaps best known to history for assassinating his distant cousin, the Tairō Hotta Masatoshi (Masatoshi’s grandMother was Daughter of Inaba Masanori which made Masatoshi was Masayas’s first cousin once removed) inside Edo castle in 1684. Masayasu's motives remain unknown; but the absence of severe adverse repercussions for his family leaves open the supposition that the shōgun himself was privy to a planned assassination.Brinkley, Frank et al. (1915). A History of the Japanese People from the Earliest Times to the End of the Meiji Era, p. 598. In the Edo period, the Inaba were identified as one of the fudai or insider daimyō clans which were hereditary vassals or allies of the Tokugawa clan, in contrast with the tozama or outsider clans.Appert, Georges. (1888). Ancien Japon, p. 67. Inaba clan genealogy The fudai Inaba clan originated in Mino province. They claim descent from Kōno Michitaka (d. 1374), who claimed descent from Emperor Kammu (736–805).\\"Inaba\\" at Ancestry.com citing Hank, Patrick, ed. (2003). Dictionary of American Family Names. Masasayu was part of the cadet branch of the Inaba which was created in 1588. This branch is descended from Inaba Masanari (+1628), who fought in the armies of Nobunaga and then Hideyoshi. In 1619, Masanari was granted the han of Itoigawa (25,000 koku) in Echigo province; then, in 1627, his holding was transferred to Mōka Domain (65,000 koku) in Shimotsuke province. Masanari's descendants resided successively at Odawara Domain (105,000 koku) in Sagami province from 1632 through 1685; at Takata Domain in Echigo province from 1685 through 1701; at Sakura Domain in Shimōsa province from 1701 through 1723. Masasayu's relatives and others who were also descendants of Inaba Masanari settled at Yodo Domain (115,000 koku) in Yamashiro province from 1723 through 1868. The head of this clan line was ennobled as a \\"Viscount\\" in the Meiji period. Tokugawa official Masayasu was a junior counselor (wakadoshiyori) in the Edo shogunate.Bodart-Bailey, Beatrice.

He replaced Karl Hobbs. He was formerly the coach of the University of Vermont Catamounts and the Catholic University of America (CUA) and before that a point guard for CUA. Biography Early life and education Lonergan grew up in Bowie, Maryland and attended Archbishop Carroll High School in Washington, D.C. Lonergan's late mother and first coach, Maureen, was coach and athletic director at Bladensburg's Elizabeth Seton High School. His father, Jack, was a successful college baseball player, gaining national attention for pitching a one-hitter for Holy Cross in the 1952 College World Series. Lonergan holds a B.A. in History from CUA and an M.S. in Criminal Justice from American International College. Coaching career In 12 seasons at CUA, Lonergan guided the Cardinals to nine NCAA Tournaments, and an overall record of 251-88, a school-best .740 winning percentage. The Cardinals won seven straight regular-season conference championships (1997-2004). No other college coach in the nation during that time – at any NCAA division – accomplished that feat. Lonergan was recognized for the achievement during the 2004 NCAA Division I Final Four. The team won the 2001 Division III National Championship during that run. After spending the 2004-05 season as an assistant at University of Maryland, College Park under Gary Williams, where he helped the Terrapins to the NIT Semifinals, Lonergan accepted the head coaching position at the University of Vermont, replacing Tom Brennan. Lonergan coached the Catamounts for six seasons where he averaged 21 wins a year and finished with a career record of 126-68 and .649 winning percentage at UVM, which is the second highest in school history among coaches with at least 100 career decisions, behind current UVM coach John Becker. In the last six seasons he guided Vermont to four postseason appearances, including a trip to the NCAA Tournament in 2010. He ranks third all-time at UVM in career wins. In May 2011, Lonergan was hired by George Washington University Athletic Director and former America East Commissioner Patrick Nero to take over as head coach of the Colonials. Early in his tenure, Lonergan highlighted his origins in the Washington, DC metropolitan area and his understanding of Colonials basketball's historical reliance on foreign-born recruits and committed to recruiting locally, nationally and internationally. His first complete recruiting class boasted two players from the DC area and players from Argentina, Greece and Denmark. The Colonials struggled to consecutive losing records under Lonergan in 2011-12 and 2012–13, marking the first time in his Division I coaching career that a Lonergan-coached team failed to reach the postseason in consecutive seasons. In 2013-14, GW finished the year 24-9, finishing third in the Atlantic 10 and earning a ninth-seed in the NCAA Tournament, where the Colonials lost to Memphis. Following the trip to the NCAAs, George Washington announced that Lonergan had signed a contract extension that keeps him at GW through the 2020-21 season. Mike Lonergan completed his fourth season as head coach for men's basketball at George Washington University in 2014-15, leading the Colonials to back-to-back 20-win seasons and postseason appearances for the first time since 2006 and 2007. He guided GW to 22 victories, seventh-most in a season in program history, and a return trip to the postseason with an at-large selection to the National Invitation Tournament. Coach Lonergan helped the Colonials post a 60-54 opening round victory at Pittsburgh for the program's first-ever win in five NIT appearances. Lonergan led the Colonials to a 5-0 record to open the 2015-16 season, including a noteworthy upset victory over the No. 6 Virginia Cavaliers on November 16, 2015. This was George Washington's first win over an opponent ranked that high since beating No. 1 Massachusetts 78-75 on Feb. 5, 1995. The Colonials would go on to finish the regular season with a 23-10 record, good enough for an NIT invite for a second consecutive season. They would go on to win the NIT Championship Game that season. In a July 21, 2016 article in the Washington Post, several former players charged Lonergan with \\"verbal and emotional abuse\\", charges that Lonergan did not respond to in a statement. The article also noted that three players transferred out of the university after each of the previous four seasons. Later that day, George Washington University announced that it was hiring outside counsel to assist in the investigation of these allegations. Lonergan was fired on September 16, 2016, reportedly on the basis of the allegations.Lonegran fired USA Today, 2016-09-16, Retrieved 2016-09-17 Nearly a year later on September 13, 2017, Lonergan and George Washington officials settled the former coach's legal dispute against the school over his firing. Both sides continue to maintain their initial positions, but per the agreement the settlement cannot be publicly discussed. On the May 10, 2017 edition of Randy Foye's Outside Shot podcast, guest Jeremy Lin described an incident which alleged that a Vermont coach called Lin, an Asian-American, a racial slur while Lin was playing for Harvard in a game at Vermont in 2006. Lonergan refuted the allegation. On November 18, 2018, Deadspin published a story which detailed the conduct and dismissals of both former George Washington athletic director Patrick Nero and Lonergan along with the tumultuous relationship between the two. Personal life Lonergan and his wife Maggie have five children: John (Jack), Margaret, Michael Jr., Robert (Moe) and Regina. Mike and Maggie met while both working at the basketball camp of legendary DeMatha Catholic High School coach Morgan Wootten. Lonergan has been involved with the Coaches vs. Cancer campaign from the beginning to help raise awareness about the devastating disease which took his mother's life.

It was an important part of the early history of Spadina Avenue in Toronto, as well as the early Jewish community of Toronto. The store was founded in 1926 by Ben Zion Hyman and his wife Fannie (also known as Faygle). For most of its 45-year history, Hyman's Bookstore was located at 412 Spadina Avenue in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The book store specialized in Jewish books of both secular and religious interest in English, Yiddish and Hebrew. Hyman's Bookstore carried a complete line of Jewish ritual objects such as talleisim, tfillin, kiddush cups, menorahs, shabbath candlesticks, kippot and jewelry (e.g., mezuzahs and magen davids). It was also the main supplier of all the Jewish schools in Toronto. In 1941, Hyman used books from the store to found the Toronto Jewish Public Library. Hyman's Bookstore started a book registry in the late 1940s, so that there would be no duplication in Bar Mitvah gifts. Another one of Hyman's specialties was office supplies. In addition, the business was renowned for its Jewish greeting cards sold during major Jewish holidays. Many Jewish landsmanshaften [organizations of people from the same European area] depended on Hyman's service for mimeographing multiple copies of local community society newsletters and minutes. The store gained its fame as a meeting place of Jewish political ideas and viewpoints. It was often referred to as the \\"Jewish Parliament.\\" Many heated conversations took place in the store, over bottles of Coca-Cola. They discussed viewpoints such as Labour Zionism, Mizrachi, Revisionism, and so on. All points of view were welcomed except for Communism. Many people came to the bookstore to have letters written in Fanny Hyman's handwriting (in English, Polish or Yiddish) to be sent home to their families in eastern Europe. \\"Hyman's Book and Art Shoppe\\" was the name of the store from 1926 to 1953. \\"Hyman and Son\\" was the name of the store from 1953 to its closing in 1971.

In club football, he played in the Football League for Woolwich Arsenal, Glossop and Fulham. Career Born in Blackheath, Hoare started out with junior sides such as West Norwood, Woolwich Polytechnic, and Bromley before joining Woolwich Arsenal in 1907. He made his League debut in a First Division match against Sheffield Wednesday on 20 April 1908, the last day of the 1907–08 season. Although he played 11 League matches in 1908–09, scoring five goals, he was unhappy at the lack of regular first- team football and moved to Glossop in December 1909. From 1909 through to 1911 he also turned out occasionally for Kent League side Northfleet United. He lasted a year at Glossop before returning to Woolwich Arsenal in December 1910. He scored seven times in 16 games for Arsenal in the 1910–11 season, but was once again dropped at the start of the following season, unable to oust Jackie Chalmers and Charles Randall from the front line. He rejoined Glossop in February 1912; in total, he played 34 times for Arsenal, scoring 13 goals. Hoare was capped multiple times for the England amateur team. He was a member of the team that represented Great Britain at the 1912 Summer Olympics: he played all three matches as Great Britain won the gold medal in the football tournament. After his second spell at Glossop, Hoare went on to play for Queens Park and Fulham, finally retiring in 1920. He died in 1973, aged 89.  Personal life  Hoare served as a lieutenant in the Army Service Corps during the First World War.

The treaty established which states would replace the former Kingdom of Hungary, with the most dramatic economic consequences of the dismantling affecting Hungary herself. Before the war Hungary depended upon the Austrian and Czech parts of the empire for the import of up to 80% of Hungary’s raw materials and a market accepting an equal percentage of Hungarian exports; the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire left the new Hungarian State with few raw materials, a loss of its markets, and no sea access, all adding to the devastation of Hungary’s destroyed economy. In 1920/21 the Hungarian budget predicted expenditures twice as high as the estimated revenue for the year. At the same time the country was facing unrestrained inflation so that by December 1920 the Minister of Finance, Lóránt Hegedüs, drafted a financial program striving for general deflation, tax reforms, and reduced budget expenditures. The plan failed for various reasons, including strong political opposition and the reparation payments which made it difficult to create a balanced budget for the country. In 1922, the government, which until that time had done nothing more than establish some export embargoes, finally intervened in an attempt to curtail the rapidly rising inflation. Foreign- exchange regulation was established mainly on imported goods, though these controls were only temporary. By the second half of the 1920s state intervention decreased significantly to allow a more liberal economic policy.  Economic Stability  The Hungarian economy remained susceptible to escalating inflation and was largely disorganized until March 1924 when the League of Nations agreed to the Financial Reconstruction Plan. Under this plan the League would lend Hungary a sum of about 250 million gold crowns in an attempt to help stabilize Hungarian currency and help balance the budget. The budget was finally balanced in 1924/25 followed by a stabilizing of the economy. On 1 January 1927, the government introduced a new currency, the pengő, which equaled 12,500 paper crowns.  Effects of the Great Depression  Despite having been greatly reduced in size following the war, Hungary, due to its agricultural efficiency, still exported more wheat than any other State in Europe at the time . The economy did well from the 1924/25 financial year until 1929/30. When the Great Depression hit in 1929 there was a collapse of world wheat prices putting Hungary, heavily depended on wheat export, into a budget deficit. From July 1930- July 1934 the boletta system was put into place, providing price support and tax relief for farms in an attempt to manage the economic crisis caused by the decline in wheat prices. The National Council for Industry was also established to help regulate the industrial sector of the economy. Between May 1 and July 13, 1931 the Hungarian National Bank paid out 200 million pengős in gold and foreign exchange. At the same time Hungary’s foreign debt reached 4,300 million pengos with interests costing 300 million pengos a year. With the gold and foreign exchange reserves virtually depleted, the gold cover of the pengős fell from 40% to 20%. By the summer of 1931 the National Bank no longer maintained enough foreign exchange to continue making interest payments. The government suspended the redemption of bonds and ended the payment of interest in foreign exchange on long-term foreign debts. In response to the economic crisis Hungary faced, foreign creditors agreed to temporarily suspend debt payments.  Recovery  The deflation policies first enacted in 1929 and 1930 meant to assist the government in rebalancing the budget were finally achieved in 1936/37. On July 7, 1937, The Times reported that Hungary had reached an agreement to pay interest on long-term non-State debts, which had been suspended since 1931 with over 65 loans falling under the terms of this new debt offer. The resumption of payments came after signs of a recovering economy. The revival of the economy was due largely to the controls set on inflation and a bilateral trade agreement signed with Germany in 1934. The agreement gave Hungary a secure market for its wheat exports along with prices which made selling to Germany more advantageous to Hungary than selling the wheat on the world market.  German Involvement and its Post World War II Consequences The trade treaty Gyula Gömbös signed with Germany in 1934 was an important factor in stimulating the economy, but it also became a critical factor in deciding the fate of Hungary for the remainder of the decade and during the war. Though the agreement did give Hungary a favorable price for sales of her wheat, the money earned remained in an account in Germany and had to be used to purchase German industrial goods. By 1938 the terms of trade agreement provided Germany with economic domination over Hungary, along with most other countries in the region, and left Hungary inextricably tied to Germany for the duration of the interwar period and leading into World War II; Hungary, because of her unbreakable ties to Germany, ultimately joined the war on the side of the Axis powers. When the tides of the war began to turn, Hungary, as in World War I, was again on the losing side. As the allies began to defeat Germany the Red Army began liberating much of Eastern Europe, reaching Hungary in December 1944. The occupation of the Red Army which began in 1944 played a role in preparing Hungary for an eventual communist takeover.

Heat shock proteins are classified into six major families based on their molecular mass: small HSPs, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, and HSP110 HSP60 is implicated in mitochondrial protein import and macromolecular assembly. It may facilitate the correct folding of imported proteins, and may also prevent misfolding and promote the refolding and proper assembly of unfolded polypeptides generated under stress conditions in the mitochondrial matrix. HSP60 interacts with HRAS and with HBV protein X and HTLV-1 protein p40tax. HSP60 belongs to the chaperonin (HSP60) family. Note: This description may include information from UniProtKB. Alternate Names: 60 kDa chaperonin, Chaperonin 60, CPN60, Heat shock protein 60, HSP-60, HuCHA60, Mitochondrial matrix protein P1, P60 lymphocyte protein, HSPD1 Heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) is a mitochondrial chaperonin that is typically held responsible for the transportation and refolding of proteins from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix. In addition to its role as a heat shock protein, HSP60 functions as a chaperonin to assist in folding linear amino acid chains into their respective three-dimensional structure. Through the extensive study of groEL, HSP60’s bacterial homolog, HSP60 has been deemed essential in the synthesis and transportation of essential mitochondrial proteins from the cell's cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix. Further studies have linked HSP60 to diabetes, stress response, cancer and certain types of immunological disorders.  Discovery  Not much is known about the function of HSP60. Mammalian HSP60 was first reported as a mitochondrial P1 protein. It was subsequently cloned and sequenced by Radhey Gupta and coworkers. The amino acid sequence showed a strong homology to GroEL. It was initially believed that HSP60 functioned only in the mitochondria and that there was no equivalent protein located in the cytoplasm. Recent discoveries have discredited this claim and have suggested that there is a recognizable difference between HSP60 in the mitochondria and in the cytoplasm. A similar protein structure exists in the chloroplast of certain plants. This protein presence provides evidence for the evolutionary relationship of the development of the mitochondria and the chloroplast by means of endosymbiosis.  Structure  Under normal physiological conditions, HSP60 is a 60 kilodalton oligomer composed of monomers that form a complex arranged as two stacked heptameric rings. This double ring structure forms a large central cavity in which the unfolded protein binds via hydrophobic interactions. This structure is typically in equilibrium with each of its individual components: monomers, heptamers, and tetradeceamers. Recent studies have begun to suggest that in addition to its typical location in the mitochondria, HSP60 can also be found in the cytoplasm under normal physiological conditions. Each subunit of HSP60 has three domains: the apical domain, the equatorial domain, and the intermediate domain. The equatorial domain contains the binding site for ATP and for the other heptameric ring. The intermediate domain binds the equatorial domain and the apical domain together. The intermediate domain induces a conformational change when ATP is bound allowing for an alternation between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrate binding sites. In its inactive state, the protein is in a hydrophobic state. When activated by ATP, the intermediate domain undergoes a conformational change that exposes the hydrophilic region. This insures fidelity in protein binding. Chaperonin 10 aids HSP60 in folding by acting as a dome-like cover on the ATP active form of HSP60. This causes the central cavity to enlarge and aids in protein folding. See the above figure for further detail on the structure. A monoclonal antibody to HSP60 was used to stain human HeLa cells grown in tissue culture. The antibody reveals cellular mitochondria in red. The blue signal is due to a DNA binding dye which reveals cell nuclei. Antibody staining and image courtesy of EnCor Biotechnology Inc. Amino acid and structural sequence of HSP60 Protein.; The mitochondrial HSP60 sequence contains a series of G repeats at the C-terminal. The structure and function of this sequence is not quite known. The N-terminal contains a pre- sequence of hydroxylated amino acids, namely arginine, lysine, serine, and threonine, which serve as directors for the importation of the protein into the mitochondria. The predicted structure of HSP60 includes several vertical sine waves, alpha helices, beta sheets, and 90 degree turns. There are regions of hydrophobicity where the protein presumably spans the membrane. There are also three N-linked glycosylation sites at positions 104, 230, 436. The sequence and secondary structure for the mitochondrial protein are illustrated in the above image obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Newer information has begun to suggest that the HSP60 found in the mitochondria differs from that of the cytoplasm. With respect to the amino acid sequence, the cytoplasmic HSP60 has an N-terminal sequence not found in the mitochondrial protein. In gel electrophoresis analysis, significant differences were found in the migration of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial HSP60. The cytoplasmic HSP60 contains a signal sequence of 26 amino acids on the N terminus. This sequence is highly degenerate and is capable of folding into amphiphilic helix. Antibodies against HSP60 targeted both the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic form. Nonetheless, antibodies against the signal sequence targeted only the cytoplasmic form. Under normal physiological condition, both are found in relatively equal concentrations. In times of stress or high need of HSP60 in either the cytoplasm or the mitochondria, the cell is capable for compensating by increasing the presence of HSP60 in one compartment and decreasing its concentration in the opposite compartment.  Function   Common  Heat shock proteins are amongst the most evolutionarily conserved of proteins. The significant function, structural, and sequential homology between HSP60 and its prokaryotic homolog, groEL, demonstrates this level of conservation. Moreover, HSP60’s amino acid sequence bears a similarity to its homolog in plants, bacteria, and humans. Heat shock proteins are primarily responsible for maintaining the integrity of cellular proteins particularly in response to environmental changes. Stresses such as temperature, concentration imbalance, pH change, and toxins can all induce heat shock proteins to maintain the conformation of the cell’s proteins. HSP60 aids in the folding and conformation maintenance of approximately 15-30% of all cellular proteins. In addition to HSP60’s typical role as a heat shock protein, studies have shown that HSP60 plays an important role in the transport and maintenance of mitochondrial proteins as well as the transmission and replication of mitochondrial DNA.  Mitochondrial protein transport  HSP60 possesses two main responsibilities with respect to mitochondrial protein transport. It functions to catalyze the folding of proteins destined for the matrix and maintains protein in an unfolded state for transport across the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Many proteins are targeted for processing in the matrix of the mitochondria but then are quickly exported to other parts of the cell. The hydrophobic portion HSP60 is responsible for maintaining the unfolded conformation of the protein for transmembrane transport. Studies have shown how HSP60 binds to incoming proteins and induces conformational and structural changes. Subsequent changes in ATP concentrations hydrolyze the bonds between the protein and HSP60 which signals the protein to exit the mitochondria. HSP60 is also capable of distinguishing between proteins designated for export and proteins destined to remain in the mitochondrial matrix by looking for an amphiphilic alpha-helix of 15-20 residues. The existence of this sequence signals that the protein is to be exported while the absence signals that the protein is to remain in the mitochondria. The precise mechanism is not yet entirely understood.  DNA metabolism  In addition to its critical role in protein folding, HSP60 is involved in the replication and transmission of mitochondrial DNA. In extensive studies of HSP60 activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, scientists have proposed that HSP60 binds preferentially to the single stranded template DNA strand in a tetradecamer like complex Kaufman, BA. Studies on mitochondria DNA nucleoids in Saccharomyces cerevisia: identification of bifunctional proteins. In Genetics and Development, UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, TX. 241pp. This tetradecamer complex interacts with other transcriptional elements to serve as a regulatory mechanism for the replication and transmission of mitochondrial DNA. Mutagenic studies have further supported HSP60 regulatory involvement in the replication and transmission of mitochondrial DNA.Mutations in HSP60 increase the levels of mitochondrial DNA and result in subsequent transmission defects.  Cytoplasmic vs mitochondrial HSP60  In addition to the already illustrated structural differences between cytoplasmic and mitochondrial HSP60, there are marked functional differences. Studies have suggested that HSP60 plays a key role in preventing apoptosis in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic HSP60 forms a complex with proteins responsible for apoptosis and regulates the activity of these proteins. The cytoplasmic version is also involved in immune response and cancer. These two aspects will be elaborated on later. Extremely recent investigations have begun to suggest a regulatory correlation between HSP60 and the glycolytic enzyme, 6-phosphofructokinase-1. Although not much information is available, cytoplasmic HSP60 concentrations have influenced the expression of 6-phosphofructokinase in glycolysis. Despite these marked differences between the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial form, experimental analysis has shown that the cell is quickly capable of moving cytoplasmic HSP60 into the mitochondria if environmental conditions demand a higher presence of mitochondrial HSP60.  Synthesis and assembly  HSP60 is typically found in the mitochondria and has been found in organelles of endosymbiotic origin. HSP60 monomers form two heptameric rings that bind to the surface of linear proteins and catalyze their folding in an ATP dependent process. HSP60 subunits are encoded by nuclear genes and translated into the cytosol. These subunits then move into the mitochondria where they are processed by other HSP60 molecules. Several studies have shown how HSP60 proteins must be present in the mitochondria for the synthesis and assembly of additional HSP60 components. There is a direct positive correlation between the presence of HSP60 proteins in the mitochondria and the production of additional HSP60 protein complexes. The kinetics of assembly of HSP60 subunits into the 2-heptameric rings takes two minutes. The subsequent protease- resistant HSP60 is formed in a half-time of 5–10 minutes. This rapid synthesis indicates that there is an ATP-dependent interaction where the formed HSP60 complex stabilizes the intermediate of the HSP60 assembly complex, effectively serving as a catalyst. The necessity of preexisting HSP60 in order to synthesize additional HSP60 molecules supports the endosymbiotic theory of the origin of mitochondria. There must have been a rudimentary prokaryotic homologous protein that was capable of similar self-assembly.  Immunological role  As discussed above, HSP60 has generally been known as a chaperonin which assists in protein folding in mitochondria. However, some new research has indicated that HSP60 possibly plays a role in a “danger signal cascade” immune response. There is also mounting evidence that it plays a role in autoimmune disease. Infection and disease are extremely stressful on the cell. When a cell is under stress, it naturally increases the production of stress proteins, including heat shock proteins such as HSP60. In order for HSP60 to act as a signal it must be present in the extracellular environment. In recent research “it has emerged that…chaperonin 60 can be found on the surface of various prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, and can even be released from cells”. According to recent research, many different types of heat shock proteins are used in immune response signaling, but it appears that different proteins act and respond differently to other signaling molecules. HSP60 has been shown to be released from specific cells like peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) when there are lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or GroEL present. This suggests that the cell has different receptors and responses to human and bacterial HSP60. In addition, it has been shown that HSP60 has the capability “of activating monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells…and also of inducing secretion of a wide range of cytokines.” The fact that HSP60 responds to other signal molecules like LPS or GroEL and has the ability to activate certain types of cells supports the idea that HSP60 is part of a danger signal cascade which is involved in activating an immune response. There is however, a twist in the immunological role of HSP60. As mentioned above, there are two different types of HSP60 proteins, bacterial as well as mammalian. Since they are very similar in sequence, bacterial HSP60 wouldn’t be expected to cause a large immune response in humans. The immune system is “designed to ignore ‘self’, that is, host constituents; however, paradoxically, this is not the case with chaperonins”. It has been found that many anti-chaperonin antibodies exist and are associated with many autoimmune diseases. According to Ranford, et al. experiments have been performed which have shown that antibodies which are “generated by a human host after exposure to bacterial chaperonin 60 proteins” can cross-react with human chaperonin 60 proteins. Bacterial HSP60 is causing the immune system to create anti- chaperonin antibodies, even though bacterial and human HSP60 have similar protein sequences. These new antibodies are then recognizing and attacking human HSP60 which causes an autoimmune disease. This suggests that HSP60 may play a role in autoimmunity, however more research needs to be done in order to discover more completely its role in this disease.  Stress response  HSP60, as a mitochondrial protein, has been shown to be involved in stress response as well. The heat shock response is a homeostatic mechanism that protects a cell from damage by upregulating the expression of genes that code for HSP60. The upregulation of HSP60 production allows for the maintenance of other cellular processes occurring in the cell, especially during stressful times. In one experiment, investigators treated various mice with L-DOPA and discovered significant upregulation of HSP60 expression in the mitochondria and HSP70 expression in the cytoplasm. Researchers concluded that the heat shock signal pathway serves as “the basic mechanism of defense against neurotoxicity elicited by free radical oxygen and nitrogen species produced in aging and neurodegenerative disorders”. Several studies have shown that HSP60 and other heat shock proteins are necessary for cellular survival under toxic or stressful circumstances.  Relationship to cancer  Immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded human breast carcinoma using anti-Hsp60 RabMAb. Click on image for source. http://www.epitomics.com/images/products/1777IHC.jpg Human Hsp60, the product of the HSPD1 gene, is a Group I mitochondrial chaperonin, phylogenetically related to bacterial GroEL. Recently, the presence of Hsp60 outside the mitochondria and outside the cell, e.g. in circulating blood, has been reported [1], [2]. Although it is assumed that Hsp60 extra-mitochondrial molecule is identical to the mitochondrial one, this has not yet been fully elucidated. Despite the increasing amount of experimental evidences showing Hsp60 outside the cell, it is not yet clear how general this process is and what are the mechanisms responsible for Hsp60 translocation outside the cell. Neither of these questions has been definitively answered, whereas there is some information regarding extracellular Hsp70. This chaperone was also classically regarded as an intracellular protein like Hsp60, but in the last few years considerable evidences showed its pericellular and extracellular residence HSP60 has been shown to influence apoptosis in tumor cells which seems to be associated with a change in expression levels. There is some inconsistency in that some research shows a positive expression while other research shows a negative expression, and it seems to depend on the type of cancer. There are different hypotheses to explain the effects of positive versus negative expression. Positive expression seems to inhibit “apoptotic and necrotic cell death” while negative expression is thought to play a part “in activation of apoptosis”. As well as influencing apoptosis, HSP60 changes in expression level have been shown to be “useful new biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.” According to Lebret et al., a loss of HSP60 expression “indicates a poor prognosis and the risk of developing tumor infiltration” specifically with bladder carcinomas, but that does not necessarily hold true for other types of cancers. For example, ovarian tumors research has shown that over expression is correlated with a better prognosis while a decreased expression is correlated with an aggressive tumor. All this research indicates that it may be possible for HSP60 expression to be used in predicting survival for certain types of cancer and therefore may be able to identify patients who could benefit from certain treatments.

He is a former head men's basketball coach at Oregon State University and Brown University. He was a star forward as a player at Princeton University in the early 1980s and a bond trader during the 1990s. He currently is the vice president of player and organizational development for the New York Knicks. Robinson is the older brother of former U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama and the brother-in-law of former U.S. President Barack Obama. Robinson has been married twice and has four children. Early years Craig Malcolm Robinson was born on April 21, 1962, in DeYoung, Illinois, to Fraser Robinson, a city water plant employee and Democratic precinct captain, and Marian Robinson (née Shields), a secretary at Spiegel's catalog store. Robinson grew up in Chicago's South Shore with his younger sister, Michelle. He learned to read by the age of four at home and skipped the second grade in school. He attended the parochial Mount Carmel High School, graduating in 1979 as class valedictorian. When Robinson was considering what college to go to, his father insisted that he attend Princeton University for its Ivy League academics, rather than either the University of Washington or Purdue University, which offered scholarships and major basketball conference play. Playing career Robinson, who stands and played forward, was a two-time Ivy League Player of the Year at Princeton University, in 1981–1982 and 1982–1983, leading the league in field goal percentage both years. He is the fourth highest scorer in school history. He graduated in 1983 with a B.A. in Sociology. His senior thesis was on social stratification in prisons. Robinson and former teammate John W. Rogers, Jr. were among those invited to practice with Michael Jordan as he prepared for his comeback. Robinson was drafted in the fourth round of the 1983 NBA Draft by the Philadelphia 76ers, but never played in the league. He played professionally for the Manchester Giants in the British Basketball League for two seasons and returned to the U.S. in 1988 to become an assistant coach at the Illinois Institute of Technology, a position he held until 1990. Business career, marriage and family Robinson at the 2009 Obama Home State Inauguration Ball Robinson left basketball partly on the advice of his Princeton coach Pete Carril and pursued a business degree, earning an M.B.A. in Finance from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business in 1992. Robinson worked in the 1990s as a bond trader. He became a vice president at Continental Bank and worked there from 1990 to 1992. He was then a vice president, from 1992 to 1999, at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Later, he was a managing director and partner at Loop Capital Markets, a minority-owned boutique investment banking firm. When Robinson's sister, Michelle, began dating her law firm colleague, Barack Obama, who played basketball recreationally, she asked her brother to play with Obama and give her a character assessment so that she would know whether she could become serious with him. He gave an encouraging report to her. As he later related, \\"When I played basketball with Barack, he was quietly confident, which means he had good self-esteem without being cocky. He was certainly a team player – he wasn't a pig, he passed when he was supposed to pass, and he cut when he was supposed to cut. To me, that speaks to a lack of selfishness. He had natural leadership ability, because he didn't just pass me the ball because he was dating my sister. Whenever a player gets tired, he reverts to the player he truly is. That's how you tell. And we played for hours. That's how I could tell.\\" The story of this pick-up game and of a \\"test\\" being passed became a key part of the Obama narrative. While working in the business world, Robinson kept a hand in basketball by doing area scouting for Princeton and coaching one year at University of Chicago High School. He earned a high six-figure income in his business career, but he eventually decided the financial world had lost its appeal and found his luxury lifestyle was not enough to save his marriage to Janis Robinson. By 2000, Robinson was going through a divorce. Robinson has two children from his first marriage, a son Avery (born 1992) and a daughter Leslie (born 1996). Robinson remarried in June 2006 to his current wife Kelly. They became parents of sons Austin in 2010 and Aaron in 2012. His daughter Leslie played for the Princeton Tigers women's basketball team as a forward. Basketball career Robinson returned to coaching in 1999, making one-tenth his former salary. He was an assistant for six years to Bill Carmody at Northwestern University, where he was an effective recruiter. He then became a head coach at Brown University in 2006, where he ran a variation of the Princeton offense which he learned from Pete Carril during his years at Princeton. In improving a mid-level basketball program, he stressed work ethic, used tough love, and tried to improve the players' vocabulary. A fifth- place placing with a strong finish to the season garnered Robinson the Ivy League men's basketball Coach of the Year for the 2006–2007 season by Basketball-U.com. The following year, the Brown Bears finished second in the league, and their 19 wins for the season was a team record. Robinson introducing his sister, Michelle Obama, at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Robinson assisted his brother-in-law throughout the latter's 2008 presidential campaign, including campaigning for him during the Iowa caucuses and campaigning and giving speeches for him in a number of other states, sometimes combining campaigning with recruiting visits. He introduced his sister Michelle before her speech on August 25, 2008, the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, which gave him his largest national exposure. He was also on stage following Obama's victory speech in Grant Park after his election as president on November 4, 2008. On April 7, 2008, Robinson was hired as the Oregon State Beavers' head basketball coach following the team's winless Pacific-10 Conference record and overall 6–25 mark the year before. (Jesse Agel, Robinson's assistant of two years, took over Robinson's former position at Brown.) Oregon State got off to a fairly good start in Robinson's first year, starting with a 6–6 record; a January 2009 conference win over USC broke a nearly two-year Pac-10 losing streak and earned Robinson a congratulatory call from his brother-in-law, then-President- elect Obama. Robinson continued his tough love approach, tailored to strengthening each player's weaknesses. After that first win, Robinson's team won another six Pac-10 games, exceeding expectations for his first year on the job given that his personnel was essentially unchanged from the team's prior year. One key was that the offensive system he installed raised the team's collective field goal percentage almost 10 points. Some commentators felt he was deserving of consideration for the Pac-10 Coach of the Year award, and by late February, Robinson had hopes of the team getting a bid from one of the postseason tournaments. The team was indeed accepted into the 2009 College Basketball Invitational, where it went on to post a 5–1 record and captured its first post-season tournament championship ever with a final series victory over the UTEP Miners. Of the win, Robinson said, \\"I can't tell you how proud I am of these guys. ... This is a great story for anybody.\\" The Beavers finished with an 18–18 record for the season and had what Rivals.com deemed a top-25 recruiting class as well. In July 2009, President Obama alluded to the possibility of Robinson coaching elsewhere by saying: \\"Craig Robinson is an outstanding coach. ... Anybody in Oregon and anybody who knows sports knows he turned it around. He loves Corvallis, and I'm sure that as a young, successful coach, he's going to start getting offers.\\" Oregon State's 2009–10 season featured an inconsistent level of play in a conference dominated by parity, leading to an 8–10 regular season conference record for a tie for fifth place. They then lost in the first round of the Pac-10 Tournament. Despite the losing record, the team was invited to defend their championship at the 2010 College Basketball Invitational, but lacked focus and energy and were beaten easily in the first round, leaving them with an overall season record of 14–18. In March 2010, shortly before the end of the season, the university and Robinson agreed on a two-year contract extension that would keep him in place through the 2015–16 season. In April 2010, Robinson published his memoir, A Game of Character: A Family Journey from Chicago's Southside to the Ivy League and Beyond. The 2010–2011 season was one of regression for Oregon State, with the team falling to a 5–13, ninth-place finish in the conference and a sharply losing record overall. However, Robinson professed to not being overly worried or disappointed, saying he was encouraged by the development of some of the underclassmen. The Obamas showed their support for Robinson by attending an Oregon State game against Towson in November 2011. The 2011–2012 season saw a Robinson-era best for overall wins, 21, including a pair in the 2012 College Basketball Invitational, but a fourth consecutive losing record within the conference. It was the highest win total for the team since 1990, and the completion of it saw star guard Jared Cunningham leaving after his junior season and being selected in the NBA Draft, the first Beaver to be drafted in over a decade. In June 2012, construction began on a $15 million basketball practice facility that Robinson and previous coaches had long been campaigning for. Prior to the 2012–2013 season, Robinson characterized his squad as \\"probably the best team I've had.\\" But the Beavers went in the opposite direction by suffering one of their worst seasons ever, with a penchant for second-half collapses and end-of-game failures. Attendance at Gill Coliseum fell to half capacity, and the student section lost enthusiasm. The team finished with a dead-last 4–14 record in the conference and a 14–18 mark overall. Fans began calling for a change in coaches, but the university athletic director said, \\"Coach Robinson is our coach, and this administration is in full support of him.\\" Following the season, Robinson appeared on the CBS Sports Network as a studio analyst during the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship tournament. The 2013–2014 season saw the team improve to a 16–16 mark overall but have its sixth consecutive losing season in the conference. The team faced the loss of all five of its starters and its five top scorers following the season, due to graduation, transfers, and the like. In March 2014, the Pac-12 announced that Robinson would coach an all-star basketball team that would tour China in August.http://www.oregonlive.com/beavers/index.ssf/2014/03/craig_robinson_to_coach_pac-12.html On May 5, 2014, Robinson was fired from his position as the Oregon State men's head basketball coach. He was given a $4 million buyout of the three remaining years on his contract. The team had failed to make the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship or the National Invitation Tournament during Robinson's tenure. His overall 93–104 record did make him the fourth- winningest coach in team history. The Milwaukee Bucks hired Robinson as vice president of player and organizational development on August 15, 2016. After one season, he left the Bucks to join the New York Knicks in a similar position. Broadcasting career On October 7, 2014, ESPN announced the hiring of Robinson as a college basketball analyst. There, he began to work broadcasting games and doing studio work on ESPNU. After coaching On July 13, 2020, Robinson was named the Executive Director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches.

() (1816-1848) was a Discalced Carmelite nun who lived in Tours, France. She is best known for starting the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus which is now one of the approved Catholic devotions and for the Golden Arrow Prayer. She also introduced the \\"Little Sachet\\" sacramental. Life Marie was born on 4 October 1816 in Rennes, Brittany, to Peter and Frances Portier Eluere, and baptized in the Church of St. Germain. As a child she was called Perrine. Her mother died when she was twelve and she was sent to learn dressmaking with two of her paternal aunts. On 13 November 1839 she entered the Carmel at Tours, a carmel that had a particular devotion to the Sacred Heart. Perrine had a special devotion to the Holy Infancy of Jesus. She was professed as a Carmelite nun under the name Sister Mary St. Peter of the Holy Family on 8 June 1841.Janvier, Pierre Désiré. The Life of Sister Mary St. Peter, Carmelite of Tours, 1884 On 8 August 1843 Pope Gregory XVI promulgated a papal brief for the erection of a confraternity under the patronage of St. Louis IX of France for the reparation of blasphemy against the Holy Name of God. On the 26 Leo Dupont, the \\"holy man of Tours\\", distributed among several of the communities of Tours, a prayer in honor of the Holy Name of God. The prayers had been circulated among all the religious houses of the city, but despite being on friendly terms with the Carmelites, M. Dupont apparently forgot them. Sister Mary reported that eighteen days later, while commencing her evening prayer Jesus made her to understand that he would give her a prayer of reparation, a \\"golden dagger\\" for blasphemy against his Holy Name. He told her that the devotion He was entrusting to her was to have as its aim not only reparation for blasphemy, but also reparation for the profanation of the Holy Day of the Lord. She invariably declared that these \\"communications\\" were neither visions, nor apparitions; that the truths shown her were not exhibited under an eternal form, nor did she physically hear what she was commissioned to relate. From 1844 to 1847 Sister Marie of St Peter reported that she had \\"communications\\" from Jesus about spreading devotion to His Most Holy Face.\\"Sr. Mary of St. Peter and the Work of Reparation\\", Discalced Carmelites of Sacramento She reported that she experienced what her biographer, Janvier, terms \\"an interior vision\\". Repeatedly she describes that while at meditation \\"The Lord gave me to understand\\" particular insights. According to Sister Marie of St Peter, Jesus told her that He desired devotion to His Holy Face in reparation for sacrilege and blasphemy, which He described as being like a \\"poisoned arrow.\\" She wrote The Golden Arrow Holy Face Devotion (Prayer) which she said was dictated to her by Jesus. This prayer is now a well known Act of Reparation to Jesus Christ.Cruz, Joan Carroll, OCDS, Saintly Men of Modern Times (2003) pages 194-197Geoghegan, G. P., A Collection of my Favorite Prayers (Dec. 2, 2006) page 106 She wrote that Jesus told her: \\"Those who will contemplate the wounds on My Face here on earth, shall contemplate it radiant in heaven.” She also quoted Jesus as saying in her visions: “Oh if you only knew what great merit you acquire by saying even once, Admirable is the Name of God, in a spirit of reparation for blasphemy.\\" The devotion that she started was promoted by the Venerable Leo Dupont. Dupont prayed for and promoted the case for a devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus for around 30 years. Documents pertaining to the life of sister Marie of St. Peter and the devotion were kept by the Church. Eventually, in 1874 Charles-Théodore Colet was appointed as the new Archbishop of Tours. Archbishop Colet examined the documents and in 1876 gave permission for them to be published and the devotion encouraged. The Devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus was eventually approved by Pope Leo XIII in 1885. Almost 50 years later, another French Carmelite nun, Saint Therese of Lisieux wrote a number of poems and prayers in the 1890s that also helped spread the devotion to the Holy Face. In the 1930s, an Italian nun, Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli associated the image of the Holy Face of Jesus from the Shroud of Turin with the devotion and made the first Holy Face Medal. The first Holy Face Medal was offered to Pope Pius XII who accepted it and approved the devotion in 1958 and declared the Feast of the Holy Face of Jesus as Shrove Tuesday (the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday) for all Roman Catholics. Her autobiography and reported revelations are published in the book “The Golden Arrow”. The Little Gospel The \\"Little Gospel\\", or the Gospel of the Holy Name of Jesus, is a Roman Catholic devotion that according to tradition, was mystically revealed by Jesus Christ to Marie of St Peter in 1847, in a monastery in Tours, France. It consists of a tiny leaflet on which are printed the short Gospel of the Circumcision, which mentions the giving of the name \\"Jesus\\"; a picture of Christ; the initials IHS representing the Holy Name of Jesus; and some invocation together with the lines, \\"When Jesus was named — Satan was disarmed.\\" This leaflet is folded into a small square, enclosed in a small pouch, and distributed to the faithful, who are encouraged to frequently say: \\"Blessed be the Most Holy Name of Jesus without end\\" while wearing it.Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices page 319 See also *Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ *Holy Face of Jesus *Holy Name of Jesus *Maria Pia Mastena *Marie Martha Chambon *Oratory of the Holy Face *Sisters of the Reparation of the Holy Face Notes Sources * Ball, Ann.

The most popular example of a database model is the relational model, which uses a table-based format. Examples Common logical data models for databases include: * Hierarchical database model :It is the oldest form of data base model. It was developed by IBM for IMS (information Management System). It is a set of organized data in tree structure. DB record is a tree consisting of many groups called segments. It uses one to many relationships. The data access is also predictable. * Network model * Relational model * Entity–relationship model ** Enhanced entity–relationship model * Object model * Document model * Entity–attribute–value model * Star schema An object- relational database combines the two related structures. Physical data models include: * Inverted index * Flat file Other models include: * Associative model * Correlational model * Multidimensional model * Multivalue model * Semantic model * XML database * Named graph * Triplestore Relationships and functions A given database management system may provide one or more models. The optimal structure depends on the natural organization of the application's data, and on the application's requirements, which include transaction rate (speed), reliability, maintainability, scalability, and cost. Most database management systems are built around one particular data model, although it is possible for products to offer support for more than one model. Various physical data models can implement any given logical model. Most database software will offer the user some level of control in tuning the physical implementation, since the choices that are made have a significant effect on performance. A model is not just a way of structuring data: it also defines a set of operations that can be performed on the data. The relational model, for example, defines operations such as select (project) and join. Although these operations may not be explicit in a particular query language, they provide the foundation on which a query language is built. Flat model Flat File Model The flat (or table) model consists of a single, two-dimensional array of data elements, where all members of a given column are assumed to be similar values, and all members of a row are assumed to be related to one another. For instance, columns for name and password that might be used as a part of a system security database. Each row would have the specific password associated with an individual user. Columns of the table often have a type associated with them, defining them as character data, date or time information, integers, or floating point numbers. This tabular format is a precursor to the relational model. Early data models These models were popular in the 1960s, 1970s, but nowadays can be found primarily in old legacy systems. They are characterized primarily by being navigational with strong connections between their logical and physical representations, and deficiencies in data independence. Hierarchical model Hierarchical Model In a hierarchical model, data is organized into a tree-like structure, implying a single parent for each record. A sort field keeps sibling records in a particular order. Hierarchical structures were widely used in the early mainframe database management systems, such as the Information Management System (IMS) by IBM, and now describe the structure of XML documents. This structure allows one-to- many relationship between two types of data. This structure is very efficient to describe many relationships in the real world; recipes, table of contents, ordering of paragraphs/verses, any nested and sorted information. This hierarchy is used as the physical order of records in storage. Record access is done by navigating downward through the data structure using pointers combined with sequential accessing. Because of this, the hierarchical structure is inefficient for certain database operations when a full path (as opposed to upward link and sort field) is not also included for each record. Such limitations have been compensated for in later IMS versions by additional logical hierarchies imposed on the base physical hierarchy. Network model Network Model The network model expands upon the hierarchical structure, allowing many-to-many relationships in a tree-like structure that allows multiple parents. It was most popular before being replaced by the relational model, and is defined by the CODASYL specification. The network model organizes data using two fundamental concepts, called records and sets. Records contain fields (which may be organized hierarchically, as in the programming language COBOL). Sets (not to be confused with mathematical sets) define one-to-many relationships between records: one owner, many members. A record may be an owner in any number of sets, and a member in any number of sets. A set consists of circular linked lists where one record type, the set owner or parent, appears once in each circle, and a second record type, the subordinate or child, may appear multiple times in each circle. In this way a hierarchy may be established between any two record types, e.g., type A is the owner of B. At the same time another set may be defined where B is the owner of A. Thus all the sets comprise a general directed graph (ownership defines a direction), or network construct. Access to records is either sequential (usually in each record type) or by navigation in the circular linked lists. The network model is able to represent redundancy in data more efficiently than in the hierarchical model, and there can be more than one path from an ancestor node to a descendant. The operations of the network model are navigational in style: a program maintains a current position, and navigates from one record to another by following the relationships in which the record participates. Records can also be located by supplying key values. Although it is not an essential feature of the model, network databases generally implement the set relationships by means of pointers that directly address the location of a record on disk. This gives excellent retrieval performance, at the expense of operations such as database loading and reorganization. Popular DBMS products that utilized it were Cincom Systems' Total and Cullinet's IDMS. IDMS gained a considerable customer base; in the 1980s, it adopted the relational model and SQL in addition to its original tools and languages. Most object databases (invented in the 1990s) use the navigational concept to provide fast navigation across networks of objects, generally using object identifiers as \\"smart\\" pointers to related objects. Objectivity/DB, for instance, implements named one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to- many named relationships that can cross databases. Many object databases also support SQL, combining the strengths of both models. Inverted file model In an inverted file or inverted index, the contents of the data are used as keys in a lookup table, and the values in the table are pointers to the location of each instance of a given content item. This is also the logical structure of contemporary database indexes, which might only use the contents from a particular columns in the lookup table. The inverted file data model can put indexes in a set of files next to existing flat database files, in order to efficiently directly access needed records in these files. Notable for using this data model is the ADABAS DBMS of Software AG, introduced in 1970. ADABAS has gained considerable customer base and exists and supported until today. In the 1980s it has adopted the relational model and SQL in addition to its original tools and languages. Document-oriented database Clusterpoint uses inverted indexing model to provide fast full-text search for XML or JSON data objects for example. Relational model Two tables with a relationship The relational model was introduced by E.F. Codd in 1970E.F. Codd (1970). \\"A relational model of data for large shared data banks\\". In: Communications of the ACM archive. Vol 13. Issue 6(June 1970). pp.377-387. as a way to make database management systems more independent of any particular application. It is a mathematical model defined in terms of predicate logic and set theory, and implementations of it have been used by mainframe, midrange and microcomputer systems. The products that are generally referred to as relational databases in fact implement a model that is only an approximation to the mathematical model defined by Codd. Three key terms are used extensively in relational database models: relations, attributes, and domains. A relation is a table with columns and rows. The named columns of the relation are called attributes, and the domain is the set of values the attributes are allowed to take. The basic data structure of the relational model is the table, where information about a particular entity (say, an employee) is represented in rows (also called tuples) and columns. Thus, the \\"relation\\" in \\"relational database\\" refers to the various tables in the database; a relation is a set of tuples. The columns enumerate the various attributes of the entity (the employee's name, address or phone number, for example), and a row is an actual instance of the entity (a specific employee) that is represented by the relation. As a result, each tuple of the employee table represents various attributes of a single employee. All relations (and, thus, tables) in a relational database have to adhere to some basic rules to qualify as relations. First, the ordering of columns is immaterial in a table. Second, there can't be identical tuples or rows in a table. And third, each tuple will contain a single value for each of its attributes. A relational database contains multiple tables, each similar to the one in the \\"flat\\" database model. One of the strengths of the relational model is that, in principle, any value occurring in two different records (belonging to the same table or to different tables), implies a relationship among those two records. Yet, in order to enforce explicit integrity constraints, relationships between records in tables can also be defined explicitly, by identifying or non- identifying parent-child relationships characterized by assigning cardinality (1:1, (0)1:M, M:M). Tables can also have a designated single attribute or a set of attributes that can act as a \\"key\\", which can be used to uniquely identify each tuple in the table. A key that can be used to uniquely identify a row in a table is called a primary key. Keys are commonly used to join or combine data from two or more tables. For example, an Employee table may contain a column named Location which contains a value that matches the key of a Location table. Keys are also critical in the creation of indexes, which facilitate fast retrieval of data from large tables. Any column can be a key, or multiple columns can be grouped together into a compound key. It is not necessary to define all the keys in advance; a column can be used as a key even if it was not originally intended to be one. A key that has an external, real-world meaning (such as a person's name, a book's ISBN, or a car's serial number) is sometimes called a \\"natural\\" key. If no natural key is suitable (think of the many people named Brown), an arbitrary or surrogate key can be assigned (such as by giving employees ID numbers). In practice, most databases have both generated and natural keys, because generated keys can be used internally to create links between rows that cannot break, while natural keys can be used, less reliably, for searches and for integration with other databases. (For example, records in two independently developed databases could be matched up by social security number, except when the social security numbers are incorrect, missing, or have changed.) The most common query language used with the relational model is the Structured Query Language (SQL).  Dimensional model  The dimensional model is a specialized adaptation of the relational model used to represent data in data warehouses in a way that data can be easily summarized using online analytical processing, or OLAP queries. In the dimensional model, a database schema consists of a single large table of facts that are described using dimensions and measures. A dimension provides the context of a fact (such as who participated, when and where it happened, and its type) and is used in queries to group related facts together. Dimensions tend to be discrete and are often hierarchical; for example, the location might include the building, state, and country. A measure is a quantity describing the fact, such as revenue. It is important that measures can be meaningfully aggregated—for example, the revenue from different locations can be added together. In an OLAP query, dimensions are chosen and the facts are grouped and aggregated together to create a summary. The dimensional model is often implemented on top of the relational model using a star schema, consisting of one highly normalized table containing the facts, and surrounding denormalized tables containing each dimension. An alternative physical implementation, called a snowflake schema, normalizes multi-level hierarchies within a dimension into multiple tables. A data warehouse can contain multiple dimensional schemas that share dimension tables, allowing them to be used together. Coming up with a standard set of dimensions is an important part of dimensional modeling. Its high performance has made the dimensional model the most popular database structure for OLAP. Post-relational database models Products offering a more general data model than the relational model are sometimes classified as post- relational.Introducing databases by Stephen Chu, in Conrick, M. (2006) Health informatics: transforming healthcare with technology, Thomson, , p. 69. Alternate terms include \\"hybrid database\\", \\"Object-enhanced RDBMS\\" and others. The data model in such products incorporates relations but is not constrained by E.F. Codd's Information Principle, which requires that Some of these extensions to the relational model integrate concepts from technologies that pre-date the relational model. For example, they allow representation of a directed graph with trees on the nodes. The German company sones implements this concept in its GraphDB. Some post-relational products extend relational systems with non-relational features. Others arrived in much the same place by adding relational features to pre-relational systems. Paradoxically, this allows products that are historically pre-relational, such as PICK and MUMPS, to make a plausible claim to be post-relational. The resource space model (RSM) is a non-relational data model based on multi-dimensional classification.  Graph model  Graph databases allow even more general structure than a network database; any node may be connected to any other node.  Multivalue model  Multivalue databases are \\"lumpy\\" data, in that they can store exactly the same way as relational databases, but they also permit a level of depth which the relational model can only approximate using sub-tables. This is nearly identical to the way XML expresses data, where a given field/attribute can have multiple right answers at the same time. Multivalue can be thought of as a compressed form of XML. An example is an invoice, which in either multivalue or relational data could be seen as (A) Invoice Header Table - one entry per invoice, and (B) Invoice Detail Table - one entry per line item. In the multivalue model, we have the option of storing the data as on table, with an embedded table to represent the detail: (A) Invoice Table - one entry per invoice, no other tables needed. The advantage is that the atomicity of the Invoice (conceptual) and the Invoice (data representation) are one-to-one. This also results in fewer reads, less referential integrity issues, and a dramatic decrease in the hardware needed to support a given transaction volume.  Object-oriented database models  Object-Oriented Model In the 1990s, the object-oriented programming paradigm was applied to database technology, creating a new database model known as object databases. This aims to avoid the object-relational impedance mismatch - the overhead of converting information between its representation in the database (for example as rows in tables) and its representation in the application program (typically as objects). Even further, the type system used in a particular application can be defined directly in the database, allowing the database to enforce the same data integrity invariants. Object databases also introduce the key ideas of object programming, such as encapsulation and polymorphism, into the world of databases. A variety of these ways have been tried for storing objects in a database. Some products have approached the problem from the application programming end, by making the objects manipulated by the program persistent. This typically requires the addition of some kind of query language, since conventional programming languages do not have the ability to find objects based on their information content. Others have attacked the problem from the database end, by defining an object- oriented data model for the database, and defining a database programming language that allows full programming capabilities as well as traditional query facilities. Object databases suffered because of a lack of standardization: although standards were defined by ODMG, they were never implemented well enough to ensure interoperability between products. Nevertheless, object databases have been used successfully in many applications: usually specialized applications such as engineering databases or molecular biology databases rather than mainstream commercial data processing. However, object database ideas were picked up by the relational vendors and influenced extensions made to these products and indeed to the SQL language. An alternative to translating between objects and relational databases is to use an object-relational mapping (ORM) library.

It aired on 29 April 2007, as part of BBC's Body Image series including F*** Off, I'm Fat and F*** Off, I'm a Hairy Woman. It was presented by ginger haired comedian Dan Wright, and followed his attempts to get a date with any woman despite his hair colour. Wright's comedy partner Steve Marsh also appeared. The documentary is about the life of a ginger haired person, and how hard they have it amongst the world around them. It aims to persuade people who discriminate against ginger hair to change their ways and respect ginger haired people just like any other person. It contained interviews with ginger haired actors Charlie Clements (Bradley Branning in EastEnders), in which he spoke about becoming typecast as a ginger actor, and about Bradley's portrayal as a geek in the show and Jennie McAlpine (Fiz Brown in Coronation Street), who said she had never been bullied for being ginger. Several members of the public were also interviewed, including a redheaded man who had taken to dying his hair blonde to avoid abuse, and another ginger who moved to the United States, to avoid what he considered discrimination in the United Kingdom. Helped by an advertising firm, Saatchi and Saatchi, Dan Wright also launched an advertising campaign with the slogan \\"You Can't Beat a Ginger\\", containing three billboard messages; one showing Boris Becker alongside Tim Henman, with the number of Grand Slams they had won underneath their pictures (Becker's 6, and Henman's 0). Similar adverts were created with Nicole Kidman (1 Oscar, 3 Golden Globes and a BAFTA) and Cameron Diaz (nothing) and Winston Churchill (1 World War) and Adolf Hitler (no World Wars). One of the participants on F*** Off, I'm Ginger started a blog entitled Militant Ginger as a result of this program, which occasionally addresses issues of 'ginger discrimination' and 'gingerism.'

H. Richardson, with landscaping by Frederick Law Olmsted. It is located on Main Street in the village of North Easton in Easton, Massachusetts, immediately adjacent to another Richardson building, Ames Free Library. History A drawing of the Hall by Harry Fenn, currently in the Metropolitan Museum of Art The hall was built 1879-1881 as a gift to the town from children of Congressman Oakes Ames. It was originally intended for use as a Town Hall but in practice has mainly served as a meeting space for private groups. It was due to dissent amongst different groups in the town at the time that the Oakes Ames Memorial Hall was never used for its intended purpose as the town hall, and to this day the Frothingham House is used for this purpose. Features The structure's main facade, altogether long by deep, presents an arcade of five massive arches with a row of windows set above and an octagonal tower at its right corner. Its first floor is constructed of native, pinkish- gray North Easton granite with Longmeadown brownstone trim. The second floor is brick, with a north-facing dormer half finished in timber and stucco. The steeply peaked roof above is finished in red tile. The front's third-floor, dormer window is wreathed with sculpted foliage, and displays the initials O. A. and twelve signs of the zodiac. The main hall inside is on the second floor, and long by wide with a height. It contains a stage (26 by 18 feet). This arrangement proved impractical due to inadequate stairway access to the hall. The first floor contains a small meeting room and service rooms; the attic contains a Masonic hall.

Born and raised in Zionsville, Indiana, Stevens starred on the Zionsville Community High School basketball team, setting four school records. After high school, he attended DePauw University, where he played basketball and earned a degree in economics. He made the all-conference team multiple times and was a three-time Academic All-America nominee. He transitioned into coaching after quitting his job at Eli Lilly and Company, joining the basketball program at Butler University as a volunteer prior to the 2000–01 season. He was promoted to a full-time assistant coach the following season. After five seasons in the role, he assumed the position of head coach on April 4, 2007, after Todd Lickliter left to coach the Iowa Hawkeyes. In his first year, Stevens led Butler to 30 wins, becoming the third-youngest head coach in NCAA Division I history to have a 30-win season. In 2010, his third year as head coach, Stevens broke the NCAA record for most wins in a coach's first three years, exceeding the previous record by eight wins. In the NCAA Tournament, Stevens coached Butler to the first Final Four in school history, while also becoming the second-youngest head coach to make an NCAA National Championship game, losing 61–59 to Duke. With the following season's team also making the Final Four, Stevens became the youngest coach to go to two Final Fours.Butler earns return trip to Final Four after beating Florida in OT Stevens coached the Bulldogs in their second consecutive national championship game on April 4, 2011, where the team again lost, this time to the Connecticut Huskies. Stevens was regularly named a finalist for Horizon League Coach of the Year award, winning twice, and was also a nominee for both the Hugh Durham Award and Jim Phelan Award in every year of his college career. This success garnered him a job with the NBA's Boston Celtics in 2013, when he signed a six-year, $22-million-dollar contract to become head coach. After undertaking a rebuild early in his career, Stevens has led the Celtics to the NBA playoffs every year since 2014, won a division championship, and appeared in the Eastern Conference Finals in 2017, 2018, and 2020. He has gained a reputation as one of the NBA's best coaches, with his motion offense and stingy defense earning plaudits from fans, peers, and players. Early life Stevens grew up in Zionsville, Indiana, where he developed his love for basketball. Starting at age five, Stevens would watch taped basketball games \\"before he went to afternoon kindergarten\\". His father often drove him to Bloomington to watch Indiana Hoosiers games. \\"It's hard not to be [in love with basketball] when you're a kid growing up in Indiana\\", Stevens later said. For his eighth birthday, Stevens received a new basketball hoop. \\"It's so much fun to dream in your driveway,\\" he later remarked. \\"That's where my friends and I hung out. It was a lot of fun to grow up in that era.\\" When a friend, Brandon Monk, had a basketball court installed in his back yard, Stevens \\"appeared instantaneously.\\" He was so dedicated to the game that he would bring the unprepared ingredients for grilled cheese sandwiches to Monk's house so that he would not waste time waiting for the sandwiches to cook. Monk's court soon became a gathering place, where kids from Zionsville and the surrounding areas would hold pickup games. These games helped develop Stevens's competitive streak. Besides playing basketball, the young Stevens also enjoyed solving puzzles, a skill he later applied to analyzing opposing teams to find their weaknesses. Stevens attended Zionsville Community High School, where he became a star basketball player. He wore No. 31 in high school in honor of Indiana Pacers guard Reggie Miller. During his freshman year, he got up early to practice shooting at a local gym before school. The hard work paid off as Stevens made the varsity team that year. By the time his high school career was complete, Stevens had set school records for career scoring, assists, steals, and three-point field goals. As of 2017, he still holds the records for career points per game average (26.8), total career points (1508), assists (444), and steals (156), as well as the single-season points record (644 in 1995). Stevens was named to the all-conference team three times. In 1995, he was the sectional MVP and the leading scorer in state sectional play (32.3 ppg). Stevens made the academic all-state first team and received the Straight A Gold Medal Award all four years. He was a member of the National Honor Society, graduating seventh in his class of 165. He earned three letters in basketball, three in track, and one in baseball during his days at Zionsville. During summers, he traveled the country playing AAU basketball. Despite his strong passion for the game, Stevens realized that his basketball skills were modest and not likely to get him very far. He chose to attend academically oriented DePauw University, where he played in all 101 DePauw games, earning four varsity letters. He earned multiple all-conference and academic all- conference awards, and was a three-time Academic All-America nominee. He was a team captain his senior year, and averaged more than 8 points per game three of his four years. His career highs were 24 points and 8 rebounds in a game. After his senior year, Stevens received the Coaches' Award. Coach Bill Fenlon later described Stevens as \\"one of the most selfless, team-oriented person I've ever been around.\\" At DePauw, Stevens was a member of the Management Fellows Honors Program and the DePauw Community Services' Sports Night executive board. He was also a brother of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. During summer vacations, Stevens spent time teaching at Butler basketball camps. He was named to the Dean's list and graduated in 1999 with a degree in economics. College coaching career In the summer of 2000, Stevens was offered the opportunity to volunteer in the Butler basketball office. He ran the idea of quitting his job at Eli Lilly by then-longtime girlfriend Tracy Wilhelmy. She thought about it for two hours before telling him to go for it. \\"Now, it looks like a great idea,\\" Stevens later remarked. \\"At the time, I thought it was something I really wanted to try.\\" Tracy began law school to get a J.D. degree that could support the couple if things did not work out for Stevens. \\"We were 23 and realized this was our chance,\\" Tracy later said. \\"Five years down the road, we were probably not going to be in a position to do that. The more success you had at Lilly, the harder it would be to leave.\\" Stevens planned to live in a friend's basement and took a job at Applebee's to pay the bills. Before he started training at Applebee's, he was offered a low- paying administrative position as coordinator of basketball operations under then-coach Thad Matta. The position had opened up when assistant coach Jamal Meeks resigned after being arrested on solicitation and drug charges, of which he was later acquitted. Years later, Matta recalled, \\"[Stevens] was just a hungry young kid that was desperate to get into coaching. He had a great passion and was willing to take a risk to get into the coaching profession.\\" After Matta left the school following the 2000–01 season, new head coach Todd Lickliter promoted Stevens to a full-time assistant coach. Under Lickliter, Stevens was active in every aspect of the game: skills instruction, game preparation, in-game coaching, and recruiting. Butler was 131–61 during Stevens' time as an assistant coach. Named head coach On April 2, 2007, Lickliter resigned in order to take the head-coaching position at the University of Iowa. The Butler players had a meeting with athletic director Barry Collier, urging him to promote from within. Collier, having spent the entire season observing the assistant coaches' interaction with the team, agreed. The day after Lickliter resigned Stevens and Butler's two other assistant coaches interviewed for the job. Within 24 hours of the interviews Stevens was named Butler's new head coach. According to Collier, Stevens had something older, outside candidates could never match: six years of experience learning the Butler system, dubbed \\"The Butler Way\\" by Collier. \\"Age wasn't a factor because I'd seen his ability shine through during the course of the season,\\" Collier said. 2007–08 season Drake At the start of the 2007–08 season, Stevens was the second youngest coach in Division I basketball. He got off to a fast start, winning his first eight games before falling to Wright State 43–42. Legendary coach Bob Knight, whose Texas Tech team was an early victim, said \\"I wish we played as smart as they do.\\" Virginia Tech coach Seth Greenberg added \\"they've got toughness about them and they expect to win.\\" Midway through Stevens' first season, with the Bulldogs at 12–1, The New York Times wrote \\"so far, Stevens has made the transition [to head coach] look easy.\\" The Times went on to state that Stevens had the calm and composure of a seasoned veteran. \\"You've got a lot of people always looking for the next step. And that's not what I was doing. I was just trying to figure out a way to win the next game and think like a head coach.\\" Stevens said. Butler ended the regular season with a 27–3 record, taking first place in the Horizon League with a 16–2 in conference mark. The team beat Illinois- Chicago 66–50 and Cleveland State 70–55 to claim the league's tournament title and an automatic bid to the 2008 NCAA tournament. Butler was awarded the seven seed in the East Regional. They beat tenth-seeded South Alabama 81–61 in the first round, before falling to second-seeded Tennessee 76–71 in overtime. Stevens ended up with a school and Horizon league record 30 wins, beating several big name schools – Michigan, Texas Tech, Florida State, Ohio State – along the way. In so doing, he became the third-youngest head coach in NCAA Division I history to lead a team to 30 wins in a season, and became the fourth-winningest first-year coach. Butler was nationally ranked for a school and league record 19 consecutive weeks. Butler's 30–4 record was the best among teams that did not reach the Final Four. Stevens was a finalist for the Hugh Durham Award, losing to Keno Davis of Drake, and a finalist for the Jim Phelan National Coach of the Year Award, losing to Bo Ryan. At the conclusion of the season, Butler signed Stevens to a seven-year contract. \\"We are extremely excited to reach this long-term agreement to have Brad continue to lead our program,\\" Collier remarked. 2008–09 season Butler lost four starters after the 2007–08 season, and was picked to finish fifth in the Horizon league during the 2008–09 season. The team got off to a 12–1 start that won Stevens the Hugh Durham mid-season coaching award. On February 5, Stevens notched his 50th win as Butler beat Detroit 66–61. In so doing, Stevens became the sixth head coach in NCAA history to reach 50 wins in 56 games or fewer. Butler finished first in the Horizon League with a 15–3 in conference record, defying preseason expectations. Butler lost the Horizon League tournament final 57–54 to Cleveland State, but made the NCAA tournament as an at-large selection. The team received the nine seed in the South Regional, and lost to eighth-seeded Louisiana State in the first round by a score of 75–71 to finish the year at 26–6 overall. Stevens' 56–10 two-year record places him second only to Bill Guthridge (58) in total wins during one's first two years as head coach. Stevens was a finalist for both the Hugh Durham and Jim Phelan Awards for the second straight year and was named the Horizon League Coach of the Year. He was also named as a finalist for the Henry Iba Coach of the Year Award. Stevens was given a one-year contract extension at the conclusion of the season. 2009–10 season Fueled in large part by Gordon Hayward's and Shelvin Mack's roles in leading Team USA to the gold medal in the FIBA Under-19 World Championship during the off-season, Butler began the season ranked 10th in the Coaches' Poll and 11th in the AP Poll. A few commentators picked the Bulldogs as a possible \\"sleeper team\\" to make the Final Four. Stevens was not so sure, privately telling his father, \\"We have a really good team, and I'm not sure how far we can go this year, but next year, we ought to go really far.\\" Butler got off to a mediocre start, losing twice in the 76 Classic 82–73 to 22nd-ranked Minnesota and to 19th- ranked Clemson 70–69. After the tournament Butler's record stood at 4–2 and the team dropped to #23 in the AP Poll and #20 in the Coaches' Poll. Butler won its next two games before falling to 13th-ranked Georgetown 72–65 in the Jimmy V Classic. The team won its next two games beating #15 Ohio State 74–66 and edging out former conference rival Xavier 69–68, both at home. After losing 67–57 at UAB three days later, Butler stood at 9–4 and fell out of the AP rankings. However, the team remained in the Coaches Poll at #23. Stevens rallied the team, and they proceeded to win 16 straight games before facing Siena in a BracketBusters game. Butler beat Siena 70–53 and Stevens tied the NCAA record for most wins (81) by a head coach in his first three seasons set by Mark Few of Gonzaga in 2002 and tied by Mark Fox of Nevada in 2007. On February 26, 2010, Butler traveled to Valparaiso for their regular season finale. Leading scorer Gordon Hayward was sidelined with lower back pain, but the team still won 74–69. In so doing, Stevens broke the coaching record he had tied the prior week and Butler completed an 18–0 undefeated conference schedule. It was Butler's first undefeated conference record since joining the Horizon League, and first since Joe Sexson led the 1978 team to a 6–0 record in the now defunct Indiana Collegiate Conference. Stevens earned his third straight regular-season conference championship. Detroitalt=Stevens with his mouth open to shout, and his hands clapping. In the Horizon league tournament, Stevens' Bulldogs used their home-court advantage to beat Milwaukee 68–59 in the semi-finals and to beat Wright State 70–45 in the finals. The win earned the team an automatic bid into the 2010 NCAA tournament, and completed a 20–0 run through league play. Stevens became the first coach to lead a Horizon League team to both an undefeated regular season and conference tournament since the league was formed in 1979. Stevens was also the only coach in Division I to lead his team to an undefeated conference schedule during the 2009–10 season. NCAA tournament For their season, the Bulldogs were ranked 8th in the final pre-NCAA tournament Coaches' Poll and 11th in the corresponding AP Poll. On Selection Sunday, the Bulldogs were seeded fifth in the West regional of the NCAA tournament and given a first- round match up with twelfth seeded UTEP on March 18. Many basketball commentators picked UTEP to pull the upset, and at halftime it looked like they might be right, as UTEP led 33–27. Stevens made a number of halftime adjustments, and the Bulldogs came out firing on all cylinders in the second half. The team dominated the second half and won the game 77–59. Butler next faced off with thirteenth seeded Murray State. The game was close throughout, but Butler emerged victorious 54–52 when Hayward deflected a Murray State pass into the back court with less than five seconds on the clock. The win gave Stevens the first Sweet Sixteen appearance of his career. On March 25, 2010, Butler faced top-seeded Syracuse. The Bulldogs got off to a good start, jumping out to a 12–1 lead and a 35–25 halftime advantage. Syracuse rallied in the second half, taking its first lead of the game, 40–39, off a Wes Johnson three-pointer. Stevens called timeout and Butler regained the lead on its next possession, stopping the run. At the 5:32 mark, Syracuse got a rare fast break opportunity that ended with a dunk and 54–50 lead. Stevens again called time out and re-focused the team. Butler responded by holding Syracuse scoreless for the next 5 minutes, taking a 60–54 lead with 0:59 to go. Butler held on to win 63–59, advancing to the Elite Eight for the first time in school history. Two days later, Stevens' Bulldogs met second-seeded Kansas State in the regional finals. Perhaps feeling the effects of their double overtime 101–96 win two days prior, Kansas State got off to a slow start, scoring just 20 points in the first half to trail 27–20. Butler kept the lead in the upper single digits for most of the second half, before Kansas State went on a 13–2 run and took a 52–51 lead. Stevens immediately called time out and re-focused the team. \\"Play your game. Just play your game,\\" he told them. On the ensuing possession, Butler regained the lead for good. They outscored Kansas State 12–4 the rest of the way and won the game 63–56. In the post game celebration, Stevens and walk-on forward Emerson Kampen connected on a flying back-bump that became one of the iconic images of the tournament. The win earned the Bulldogs a trip back to Indianapolis for the first Final Four appearance in school and Horizon League history. The win made Stevens, at age 33, the youngest coach to lead a team to the Final Four since Bob Knight made his first Final Four appearance at age 32 in 1973. Butler became the smallest school (enrollment 4,200) to make the Final Four since seeding began in 1979. =Final Four= On April 3, Stevens and the Butler Bulldogs faced off with Michigan State in the national semi-finals. Michigan State took an early 14–7 lead, and Matt Howard got in early foul trouble, sitting most the first half. Stevens kept the team focused with a \\"next man up\\" attitude and the game was tied at 28 at halftime. The second half was dominated by tight defense for both sides. With 2:45 to go in the game, the score was 47–44 Butler. Michigan State called a time out to set up a play. Stevens correctly anticipated the play call and had Ronald Nored, the team's best defender, switch onto Korie Lucious off a screen. Nored stole the ball and Shawn Vanzant got fouled on the resulting run out, hitting 1 of 2. Trailing 50–49 with under 30 seconds remaining, Michigan State came up empty and was forced to foul. Nored hit both foul shots, giving Butler a 52–49 lead. After a Michigan State time out, Stevens had his team foul Lucious with 2 seconds remaining to prevent a potentially game tying 3-pointer. After making the first, Lucious intentionally missed the second free throw. Hayward came down with the rebound to seal the victory. Butler became the first team since the shot clock was adopted for the 1985–86 season to hold five straight tournament opponents under 60 points. On April 5, 2010, Butler and Duke faced off in what The New York Times called \\"the most eagerly awaited championship game in years\\". Late in the first half, Duke went on an 8–0 run to take a 26–20 lead. Stevens called a timeout. With starters Matt Howard and Ronald Nored on the bench in foul trouble, Stevens was forced to call on backup center Avery Jukes who came up big for Butler. Jukes scored 10 first half points, tying his season high. At half time, Duke's lead stood at 33–32. The second half was played very closely, with neither team taking a substantial lead. With 3:16 to play, Duke took a 60–55 lead on two made free throws by Nolan Smith. Butler cut the lead to one point in the final minute and, after a missed Kyle Singler jump shot with 36 seconds remaining, got a chance to retake the lead. Butler was unable to initiate their offense and Stevens called a timeout to set up a play. A failed inbounds attempt and a timeout later, Hayward missed a baseline fade- away jumper and Brian Zoubek came down with the rebound for Duke. He was quickly fouled with less than 4 seconds remaining. Hayward narrowly missed a desperation half-court shot as time expired, making the final margin 61–59. The loss snapped Butler's 25-game winning streak, the longest in school history. Butler became the smallest school to play for a National Championship since Jacksonville in 1970. Stevens became the second-youngest head coach to coach in the NCAA National Championship Game, behind Branch McCracken who led the Indiana Hoosiers to the 1940 National Championship at age 31. Stevens was named as both a Hugh Durham and Jim Phelan Award finalist for the third consecutive year, losing to Mike Young and Jamie Dixon respectively. He was also a finalist for the Skip Prosser Man of the Year Award, which was won by Bob Marlin. Butler finished the year ranked #2 in the Coaches' Poll, the highest ranking in school history. The school was ranked for 19 consecutive weeks, tying the school record. 2010 off-season After the end of the 2009–10 season, Stevens and Butler continued to attract considerable attention. President Barack Obama personally called Stevens to congratulate him on Butler's season. David Letterman had Stevens on his show for a guest appearance. Butler admissions inquiries increased by 67%. Stevens received fan letters from around the world, and his phone rang off the hook. He was invited to throw the ceremonial first pitch before the Chicago Cubs vs. Florida Marlins game in Chicago on May 10. \\"It's all been very surreal,\\" Stevens said. \\"If you are the runner-up, you don't expect to talk to the president.\\" \\"It's been a little overwhelming, because I'm a pretty simple guy,\\" he added. The 2009–10 season also helped increase Butler's recruiting profile. Asked if the increased fame would change things, Stevens said it better not spoil him or the university. \\"I look at this new challenge of not changing and sticking to your core values and making sure you remain humble as a great coaching opportunity.\\" 2010–11 season Rankings by ESPN's Andy Katz and Fox Sports' Jeff Goodman released shortly after the 2010 Championship game both had Butler third for the 2010–2011 season. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski agreed, saying Butler would be\\"right up there, No. 1 or No. 2... They'll be a favorite next year.\\" However, Hayward chose to leave early for the NBA Draft and Butler went through a rough patch early in the season, at one point losing three straight games and having a 6–5 conference record. Bolstered by the emergence of Andrew Smith at center and Matt Howard's success as a perimeter forward, Butler ended up winning a share of the conference title at 13–5. The Bulldogs then won the Horizon League Tournament to secure an automatic NCAA tournament bid, and received an 8 seed. Picked by many to lose a first-round match-up against Old Dominion, Butler advanced on a last-second tip-in by Howard. Howard was also clutch in their next game, hitting a free throw with a less than one second remaining to beat Pitt in a dramatic finish. Shelvin Mack scored 30 points in the win. Butler won their next game when they defeated Wisconsin. On March 26, 2011, the Bulldogs beat Florida 74–71 in overtime to earn back-to-back trips to the Final Four. On April 2, Butler beat fellow Cinderella team VCU 70–62 to make it to a second consecutive national championship game. For the second consecutive year, the Bulldogs fell in the national championship game, this time to Connecticut. Coaching future On April 8, 2010, Stevens signed a long-term deal with Butler, extending his contract through the 2021–22 season. Financial terms of the contract were not disclosed; however, Butler president Bobby Fong had publicly stated that the university could afford to increase Stevens' base salary to approximately US $1,000,000 a few days prior. Stevens had previously made US$395,000 plus benefits in base salary, a relatively low figure for a successful Division I head basketball coach. His total compensation for 2009–10 was estimated at US$750,000. Stevens had received a raise after each of his three seasons at Butler and his contract contains a buyout clause estimated in the high six or low seven figures. By re-signing with Butler, Stevens temporarily ended speculation that he would leave the university for a higher paying job. Oregon, Clemson, and Wake Forest were all said to be interested in offering Stevens multi-million dollar contracts to leave Butler. \\"First and foremost, I'm loyal to Butler,\\" Stevens said. When asked if he would ever leave Butler, Stevens replied \\"I guess if they kicked me out.\\" After the 2011–12 season, Stevens was pursued vigorously by Illinois to fill their coaching vacancy before he declined their offer. In March 2013, UCLA reportedly offered Stevens between $2.5 and $3 million a year to leave Butler. Rumors circulated that Stevens was in contract negotiations with UCLA, but ultimately the rumors proved false and Stevens stayed at Butler. Commenting on the situation, a source close to Stevens said \\"Brad doesn't understand why people would assume he's leaving.\\" A few days later, Stevens reiterated that he was very happy at Butler and had no intentions to leave as long as he had the support of the university to continue running the program the \\"right way\\". NBA coaching career Boston Celtics On July 3, 2013, Stevens was signed as the head coach for the Boston Celtics to coach in the NBA. In April 2015, in his second season as head coach, Stevens led the Celtics to the 2015 playoffs as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference with a 40–42 record. On April 21, 2015, it was announced that Stevens finished fourth in voting for the NBA's Coach of the Year Award. In April 2016, Stevens led the Celtics to their second consecutive playoff appearance as the fifth seed in the 2016 playoffs, finishing the season with a 48–34 record. On April 16, 2015, Stevens was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for April. He led the Celtics to the East's best record in April at 7–1. The Celtics recorded a 4–0 mark on the road, and closed the month with six consecutive victories – five of them against playoff teams. On February 28, 2016, Stevens was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for February. He guided his squad to an Eastern Conference-best 9–3 record during the month, including a perfect 6–0 mark at home. The Celtics (36–25 overall) finished the month in sole possession of third place in the East behind the Cleveland Cavaliers and Atlantic Division foe the Toronto Raptors. On June 1, 2016, Stevens received a contract extension. On February 3, 2017, Stevens was named the Eastern Conference head coach for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game. In April 2017, in his fourth season as head coach, Stevens led the Celtics to the 2017 playoffs as the first seed in the Eastern Conference with a 53–29 record. They reached the Eastern Conference Finals, where they lost to the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers in five games. On July 4, 2017, Stevens was reunited with his former college player Gordon Hayward when Hayward signed a contract to play for the Celtics. In the 2017–18 season, the Celtics' roster saw a massive change, as two-time All-Star Isaiah Thomas was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kyrie Irving. Stevens and the Celtics went 55–27, finishing the season as the second seed in the Eastern Conference, despite losing Hayward for the season to a broken ankle in the first game of the season and Irving missing significant playing time due to knee injuries. Despite Irving missing the playoffs, Stevens led the Celtics on a deep playoff run, losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals. Stevens was considered a front runner for the NBA Coach of the Year Award, but lost to Dwane Casey of the Toronto Raptors. Coaching style According to Stevens, in one of his first games as head coach, he was nervous and \\"felt like our team played on edge\\" because of it. He decided that a team's play will reflect its coach's mood; a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in difficult game situations, while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge. \\"I don't want to lose a game because of my approach,\\" he told himself. Accordingly, he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games. He rarely raises his voice or gets emotional, instead quietly observing on the sideline with folded arms. He does not get upset about bad calls by referees or player mistakes, preferring to focus on \\"the next play\\" rather than what just happened. Butler player Willie Veasley explained Butler's 2010 Final Four run by saying, \\"When those big runs [by Syracuse and Kansas State] came, Coach called a timeout and said a few calm words. Then he said he believes in us, he loves us and we're going to win the game.\\" On the rare occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player, he does it with \\"positive reinforcement, just at a little louder decibel\\", according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves. Above all, Stevens wants his players to be confident, not living in fear of being yanked for making a bad play. Externally, Stevens is always calm, but internally he is far from it. \\"I'm not as calm as everybody thinks,\\" Stevens says. His wife Tracy adds, \\"He's calm and collected, but he's fiercely competitive. He's always thinking about how he can beat you.\\" Former player Joel Cornette says \\"Everyone sees Brad as a level-headed, calm and cool coach, but he's about as competitive of a guy as I know. We would get into it constantly, whether playing two-on-two or arguing about players' having better college careers.\\" Stevens talking with former player alt=Stevens looks at a player as he talks with him. The players' eyes are turned toward the basketball game to Stevens's left. Stevens spends a lot of time preparing for each game, and always tries to add a few new wrinkles specific to that game's opponent. Sports Illustrated calls Stevens an expert \\"on breaking down tape and looking at statistical trends to find opponents' weaknesses.\\" Former player Ronald Nored agrees: \\"We know everything we need to about our opponents, all their tendencies are broken down\\" ahead of time. Stevens is a proponent of statistical analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film. \\"I think it's a unique way of looking at the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players\\", he explains. For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: \\"this [46% defensive field goal percentage] is where we are. This isn't acceptable to get to where we want to go. But what does that really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it is, if we give up 3 less baskets a game, then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country\\". The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. If he had the resources, Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the team's play. Stevens's teams are built around solid basketball fundamentals and good teamwork rather than individual basketball skill. His teams are known for their defense, forcing opponents into uncharacteristic mistakes. The secret to basketball – and life – is \\"just to do the job to the best of your ability and don't worry about anything else,\\" Stevens says. \\"Win the next game. Win the next possession. That's our focus. It's boring. It's also the way championships are won\\", he says. In short, Stevens is a strong believer in \\"The Butler Way\\" – doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team. \\"I tell the players 'the Butler Way' isn't easy to define,\\" Stevens says, \\"but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball, play with great energy and defend.\\" Stevens prefers to recruit strong team players instead of going after \\"top recruits.\\" \\"The guys we [have] recruited, most of them weren't very highly ranked,\\" Stevens says. \\"They had very good high school careers or careers at other places (transfers), but for one reason or the other they weren't seen as great players. But they all had intangibles.\\" Stevens puts a strong emphasis on education and has said he would only recruit a \\"one and done\\" player if he was committed to getting his degree while playing professionally. Stevens has often been referred to as a coaching prodigy, but is not interested in self-promotion. He instead prefers to deflect the praise he receives to the players, athletic department, and his mentors. He has not been known to posture for more money, or to leak his name for open coaching positions. He has been described as humble, modest, and not \\"about the money\\". The New York Times, USA Today, ESPN, and other commentators attributed Butler's success against teams with superior athletes to Stevens's coaching style. The Times remarked, \\"the Bulldogs are very well prepared for their opponents, and they do not rattle easily\\", and says that the resulting confidence has led to the team's success. \\"He coaches to his personality and to his strengths,\\" Collier says. \\"Obviously, he has great rapport and communication ability with his team.\\" Yahoo! Sports compared Stevens to legendary coach John Wooden, writing \\"Brad Stevens is winning at Butler the Wooden way – calm and composed on the sideline.\\" Wooden agreed, saying, \\"I enjoy watching [Stevens] and very much enjoy [Butler's] style of play.\\" With background at his short Eli Lilly stint, Stevens also gave a priority to mental health in his locker room. He implemented wellness programs and invited Dr. Stephanie Pinder-Amaker, founding director of McLean Hospital's College Mental Health Program, to speak to his players. Personal life Stevens is known for projecting a professional, \\"corporate\\" look from the sidelines. Asked what his life would be like if he had never taken up coaching, he replies \\"If everything else remained the same, I would have been as happy as heck... Friends and family and faith, they're going to take the cake over all this stuff.\\" Stevens met his wife, Tracy (née Wilhelmy), while attending DePauw University. Tracy, who played soccer for DePauw, quickly learned of Brad's love for basketball; on their third date he drove her an hour and a half to attend a high school basketball game. Tracy graduated from Rocky River High School in 1995, and from DePauw in 1999. She returned to school in 2000, driving five hours from Case Western's law school to Indianapolis on weekends to see Stevens. She finished her final year of law school in Indianapolis, and the couple married in August 2003. Tracy works as a labor and employment lawyer, and also serves as Stevens' agent. Brad and Tracy are involved with the American Cancer Society's Coaches Vs. Cancer. He says that the cause really hit home for them after Tracy's mother died of the disease in June 2004. The day before Butler's 2010 Final Four appearance, they hosted a fundraiser for the organization. Stevens has also volunteered his time to the Jukes Foundation for Kids, a charity benefiting Ugandan children run by former Butler player Avery Jukes. Stevens remains in close contact with the Butler basketball family; he notably took a one-game leave from the Celtics in January 2016 to visit with Andrew Smith, a player on both of Butler's Final Four teams who was dying of cancer; Smith died less than a week later. At the request of Andrew's widow, Sam, Stevens delivered the eulogy at the memorial service on January 17, 2016. Stevens' father, Mark, is an orthopedic surgeon in Indianapolis who played college football for Indiana. His mother, Jan, is a university professor who has previously taught at Butler.

The mermaid now has fuller breasts, yet still lacks a navel. The old rendering of the arms of Stolpmünde in 1922. The arms on a local monument commemoration Stolpmünde war dead. The original coat of arms of Ustka, Poland (German Stolpmünde) was created in 1922 by local artist Wilhelm Granzow.According to an exposition in the museum in Ustka. The artist depicted the ship, mermaid and fish on the arms of his hometown of Stolpmünde, which symbolize the town's main sources of income: the seaport, tourism and fishery respectively. The coat of arms can be found in various places throughout the city, with the most remarkable of these being the 1922 monument by sculptor Josef Thorak named Der sterbende Krieger (The Dying Warrior) which commemorates the 76 inhabitants that perished during the First World War. After the town became part of Poland the city arms of Stolpmünde were retained.  Blazon  The official blazon (in Polish) of the arms of Ustka is: :W błękitnym polu tarczy żaglowiec trójmasztowy srebrny (z rozwiniętymi żaglami i o złotych pennantach na szczytach masztów), na falach o srebrnych grzywach. Poniżej, u podstawy tarczy, syrena ukoronowana złotą koroną, o złotych włosach i złotym (rybim) ogonie, z lewą ręką na biodrze, prawą - ujmująca dłonią rybę srebrną (łososia ).Załącznik nr 2 do Statutu Miasta Ustka (Attachment no. 2 to the Statute of the Town of Ustka) The following is an unofficial English translation of the blazon: :Azure a sailing ship with three masts Argent, with pennants Or, on waves of the second; and in base a mermaid [proper] crowned, crined and tailed of the third, with her sinister hand on her hip and maintaining in her dexter hand a salmon of the second.Translation by Wikipedia  Breasts affair  Ustka gained worldwide attention in the 2000s, as a bitter debate over a proposed alteration of the town's symbols started. In 2004, one of the town councilors proposed a modernization of the coat of arms. The temperature of a rather dull debate suddenly rose when one councilor complained, jokingly, about the current size and shape of mermaid's breasts, which, to her, seemed small and flaccid. For two years, the councilors debated the proper shape and size of breasts until they finally agreed to accept a project created by historian and heraldist Michał Marciniak-Kożuchowski. On the new coat of arms, the mermaid's breasts are significantly larger and more shapely. However, some councilors have complained that the new mermaid still lacks a navel. Ustka's citizens were divided on the issue of enlarging the mermaid's breasts. Many of them supported the idea, stating that the change could increase tourism. Others, however, were dissatisfied with the idea of the cost of a reform that seemed entirely unnecessary. A small group of disgruntled citizens even began a petition, demanding that the mermaid be removed entirely from the town's coat of arms. The whole affair provided a large dose of publicity to the town, making headlines in places as far afield as China. Also, the mermaid became Ustka's most recognizable symbol, and so has become a dominant theme of the town's promotional materials. The souvenir industry has acknowledged the potential of the mermaid and she is to be found on numerous trinkets and items in the town, often with enormous breasts.

History Smalley's Inn closed its doors on January 15 at 2pm, 2020. The building is for sale. Smalley Inn was opened in 1852 by James Smalley. In 1924, the inn and much of Carmel burned to the ground. A new Smalley's Hotel was built. The hotel was located where the Palmer Agency, Smith Barney and the Smalley Inn Restaurant are located now. The Putnam County National Bank was also located in Smalley's Hotel in 1896. The old hotel was later divided and sold to private business owners. Millie Conigllio bought Smalley Inn & Restaurant in the early 1950s. As a new resident to the area, she decided to keep the name. The business was later taken up by her son, Anthony F. Porto Sr., who remains as the current owner, along with his son, Anthony M. Porto Jr. Recently the Inn was renovated. A family restaurant currently lies to the left of the old fashioned bar. Smalley Inn & Restaurant is an Italian-American restaurant located on NYS Route 52 in Carmel, New York. Smalley Inn announced its closure in 2020, reportedly due to financial reasons as well as Porto's health, and ended service at 2:00 PM on January 15, 2020 after over 55 years in business.https://www.lohud.com/story/life/food/restaurants/2020/01/15/smalleys- inn-carmel-restaurant-closes/4476112002/ News and events A growing interest in the apparent haunting of Smalley's Inn has evolved. Owners and employees have noted peculiar sightings and events for years. Approximately fifteen years ago, Anthony Porto Jr. found the tombstone of a little girl buried under a set of basement steps in the restaurant. After this occurrence, these peculiar events intensified. Frequent ghostly sightings of a little girl prompted owners at the Inn to contact paranormal investigators. It was clarified that the ghost in Smalley Inn was in fact Elizabeth Smalley, daughter of original owner James Smalley, who had been killed as a toddler. SMALLEY INN on Route 52 in Carmel has all the ingredients for a haunting. The inn was built around the mid-19th century, though evidence shows it may have been around a lot longer. The site had a series of tragic events, including a deadly fire and an execution. Owner James J. Smalley was at various times the sheriff, coroner and treasurer of the town. His daughter, Elizabeth, was only a toddler when she died, and there's the belief that a portion of the basement was used as a morgue when Smalley was the coroner. Witnesses have had their clothing tugged on, have seen ghostly figures of a man, woman and child, and, on one occasion, every cell and house phone went off at exactly the same time, with each call originating from a phone within the building. Tony's dad, Anthony, who owns the inn, has had experiences in the upstairs apartment, and the inn's staff members have their own stories of happenings in the kitchen and basement liquor closet and meat locker. One waitress has said that she has heard footsteps, while working alone, in the attic. When she confronted someone, the answer was that no one was ever up there. No one wants to go downstairs for they feel a strange presence. As for Anthony, while upstairs and lying in his Queen Sized Bed, he felt someone on the other side of his bed... just lying there. Once he got up, there was no body there. Anthony wanted to build a sports bar in the basement. But in order to do that, men had to work around \\"The Pillar\\". The ghost of Elizabeth was said to peek out behind the pillar. Almost as if playing peek-a-boo or hide and go seek. As one man tried to work downstairs, he came up asking \\"Is this like a joke?\\" and left. The second man came over, went downstairs, came up freaked out, and left. As for the third man, he went down, came up almost in tears and screaming, and left. He forgot his tools in the basement. Radio Station K104 visits the restaurant yearly around Halloween with paranormal investigators for entertainment. On August 17, 2012, The Travel Channel aired an episode of \\"The Dead Files\\" filmed in Smalley Inn. In the episode, the show's physic medium, Amy Allan, said she saw the transparent ghosts of a banshee and a soldier, who reportedly haunt the building. Hauntings of the Hudson River Valley, An Investigative Journey, by Vincent T. Dacqunio and Postcard History Series- Carmel, by George Carroll Wipple III are books entailing detailed references of the history behind the current paranormal events documented at Smalley Inn & Restaurant.

Mathes, 199 A.2d 548 (Del. 1964), was a case in which the Delaware Supreme Court first addressed the issue of director conflict of interest in a corporate change of control setting. This case is the predecessor to future seminal corporate law cases including: Unocal Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum Co., Revlon v. MacAndrews, and Paramount v. Time. Facts Holland Furnace Company manufactured home furnaces. The company's marketing strategy involved door-to- door sales, which employed a large workforce. This model, if not unique to Holland Furnace, was nevertheless unusual. From the standpoint of Arnold Maremont, a businessman who had been purchasing Holland Furnace stock, it was unprofitable. These practices also implicated Holland Furnace in charges of unfair trade practices. (An investigation of these practices by the Federal Trade Commission had already been pending for a year at the time of the events underlying the decision in Cheff.) Sales representatives for Holland would go door to door posing as official inspectors. Claiming to be employed by the homeowner's utility or by the local government, these salesmen would disassemble the furnace, refusing to reassemble it for lack of spare parts. Holland's core business lay in replacement boilers. Cheff-Landwehr family group had effective control over the company, with 18.5% of Holland stock. Cheff, a family member, was Holland's Chief Executive Officer. From 1948-1956, Holland's sales declined by 25%. Management attributed the sharp drop to a boom in sales following World War II, which could not be sustained in later years. Maremont, an owner of an automotive parts manufacturing business, approached Cheff in 1957 to discuss the possibility of a merger between the two companies. Cheff was not interested in a business combination. Rebuffed, Maremont purchased 6% of Holland stock on the open market. Cheff ordered an investigation of Maremont, and learned that Maremont had engaged in corporate takeovers and liquidation of several companies. (At the resulting trial, Cheff would testify that Maremont was not well regarded among local area businessmen.) Cheff and Maremont met a second time, by which time Maremont owned 11% of Holland Stock. Maremont told Cheff that Holland's door-to-door sales tactic was obsolete and should be abandoned in favor of a wholesaler marketing strategy. Upon learning of Maremont's plans, Cheffs and Holland's board of directors agreed that Maremont posed a threat to Holland's continued existence. Holland's board would claim that Maremont's threat caused many of Holland's employees to quit in anticipation of the threatened takeover. With the stated aim of eliminating Maremont's threat to Holland's existence, the Holland board of directors authorized the repurchase of Maremont's holdings of Holland stock at a price above the prevailing market stock price. Essentially, the board authorized the payment of greenmail to Maremont. ;Business Judgment Rule The Delaware Supreme Court first had to determine whether Holland's directors were protected from judicial scrutiny of their actions under the business judgment rule. While the business judgment rule typically protects corporate officers from judicial scrutiny of their actions, the rule could be limited if judges found a conflict of interest. In the case of Holland Furnace, the board's purchase of shares with corporate funds prevented a hostile takeover (which could have been in the best interest of the company) while also maintaining their control of the company. Thus, the court had to decide whether the Board was so conflicted that they should not be afforded Business Judgment Rule protection. ;Threat to Corporate Policy \\"The question then presented is whether or not [the board] satisfied the burden of proof of showing reasonable grounds to believe a danger to corporate policy and effectiveness existed by the presence of the Maremont stock ownership. It is important to remember that the directors satisfy their burden by showing good faith and reasonable investigation; the directors will not be penalized for an honest mistake of judgment, if the judgment appeared reasonable at the time the decision was made.\\" Judgment The court held that the directors were protected by the business judgment rule, because they held a good faith belief that Maremont posed a threat to Holland's continued existence. Testimony established the board's understanding of Maremont's reputation for acquiring businesses and liquidating them, and that Maremont's apparent intentions negatively affected Holland's work force. Therefore, after Delaware's holding in this case, a director could rebut any inference of a conflict of interest, and remain protected by the business judgment rule, if they showed that they held a good faith belief that they were pursuing a \\"business purpose\\" that would benefit the corporation. Aftermath The court's findings mention - and minimize - the FTC investigation of Holland Furnace. The court, endorsing Holland's board, also notes that Holland's downward sales-trend reversed itself in 1957, the year that Maremont was bought out. What the court does not mention is that Holland's fortunes suffered another reversal - this one fatal. Holland's sales were in excess of $31 million in 1958, but dropped to $1.1 million by 1965. That year, Holland stock reached a high of $1.63 per share, compared to a closing price of $11–1/8 per share in October 1957. Holland Furnace, listed in editions of Moody's Industrial Manual for the years covering the events of this case, did not appear in 1966. Holland Furnace faced charges of unfair trade practices that were known prior to the decision in Cheff v. Mathes. As a result of their investigations into the sales practices of Holland Furnace, the FTC issued a \\"cease and desist order\\" against the company, an order upheld by the United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit.See Ultimately, Holland Furnace and Mr. Cheff were held in contempt for violating the order by continuing to engage in unfair trade practices. Mr. Cheff went to jail for 6 months.See The unsavory character of Arnold Maremont is a key factor in the court's decision. During proceedings leading up to the court's decision in Cheff, Mr. Cheff testified as to Maremont's reputation, that: \\"Throughout the whole of the Kalamazoo-Battle Creek area, and Detroit too, where I spent considerable time, he is well known and not highly regarded by any stretch.\\" Arnold Maremont, who died in 1978, involved himself in pursuits other than business. According to his obituary in The New York Times, Maremont was both a patron of the arts and a visionary for social justice. A governing life member of the Art Institute of Chicago and a former trustee of the Lyric Opera and Ballet Theater, Maremont was the first Illinois industrialist to back a law ending employment discrimination against African Americans. As chairman of the Illinois Public Aid Commission in the early 1960s, he campaigned for publicly supported birth control for welfare families. See also *Weinberger v.

Current technological developments suggest that cars, as used today, will be replaced.Dennis, K., Urry, J. 2009. After the Car. Cambridge: Polity. Established alternatives to car use include cycling, walking, kick scooters, rollerblading, skateboarding, twikes and (electric or internal combustion) motorcycles. Other alternatives are public transport vehicles (buses, trolleybuses, trains, subways, monorails, tramways). History An 1889 Japanese print shows various forms of transportation Prior to the popularity of car use which dominated motorised transport (and consequently urban planning) from around the 1950s onwards, several transportation modes were used. Pedestrianism for both short and long distances was used, but also travel by horse especially for long distances. Trams, especially powered trams, achieved widespread popularity in the 19th century. Carriages, used for centuries, are still used but mainly for tourism. Public transport Walking bus, Třebíč-Vnitřní Město, Třebíč District, Vysočina Region, Czechia, Karlovo náměstí The public transport with the highest modal share worldwide is travelling by bus followed by travelling by rail due to infrastructure cost. A pedestrian form of public transport is a walking bus predominantly used by schools. An attempt to transform private transport by bicycle into public transport has been bicycle sharing schemes. Bicycle-sharing systems have been implemented in over 1000 cities worldwide, and are especially common in many European and Chinese cities of all sizes. Similar programs have been implemented across the United States as well, including large cities like Washington, D.C., and New York City, as well as smaller cities like Buffalo, New York and Fort Collins, Colorado. Personal rapid transit is a scheme that has been discussed, in which small, automated vehicles would run on special elevated tracks spaced within walking distance throughout a city, and could provide direct service to a chosen station without stops. However, despite several concepts existing for decades personal rapid transit has failed to gain significant ground and several prototypes and experimental systems have been dismantled as failures. Private transport Unmotorised The private transport with the highest modal share, worldwide that is unmotorised, is pedestrianism followed by cycling. Motorised Another possibility is new forms of personal transport such as the electric skateboard/mountainboard, electric kick scooter, or personal transporters, such as self-balancing unicycles (i.e. Segway PT and others), which could serve as an alternative to cars and bicycles if they prove to be socially accepted. Electric or internal combustion motorcycles (which also include scooters) are also an option. Internal combustion motorcycles do create some degree of local air pollution however. That said, the degree of local air pollution varies considerably depending on which fuel (i.e. gasoline, LPG, CNG/biogas, hydrogen) is injected to the internal combustion engine. This fuel can be freely chosen, and existing motorcycle engine can be converted to run on these. Hydrogen for instance is described as being \\"near- emissionless\\" when burned in an internal combustion engine. Also, velomobiles exist (including electric assisted versions), which compared to regular bicycles have the benefit of being enclosed (hence protecting the driver from the weather), and the potential of being motorized, which can allow one to travel greater distances (at a faster speed). Benefits All of these alternative modes of transport pollute less than at least the petroleum- powered car and contribute to transport sustainability. They also provide other significant benefits such as reduced traffic-related injuries and fatalities, reduced space requirements, both for parking and driving, reduced resource usage and pollution related to both manufacturing and driving, increased social inclusion, increased economic and social equity, and more livable streets and cities. Some alternative modes of transportation, especially cycling, also provide regular, low-impact exercise, tailored to the needs of human bodies. Public transport is also linked to increased exercise, because they are combined in a multi-modal transport chain that includes walking or cycling. According to the MIT Future Car Workshop, the benefits of possible future car technologies not yet in widespread use (such as zero- emissions vehicles) over these alternatives, would be:Transology: M.I.T.

Born in Xi'an, China in 1959, Li studied at the Beijing Broadcasting Institute from 1985 to 1987, after which he moved to Germany. There he made several documentary films and spent some time acting on German television before eventually enrolling and graduating from the Academy of Media Arts in Cologne in 1995. Directing career Upon his return to China, Li made his first non- documentary film, the critically acclaimed Blind Shaft (2003). The film's bleak story of two murderous con-men plying their trade in China's dangerous mines proved a major success in the international film festival circuit. Critics particularly noted how Li’s background in documentaries showed through in the film's Cinéma vérité and Italian neorealist style, in particular Li's use of handheld cameras and an ambient sound soundtrack. In China, however, the film’s critical eye toward the notoriously dangerous mining industry proved controversial and Blind Shaft was banned by the Beijing Film Bureau. However, neither the precise reasoning nor the length of the ban was made known to Li. After his ban, Li Yang split his time between Hong Kong and Germany and gave at least one interview where he claimed, Despite his worries, the ban was eventually lifted and Li was allowed to begin work on his follow up to Blind Shaft. Entitled Blind Mountain (2007), it debuted at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival in the Prix un certain regard competition and was one of only three Asian films vying for an award at the prestigious event. Like Li's previous film, Blind Mountain turns a sharply critical eye towards another one of China's continuing social problems, this time the illegal selling of women for marriage. Blind Mountain also shares the same realistic style as Blind Shaft as seen in the latter film's cast of mostly non-professional actors and its use of diegetic music.

Upon receiving an asylum seeker's application, the Russian Migration Service (former \\"FMS\\") determines whether the asylum seeker meets the legislative definition of a \\"refugee\\" and should be granted asylum. As of year end 2006, 1,020 people have been granted temporary asylum status and 405 people have been granted full refugee status by the Russian government. It is estimated, however, that there may be as many as one million \\"undocumented foreigners\\" on Russian soil awaiting initial access to the procedure of refugee status determination.USCI The Russian authorities are notorious for denying refugee status to asylum seekers – with the approval rate for refugee status at only 2-5% of applicants. According to an April 2007 report, individuals from Afghanistan constitute the largest number of asylum seekers in Russia. According to Vladimir Rucheikov, head of asylum issues in the Citizenship Department of the Federal Migration Service of Russia, Afghanis make up over 70% of all submitted applications. Additionally, Afghans make up the majority of those that actually gain refugee status (as of 2006, 962 Afghans have been granted temporary asylum status and 240 Afghans have been granted full refugee status). Asylum seekers in Russia also originate from various African and Middle Eastern countries. Given the significant difficulty in obtaining refugee status, many asylum seekers seek non profit legal representation (such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (\\"UNHCR\\"), that help them consider the most durable and realistic solution for them and their family. Without legal assistance, the legal intricacies of the Law on Refugees are likely to be overlooked, and their application for asylum could be denied regardless of the legitimacy of their claim. The Convention relating to the Status of Refugees was adopted at a special United Nations conference. The Soviet Union, however, never ratified the 1951 Convention, partly because it viewed the Convention as a treaty whose standards \\"were dictated by the Western Countries\\". After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, however, a large number of people from the former Soviet Union republics migrated into the Russian Federation. In direct response to the dramatic migration into the country, Russia, in 1992, accepted the establishment of the UNHCR and established the Federal Migration Service (\\"FMS\\"). A year after establishing the FMS, Russia acceded to the 1951 Convention (and the 1967 Protocol) and enacted specific legislation to address the increased migration. In 1993, Russia adopted three laws to address the issue of migration. The first law, incorporated under the Russian Constitution, grants individuals the right to claim political asylum in Russia. The second law, the Law on Forced Migrants, addressed those asylum seekers who either already had Russian citizenship or were qualified to obtain it. These migrants were mainly people living in FSU republics, with or without Russian citizenship, that were forced to move to Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union for economic reasons. The Law on Forced Migrants allowed these individuals to freely and legally move to Russia. The third law, the Law on Refugees, addressed those asylum seekers coming from states other than the Former Soviet Union republics, or the \\"far abroad\\". In effect, the laws enacted in 1993 were meant to offer protection first to former Soviet citizens, and second to citizens of all other countries. In fact, the dominant interpretation of the 1993 Law on Refugees was that refugee status was to be granted only to asylum seekers from the \\"near abroad\\" (the former Soviet republics).(Silvestri and Tchernishova 1998: 185) However, as Russia began to develop in the mid 1990s, large numbers of individuals fearing persecution for various reasons in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia viewed Russia as a safe place to migrate to. In response, in 1997, Russia amended and replaced the 1993 Law on Refugees to better address those individuals who have traveled to Russia in need of international protection. Russia’s current law on refugees The 1997 Law on Refugees, though slightly amended in 1998 and 2000, represents the Russian Federation’s current legislation on refugees. General process of attaining asylum in Russia According to Article 4.1(3), an asylum seeker who enters the Russian Federation illegally must file an application with the regional Ministry of Interior (\\"MOI\\") within 24 hours. According to a 2002 World Refugee Survey, the majority of applications that have been submitted to regional MOI offices are from foreigners who have entered illegally.USCR World Refugee Survey 2002, at 194, available at: http://www.refugees.org/WRS2002. (Immigration and Refugee Services of America 2002) While an individual cannot be detained for illegally entering Russia for the purposes of applying for asylum, the penal code allows the government to imprison illegal immigrants including unregistered asylum seekers – making it even more imperative to meet the 24-hour deadline. Even though the 24-hour limit can be relaxed, Article 5.1(7) states that a violation can serve as the basis for denial of a substantive evaluation of an applicant's claim. In the application, the asylum seeker must describe in detail the situation in his home country and the reason why the FMS should grant him refugee status. Once the asylum seeker has registered and has an application filed with the MOI, the individual can either stay in a Temporary Accommodation Center (TAC) or find another place to live until his status is determined. According to Article 4.6, once an application is received, the Russian authorities should issue a certificate to asylum seekers. The FMS will then conduct a Refugee Status Determination (RSD), a process that could take up to one year. The FMS will first assess the admissibility of the asylum seeker's claim and, if found admissible, then examine the individual case on the merits (substantive examination). Article 3.3 states that these determination must be based on an interview, completion of a questionnaire and examination of the credibility of the data provided. If the application is denied and the applicant does not appeal to the Russian courts, the individual becomes immediately excluded from the Law on Refugees. The Department of Passport and Visa Registration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs begins the process of deporting the individual. If the individual does not leave in the specified time frame, usually six months, the Ministry can detain the individual.Olga Osipova, Work With Undocumented People, paper presented at the conference Refugee Status Determination: Standard of Proof and Status Determination of Undocumented Asylum Seekers, Prague (December 3–4, 1999), available at http://refugees.memo.ru (last accessed Sept. 16, 2002). However, Article 12.2(2) allows the FMS to grant temporary asylum to those individuals who cannot be deported for humanitarian reasons. This concept of \\"non-refoulement\\", or expressly prohibiting the expulsion of a refugee into an area where she or he might be again subjected to persecution, is well documented in the 1951 Convention – but not explicitly stated in Russian law. Russia's answer to the fundamental principle of non-refoulement is to offer temporary asylum status, subject to revocation, to those who might again be subject to persecution. If the applicant is determined to be a legitimate refugee and is granted asylum by the FMS, he will immediately be entitled to receive travel documents and a refugee ID card. It is important to note, however, that the refugee status is only granted on a temporary basis. According to Article 7.9, refugee status can be granted for up to three years, after which it must be extended on an annual basis. Once declared a refugee by the Russian authorities, the refugee can then apply for Russian citizenship. Throughout the entire process, the asylum seeker is without a certificate of registration with the police (called a propiska) – a requirement for all Russian citizens and visitors of Russia. Because most asylum seekers do not have legal status, they cannot obtain the necessary propiskas. This lack of registration typically leads to multiple fines and arrests, which can ultimately affect the asylum seeker's ability to attain \\"refugee\\" status – as the FMS can exclude the individual from an RSD if he has committed any crimes, even minor ones, in Russia. Admissibility of Claim Determination - Exclusionary Provisions According to the Law on Refugees, some asylum seekers will be explicitly excluded from being considered refugees before any substantive determination is made by the FMS. Article 2.2 excludes asylum seekers who have fled their country of origin for \\"economic reasons due to hunger, epidemic, or natural or man-made emergencies\\". Article 5 of the Law describes in which circumstances a claim shall not be considered on its merits. These include: (1) if there is a criminal proceeding against the applicant for allegedly committing a crime in Russia; (2) the case of repetitive applications; (3) the case in which the applicant has received a negative decision on refugee status in any State that has acceded the 1951 Convention; (4) the principle of safe third country – the case in which an asylum seeker arrived in Russia from a country where he could have claimed asylum; (5) the case of asylum seekers who did not flee persecution and who are unwilling to return owing to fear of punishment for their illegal departure or for another offence committed in their home country, and; (6) the case of asylum seekers who illegally enter Russia and do not apply for refugee status within 24 hours from the moment of entry. Substantive determination – definition of refugee status In order for an individual to seek asylum in Russia, he must be designated by the Federal Migration Service as such. The FMS will conduct a substantive investigation, or Refugee Status Determination (RSD), once an asylum seekers application is registered. The 1997 Law on Refugees defines the term \\"refugee\\" as \\"a person who is outside his/her country of nationality or habitual residence; has a well-founded fear of persecution because of his/her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion; and is unable or unwilling to avail himself/herself of the protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of persecution\\".Article 1 of the 1951 Convention The individual seeking asylum must satisfy the requirements set forth in the definition of \\"refugee\\" in order to obtain asylum in Russia. Criticism of Russia’s Law on Refugees Human rights campaigners have been vocal in denouncing the negative aspects of Russia’s Law on Refugees.See: 2005 In Review: Migrants, Refugees Victims Of Incoherent Laws In post-Soviet States available at: http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/12/43bcbcc3-3f98-4ec4-9cb7-23be438220eb.html The following are examples of their most notable concerns: Observers have found it to be an extreme measure that an asylum seeker’s application can be summarily denied if the applicant fails to apply within 24 hours of entering the country. The 24 hour deadline is arguably too difficult to meet in practice, given that many asylum seekers are being detained at the borders for three days upon arrival – with no knowledge of the requirement and no access to legal representation. Human rights organizations are concerned with the conditions at the various detention centers – where the unregistered and denied asylum seekers are placed. According to one specialist, detention centers in Russia differ little from the country’s prisons. For example, features of a detention center in St. Petersburg, include two square meters of space per person, permanent isolation from the outer world, and a 20-minute walk per day. Furthermore, there is no formal system to independently review the Ministry of Internal Affairs’ decision to detain people and no particular limits on the length of time an individual can be detained. Therefore, if an individual is appealing their denial of asylum, he will continue to be detained during the duration of his appeal. Organizations are concerned that the safe third country rule (concept that an applicant will be denied a substantive examination of their claim if they arrived from a country where they could have claimed asylum) is not well considered. The UNHCR, for instance, argues that the safe third country rule fails to consider whether the applicant really had the chance to apply for asylum in that country, and furthermore, whether the applicant can actually re-enter into that country.(see AI 2003b: 60; UNHCR 2002c: 390). There is no clear and explicit provision that prohibits refoulement (that prohibits Russia from returning individuals to their home country where their lives or freedoms could be threatened). Opponents contend that with no guarantee that asylum seekers will not be forcibly returned to the country they fled, the Law fails its central purpose and is inconsistent with a norm in international law. Even when refugee status is present, it is only a temporary benefit limited to three years, after which it must be extended on an annual basis. Opponents of the law suggest that the process in and of itself is difficult to manage. Once a determination is made, the refugee should be free to live like all other residents of the country. Finally, the most troubling complaint is that in some cases the law cannot be relied upon because it is not being properly implemented by the authorities (i.e. state authorities fail to issue a certificate to the asylum seeker upon receiving application, in accordance with Article 4.6). Legal representatives of asylum seekers, such as the UNHCR and the Committee for Civic Assistance, complain that individuals with legitimate claims are being denied asylum without just cause – and where a showing of persecution upon return to their home country is clear and apparent. Others argue that the law is not being properly implemented because the attention of the Russian authorities in the migration sphere is elsewhere – primarily with combating illegal migration. Organizations Offering Legal Representation to Refugees The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Committee for Civic Assistance (CCA) provide legal consulting to refugees and forced migrants, mediate between refugees and the authorities, defend refugees in the courts, and advocate for refugee rights to housing and work. In connection with these tasks, both organizations have constant contact with all structures dealing with refugee problems: the Federal Migration Service, regional migration services, and the Commission on Refugees in the State Duma.These are solutions deemed by conversations with unnamed UNHCR officials Durable solutions Organizations such as the UNHCR and the CCA work directly with those individuals they deem worthy of \\"refugee\\" status (i.e. UN mandated refugees – though this status is not recognized by the Russian authorities) and help them with reaching the most desirable outcome for them and their family. The three most durable solutions are: Voluntary Repatriation In some instances, the situation in a mandated refugee’s home country changes for the better, and the fear of persecution upon return is no longer an immediate or long term issue. Nevertheless, the issuance of exit visas by the Russian authorities remains an obstacle delaying the repatriation process. The UNHCR helps the individual determine the best way to return home. With the aid of the UNHCR, the Russian authorities will offer a one time deportation visa (which takes less than one week), as opposed to the exit visa normally required of all individuals leaving Russia (which could take several months). Local Integration According to the Law on Refugees, Government recognized refugees can apply for citizenship. Nevertheless, there are significant legal obstacles for their acquisition of citizenship due to the restrictive registration system, which required proof of adequate income. Local integration, though typically desirable, is an unrealistic goal for most asylum seekers as the Russian government does not recognize the UN mandated refugees. Resettlement The most common solution for UN recognized refugees is resettlement. Due to inadequate protection capacity, resettlement remains the most viable option for UN mandated refugees. It is estimated that there are thousands of UN mandated refugees in Russia who have been in the Russian asylum system for five years or more. For these individuals especially, resettlement to Western Europeans countries and to North America is very desirable – where they can actually settle. The UNHCR works with the migration offices of these countries and attempts to find these mandated refugees a home. Present Day Conditions for Asylum Seekers in Russia The conditions for asylum seekers in Russia are generally very poor. Asylum seekers in Russia typically have to wait years to receive a decision from the FMS. During that time, they are typically living without proper legal documents – making it nearly impossible for them to find a job outside of the local food markets. According to the United Nations, until recognized as refugees by the state, asylum seekers cannot enjoy such rights as \\"legal employment, healthcare, housing assistance and social benefits\\" - and even the right to register marriages and births.(USCRI 2003) Asylum seekers in Russia are constantly in friction with the police. Amnesty International states that \\"asylum seekers are often harassed and ill-treated by law enforcement officers who feel they can abuse such people with impunity\\". Amnesty International has received persistent reports of asylum-seekers from outside the territory of the former Soviet Union having their identity papers destroyed by police and being subjected to police harassment in the form of extortion, beatings and general intimidation. Many have been subjected to police raids or intimidated into leaving their homes.Amnesty International. Xenophobia, a fear or hatred of foreigners, is another problem that confronts asylum seekers and refugees.Journal of Refugee Studies, Refugees in Russia: The Law on Refugees and its Implementation, 18 JRSTUD 468 (2005) Xenophobia is of particular concern to those that look different than the local community. Such groups include specifically: Africans, Afghans, Iraqis, and Tajiks. There are many occurrences of asylum seekers being beaten by local gangs.See: http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,230458,00.html In fact, some asylum seekers do not even report attacks for fear of police harassment, since many do not have official status. Absence of legal documents resulting in problems with housing, employment, and health care, as well as ongoing harassment from the police make it extremely difficult for asylum seekers stressfully waiting for refugee status determination.

He is the former head coach of Boston College and Cornell.  Background  Donahue is a native of Springfield Township, Pennsylvania and a former player at Ursinus College. Coaching career Early jobs Prior to becoming the head coach at Cornell University, Donahue began his coaching career as an assistant coach at Springfield High School, Monsignor Bonner High School, Philadelphia University, and The University of Pennsylvania. Cornell Donahue had been the head coach at Cornell from September 2000 until April 6, 2010. Cornell struggled early under Donahue, but he eventually turned the program around. A March 1, 2008 defeat of the Harvard Crimson gave Cornell the Ivy League championship for the first time since 1988 and just the second title in program history.Dance Party: Cornell Claims First NCAA Tourney Bid In 20 Years CornellBigRed.com access 03-03-2008 On March 6, 2009, with Princeton's loss to Columbia, Cornell clinched the Ivy League Championship for a second consecutive year. It was the first time in 50 years that any team other than Penn or Princeton had won consecutive Ivy League titles in basketball. Exactly one year later on March 6, 2010, Donahue's Cornell team defeated the Brown Bears to clinch its third consecutive title and fourth in team history. This guaranteed an automatic bid for Cornell in the 2010 NCAA basketball tournament, in which Cornell was given a 12-seed in the East region. Cornell went on to win two games in the tournament, defeating 5-seed Temple and then 4-seed Wisconsin, both victories by double digit margins, to advance to the Sweet 16, the first Ivy League team to advance this far since 1979 (when Penn reached the final four). There they fell to the 1-seed Kentucky Wildcats, ending their historic run. This team featured several lauded seniors, including point guard Louis Dale, who finished as the third highest scorer and top assist man in Cornell history; center Jeff Foote, whose presence in the middle was essential to Cornell's success; and forward Ryan Wittman, who finished as the top scorer in Cornell men's basketball history (and the 5th highest scorer overall in Ivy League's men's basketball history) at 2,028 points. Donahue received the Clair Bee Coach of the Year Award for his accomplishments during the 2009–10 season.  Boston College  On April 7, 2010, Boston College announced that Donahue had been hired as the head coach of its basketball program, replacing coach Al Skinner. Donahue led the Eagles to the second round of the NIT his first year. Donahue's second year was less successful, as the Eagles won only 9 games and lost to Harvard for the fourth year in a row. Donahue led the Eagles to a 16-17 season in his third year. Despite going 16-17, the Eagles lost to two top ten teams by one point. On February 19, 2014, Donahue achieved what is considered his biggest win at BC by beating #1-ranked Syracuse on the road in the Carrier Dome, 62-59 in overtime. The upset was one of the few bright spots of Donahue's fourth and final year, which saw the Eagles finish with an 8-24 record. On March 18, 2014, Boston College terminated Donahue. He compiled a 54–76 record in four seasons and failed to reach the NCAA tournament. Penn On March 16, 2015, Donahue was named the 20th head coach in Penn basketball history, replacing Jerome Allen. Donahue served as an assistant coach for the Quakers from 1990 to 2000. Following Donahue's hiring as head coach, Mike Krzyzewski, Duke University and USA National Team head coach, stated, “Steve Donahue is a terrific basketball coach, and is even more impressive off the court,\\" adding, \\"This is truly an outstanding hire by the University of Pennsylvania.” http://www.pennathletics.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=1700&ATCLID;=209964636 Penn's 2017–18 team won the 2018 Ivy League Tournament qualifying for their 1st NCAA Tournament since 2007. As the 16th seed for the Midwest bracket of the 2018 NCAA Tournament, they played number 1 seed Kansas. The Quakers jumped out to a 21–11 lead with 8:01 left in the 1st half. However, the Jayhawks finished the half on a 22–5 run taking a 33–26 lead into half-time. The Jayhawks never trailed again and outscored the Quakers 43–34 in the 2nd half, causing the Quakers to lose 60–76.

He was previously serving as a consultant to Tom Izzo at Michigan State after being let go as head coach with Georgia Tech. Prior to coaching at Georgia Tech, he was the head coach at Dayton and an assistant coach under Izzo at Michigan State. Early life and education From 1985 to 1986, Gregory attended the U.S. Naval Academy where he played on the Navy team that featured David Robinson and advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. He then went to Oakland University where he was a three-time all conference selection and in 1990 was named an Academic All-American. In 1990, Gregory graduated from Oakland University with a bachelor of arts in secondary education. He went on to earn a master of arts in athletic administration at Michigan State, graduating in 1992. Coach Michigan State Gregory was an assistant at Michigan State for five years, from 1999 to 2003, under head coach Tom Izzo. During that time, the Spartans reached the Final Four three times and won the 2000 national title. Dayton On April 9, 2003, Gregory was named the head basketball coach of the Dayton Flyers. As Flyers head coach, he led the team to the 2004 and the 2009 NCAA Tournament as well as the 2008 National Invitation Tournament. On January 14, 2008, Gregory led the Dayton Flyers to a top-14 ranking in the AP poll. This was the highest ranking for Dayton in 40 years. He capped off the 2009–10 season by leading the Flyers to the 2010 NIT championship over North Carolina. Gregory had a 172–94 record with the Flyers over eight seasons and NCAA Tournament appearances. Georgia Tech On March 28, 2011, it was announced that Gregory would become the 13th head coach at Georgia Tech replacing Paul Hewitt. Gregory struggled at Georgia Tech, only finishing above .500 two times. He failed to make a postseason appearance in his first four years at Georgia Tech. On March 16, 2015, Georgia Tech announced that Gregory would continue as head basketball coach for another year, despite the fact he had had a conference finish higher than ninth. In the 2015–16 season, Georgia Tech improved, finishing the season 21–15 and did receive a bid to the National Invitation Tournament, their first postseason trip under Gregory. The Yellow Jackets won two games before losing in the quarterfinals. After a 5th consecutive losing record in the ACC, Georgia Tech Athletic Director Mike Bobinski announced on March 25, 2016 that Gregory would not return for the 2016–17 season. His record was 76–86 overall and 27–61 in ACC play. Gregory would serve as a consultant to his old head coach Tom Izzo at Michigan State during the 2016–17 season.  South Florida  On March 14, 2017, Gregory was hired as head coach at South Florida to replace Orlando Antigua. Quickly, he helped the Bulls turn into a contender in the American Athletic Conference. USF went 10-22 in Gregory's first season, which was the first time the program posted ten wins since the 2014-15 season - the first of the Antigua era. It posted a 7-11 record at the Yuengling Center (formerly the USF Sun Dome), but struggled away from home, collecting just three wins away from Tampa. The Bulls finished 3-15 in AAC play, last in the conference and was a first-round exit in the 2018 conference tournament. Gregory welcomed nine new players to the program for the 2018-19 season. USF also was benefitted by Gardner–Webb transfer Laquincy Rideau, who came off a redshirt season in 2017-18 and Alexis Yetna's addition to the hardwood. It started the season 10-2 through non-conference play before going 8-10 in AAC play. Under Gregory's eye, Rideau earned an AAC Defensive Player of the Year honor, while Yetna was named the league's Freshman of the Year for their efforts during the regular season. Although it was bounced in the first round of the conference tournament yet again, this time by UConn, USF received a bid to play in the College Basketball Invitational, the third tier postseason college basketball tournament. The Bulls came back from a 25-point deficit to defeat Stony Brook in the first round before defeating Utah Valley and Loyola Marymount to reach the CBI finals. In a three-game series against DePaul, the Bulls took two-of- three (63-61, 96-100 OT, 77-65) to win the tournament. Sophomore guard David Collins was named as the tournament's MVP. In the process, USF finished 24-14 and had the largest improvement among NCAA Division I teams. Three Bulls - Rideau, Collins and Yetna - were named preseason all-conference selections before the 2019-20 season.

The side dance Cotswold Morris locally in the towns and villages around Watford, Rickmansworth, Hemel Hempstead and St Albans, and further afield at events and folk festivals across the country, as well as occasional trips abroad.  Origins of Woodside Morris Men  Woodside Morris Men were formed in Finchley, North London. The name comes from the School at which the Phoenix Folk Club met, which happened to be situated in a part of Finchley known as Woodside Park. The decision to form a men's Morris side to perform the Cotswold dance traditions, along with a little Rapper Sword Dancing, was taken following the Phoenix club's 1956 Whit Monday tour. Previously the club had flirted with Morris as one of their many folk activities, but it was felt that the time had come for a permanent, dedicated Morris section. Woodside's original artwork for their baldrik rosette The man charged with organising the new Morris club was Edmund 'Eddie' Reavell. Eddie would go on to become Squire of the side in the long term, but in seeking guidance for getting the club together, and developing a repertoire, he obtained the help of legendary dancer and instructor, Bert Cleaver. Bert Cleaver took on the role of Squire during this formative time for the club, and under his eye, and the organisation of Eddie Reavell, the club gained members, produced a kit utilising a purpose designed tree emblem to reflect the name, and prepared to dance out in public. The first official meeting of the club took place in September 1956, and it was almost exactly a year later that they finally kitted up and danced in anger for the first time. From the start, Woodside Morris Men adopted the profile of a team that would seek association with the Morris Ring - all male membership with officers and a constitution that reflected Ring policy. Fittingly then, it was a Morris Ring event at which they first danced; the association's 61st meeting, hosted by Thames Valley Morris Men, and based around Kingston upon Thames, London . Two years later, at the 68th meeting of the Ring, the side danced for the first time as members; the now Squire Eddie Reavell being presented with Woodside's staff of association by Ring Squire Jim Phillips . The early years for the club were taken up with local social and community events, regular involvement with Morris Ring meetings, and privately arranged trips to various locations, though Deal, Kent was a particular favourite, in the company of Westminster Morris Men, and later joined by the Hammersmith Morris Men. at this time, there were a few dancers that were involved in just about all of these three side's at one time or another. Bert Cleaver had ended his direct association with Woodside when they reached the stage where they were ready to dance out, and subsequently became involved with a few other London sides, and would go on to become Squire of the Morris Ring. Another busy Morris Man was Hugh Rippon, who at that time was something of a Morris firebrand, being involved with all of these teams to some extent, and remains to this day an influential figure on the English folk scene. Originally, Woodside Morris Men were intended to remain part of the Phoenix Folk Club, but discussion with a number of early members indicates that the link to the parent club was tenuous from the very start. If it were intended that the membership should originally be drawn from the Phoenix Club, then such expectations were sadly not met. In March 1965, Woodside Squire, Graham Wild, wrote a letter to all members of the team to inform them that, for one week only, the side would be meeting at the Railway Club, Watford, for practice, but not to worry, as practice would return to Finchley as soon as possible. As much as this may not have been an intentional first step away from the now only notionally parent club, as well as the area in which the club was formed, a page in the history of Woodside Morris Men had been turned, and there would be no going back. By July of that same year, meetings had been firmly established as taking place at the Railway's social club in Watford.  Life in Watford  Woodside dancing as part of Whitby Folk Week, with the scenic back-drop of the old Abby One of Woodside's members was an employee of British Rail, and also a member of their British Railways Staff Association, which had premises just off the St Albans Road in Watford. This member was able to arrange a favourable rate for using one of the rooms on a Wednesday evening, for reasons of practise. As well as the side moving to the area for rehearsals, they also started to gravitate their other activities, such as feast evenings and days of dance, into the surrounding towns and villages. At this time, Woodside were still very active in the Morris Ring, and the profile of events that were participated in was dominated by days of dance, and Ring meetings. The countryside surrounding Watford was ideal for hosting other teams for club events and the move to a more suburban area meant less competition from the wealth of London sides. Woodside became involved in local community events, even appearing at the assembly rooms of the Watford Town Hall, an internationally recognised recording venue for major orchestral and operatic projects. All this activity in and around the side's new home didn't prevent Woodside from continuing to dance at some of their old haunts in London, a legacy that is still apparent today. Relationships changed with the London sides, which was as much to do the change in membership as it was to do with the change of base, and Woodside looked to form new bonds with teams based outside London. Just as the side were settling in comfortably to their new environment, disaster struck, albeit on a rather minor scale. In 1969, having discovered that Woodside's British Rail employee member had long since parted for pastures new, the Railway Club decided that the accommodation agreement was no longer appropriate. Woodside Morris Men promptly found themselves without a home. A few new venues were tried stop gap, but eventually, by the end of the year, an agreement had been made with the Hertfordshire County Council Divisional Education Officer to set up camp on a long term base at Chater School, Watford. The side moved on and it was business as usual, for a while, when the side moved to the Red Lion in Nash Mills, near Hemel Hempstead. This era saw a dwindling membership, which in turn led to a reduction in funds, which are usually raised through membership, collections at dance outs and fees for performances. It became difficult to maintain the side, culminating in the team failing to meet throughout the whole of 1973. Throughout this period, it was down to the determination and correspondence of then Bagman Mike 'Lank' Broughton, that the team continued in even this notional form. Lank was a dancer of many years experience, he had seen William Kimber perform at the Royal Albert Hall, and had danced in Watford on the Queen's Coronation Day - though which Queen he has never disclosed. Lank had joined Woodside when they moved to Watford, and if it had not been for his involvement, it seems likely that Woodside's history would have ended c 1972. Having struggled to raise a side for a number of events in that year, there was no choice but to suspend activities until new membership could be found. Lank already had a plan that he suspected could change the club's current bad fortune, and although the side did not meet during 1973, the Bagman was not idle. Lank's hard work paid off, and salvation came to the team, providing not only a new base of operations, but also a ready made pool of members.  The Pump House Theatre and Arts Centre  In the early 1970s, the old Water Board buildings just off Watford's Lower High Street, which had fallen into disrepair following many years of sterling service, became the location of a local centre for arts groups. One particular group, which was particularly influential in the development of the Pump House Theatre and Arts Centre, as it came to be known, was the Watford Folk Club. Woodside's interest in the project, and willingness to become actively involved, created a link not only with the Pump House, where the side still meet today, but also with the Folk Club. What seemed a promising venue for the previously struggling side, also became the source of many new dancers. It had taken a lot of hard work on the part of Lank to negotiate a place at the Pump House, lobbying the committee throughout the preceding year to allow Woodside a home on Wednesday nights, and in the end a place was found - originally in a much smaller venue than the current Colne River Rooms - on the grounds that the side be associated with the folk club. The new membership brought with it a slightly changed attitude to dance venues, and the frequency of dancing out. Where pub's had never been a deterrent to Woodside Morris Men, they now became the mainstay for performances. This was not a complete change in attitude - the tours, [Morris Ring] meetings, days of dance and feasts still remained part of the side's schedule - but the pub evenings became an opportunity to dance out more regularly, and to promote Woodside in the local area.

He was the most prominent Native American of his time in the lower Hudson Valley. Background Prior to Henry Hudson's arrival in 1609, the Wappinger People lived on the eastern shore of the today's Hudson River, a tidal estuary for some half its length. To them, it was the Muhheakantuck, \\"the river that flows both ways\\", and their territory spread from Manhattan Island north to the Roeliff Jansen Kill in Columbia County, and east as far as the Norwalk River Fairfield County, Connecticut. The Wappinger were allied with the Mohican People to the north. Their settlements included camps along the major creeks and Hudson River tributaries with larger villages located where these streams met the river. During the early period of European contact, the population of the Wappingers has been estimated at approximately 600. They are said to have occupied the highlands north of Anthony's Nose to Matteawan Creek (today's Fishkill Creek). Adriaen van der Donck, one of the earliest writers of this portion of the country, assigns them three villages on the Hudson; Keskistkonck, Pasquasheck and Nochpeems; but their principal village was Canopus, which was situated in a valley in Putnam county, and known as Canopus Hollow.Pelletreau, William S., History of Putnam County, New York, W.W. Preston & Co., Philadelphia, 1886, pgs 66-86 To the Dutch and English they were known as the \\"River Indians\\" and the \\"Highland Indians\\". History Robert S. Grumet describes Daniel Nimham as the \\"leader of a small peripatetic group of from two hundred to three hundred displaced Mahican- and Munsee- speaking Indian people\\" who wandered the \\"mountainous contested borderlands separating Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.Grumet, Robert S. \\"The Nimhams of the Colonial Hudson Valley 1667-1783\\", The Hudson River Valley Review, The Hudson River Valley Institute They built small bark houses and log cabins on sparsely settled lands in remote valleys far from colonial roads and towns, and made meager livings weaving baskets, crafting brooms and working seasonal as laborers or servants on nearby farms. He learned to speak English by listening to his new neighbors. After 1746 his residence was at Westenhuck, near Great Barrington, Massachusetts. In 1755, during King George's War, he, with most of his fighting men, traveled to Albany and entered the English service under Sir William Johnson,Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico, Vol.3, Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology, 1912 By March 1758, he was in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, serving as town constable, although it appears he continued to frequent the ancestral lands around Wiccopee in Dutchess County, New York. Land claims In 1697, Adolphus Philipse, a wealthy New York City merchant and son of the first lord of Philipsburg Manor purchased land from two Dutch squatters, Jan Sybrandt (Seberinge) and Lambert Dorlandt. As they had never had a patent, Philips subsequently negotiated a confirmation deed with local representatives of the remaining Wappinger in which they renounced title to the land. Philipse claimed the deed set the Connecticut line as the patent's eastern border. During the French and Indian War, the Wappingers or \\"Indians of the long reach\\" as that section of the river was called, furnished a corps of about three hundred, notably, to serve with Rogers' Rangers. They had moved their families to the Christian Indian mission settlement at Stockbridge, for the duration of the war. When the men returned, they found their land rented by the Philipses to tenant farmers. Daniel Ninham may have learned to speak English through the family of Catheryna Rombout Brett who lived in what is now the City of Beacon, New York. She was friends with the Ninhams and allowed the Wappinger to stay on her land after it had been sold. Most historians suggest Daniel Nimham was born in the Fishkill Creek Region near the hamlet of Wiccopee, New York. Because of Ninham's multicultural skills, he went to court on several occasions to defend his people's land rights. Nimham contested the validity of the Philipse's deed arguing with considerable justification that the Wappinger had been defrauded of their lands.\\"Putnam's Origins\\", PutnamCountyOnline The New York Council, dominated by manor lords, threw out Nimham's claim and jailed his legal advisor, Samuel Munrow, for \\"high misdemeanors\\".Nash, Gary B., \\"The Unknown American Revolution\\", Penguin, 2006 Undeterred, In 1766, Nimham and three Mohican chiefs: Jacob Cheeksaunkun, John Naunauphtaunk and Solomon Uhhaunauwaunmut from the Stockbridge area and three of their wives traveled to England to present his case to the royal Lords of Trade. The trip was financed largely by a combination of sympathetic rent rioters and land speculators. The London Chronicle describes the Nimham group of four chiefs as tall and strong, one being \\"six and a half feet without shoes...dressed in the Indian manner.\\" Although he and his group were treated very well, he never had a meeting with the King directly (unlike the Four Mohawk Kings of half a century earlier), however he did speak with someone who was in the parliament who agreed to contact the governor in Albany, New York. The Lords of Trade reported that there was sufficient cause to investigate \\"frauds and abuses of Indian lands...complained of in the American colonies, and in this colony in particular.\\" And that, \\"the conduct of the lieutenant-governor and the council...does carry with it the colour of great prejudice and partiality, and of an intention to intimidate these Indians from prosecuting their claims.\\" Upon a second hearing before New York Provincial Governor Sir Henry Moore and the Council, John Morin Scott argued that legal title to the land was only a secondary concern. Returning the land to the Indians would set an adverse precedent regarding other similar disputes.Smolenski, John. and Humphrey, Thomas J., New World Orders: Violence, Sanction, and Authority in the Colonial Americas, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2013 Stockbridge Militia Von Ewald sketch of a Stockbridge warrior Daniel's son Abraham Nimham (born in 1745) was appointed captain of a company of Indian scouts serving with the Continental Army, a confederacy of Mohicans, Wappingers, Munsee and other local tribes.Stockbridge Militia by General George Washington. Daniel and Abraham Nimham and his fellow Stockbridge warriors fought for the American cause during the Revolution and were some of America's first Veterans. They served with Washington at Valley Forge and later with General Marquis de Lafayette's troops. It is noted that Daniel \\"faithfully served in the army as a soldier at Cambridge...In 1775 \\". On August 31, 1778, the Nimhams and fifty of their fellow Wappinger were surrounded then killed by Loyalist, British Dragoons and Hessian Soldiers under the command of Lt. Colonel John Graves Simcoe in the Battle of Kingsbridge Cortlandt Ridge in what is now Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. A stone monument to the Stockbridge Warriors who sacrificed their lives for the American cause marks a trail to the battlefield. Mohican Sachem Hendrick Aupaumut and others of the tribe petitioned the General Court for compensation for the losses at the Bronx Massacre, dated September 22, 1778. \\"Our young men have been employed in the present War against the common Enemy and many have lately fell in Battle. Their Widows are now left to care of themselves and their children; without help from their husbands, who at this season of the year provided for their families by hunting. We Indians depend on hunting to clothe ourselves and families. But when we get skins we know not where to go to trade for clothing. We are not able to make any ourselves. Our way of living is very different from our English breathren. And by this, we the subscribers, in behalf of our Tribe now earnestly pray you to consider our circumstances, and open your hearts, by providing such way by which we may be able to procure some coarse cloathing particularly Blankets.\\" By the early 1800s many of the local native people from Stockbridge had joined the Oneida Nation in New York, eventually journeying west to Ontario and Wisconsin.

It is a venue where a large community of composers and sound artists come together to present their music. Each year after the call for works a Radio Request Extravaganza is held. This is a radio show where any work submitted to the project may be requested for airplay. Afterwards, a selection panels finds 60 works for the 60x60 International mix for that year; when 60 composers of a particular region or style are found an alternate mix is created to represent them. When this happens the project presents the alternate mix as well as the international mix in its concert season. After the project has presented the audio mixes, usually presented with an analog clock, 60x60 collaborates with an artist in a different media. A second performance season is held promoting the multimedia collaboration. In conjunction to the performances of the project a CD is made each year to represent the submissions sent to the project. 60x60 has been presented in various types of venues throughout the world from concert halls to classrooms; from contemporary museums to art galleries; from projections on building walls to installations in storefront windows; from large public atriums to bars and nightclubs. 60x60 uses \\"guerrilla\\" production tactics to bring it to the broadest audience possible.

In the late 1980s, Jean-François Denis and Claude Schryer of Montreal, commissioned 25 three-minute pieces for the \\"25 instantanés électroacoustiques\\", Électro Clips, published by empreinted DIGITALes in 1990, IMED 9004. In 1998, Larry Polansky created \\"The Frog Peak Collaborations Project\\" a double album of shorts based on an audio sound file from Chris Mann. In the tradition of projects before it 60x60 has inspired several electroacoustic miniature projects such as David Morneau's 60x365, where he blogged a 60-second composition once every day for a year. And the miniature form continues in many other projects such as Jon Nelson's 50/50 project.

The Cavaliers made the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship each year that Stokes was with the team and during the three years that Stokes played along the legendary Ralph Sampson, the team earned a #1 seed. Coach Stokes was hired in 1999 by Jim Weaver, the new director of athletics at Virginia Tech, to replace the fired Bobby Hussey. In his first year as coach, Stokes brought the Hokies their first winning season since the departure of Bill Foster but that year would be his high water mark in Blacksburg. Beginning with the 2000–01 season, the Hokies departed the Atlantic 10 Conference and joined the much tougher Big East. Stokes was unable to recruit Big East level talent to Virginia Tech and the team's record suffered accordingly. The highlight of his four seasons at Tech were blowout wins over #18 Connecticut and rival Virginia his final year. Stokes was dismissed after a third straight losing season and a 10–38 overall record in the Big East. In none of these three years in the Big East was Virginia Tech able to qualify for the conference post-season tournament under Stokes.

The current music director is conductor Michael Stern. The Symphony performs at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts, located at 1601 Broadway Boulevard. History Kansas City's first symphony orchestra was the Kansas City Symphony, formed in 1911 for Carl Busch. It ceased operations at the start of World War I, as many of the musicians were sent to War. Kansas City's second symphony orchestra was the Kansas City Philharmonic, founded in 1933 and dissolved in 1982. Only months later, seeing the necessity for a new symphony orchestra, businessman and philanthropist R. Crosby Kemper, Jr. founded the Kansas City Symphony. Kemper chose a group of other prominent Kansas Citians, including Hallmark Cards Chairman and CEO Donald J. Hall, Sr. and H&R; Block co-founder Henry W. Bloch, to be the founding trustees; together, the first board established the Symphony's initial endowment. They also promulgated the Symphony's mission, to \\"advance and advocate the art of classical music for the enrichment of the community.\\" In 2002, the Kansas City Symphony was instrumental in developing the Concert Companion, led by then-executive director Roland Valliere. Funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the Concert Companion was tested by the Kansas City Symphony, as well as the New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Pittsburgh Symphony, Aspen Music Festival, and Oakland East Bay Symphony. The previous home of the Symphony was the Lyric Theatre until September 2011 when it moved to Helzberg Hall in the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts. Today The Kansas City Symphony currently has 80 full-time musicians, all area residents. Each year, it plays a 42-week season, which includes subscription concerts, educational concerts, regional and national tours, and public outreach concerts. The Symphony also performs music for the Lyric Opera of Kansas City and the Kansas City Ballet. In addition to ordinary donations and concert proceeds, the Symphony is supported by four specialized auxiliary groups. Together, these groups raise over $1,000,000 each year. Fund-raising events include Kansas City's main debutante ball, the Jewel Ball (which also benefits the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art), the Symphony Ball, the Designers' Showhouse (a home renovation expo in Kansas City's Country Club District which chooses one historic home to renovate each year), a Friends of the Symphony Gift Shop, and a docent program for educational concerts. In the 2018/19 season, the symphony's annual budget was nearly $19 million.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone live with the Kansas City SymphonyThe Symphony released its first compact disc, American Voices, conducted by William McGlaughlin, in 1995. The Sound of Kansas City CD debuted in 2004. In July 2008 the Symphony released Gordon Chin's Formosa Seasons on the Naxos label, and two settings for Shakespeare's Tempest (by Arthur Sullivan and Jean Sibelius) with Reference Recordings. The Symphony released Britten's Orchestra, in 2009, a Vaughan Williams/Elgar disc in 2013 and a Hindemith/Prokofiev/Bartok disc in 2014 also with Reference Recordings. Additionally, the Symphony has performed on National Public Radio and has participated in two nationally broadcast PBS television specials, the latest being Homecoming: The Kansas City Symphony presents Joyce DiDonato, recorded in Helzberg Hall at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts.

Memory occurs through three fundamental stages: encoding, storage, and retrieval. Storing refers to the process of placing newly acquired information into memory, which is modified in the brain for easier storage. Encoding this information makes the process of retrieval easier for the brain where it can be recalled and brought into conscious thinking. Modern memory psychology differentiates between the two distinct types of memory storage: short-term memory and long-term memory. Several models of memory have been proposed over the past century, some of them suggesting different relationships between short- and long-term memory to account for different ways of storing memory.  Types   Short-term memory  Short-term memory is encoded in auditory, visual, spatial, and tactile forms. Short-term memory is closely related to working memory. Baddeley suggested that information stored in short-term memory continuously deteriorates, which can eventually lead to forgetting in the absence of rehearsal. George A. Miller suggested that the capacity of the short-term memory storage is about seven items plus or minus two, also known as the magic number 7, but this number has been shown to be subject to numerous variability, including the size, similarity, and other properties of the chunks. Memory span varies; it is lower for multisyllabic words than for shorter words. In general, the memory span for verbal contents i.e. letters, words, and digits, relies on the duration of time it takes to speak these contents aloud and on the degree of lexicality (relating to the words or the vocabulary of a language distinguished from its grammar and construction) of the contents. Characteristics such as the length of spoken time for each word, known as the word-length effect, or when words are similar to each other lead to fewer words being recalled. Chunking Chunking is the process of grouping pieces of information together into “chunks”. This allows for the brain to collect more information at a given time by reducing it to more-specific groups. With the processes of chunking, the external environment is linked to the internal cognitive processes of the brain. Due to the limited capacity of the working memory, this type of storage is necessary for memory to properly function. The exact number of chunks that can be present in the working memory is not definite, but ranges from one to three chunks. The recall is not measured in terms of the items that are being remembered, but they chunks that they are put into.Yamaguchi, M., Randle, J.M., Wilson, T.L., & Logan, G.D. (2017). Pushing typists back on the learning curve: Memory chunking improves retrieval of prior typing episodes. Journal of Experimental Psychology. Learning, Memory, and Cognition, (43)9, 1432-1447. This type of memory storage is typically effective, as it has been found that with the appearance of the first item in a chunk, the other items can be immediately recalled. Though errors may occur, it if more common for the errors to occur at the beginning of the chunk than in the middle of the chunk. Chunks can be recalled with long-term or working memory. Simple chunks of information can be recalled without having to go through long term memory, such as the sequence ABABAB, which would use working memory for recollection. More difficult sequences, such as a phone number, would have to be split into chunks and may have to pass through long-term memory to be recalled. The spacing used in phone numbers is a common chunking method, as the grouping in the numbers allows for the digits to be remembered in clusters and not individually. Chunking was introduced by George A. Miller who suggested that this way of organizing and processing information allows for a more effective retention of material from the environment. Miller developed the idea that chunking was a collection of similar items and when that chunk was named, it allowed for the items in that chunk to be more easily recalled. Other researchers described the items in these chunks as being strongly connected to each other, but not to the other items in other chunks. Each chunk, in their findings, would hold only the items pertaining to that topic, and not have it be relatable to any other chunk or items in that chunk. The menu for a restaurant would display this type of chucking, as the entrée category would not display anything from the dessert category, and the dessert category would not display anything form the entrée category. Psychologist and master chess player Adriaan de Groot supported the theory of chunking through his experiment on chess positions and different levels of expertise. When presented positions of pieces from chess tournament games, the experts were more accurate at recalling the positions. However, when the groups were given random positions to remember, De Groot found that all groups performed poorly at the recalling task regardless of the participants knowledge of chess. Further research into chunking greatly impacted the studies of memory development, expertise, and immediate recall. Research into behavioral and imaging studies have also suggested that chunking can be applied to habit learning, motor skills, language processing, and visual perception.  Rehearsal  Rehearsal is the process by which information is retained in short-term memory by conscious repetition of the word, phrase or number. If information has sufficient meaning to the person or if it is repeated enough, it can be encoded into long-term memory. There are two types of rehearsal: maintenance rehearsal and elaborate rehearsal. Maintenance rehearsal consists of constantly repeating the word or phrase of words to remember.Moore, T. (n.d.). Rehearsal. Retrieved November 6, 2014, from http://psychology.jrank.org/pages/539/Rehearsal.html Remembering a phone number is one of the best examples of this. Maintenance rehearsal is mainly used for the short-term ability to recall information. Elaborate rehearsal involves the association of old with new information.  Long-term memory  In contrast to the short-term memory, long-term memory refers to the ability to hold information for a prolonged time and is possibly the most complex component of the human memory system. The Atkinson–Shiffrin model of memory (Atkinson 1968) suggests that the items stored in short-term memory moves to long-term memory through repeated practice and use. Long-term storage may be similar to learning—the process by which information that may be needed again is stored for recall on demand.Peterson, L. (1966). Short-term memory. Retrieved October 30, 2014, from http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v215/n1/pdf/scientificamerican0766-90.pdf The process of locating this information and bringing it back to working memory is called retrieval. This knowledge that is easily recalled is explicit knowledge, whereas most long-term memory is implicit knowledge and is not readily retrievable. Scientists speculate that the hippocampus is involved in the creation of long-term memory. It is unclear where long-term memory is stored, although there is evidence depicting long-term memory is stored in various parts of the nervous system.Warren, S. (1997). Remember this: Memory and the Brain. Retrieved November 1, 2014, from https://serendipstudio.org/biology/b103/f97/projects97/Warren.html Long-term memory is permanent. Memory can be recalled, which, according to the dual- store memory search model, enhances the long-term memory. Forgetting may occur when the memory fails to be recalled on later occasions.  Models  Several memory models have been proposed to account for different types of recall processes, including cued recall, free recall, and serial recall. However, to explain the recall process, the memory model must identify how an encoded memory can reside in the memory storage for a prolonged period until the memory is accessed again, during the recall process; but not all models use the terminology of short-term and long-term memory to explain memory storage; the dual-store theory and a modified version of Atkinson–Shiffrin model of memory (Atkinson 1968) uses both short-and long-term memory storage, but others do not.  Multi-trace distributed memory model  The multi-trace distributed memory model suggests that the memories that are being encoded are converted to vectors of values, with each scalar quantity of a vector representing a different attribute of the item to be encoded. Such notion was first suggested by early theories of Hooke (1969) and Semon (1923). A single memory is distributed to multiple attributes, or features, so that each attribute represents one aspect of the memory being encoded. Such a vector of values is then added into the memory array or a matrix, composed of different traces or vectors of memory. Therefore, every time a new memory is encoded, such memory is converted to a vector or a trace, composed of scalar quantities representing variety of attributes, which is then added to pre-existing and ever-growing memory matrix, composed of multiple traces—hence the name of the model. Once memory traces corresponding to specific memory are stored in the matrix, to retrieve the memory for the recall process one must cue the memory matrix with a specific probe, which would be used to calculate the similarity between the test vector and the vectors stored in the memory matrix. Because the memory matrix is constantly growing with new traces being added in, one would have to perform a parallel search through all the traces present within the memory matrix to calculate the similarity, whose result can be used to perform either associative recognition, or with probabilistic choice rule, used to perform a cued recall. While it has been claimed that human memory seems to be capable of storing a great amount of information, to the extent that some had thought an infinite amount, the presence of such ever-growing matrix within human memory sounds implausible. In addition, the model suggests that to perform the recall process, parallel-search between every single trace that resides within the ever-growing matrix is required, which also raises doubt on whether such computations can be done in a short amount of time. Such doubts, however, have been challenged by findings of Gallistel and King who present evidence on the brain’s enormous computational abilities that can be in support of such parallel support.  Neural network models  The multi- trace model had two key limitations: one, notion of the presence of ever- growing matrix in human memory sounds implausible; and two, computational searches for similarity against millions of traces that would be present in memory matrix to calculate similarity sounds far beyond the scope of the human recalling process. The neural network model is the ideal model in this case, as it overcomes the limitations posed by the multi-trace model and maintains the useful features of the model as well. The neural network model assumes that neurons in a neural network form a complex network with other neurons, forming a highly interconnected network; each neuron is characterized by the activation value, and the connection between two neurons is characterized by the weight value. Interaction between each neuron is characterized by the McCulloch–Pitts dynamical rule, and change of weight and connections between neurons resulting from learning is represented by the Hebbian learning rule. Anderson shows that combination of Hebbian learning rule and McCulloch–Pitts dynamical rule allow network to generate a weight matrix that can store associations between different memory patterns – such matrix is the form of memory storage for the neural network model. Major differences between the matrix of multiple traces hypothesis and the neural network model is that while new memory indicates extension of the existing matrix for the multiple traces hypothesis, weight matrix of the neural network model does not extend; rather, the weight is said to be updated with introduction of new association between neurons. Using the weight matrix and learning/dynamic rule, neurons cued with one value can retrieve the different value that is ideally a close approximation of the desired target memory vector. As the Anderson’s weight matrix between neurons will only retrieve the approximation of the target item when cued, modified version of the model was sought in order to be able to recall the exact target memory when cued. The Hopfield Net is currently the simplest and most popular neural network model of associative memory; the model allows the recall of clear target vector when cued with the part or the 'noisy' version of the vector. The weight matrix of Hopfield Net, that stores the memory, closely resembles the one used in weight matrix proposed by Anderson. Again, when new association is introduced, the weight matrix is said to be ‘updated’ to accommodate the introduction of new memory; it is stored until the matrix is cued by a different vector.  Dual-store memory search model  First developed by Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968), and refined by others, including Raajimakers and Shiffrin, the dual-store memory search model, now referred to as SAM or search of associative memory model, remains as one of the most influential computational models of memory. The model uses both short-term memory, termed short-term store (STS), and long-term memory, termed long-term store (LTS) or episodic matrix, in its mechanism. When an item is first encoded, it is introduced into the short-term store. While the item stays in the short-term store, vector representations in long-term store go through a variety of associations. Items introduced in short-term store go through three different types of association: (autoassociation) the self- association in long-term store, (heteroassociation) the inter-item association in long-term store, and the (context association ) which refers to association between the item and its encoded context. For each item in short-term store, the longer the duration of time an item resides within the short-term store, the greater its association with itself will be with other items that co- reside within short-term store, and with its encoded context. The size of the short-term store is defined by a parameter, r. As an item is introduced into the short-term store, and if the short-term store has already been occupied by a maximum number of items, the item will probably drop out of the short-term storage. As items co-reside in the short-term store, their associations are constantly being updated in the long-term store matrix. The strength of association between two items depends on the amount of time the two memory items spend together within the short-term store, known as the contiguity effect. Two items that are contiguous have greater associative strength and are often recalled together from long-term storage. Furthermore, the primacy effect, an effect seen in memory recall paradigm, reveals that the first few items in a list have a greater chance of being recalled over others in the STS, while older items have a greater chance of dropping out of STS. The item that managed to stay in the STS for an extended amount of time would have formed a stronger autoassociation, heteroassociation and context association than others, ultimately leading to greater associative strength and a higher chance of being recalled. The recency effect of recall experiments is when the last few items in a list are recalled exceptionally well over other items, and can be explained by the short-term store. When the study of a given list of memory has been finished, what resides in the short-term store in the end is likely to be the last few items that were introduced last. Because the short- term store is readily accessible, such items would be recalled before any item stored within long-term store. This recall accessibility also explains the fragile nature of recency effect, which is that the simplest distractors can cause a person to forget the last few items in the list, as the last items would not have had enough time to form any meaningful association within the long-term store. If the information is dropped out of the short-term store by distractors, the probability of the last items being recalled would be expected to be lower than even the pre-recency items in the middle of the list. The dual-store SAM model also utilizes memory storage, which itself can be classified as a type of long-term storage: the semantic matrix. The long- term store in SAM represents the episodic memory, which only deals with new associations that were formed during the study of an experimental list; pre- existing associations between items of the list, then, need to be represented on different matrix, the semantic matrix. The semantic matrix remains as another source of information that is not modified by episodic associations that are formed during the exam. Thus, the two types of memory storage, short- and long-term stores, are used in the SAM model. In the recall process, items residing in short-term memory store will be recalled first, followed by items residing in long-term store, where the probability of being recalled is proportional to the strength of the association present within the long-term store. Another memory storage, the semantic matrix, is used to explain the semantic effect associated with memory recall.

The dynasty was established by Emperor Taizu of Song with his usurpation of the throne of Later Zhou, ending the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The Song is considered a high point of classical Chinese innovation in science and technology, an era that featured prominent intellectual figures such as Shen Kuo and Su Song and the revolutionary use of gunpowder weapons. However, it was also a period of political and military turmoil, with opposing and often aggressive political factions formed at court that impeded political, social, and economic progress. The frontier management policies of the Chancellor Wang Anshi exacerbated hostile conditions along the Chinese-Vietnamese border. This sparked a border war with Vietnam's Lý dynasty, which was fought to a mutual draw and concluded with a peace treaty in 1082. To the northwest the Song Empire frequently quarreled with the rival Western Xia, led by the Tanguts, as well as the Liao Dynasty to the northeast, led by ethnic Khitans. The Song Empire suffered a disastrous military defeat at the hands of invading Jurchens from the north in 1127 during the Jin–Song wars. Following the Jingkang Incident, the remnants of the Song court were forced to flee south from Kaifeng and establish a new capital at Hangzhou. The loss of northern territory and shifting of the capital marks the division of the dynasty into two distinct periods: the Northern Song (960-1127) and the Southern Song (1127-1279). The Southern Song developed a new navy to combat the Jurchen's Jin dynasty formed in the north. The Song dynasty was able to defeat further Jurchen invasions and even fought the Jin dynasty in an erstwhile alliance with the Mongols. However, the Mongol rulers Genghis Khan, Ögedei Khan, Möngke Khan, and finally Kublai Khan gradually conquered China, until the fall of the final Song emperor at the Battle of Yamen in 1279. Founding of the Song The Conquest of Song Dynasty from 960 to 979 which ended the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The Later Zhou was the last of the Five Dynasties that had controlled northern China after the fall of the Tang dynasty in 907. Zhao Kuangyin, later known as Emperor Taizu (r. 960–976), usurped the throne and deposed the last Zhou ruler Guo Zongxun with the support of military commanders in 960, initiating the Song dynasty. Upon taking the throne, his first goal was the reunification of China after half a century of political division.Lorge (2015), 4-5. This included the conquests of Nanping, Wu-Yue, Southern Han, Later Shu, and Southern Tang in the south as well as the Northern Han and the Sixteen Prefectures in the north. With capable military officers such as Pan Mei (d. 991), Liu Tingrang (929–987), Cao Bin (931–999) and Huyan Zan (d. 1000), the early Song military became the dominant force in China. Innovative military tactics, such as defending supply lines across floating pontoon bridges led to success in battle such as the Song assault against the Southern Tang state while crossing the Yangzi River in 974.Graff, 87. Using a mass of arrow fire from crossbowmen, Song forces were able to defeat the renowned war elephant corps of the Southern Han on 23 January 971, thus forcing the submission of Southern Han and terminating the first and last elephant corps that would make up a regular division within a Chinese army.Schafer, 291.

Song military forces then turned north against the Northern Han, which fell to Song forces in 979. However, efforts to take the Sixteen Prefectures were unsuccessful and they were incorporated into the Liao state based in Manchuria to the immediate north instead.Ebrey et al., 154. To the far northwest, the Tanguts had been in power over northern Shaanxi since 881, after the earlier Tang court appointed a Tangut chief as a military governor (jiedushi) over the region, a seat that became hereditary (forming the Xi-Xia dynasty).Ebrey et al., 155. Although the Song state was evenly matched against the Liao dynasty, the Song gained significant military victories against the Western Xia (who would eventually fall to the Mongol conquest of Genghis Khan in 1227).Needham, Volume 1, 133. After political consolidation through military conquest, Emperor Taizu held a famous banquet inviting many of the high-ranking military officers that had served him in Song's various conquests. As his military officers drank wine and feasted with Taizu, he spoke to them about the potential of a military coup against him like those of Five Dynasties era. His military officers protested against this notion, and insisted that none were as qualified as him to lead the country. The passage of this account in the Song Shi follows as such: > The emperor said, 'The life of man is short. Happiness is to have the wealth > and means to enjoy life, and then to be able to leave the same prosperity to > one's descendents. If you, my officers, will renounce your military > authority, retire to the provinces, and choose there the best lands and the > most delightful dwelling-places, there to pass the rest of your lives in > pleasure and peace...would this not be better than to live a life of peril > and uncertainty? So that no shadow of suspicion shall remain between prince > and ministers, we will ally our families with marriages, and thus, ruler and > subject linked in friendship and amity, we will enjoy tranquility'...The > following day, the army commanders all offered their resignations, reporting > (imaginary) maladies, and withdrew to the country districts, where the > emperor, giving them splendid gifts, appointed them to high official > positions.Needham, Volume 1, 132. Emperor Taizu developed an effective centralized bureaucracy staffed with civilian scholar-officials and regional military governors and their supporters were replaced by centrally appointed officials. This system of civilian rule led to a greater concentration of power in the central government headed by the emperor than had been possible during the previous dynasties. In the early 11th century, there were some 30,000 men who took the prefectural exams per year (see imperial examination), which steadily increased to roughly 80,000 by the end of the century, and to 400,000 exam takers during the 13th century.Ebrey et al., 160. Although new municipal governments were often established, the same number of prefectures and provinces were in existence as before the Song came to power. Thus although more people were taking exams, roughly the same number were being accepted into the government as in previous periods, making the civil service exams very competitive amongst aspiring students and scholars. Emperor Taizu also found other ways to consolidate and strengthen his power, including updated map-making (cartography) so that his central administration could easily discern how to handle affairs in the provinces. In 971, he ordered Lu Duosun to update and 're-write all the Tu Jing [maps] in the world'; a daunting task for one individual. Nonetheless, he traveled throughout the provinces to collect illustrative gazetteers and as much data as possible.Needham, Volume 3, 518. With the aid of Song Zhun, the massive work was completed in 1010, with some 1566 chapters.Hargett (1996), 413. The later Song Shi historical text stated (Wade–Giles spelling): > Yuan Hsieh (d. +1220) was Director-General of governmental grain stores. In > pursuance of his schemes for the relief of famines he issued orders that > each pao (village) should prepare a map which would show the fields and > mountains, the rivers and the roads in fullest detail. The maps of all the > pao were joined together to make a map of the tu (larger district), and > these in turn were joined with others to make a map of the hsiang and the > hsien (still larger districts). If there was any trouble about the > collection of taxes or the distribution of grain, or if the question of > chasing robbers and bandits arose, the provincial officials could readily > carry out their duties by the aid of the maps. Taizu also displayed a strong interest in science and technology. He employed the Imperial Workshop to support such projects as Zhang Sixun's hydraulic- powered armillary sphere (for astronomical observation and time-keeping) that used liquid mercury instead of water (because liquid mercury would not freeze during winter).Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 469–471. Emperor Taizu was also quite open-minded in his affairs, especially with those perceived as foreigners: he appointed the Arab Muslim Ma Yize (910–1005) as the chief astronomer of the Song court. For receiving envoys from the Korean kingdom of Goryeo alone, the Song court had roughly 1,500 volumes written about the nuanced rules, regulations, and guidelines for their reception.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 138. The Song also sent envoys abroad, such as Wang Yande (939–1006), who was sent as an official envoy to the Uyghur-Turkic city of Gaochang in 981,Brose (2008), 258. then under Kara- Khanid control. From the 2nd century onwards, ancient Chinese histories even record that embassies of the Roman Empire (\\"Daqin\\") and Byzantine Empire (\\"Fu lin\\") arrived in China. As recorded in the History of Song and Wenxian Tongkao, the last known arrival of Byzantine envoys came in 1081, apparently sent by Michael VII Doukas to the court of Emperor Shenzong of Song.Sezgin et. al. (1996), p. 25. However, the History of Yuan records that a Byzantine man served as an astronomer and physician at the court of Kublai Khan during the subsequent Yuan dynasty,Bretschneider (1888), p. 144. and in 1371 the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty sent an alleged Byzantine merchant (who was likely Nicolaus de Bentra, Archbishop of Khanbaliq) to inform the Byzantine ruler of the founding of the new dynasty.Luttwak (2009), pp. 169-170.  Relations with Liao and Western Xia The Great Ditch and Treaty of Shanyuan Contemporary portrait of Emperor Taizong of Song, National Palace Museum, Taipei Relations between the Song and Liao (led by the Khitans) were relatively peaceful in the first two decades after Song was founded, the disputed territories of the Northern Han and the Sixteen Prefectures notwithstanding. In 974, the two began exchanging embassies on New Years Day. However, in 979 the Song moved against the Northern Han, long under the protection of the Liao dynasty. The Song emperor succeeded in forcing the Northern Han to surrender, but when marching on the Liao Southern Capital (present-day Beijing) in the Sixteen Prefectures, Song forces were defeated at the Battle of Gaoliang River.Mote, 69. This defeat was politically damaging to the prestige of Emperor Taizong of Song (r. 976–997), so much so that his top military commanders orchestrated an aborted coup to replace him with his nephew Zhao Dezhao.Lorge (2008), 67. Relations between the Song and Liao remained tense and hostile: in 986 the Song sent three armies against the Liao in an effort to take advantage of an infant emperor and recapture the Sixteen Prefectures, but the Liao successfully repulsed all three armies.Lorge (2008), 60. Following this, diplomatic relations were resumed. Relations between Song and Liao worsened in the 990s. From 993 to 1004, the Liao observed the Song as the latter built a 'Great Ditch' in northern Hebei province from the Taihang Mountains in the west all the way to the Bohai Sea in the east.Lorge (2008), 59–61. This was essentially a series of canals meant to block the advance of Liao cavalry far from the northern border line, although the Liao perceived this engineering project as a means for the Song to dispatch offensive forces more efficiently via new waterways.Lorge (2008), 60–62. In 999 the Liao began annual attacks on Song positions, though with no breakthrough victories. The Liao were interested in capturing the Guannan region of northern Hebei, both because the Song general Zhou Shizong had taken it from them and because it contained strategic passes.Lorge (2008), 65. A 12th century Song painting of ladies processing silk; as part of the agreement in the Treaty of Shanyuan, the Song sent annual tribute of 200,000 bolts of silk to the Khitan Liao dynasty. In 1004, Liao forces managed to march deep into Song territory, camping out in Shanyuan, about north of the Song capital of Kaifeng. However, their forces were greatly overextended and any possible escape route was in danger of being blocked by Song forces.Lorge (2008), 70. Eventually, the completion of the 'Great Ditch' as an effective defensive blockade which slowed the advance of Liao cavalry forced the Liao to request a truce.Lorge (2008), 71. Negotiations resulted in the Treaty of Shanyuan, signed in January 1005 (some sources cite 1004 due to the Chinese Lunar Calendar), which fixed the borders of the Song and Liao as they were before the conflict. The Khitan rulers also wanted to intermarry with the Zhao family line of the Song, an offer that the Song refused in favor of a nominal and figurative imperial kinship.Lorge (2008), 66. However, the treaty required the Song to make annual tribute payments to the Liao and recognize Liao equality with the Song.Mote, 70–71. The tribute consisted of 283 kg (100,000 oz) of silver along with 200,000 bolts of silk, increasing to 500,000 units by 1042. However, even with the increase in 1042, the Song economy was not damaged by this enforced tribute. The bullion holding of the Liao dynasty did not increase with the tribute either, since the Song exported many goods annually to the Liao, dwarfing the amount of imported goods from Liao. Therefore, much of the silver sent to Liao as tribute was used to pay for Song Chinese goods, and the silver wound up back into the hands of Chinese merchants and the Song government. Until the Song dynasty took advantage of a large rebellion within the Liao Kingdom in 1125, the Song had to conduct cordial relations with the Liao. Skilled ambassadors were sent on missions to court the Liao and maintain peace, such as the renowned horologist, engineer, and state minister Su Song.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 446. The Song also prepared for armed conflict, increasing the overall size of the armed forces to a million soldiers by 1022. By that time, however, the military was consuming three- quarters of the tax revenues gathered by the state, compared to a mere 2 or 3 percent of state income that would be consumed by just providing the Liao with tribute. Due to these circumstances, intense political rivalries would later arise in the Song court over how to handle these issues.

Bronze edicts written in the Tangut script of the Western Xia; edict plates were used to send urgent documents and messages, under imperial orders. When these matching pieces are joined together, they prove the bearer's identity. The Song came into conflict with the Tanguts of the Western Xia dynasty as early as the 980s, when Song intended to retake the former Ordos prefectures of the late Tang dynasty, then held by the Tanguts.Dunnell (1996), xxi, 13, 91 After the Tangut leader Li Jiqian died in 1004, the Tanguts under his successor Li Deming (r. 1005–1032) had initially attacked the Song, but later sought peaceful relations which brought economic benefits until 1038.Lorge (2005), 44.McGrath (2008), 152. After Li Jipeng (aka Zhao Baozhong), a Tangut prince who had submitted to the Song dynasty,Lorge (2005), 211. raided Xia's territory and destroyed some fortified settlements in 1034, the Tanguts under Li Yuanhao (1003–1048) retaliated.McGrath (2008), 155. On 12 September 1034 the Tanguts raided Qingzhou in Huanqing Circuit, but later Li Yuanhao released Song officers and soldiers he had captured; by 29 January 1035 relations were restored when Li Yuanhao sent tribute of fifty horses to the Song court and requested a copy of a Buddhist canon in return, which he received. Although he retained some unique Tangut customs and had a Tangut script created, Li's administration followed the traditional Chinese model of bureaus.McGrath (2008), 154–156. Li proclaimed himself the first imperial ruler of Western Xia, ruling as Emperor Jingzong (r. 1038–1048), and on 10 November 1038 he sent an envoy to the Song capital in order to gain recognition for his new title as \\"Son of Blue Heaven\\" and to cease paying tribute to Song to affirm his new status.McGrath (2008), 157. The Xia began attacks on Song's borders which were repulsed by Song commander Lu Shouqin (fl. 1030–1050), and on 9 January 1039 the Song shut down its border markets and soon after a reward of 100,000 strings of coin was offered to anyone who could capture Emperor Jingzong.McGrath, 157–159. Although he won impressive victories in the initial phase of the war, Jingzong gained no additional territory for Western Xia by war's end in 1044, while both sides had lost tens of thousands of troops.Lorge (2005), 44–45.McGrath (2008), 152, 157–158 Emperor Jingzong also conceded to the Song demand that he refer to himself as an inferior subject when addressing the Song, and that he accept Song ritualists to perform official ceremonies at his court.McGrath (2008), 157–158. Throughout the war, the Song had maintained a number of fortified military outposts stretching some from the westernmost prefectures of Shaanxi to Hedong in what is now Shanxi.McGrath (2008), 153. Since the Song could not rely on water obstacle defenses in this region—like the Great Ditch of Hebei used against Liao—they instead garrisoned the wide expanse with a recorded 200 imperial battalions and 900 provincial and militia battalions by 1043. The war was costly and the Song state had to raise the taxes by fifty percent in the Hubei, Hedong and Shanxi circuits. Even after the end of the conflict, maintaining standing army in the resource- poor northern regions placed a heavy burden on the economy. Defence expenditures amounted to 50 million strings of cash by 1067, out of the total income of 60 million.Twitchett ed., 348-349 Relations broke down once more in 1067 with the ascension of Emperor Shenzong of Song,McGrath (2008), 158. and in the 1070s the Song had considerable success in capturing Tangut territory. A mood of frontier adventurism permeated Shenzong's court, as well as a desire to reclaim territories he felt belonged to him as the rightful ruler of China; when a Song general led an unprovoked attack on a Western Xia border town, Shenzong appeared at the border to commend the general himself.Anderson (2008), 206. To punish the Western Xia and damage their economy, Emperor Shenzong also shut down all commercial border markets along the Song-Western Xia border. The scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095) was sent to Yanzhou (now Yan'an, Shaanxi province) in 1080 to stave off Tangut military invasion.Sivin, III, 8. He successfully defended his fortified position, yet the new Grand Councillor Cai Que held him responsible for the death of a rival Song military officer and the decimation of that officer's forces; as a result, Shen Kuo was ousted from office and the state abandoned the projected land that Shen was able to defend.Sivin, III, 9. When Empress Dowager Gao died in 1093, Emperor Zhezong of Song asserted himself at court by ousting the political conservatives led by Sima Guang, reinstating Wang Anshi's reforms, and halting all negotiations with the Tanguts of the Western Xia. This resulted in continued armed conflict between the Song dynasty and the Western Xia. In 1099, the Northern Song launched a campaign into Xining and Haidong (in modern Qinghai province), occupying territory that was controlled by the Tibetan Gusiluo regime since the 10th century.Dunnell (1996), 75. By 1116, Song managed to acquire all of its territory and incorporated it into prefectures; the area became the westernmost frontier against the Western Xia.Wang (2001), 15. Relations with Đại Việt and border conflict The Lý dynasty controlled areas seen in light yellow on the map, then called Đại Việt, bordered by Champa and the Khmer Empire Background For roughly a millennium a series of Chinese dynasties had controlled northern Vietnam, until the Vietnamese regained independence in 905 when a local noble Khúc Thừa Dụ became jiedushi (governor) of Tĩnh Hải circuit, amid the collapsion of Tang Empire. In 938, Vietnamese general Ngô Quyền defeated the Chinese invasion on Bạch Đằng River, firmly ended the Chinese domination. In 939, he established the monarch Ngô dynasty (939–965), secured the Vietnamese independence.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. In 968, Duke Đinh Bộ Lĩnh reunited northern Vietnam under new Đinh dynasty and renamed his kingdom to Đại Cồ Việt (大瞿越). Đại Cồ Việt's independence was recognized by Emperor Taizong of Song in 973 with the nominate tributary relationship, regarded as Annam. However, when Vietnam had political unstable in 980, the Chinese Emperor sent a 40,000-men forces led by Hou Renbao to invade Vietnam as he said \\"recover Giao Chỉ\\"History of Song, vol. 488 in early 981, but were defeated by general Lê Hoàn (941–1005), who later was elected as the new king of the Vietnamese and also was recognized by the Chinese Empire. Lê Hoàn's son Lê Long Đĩnh succeed and ruled the country from 1005 to 1009, sent tributes to Song China, brought many Mahayana Buddhist sutras and Taoist books to Vietnam, and translated into Vietnamese.Khâm định Việt sử Thông giám cương mục, Main/vol. 2 The relationship of Song China to the Vietnamese remained in peace. The new Vietnamese ruler, Lý Công Uẩn, replaced the house of Lê in November 1009, and Song China continued recognizing the Lý monarchs like previous. Vietnamese tributary envoys sent to China horses, jades, and received back books, sutras, clothes and gold belts. In 1014, Đại Việt engaged a border conflict with Dali kingdom in Northwest Vietnam. King Lý Công Uẩn's envoy Phùng Chân brought 100 horses captured from Dali forces to Song court as gifts. Subsequently, the Zhuang rebel Nong Zhigao (Nùng Trí Cao) (1025–1053) attempted to establish his own frontier kingdom in 1042, 1048, and 1052, creating a disturbance on Song's southern border that prompted an invasion against Nong Zhigao/Nùng Trí Cao's forces in the 1050s. This invasion resulted in the Song conquest of border regions inhabited by Tai peoples and a border confrontation with the Lý dynasty (1010–1225) that lasted from 1075 to 1077.Anderson (2008), 191. The Song court's interest in maximizing the economic benefits of these frontier zones came into conflict with the Lý dynasty, whose goal was to consolidate their peripheral fiefdoms. In the aftermath, an agreement was negotiated by both sides that fixed the borders; the resulting line of demarcation \\"would largely remain in place through to the present day\\", according to James A. Anderson, Associate Professor in the History Department at the University of North Carolina.Anderson (2008), 191–192. Border hostilities The Vietnamese court had not intervened when the Song general Di Qing (1008–1061) crushed the border rebellion of Nùng Trí Cao in 1053.Anderson (2008), 195. During the two decades of relative regional peace that followed, the Vietnamese observed the threat of Song expansion, as more Han Chinese settlers moved into areas which the Vietnamese relied upon for the extraction of natural resources.Anderson (2008), 195–198. Initially, a division of Di Qing's soldiers (originally from Shandong) had settled the region, followed by a wave of Chinese settlers from north of the Yangzi River.Anderson (2008), 198. The Guangnan West Circuit Fiscal Commissioner, Wang Han (fl. 1043–1063), feared that Nùng Trí Cao's kinsmen Nùng Tông Đán intended to plunder the region after he crossed the Song border in 1057. Wang Han took a personal visit to Nùng Tông Đán's camp and spoke with Nùng Trí Cao's son, explaining that seeking \\"Interior Dependency\\" status would alienate them from the Vietnamese, but if they remained outside of China proper they could safely act as loyal frontier militia. Wang Han then sent a memorial to Emperor Renzong's (r. 1022–1063) court in 1060, advocating the policy agreed with the Nùng.Anderson (2008), 196. The Song government rejected his proposal and made the Nùng communities (along with other ethnic groups) official dependents of Song imperial authority, and Nùng Tông Đán's request that the territories under his authority be incorporated into the Song Empire was granted in 1062. In 1059—six years before the Song court's New Policies under Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021–1086) organized new self-sufficient militia units throughout the empire and along the border with Đại Việt—the Vietnamese ruler Lý Thánh Tông reorganized northern frontier administrative units and raised new militias.Anderson (2008), 199. This bolstered his kingdom's strength in a time of conflict with Champa (located in southern Vietnam). In the spring of 1060, Giáp Đồng natives under the frontier prefectural governor Thân Thiệu Thái (996-1066)—an Tày officer in-law to the Vietnamese court through marriage alliance—raided the Song frontier for cattle and militia recruits. He succeeded in taking the Song military leader Yang Baocai hostage, and in autumn of 1060 Song troops were sent into the frontier to rescue the general but he was not found. The Song court appointed Yu Jing (余靖; 1000–1064) as a new military commissioner of the Guangnan region and charged him with the task of quelling the unrest caused by Thân Thiệu Tháii. Yu Jing also sent an agent to Champa to enlist Cham aid against the Song's enemies in Guangnan.Anderson (2008), 200. Tribute and intrigue Elephas maximus; the Lý Dynasty court sent nine elephants as tribute to the Song capital of Kaifeng on February 8, 1063. The Vietnamese court discovered the Song's secret attempt to ally with Champa; while Dai Viet sent a delegation to Yongzhou to thank Song for putting down local rebellions and to negotiate terms of peace, they instructed their agents to gather intelligence on the alleged Champa alliance and the strength of Song's military presence in the Guangnan Western Circuit. Two Vietnamese envoys were permitted to offer tribute to the court of Renzong in Kaifeng, arriving on 8 February 1063 to deliver gifts, including nine tamed elephants. On 30 March 1063, Emperor Renzong died and was succeeded by Emperor Yingzong (r.1063–1067); Vietnamese envoys arrived in Kaifeng again to congratulate Yingzong on his ascension, and on 7 April 1063, Yingzong sent gifts such as calligraphy works by Renzong to Vietnamese King Lý Thánh Tông. On the day that the Vietnamese envoy Lý Kế Tiên prepared to depart from Kaifeng back to Đại Việt, news arrived that Thàn Thiệu Thái had raided Song's Guangnan West Circuit again.Anderson (2008), 201. Although a plea from a Guangnan official urged Kaifeng to take action, Yingzong left defenses up to local Guangnan forces and labeled Thàn Thiệu Thái as \\"reckless and mad\\" in an effort to disassociate him from the Lý court. The minor Song official Lu Shen, a prefect in Guizhou, sent a message to Kaifeng in 1065 which reported that Nùng Tông Đán had apparently switched allegiance from Song to Lý, as well as united with the Quảng Nguyên chieftain Lưu Ký.Anderson (2008), 202. When the now \\"mentally weak and distracted ruler\\" Yingzong—as Anderson describes him—received the report, he took no other action but to reassign Nùng Tông Đán with new honorific titles. The court took no action to resolve the problem, and Nùng Tông Đán later played a key role in the Lý–Song War of 1075–1077. The Song also gave official titles to other Vietnamese leaders despite their involvement in Nùng Trí Cao's rebellions and their pledged loyalty to Lưu Ký, the latter employed as a tribal official under King Lý Thánh Tông.Anderson (2008), 202–203. Yingzong died on 8 January 1067, and was replaced by Emperor Shenzong (r. 1067–1085), who like his father, heaped rewards on Vietnamese leaders but was more observant of the Vietnamese delegations. When Vietnamese envoys arrived in Kaifeng to congratulate Shenzong on his ascension, he sent lavish gifts to the Lý court, including a golden belt, silver ingots, 300 bolts of silk, two horses, a saddle inlaid with gold and silver plating, and on 9 February 1067 bestowed the Vietnamese ruler Lý Thánh Tông with the official title \\"King of the Southern Pacified Region\\" (Chinese:南平王, pinyin: nán píng wáng, Vietnamese: Nam Bình Vương). Shenzong also countered Nùng Tông Đán's defection by recognizing his kinsman Nùng Trí Hội as the Nùng clan leader in 1069, giving him a title similar to Tông Đán's and command over Guihua prefecture (also known as Wuyang grotto settlement).Anderson (2008), 203. Frontier policy and war In his New Policies sponsored by Shenzong, Wang Anshi enhanced central authority over Song's frontier administrations, increased militia activity, increased troop levels and war horses sent to the frontiers (including the border areas with Đại Việt), and actively sought loyal supporters in border regions who could heighten the pace of extraction of local resources for the state's disposal. Officials at court debated the merits or faults of Wang's policies, yet criticism of his reforms even appeared in Đại Việt, where the high officer Lý Thường Kiệt (1019–1105) publicly announced that Wang's policies were deliberate efforts to seize and control their border frontiers.Anderson (2008), 206–207. Tensions between Song and Lý were critical, and in these conditions any sign of hostility had potential to ignite a war. The location of modern Hanoi in Vietnam, where the Đại Việt's capital of Thăng Long was located, and which Song forces nearly besieged before both sides agreed to withdraw The Quảng Nguyên chieftain Lưu Ký launched an unexpected attack against Yongzhou in 1075, which was repelled by the Song's Vietnamese officer Nùng Trí Hội in charge of Guihua.Anderson (2008), 207. Shenzong then sought to cement an alliance with the \\"Five Clans\\" of northern Guangnan by issuing an edict which would standardize their once irregular tribute missions to visit Kaifeng now every five years. Shenzong had officials sent from the capital to supervise militiamen in naval training exercises. Shenzong then ordered that all merchants were to cease trade with the subjects of Đại Việt, a further indication of heightened hostility that prompted the Vietnamese court under Lý Nhân Tông (r. 1072–1127) to prepare for war. In November 1075, Nùng Tông Đản advanced into Song territory in Guangxi while a naval fleet commanded by Lý Thường Kiệt captured Qinzhou and Lianzhou prefectures.Anderson (2008), 207–208. Lý Thường Kiệt calmed the apprehensions of the local Chinese populace, claiming that he was simply apprehending a rebel who took refuge in China and that the local Song authorities had refused to cooperate in detaining him.Anderson (2008), 208. In the early spring of 1076, Thường Kiệt and Nùng Tông Đản defeated the Song militia of Yongzhou, and during a battle at Kunlun Pass, their forces beheaded the Governor-General of Guangnan West Circuit, Zhang Shoujie (d. 1076). After a forty-two-day siege, Yongzhou was breached and razed to the ground. When Song forces attempted to challenge the Vietnamese forces, the latter retreated, with their spoils of war and thousands of prisoners. Lý Thường Kiệt had fought a war with the Cham in 1069, and in 1076 Song called on the Khmer Empire and Champa to go to war again in 1076. At the same time, the Song commander Guo Kui (1022–1088) led the combined Song force of approximately 100,000 men against Dai Viet. The Song quickly regained Quảng Nguyên prefecture and in the process captured the resistance leader Lưu Ký. By 1077, the Song had destroyed two other Vietnamese armies and marched towards their capital at Thăng Long (modern Hanoi). Song forces halted at the Nhu Nguyệt River (in modern Bắc Ninh Province), where Lý Thường Kiệt had defensive ramparts built on the southern banks. However, Song forces broke through his defense line and their cavalry advanced to within several kilometers of the capital city.Anderson (2008), 209. The Vietnamese counterattacked and pushed Song forces back across the river while their coastal defenses distracted the Song navy. Lý Thường Kiệt also launched an offensive, but lost two Vietnamese princes in the fighting at Kháo Túc River. According to Chinese sources, \\"tropical climate and rampant disease\\" severely weakened Song's military forces while the Vietnamese court feared the result of a prolonged war so close to the capital. In 1078 China defeated Đại Việt and overran several districts that would later make up part of Cao Bằng Province.Cœdès (1966), p. 84 As a result, Thường Kiệt made peace overtures to the Song; the Song commander Guo Kui agreed to withdraw his troops, but kept five disputed regions of Quảng Nguyên (renamed Shun'anzhou or Thuận Châu), Tư Lang Châu, Môn Châu, Tô Mậu Châu, and Quảng Lăng. These areas now comprise most of modern Vietnam's Cao Bằng Province and Lạng Sơn Province. In 1082, after a long period of mutual isolation, King Lý Nhân Tông of Đại Việt returned Yong, Qin, and Lian prefectures back to Song authorities, along with their prisoners of war, and in return Song relinquished its control of four prefectures and the county of Đại Việt, including the Nùng clan's home of Quảng Nguyên. Further negotiations took place from 6 July to 8 August 1084 and were held at Song's Yongping garrison in southern Guangnan, where Vietnamese Director of Military Personnel Lê Văn Thịnh (fl. 1075–1096) convinced Song to fix the two countries' borders between Quảng Nguyên and Guihua prefectures.Anderson (2008), 210. After 1082 The relation of Vietnamese kingdom with Song China were in peace until the Mongol conquest. In 1125,Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư, vol. 3 a Vietnamese tributary envoy came to Song dynasty's capital Kaifeng to sent gifts. Shortly after, the Jurchen Jin dynasty's army surrounding the city, as known as Jingkang incident. A Vietnamese Prince in the envoy's crew, Lý Dương Côn (), survived the Jin siege and seek refugee in Goryeo (Korea). 19 years later after the reestablishment of Southern Song dynasty, the Vietnamese king Lý Anh Tông sent a new tributary envoy to Song China, gave to the Chinese court some local produces like gold, silver, elephant teeths, and incenses. In 1164, with Vietnamese diplomat Doãn Tử Tư, Emperor Xiaozong of Song officially started referring Vietnam as Annam, and changed king of Jiaozhi / king of Nanping to king of Annam (安南國王). That Chinese title gave for Vietnamese monarchs, continued until 1804. Four years later in spring 1168, Emperor Shizong of Jin dynasty sent a emissary to Thăng Long, tried to install a nominate tributary relationship with Đại Việt.Ngô Thì Sĩ, Khâm định Việt sử thông giám cương mục, vol 5. p. 350. Since new Vietnamese king Lý Huệ Tông had ascended the throne in 1206, there were no tributary missions from Vietnam to China until the Trần clan took the throne of Lý family in 1225. In 1229, new Vietnamese ruler Trần Thái Tông sent a diplomatic mission to Song China, and he was recognized as king of Annam. After the first Mongol invasion in 1258, Đại Việt ended all nominate tributary relation and diplomatic relations with the Song dynasty.  Partisans and factions, reformers and conservatives  A portrait painting of Chancellor Wang Anshi After students passed the often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, they did not always see eye to eye with others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready for government service, there was always the factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new officials often needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for service.Ebrey et al., 163. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with. Factional strife at court first became apparent during the 1040s. The unsuccessful war with Tanguts and the mounting economic pressures prompted the first reform movement of the Song: Qingli Reforms initiated by Fan Zhongyan (989–1052).Twitchett ed., 350 Fan was a capable military leader (with successful battles in his record against the Tanguts of Xi-Xia) but as a minister of state he was known as an idealist, once saying that a well-minded official should be one that was \\"first in worrying about the world's troubles and last in enjoying its pleasures\\". When Fan rose to the seat of chancellor, there was a growing opposition to him within the older and more conservative crowd. They disliked his pushing for reforms for the recruitment system, higher pay for minor local officials to discourage against corruption, and wider sponsorship programs to ensure that officials were drafted more on the basis of their intellect and character. However, his reforms were cancelled within a year's time (with Fan replaced as chancellor), since many older officials halfway through their careers were not keen on making changes that could affect their comfortably set positions. \\"Children Playing in an Autumn Courtyard\\" (秋庭婴戏图), close-up detail of a larger vertical-scroll painting on silk by Su Hanchen (苏汉臣, active 1130-1160s AD) After Fan Zhongyan, there was Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021–1086). The new nineteen-year-old Emperor Shenzong (r. 1067–1085) had an instant liking of Wang Anshi when he submitted a long memorial to the throne that criticized the practices of state schools and the examination system itself. With Wang as his new chancellor, he quickly implemented Wang's New Policies, which evoked some heated reaction from the conservative base. Along with the Baojia system of a community-based law enforcement, the New Policies included: *Low-cost loans for farmers and replaced the labor service with a tax instead, hoping this would ultimately help the workings of the entire economy and state (as he directly linked state income to the level of prosperity of rural peasants who owned farms, produced goods for the market, and paid the land tax). These government loans replaced the system of landlords offering their tenants private loans, which was prohibited under the new laws of Wang's reforms.Fairbank, 97. *Government monopolies on tea, salt, and wine in order to raise state revenues (although this would now limit the merchant class). *Instituting a more up-to-date land survey system in order to properly assess the land tax. *Introduction of a local militia in order to lessen the budget of expenses paid for upholding the official standing army, which had grown dramatically to roughly 1 million soldiers by 1022. *The creation of a new government bureau in 1073 called the Directorate of Weapons, which supervised the manufacture of armaments and ensured quality control.Peers, 130. *Introduction of the Finance Planning Commission, created in mind to speed up the reform process so that dissident Conservatives would have less time to react and oppose reforms. *The poetry requirement of the civil service examination (introduced during the earlier Tang dynasty) was scrapped in order to seek out men with more practical experience and knowledge. An early Yuan dynasty portrait of Su Shi (1037–1101), by Zhao Mengfu 趙孟頫, held at Taipei Palace Museum. In addition, Wang Anshi had his own commentaries on Confucian classics made into a standard and required reading for students hoping to pass the state examinations. This and other reforms of Wang's were too much for some officials to bear idly, as there were many administrative disagreements, along with many personal interests at stake. In any case, the rising conservative faction against the reformer Wang Anshi branded him as an inferior-intellect who was not up to par with their principles of governance (likewise, the reformers branded conservatives in the same labeled fashion). The conservatives criticized Wang's reforms as a means of curbing the influence of landholding families by diminishing their private wealth in favor of self-sufficient communal groups. The conservatives argued that the wealth of the landholding class should not be purposefully diminished by state programs, since the land holding class was the essential socio-economic group that produced China's scholar-officials, managers, merchants, and landlords. Reminded of the earlier Fan Zhongyan, Wang was not about to allow ministers who opposed his reforms to have sway at court, and with his prowess (and perceived arrogance) was known as 'the bullheaded premier'.Morton, 102. He gathered to his side ministers who were loyal to his policies and cause, an elite social coalition known as the New Policies Group (新法, Xin Fa).Sivin, III, 3–4. He had many able and powerful supporters, such as the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo. Ministers of state who were seen as obstructive to the implementation of Wang's reforms were not all dismissed from the capital to other places (since the emperor needed some critical feedback), but many were. A more extreme example would be \\"obstructionist\\" officials sent far to the south to administer regions that were largely tropical, keeping in mind that northern Chinese were often susceptible to malaria found in the deep south of China.Ebrey et al., 164. Even the celebrated poet and government official Su Shi was persecuted in 1079 when he was arrested and forced into five weeks of interrogation. Finally, he confessed under guarded watch that he had slandered the emperor in his poems. One of them read: { cellpadding=\\"2\\" style=\\"font-size:90%; border- collapse:collapse; background:none; border-style:none; margin:10px 20px;\\" -  style=\\"width:10px; vertical-align:top;\\" File:Cquote1.png  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" An old man of seventy, sickle at his waist, Feels guilty the spring mountain bamboo and bracken are sweet. It's not that the music of Shao has made him lose his sense of taste. It's just that he's eaten his food for three months without salt.  style=\\"width:10px; vertical-align:bottom;\\" File:Cquote2.png -  colspan=\\"2\\"  Su Shi } A drawing of Sima Guang. This poem can be interpreted as criticizing the failure of the salt monopoly established by Wang Anshi, embodied in the persona of a hard-working old man who was cruelly denied his means to flavor his food, with the severity of the laws and the only salt available being charged at rates that were too expensive. After his confession, Su Shi was found guilty in court, and was summarily exiled to Hubei Province. More than thirty of his associates were also given minor punishments for not reporting his slanderous poems to authorities before they were widely circulated to the educated public. Emperor Shenzong died in 1085, an abrupt death since he was in his mid 30s. His successor Emperor Zhezong of Song was only ten years old when he ascended to the throne, so his powerful grandmother served as regent over him. She disliked Wang's reforms from the beginning, and sought to appoint more Conservative officials at court who would agree to oppose the Reformists. Her greatest political ally was Sima Guang (1019–1086), who was made the next Chancellor. Undoing what Wang had implemented, Sima dismissed the New Policies, and forced the same treatment upon Reformers that Wang had earlier meted out to his opponents: dismissal to lower or frontier posts of governance, or even exile. However, there was still mounted opposition to Sima Guang, as many had favored some of the New Policies, including the substitution of tax instead of forced labor service to the state. Sure enough, when Emperor Zhezong's grandmother died in 1093, Zhezong was quick to sponsor the Reformists like his predecessor Shenzong had done. The Conservatives once more were ousted from political dominance at court. When Zhezong suddenly died in his twenties, his younger brother Emperor Huizong of Song (r. 1100–1125) succeeded him, and also supported the Reformers at court. Huizong banned the writing of Sima Guang and his lackeys while elevating Wang Anshi to near revered status, having a statue of Wang erected in a Confucian temple alongside a statue of Mencius.Ebrey et al., 165. To further this image of Wang as a great and honorable statesman, printed and painted pictures of him were circulated throughout the country. Yet this cycle of revenge and partisanship continued after Zhezong and Huizong, as Reformers and Conservatives continued their infighting. Huizong's successor, Emperor Gaozong of Song, abolished once more the New Policies, and favored ministers of the Conservative faction at court. Jurchen invasions and the transition to Southern Song Jingkang Incident Official court portrait painting of Emperor Huizong of Song. Before the arrival of the Jurchens the Song dynasty was for centuries engaged in a stand-off against the Western Xia and the Khitan Liao dynasty. This balance was disrupted when the Song dynasty developed a military alliance with the Jurchens for the purpose of annihilating the Liao. This balance of power disrupted, the Jurchens then turned on the Song, resulting in the fall of the Northern Song and the subsequent establishment of the Southern Song. During the reign of Huizong, the Jurchen tribe to the north (once subordinates to the Liao), revolted against their Khitan masters. The Jurchen community already had a reputation of great economic clout in their own region of the Liao and Sungari rivers. They were positioned in an ideal location for horse raising, and were known to muster ten thousand horses a year to sell annually to the Khitans of the Liao dynasty. They even had a martial history of being pirates, in the 1019 Toi invasion of the Heian Japanese islands in modern-day Iki Province, Tsushima Province, and Hakata Bay. From the Jurchen Wanyan clan, a prominent leader Wanyan Aguda (1068–1123) challenged Liao authority, establishing their own Jin (or 'Golden') dynasty in 1115. The Song government took notice of the political dissidence of the Jurchens in Liao's territory, as Council of State Tong Guan (1054–1126) persuaded the emperor to ally with the Jurchens against the Liao . The two nations secretly forged the Alliance on the Sea, so-named because it was negotiated by envoys who crossed the Bohai Sea, and agreed to jointly invade the Liao, and if successful, divide up Liao territory with the Sixteen Prefectures given to the Song.. In 1121–23, Song forces fared badly against the Liao, but the Jin succeeded in driving the Liao to Central Asia. Through the campaign, the Jurchens discovered weaknesses about the Song military based in the north (as the Chinese for so long had been sending tribute to the Liao instead of actually fighting them). Song forces had failed to make a joint attack in a siege with the Jurchens, who viewed the Song generals as incompetent. Banking on the possibility that the Song were weak enough to be destroyed, the Jurchens made a sudden and unprovoked attack against the Song in the north. Soon enough, even the capital at Kaifeng was under siege by Jin forces, only staved off when an enormous bribe was handed over to them. There was also an effective use of Song Chinese war machines in the defense of Kaifeng in 1126, as it was recorded that 500 catapults hurling debris were used.Peers, 131. During the siege of Taiyuan, the Jin employed 30 catapults and over fifty carts protected by rawhide and sheets of iron plating so that Jin troops could be ferried to the walls safely to fill in Taiyuan city's defensive moat. The eunuch general Tong Guan, who had initially urged for an alliance with the Jurchens, was blamed for causing the war. He was eventually executed by Emperor Qinzong of Song (r. 1126–1127) after Huizong abdicated the throne to him.Ebrey et al., 166. Southern Song in 1142. However, the Jin returned soon after with enough siege machinery to scale Kaifeng's layer of walls defended by 48,000 Song troops.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 168. The Jin used siege towers taller than Kaifeng's walls in order to lob incendiary bombs into the city. The besieged city was captured by the Jurchens in less than two months. Three thousand members of the Emperor's court were taken as captives,Gernet, 22. including Qinzong and many of his relatives, craftsmen, engineers, goldsmiths, silversmiths, blacksmiths, weavers and tailors, Daoist priests, and female entertainers to label some.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 497. The mechanical clock tower designed by Su Song and erected in 1094 was also disassembled and its components carted back north, along with many clock-making millwrights and maintenance engineers that would cause a setback in technical advances for the Song court. According to the contemporary Xia Shaozeng, other war booty included 20,000 fire arrows that were handed over to the Jurchens upon taking the city.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 154. After capturing Kaifeng, the Jurchens went on to conquer the rest of northern China, while the Song Chinese court fled south. They took up temporary residence at Nanjing, where a surviving prince was named Emperor Gaozong of Song in 1127. Jin forces halted at the Yangzi River, but staged continual raids south of the river until a later boundary was fixed at the Huai River further north. With the border fixed at the Huai, the Song government would promote an immigration policy of repopulating and resettling territories north of the Yangzi River, since vast tracts of vacant land between the Yangzi and Huai were open for landless peasants found in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces of the south.Coblin, 533 & 536. A new capital and peace treaty In 1129, Emperor Gaozong designated the site at Hangzhou (known then as Lin'an) to be the temporary settlement of the court, but it was not until 1132 that it was declared the new Song capital.Coblin, 533. Hangzhou and Nanjing were devastated by the Jin raids; both cities were heavily repopulated with northern refugees who outnumbered the remaining original inhabitants. Hangzhou was chosen not only for its natural scenic beauty, but for the surrounding topographic barriers of lakes and muddy rice-fields that gave it defensive potential against northern armies comprising mostly cavalry.Gernet, 22–23. Yet it was viewed by the court as only a temporary capital while the Song emperors planned to retake Kaifeng.Gernet, 23–25. However, the rapid growth of the city from the 12th century to the 13th necessitated long-term goals of residency. In 1133 the modest palatial residence of the imperial family was improved upon from a simple provincial lodging to one that at least accommodated strolls with new covered alleyways to deflect the rain.Gernet, 25. In 1148 the walls of the small palace compound were finally extended to the southeast, yet this was another marginal improvement. Emperor Gaozong (r. 1127–1162) The new triangular arrangement between the Southern Song, Jin, and Western Xia continued the age of division and conflict in China. The region of Huainan (between the Yangzi and Huai rivers) became a new borderland and battleground between Song and Jin from 1128 to 1141, displacing hundreds of thousands of families who had lived there for generations.Mostern (2008), 231. The Southern Song deployed several military commanders, among them Yue Fei and Han Shizhong, to resist the Jin as well as recapture territory, which proved successful at times. Yue Fei in particular had been preparing to recapture Kaifeng (or Bianjing as the city was known during the Song period), the former capital of the Song dynasty and the then southern capital of the Jin, after a streak of uninterrupted military victories. However, the possible defeat of the Jurchens threatened the power of the new emperor of the Southern Song, Gaozong and his premier Qin Hui. The reason for this was that Qinzong, the last emperor of the Northern Song was living in Jin-imposed exile in Manchuria and had a good chance of being recalled to the throne should the Jin dynasty be destroyed. Although Yue Fei had penetrated into enemy territory as far as Luoyang, he was ordered to head back to the capital and halt his campaign. Emperor Gaozong signed the Treaty of Shaoxing in 1141 that fixed the borders at the Huai River,Mostern (2008), 238. as well as conceded territory regained through the efforts of Yue Fei, while Yue was killed during imprisonment. As part of the treaty, the Song were also forced to pay tribute to the Jin, much as it had to the Liao.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 150. With the treaty of Shaoxing, hostilities ceased between the Jin and Song dynasties for the next two decades.Tillman, 3. In the meantime, Emperor Gaozong negotiated with the Jin over his mother's ransom while he commissioned a symbolic art project about her, the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute, originally based upon the life of Cai Wenji (b. 177).Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 151. Gaozong's mother was eventually released and brought south, but Qinzong was never freed from his confinement in the north. Decades after Yue's death, the later Emperor Xiaozong of Song honored Yue Fei as a national hero in 1162, providing him proper burial and memorial of a shrine.Giles, 950. As a means to shame those who had pressed for his execution (Qin Hui and his wife), iron statues of them were crafted to kneel before the tomb of Yue Fei, located at the West Lake in Hangzhou. China's first standing navy junk ship, 13th century; Chinese ships of the Song period featured hulls with watertight compartments. As the once great Indian Ocean maritime power of the Chola dynasty in medieval India had waned and declined, Chinese sailors and seafarers began to increase their own maritime activity in South East Asia and into the Indian Ocean. Even during the earlier Northern Song period, when it was written in Tamil inscriptions under the reign of Rajendra Chola I that Srivijaya had been completely taken in 1025 by Chola's naval strength, the succeeding king of Srivijaya managed to send tribute to the Chinese Northern Song court in 1028.Hall, 23. Much later, in 1077, the Indian Chola ruler Kulothunga Chola I (who the Chinese called Ti- hua-kia-lo) sent a trade embassy to the court of Emperor Shenzong of Song, and made lucrative profits in selling goods to China.Sastri, 173, 316. There were other tributary payers from other regions of the world as well. The Fatimid- era Egyptian sea captain Domiyat traveled to a Buddhist site of pilgrimage in Shandong in 1008, where he presented the Chinese Emperor Zhenzong of Song with gifts from his ruling Imam Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, establishing diplomatic relations between Egypt and China that had been lost during the collapse of the Tang dynasty in 907 (while the Fatimid state was established three years later in 910).Shen, 158. During the Northern Song, Quanzhou was already a bustling port of call visited by a plethora of different foreigners, from Muslim Arabs, Persians, Egyptians, Hindu Indians, Middle-Eastern Jews, Nestorian Christians from the Near East, etc. Muslims from foreign nations dominated the import and export industry (see Islam during the Song dynasty).BBC page about Islam in China To regulate this enormous commercial center, in 1087 the Northern Song government established an office in Quanzhou for the sole purpose of handling maritime affairs and commercial transactions.Wang, 14. In this multicultural environment there were many opportunities for subjects in the empire of foreign descent, such as the (Arab or Persian) Muslim Pu Shougeng, the Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for Quanzhou between 1250 and 1275.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 465. Pu Shougeng had gained his reputable position by helping the Chinese destroy pirate forces that plagued the area, and so was lavished with gifts and appraisal from Chinese merchants and officials.Rossabi, 92. Quanzhou soon rivaled Guangzhou (the greatest maritime port of the earlier Tang dynasty) as a major trading center during the late Northern Song. However, Guangzhou had not fully lost its importance. The medieval Arab maritime captain Abu Himyarite from Yemen toured Guangzhou in 993, and was an avid visitor to China.Shen, 157–158. There were other notable international seaports in China during the Song period as well, including Xiamen (or Amoy).Sivin, III, 5. A small section of Along the River During Qingming Festival, a large horizontal scroll painting by Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145). When the Song capital was removed far south to Hangzhou, massive numbers of people came from the north. Unlike the flat plains of the north, the mountainous terrain riddled with lakes and rivers in southern China is largely a hindrance and inhospitable to widespread agriculture. Therefore, the Southern Song took on a unique maritime presence that was largely unseen in earlier dynasties, grown out of the need to secure importation of foreign resources. Commercial cities (located along the coast and by internal rivers), backed by patronage of the state, dramatically increased shipbuilding activity (funding harbor improvements, warehouse construction, and navigation beacons). Navigation at sea was made easier by the invention of the compass and Shen Kuo's treatise of the 11th century on the concept of true north (with magnetic declination towards the North Pole).Sivin, III, 22. With military defense and economic policy in mind, the Southern Song established China's first standing navy. China had a long naval history before that point (example, Battle of Chibi in 208), and even during the Northern Song era there were concerns with naval matters, as seen in examples such as the Chinese official Huang Huaixin of the Xining Reign (1068–1077) outlining a plan of employing a drydock for repair of 'imperial dragon boats' (see Science and technology of the Song dynasty).Levathes, 77. Already during the Northern Song, the Chinese had established fortified trade bases in the Philippines, a noted interest of the court to expand China's military power and economic influence abroad.Hall, 24. Provincial armies in the Northern Song era also maintained naval river units.Lo, 490. However, it was the Southern Song court that was the first to create a large, permanent standing naval institution for China in 1132.Paludan, 136. The new headquarters of the Southern Song Chinese admiralty was based at Dinghai, the office labeled as the Yanhai Zhizhi Shisi (Imperial Commissariat for the Control and Organization of Coastal Areas).Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 476.Lo, 491. Even as far back as 1129 officials proposed ambitious plans to conquer Korea with a new navy and use Korea as a base for launching invasions into Jin territory, but this scheme was never achieved and was of secondary importance to maintaining defense along the fluctuating border with Jin. A Song illustration from the Wujing Zongyao manuscript of 1044, showing a rivership with a Xuanfeng traction trebuchet catapult mounted on the top deck. Capturing the essence of the day, the Song era writer Zhang Yi once wrote in 1131 that China must regard the Sea and the River as her Great Wall, and substitute warships for watchtowers. Indeed, the court administration at Hangzhou lived up to this ideal, and were successful for a time in employing their navy to defend their interests against an often hostile neighbor to the north. In his Science and Civilization in China series, Joseph Needham writes: > From a total of 11 squadrons and 3,000 men [the Song navy] rose in one > century to 20 squadrons totalling 52,000 men, with its main base near > Shanghai.

During the reign of Emperor Xiaozong of Song, the Chinese increased the number of trade missions that would dock at ports throughout the Indian Ocean, where Arab and Hindu influence was once predominant. The Chinese sailed regularly to Korea and Japan in the Far East, westwards towards India and Sri Lanka, and into the Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea. The Chinese were keen to import goods such as rare woods, precious metals, gems, spices, and ivory, while exporting goods such as silk, ceramics, lacquer-ware, copper cash, dyes, and even books.Paludan, 142. In 1178, the Guangzhou customs officer Zhou Qufei wrote in Lingwai Daida of an island far west in the Indian Ocean (possibly Madagascar), from where people with skin \\"as black as lacquer\\" and with frizzy hair were captured and purchased as slaves by Arab merchants.Levathes, 37. As an important maritime trader, China appeared also on geographical maps of the Islamic world. In 1154 the Moroccan geographer Al-Idrisi published his Geography, where he described the Chinese seagoing vessels as having aboard goods such as iron, swords, leather, silk, velvet, along with textiles from Aden (modern-day Yemen), the Indus River region, and Euphrates River region (modern-day Iraq). He also commended the silk manufactured at Quanzhou as being unparalleled in the world for its quality, while the Chinese capital at Hangzhou was best known throughout the Islamic world for being a major producer of glass wares.Shen, 159–161. By at least the 13th century, the Chinese were even familiar with the story of the ancient Lighthouse of Alexandria since it is described at length by Zhao Rugua, a Southern Song customs inspector of Quanzhou.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 662. Defeat of Jin invasion, 1161 Games in the Jinming Pool, by Zhang Zeduan, a painting depicting the imperial gardens of Kaifeng, Northern Song. In 1153 the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang moved the empire's capital from Huining Prefecture in northern Manchuria (south of present-day Harbin) to Zhongdu (now Beijing). Four years later in 1157 he razed Beijing, including the nobles’ residences, and moved the Jin's southern capital from Beijing to Kaifeng. It was here at the former seat of the Song dynasty that he began a large project of reconstruction (since the siege against it in 1127).Needham, Volume 1, 139. For much of his reign there was peace between Jin and Song, while both states upheld an uninterrupted flow of commercial trade between each other. While amassing tribute from the Southern Song, the Jin dynasty also imported large amounts of tea, rice, sugar, and books from the Southern Song. However, Wanyan Liang reopened the Jin dynasty's armed conflict with the Song by the 1160s. Wanyan Liang established a military campaign against the Southern Song in 1161, with 70,000 naval troops aboard 600 warships facing a smaller Song fleet of only 120 warships and 3,000 men.Levathes, 43–47. At the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi along the Yangtze River, Jin forces were defeated by the Southern Song navy. In these battles, the Jin navy was wiped out by the much smaller Song fleet because of their use of fast paddle-wheel crafts and gunpowder bombs launched from trebuchet catapults (since explosive grenades and bombs had been known in China since the 10th century).Needham, Volume 1, 134. Meanwhile, two simultaneous rebellions of Jurchen nobles, led by soon-to- be crowned Jin emperor Wanyan Yong and Khitan tribesman, erupted in Manchuria. This forced the reluctant Jin court to withdraw its troops from southern China to quell these uprisings. In the end, Wanyan Liang failed in taking the Southern Song and was assassinated by his own generals in December 1161.Tillman, 29.Mostern (2008), 241. The Khitan uprising was not suppressed until 1164, while the Treaty of Longxing (隆興和議) was signed in 1165 between Song and Jin, reestablishing the 1142 border line and ushering in four decades of peace between the two. Rise of the Mongols Portrait of Genghis Khan, who initiated the first Mongol invasions of China. In the years 1205 and 1209 the Jin state was under raid attacks by Mongols from the north, and in 1211 the major campaign led by Genghis Khan was launched.Ebrey et al., 235. His army consisted of fifty thousand bowmen, while his three sons led armies of similar size. Patricia Ebrey writes that at this point the Mongol population could not have been greater than 1.5 million, yet they boosted their numbers by employing Khitans and Han Chinese \\"who felt no great loyalty to their Jurchen lords.\\"Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 171. After a Jurchen general murdered the Jin emperor Wanyan Yongji in 1213 and placed Emperor Xuanzong on the throne, a peace settlement was negotiated between Jin and the Mongol forces in 1214, as Genghis made the Jin a vassal state of the Mongol Empire.Ebrey et al., 236. However, when the Jin court moved from Beijing to Kaifeng, Genghis saw this move as a revolt, and moved upon the old Jin capital at Beijing in 1215, sacking and burning it. Although the now small Jin state attempted to defend against the Mongols and even fought battles with the Song in 1216 and 1223, the Jin were attacked by the Mongols again in 1229 with the ascension of Ögedei Khan. According to the account of 1232, written by the Jin commander Chizhan Hexi, the Jurchens led a valiant effort against the Mongols, whom they frightened and demoralized in the siege of the capital by the use of 'thunder-crash-bombs' and fire lance flamethrowers.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 225. However, the capital at Kaifeng was captured by siege in 1233, and by 1234 the Jin dynasty finally fell in defeat to the Mongols after the capture of Caizhou. The Western Xia met a similar fate, becoming an unreliable vassal to the Mongols by seeking to secure alliances with Jin and Song. Genghis Khan had died in 1227 during the 5-month siege of their capital city, and being held somewhat responsible for this, the last Xia ruler was hacked to death when he was persuaded to exit the gates of his city with a small entourage. Mongol invasion and end of the Song dynasty Following the death of Gaozong and the emergence of the Mongols, the Song dynasty formed a military alliance with the Mongols in the hope of finally defeating the Jin dynasty. Several tens of thousands of carts full of grain were sent to the Mongol army during the siege. Following the destruction of the Jurchens in 1234, the Southern Song generals broke the alliance, proceeding to recapture the three historical capitals of Kaifeng, Luoyang and Chang'an. However, the cities, ravaged by years of warfare, lacked economic capacity and yielded little defensibility. This breaking of alliance meant open warfare between the Mongols and the Song Chinese. Ögodei Khan's forces conquered fifty-four out of Sichuan's fifty-eight total districts by 1236, while ordering the slaughter of over a million people that inhabited the city of Chengdu, which was taken by the Mongols with ease.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 170. Möngke's campaign Growth of the Mongol Empire throughout the 13th century until Kublai Khan's death in 1294. The bounds of the Yuan dynasty of China is seen in purple in the final stage. The Mongols eventually gained the upper hand under Möngke Khan, famed for his battles in Russia and Hungary in Eastern Europe, and ushered in the final destruction of the ruling Ch'oe family of Korea in 1258.Ebrey et al., 239. In 1252, Möngke commissioned his younger brother Kublai and experienced general Uriyangkhadai to conquer the Dali Kingdom.Ebrey et al., 240. From the summer of 1253 to early 1254, the campaigns were successful in conquering and pacifying the tribes, with Uriyangkhadai's military experience proving invaluable in battle. After Kublai's return to northern China, Uriyangkhadai conquered neighboring tribes in Tibet before turning east towards the Trần dynasty by 1257. Meanwhile, Uriyangkhadai's forces invaded Vietnam with generals Trechecdu and Aju and captured the Trần dynasty capital of Thang Long in 1258. While Chinese source material incorrectly stated that Uriyangkhadai withdrew from Vietnam after nine days due to poor climate, his forces did not leave until 1259. In 1259, Uriyangkhadai's forces attacked Guangxi from Thang Long as part of a coordinated Mongol attack in 1259 with armies attacking in Sichuan under Mongol leader Möngke Khan and other Mongol armies attacking in modern-day Shandong and Henan. Möngke Khan died during the Siege of Diaoyu Castle while attacking the Sichuan anti-Mongol fortresses in Chongqing on August 11, 1259. There are several different claims as to how he died; the causes of death include either an arrow wound from a Chinese archer during the siege, dysentery, or cholera epidemic.Rossabi, 46. Möngke's death in battle led to the recall of the main Mongol armies led by Hulagu campaigning in the Middle East and sparked a succession crisis that would ultimately favor Kublai as the new Khan of the Mongols. Hulagu had to travel back to Mongolia in order to partake in the traditional tribal meeting of the khuriltai to appoint a new successor of the Mongol Khanate. A fluctuating border Painting of Kublai Khan on a hunting expedition with guards, by court artist Liu Guandao, c. 1280. Although Möngke's forces stalled the war effort immediately after his death, his younger brother Kublai continued to fight the Southern Song along the Yangzi River for the next two months into the autumn of 1259.Rossabi, 49. Kublai made a daring advance across the river during a storm, and assaulted the Southern Song troops on the other side. Both sides suffered considerable casualties, but Kublai's troops were victorious and gained a foothold south of the Yangzi. Kublai made preparations to take the heavily fortified city of Ezhou. Meanwhile, the Song chancellor Jia Sidao dispatched General Lü Wende to lead the reinforcements in the defense of Ezhou, and on October 5 Lü slipped past Kublai's ill-prepared forces and entered the city.Rossabi, 50. Jia Sidao then sent his general and emissary Song Jing to negotiate a tributary settlement with Kublai. He offered Kublai annual tribute of silver like in the earlier treaty with the Khitans, in return for the territories south of the Yangzi that had been taken by the Mongols. Kublai rejected the proposal since he was already in a favorable strategic position on the other side of the Yangzi. By the winter of 1259, Uriyangkhadai's army fought its way north to meet Kublai's army. However, Kublai had to suspend the war and travel north with the majority of his forces due to the Toluid Civil War. His rival brother Ariq Böke led a sudden movement of troops towards Kublai's home base of Xanadu.Rossabi, 50–51. Kublai's absence from the war front was seen by Chancellor Jia Sidao as an opportune moment, so he ordered to resume armed conflict.Rossabi, 56. The Song army routed the small armed detachment that Kublai had stationed south of the Yangzi, and the Song regained its lost territory. With his ally Hulagu busy fighting the Golden Horde and his own forces needed in the north against the rival Khagan claimant Ariq Böke, Kublai was unable to focus on hostilities in the south.Rossabi, 55–56. On May 21, 1260, Kublai sent his envoy Hao Jing and two other advisors to negotiate with the Southern Song. Upon their arrival and attempts to solve the conflict through diplomatic means, Jia Sidao ordered Kublai's embassy to be detained. Although Kublai would not forget this slight of imprisoning his ambassadors, he nonetheless had to focus on more pressing affairs with the threat of his brother and rival Khan. From 1260 to 1262 the Song forces raided Kublai's southern border which forced Kublai to retaliate with some minor incursions until 1264, when his brother finally surrendered and ended the civil war.Rossabi, 82. In 1265 the first major battle in five years erupted in Sichuan province, where Kublai gained a preliminary victory and considerable war booty of 146 Song naval ships. Growing discontent Kublai Khan ruled as the Khagan of the Mongol Empire from 1260 to 1271. From 1271 until his death in 1294 he was the emperor of China, establishing the Yuan dynasty that would end in 1368. While Kublai attended to other matters in the north, the Song court was mobilizing its populace for war and all available resources that could be rendered and drained into the war effort.Embree, 385. In the mid 13th century, the Song government led by Jia Sidao began confiscating portions of estates owned by the rich in order to raise revenues in a land nationalization scheme.Adshead, 90–91. This had the negative effect of alienating the wealthy landowners and hastening the collapse of the empire, as wealthy landlords and merchants favored what they deemed the inevitable Mongol conquest and rule than the other alternative of paying higher taxes for continual, exhaustive warfare. There was also mounting political opposition against Chancellor Jia Sidao. Jia had purged several dissident officials who were opposed to his reforms aimed at limiting official corruption and personal profiteering.Rossabi, 80–81. When he replaced some of these officials with his own cronies, however, political conditions were ripe for a schism at court and within the gentry class that would be favorable to a strong, unified force led by Kublai.Rossabi, 81. Kublai used various ploys and gestures in order to entice defectors from the Southern Song to his side. Kublai Khan established Dadu (Beijing) as his new capital in 1264, catering to the likes of the Chinese with his advisor Liu Bingzhong and the naming of his dynasty with the Chinese word for \\"primal\\" (\\"Yuan\\"). He made it a policy to grant land, clothing, and oxen to Song Chinese who defected to his side. Kublai Khan chose the moral high ground of releasing Song captives and prisoners while Jia Sidao refused to release Kublai's emissary Hao Jing. In 1261 Kublai personally released seventy-five Song merchants captured at the border; in 1263 he released fifty-seven merchants; in 1269 he released forty-five merchants. In 1264 he publicly reprimanded his own officers for executing two Song generals without trial or investigation. With these acts his reputation and legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese were greatly enhanced. Battle of Xiangyang The siege of the city Xiangyang was a long, drawn out conflict from 1268 to 1273.Rossabi, 82–87. Xiangyang and the adjacent town of Fancheng were located on the opposite bank of the Han River and were the last fortified obstacles in Kublai's way towards the rich Yangzi River basin. Kublai made an attempt to starve the city of its supply lines by gaining naval supremacy along the Han River in a gigantic blockade.Rossabi, 83. It was the Song defector Liu Zheng who was the main proponent in advising Kublai Khan to expand the Yuan's naval strength, which was a great factor in their success.Lo, 492. An international force — composed of Chinese, Jurchens, Koreans, Mongols, Uyghur Turks, and Middle Eastern Muslims— contributed to Kublai's siege effort in crafting ships and artillery. On several occasions—August 1269, March 1270, August 1271, and September 1272—the Southern Song attempted to break the Yuan blockade with its own navy, yet each attempt was a costly failure of thousands of men and hundreds of ships.Rossabi, 85. After the siege, in the summer of 1273, Kublai appointed the Chinese general Shi Tianze and Turkic general Bayan as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. However, Shi Tianze died in 1275; Bayan was then granted a force of 200,000 (composed mostly of Han Chinese) to assault Song.Rossabi, 87. Final resistance Emperor Bing, the last Song emperor. In March 1275 the forces of Bayan faced the army of Chancellor Jia Sidao, which was 130,000 strong; the end result was a decisive victory for Bayan, and Jia was forced to retreat after many deserted him.Rossabi, 88. This was the opportune moment for his political rivals to smite him. Jia was effectively stripped of rank, title, and office and banished to Fujian in exile from the court; while en route to Fujian, he was killed by the same commander that was appointed to accompany him.Rossabi, 88–89. After his death many of his supporters and opposing ministers submitted to Bayan. By 1276 the Yuan army had conquered nearly all of the Southern Song's territory, including the capital at Hangzhou. Meanwhile, the rebel remnants of the Song court fled to Fuzhou.Rossabi, 91. Emperor Gong was left behind as the empress dowager submitted to Bayan, horrified by reports of the total slaughter of Changzhou.Ebrey et al., 241. Before the capital was taken, Empress Dowager Xie (1208–1282) made attempts to negotiate with Bayan, promising annual tribute to the Yuan dynasty, but he rejected these proposals.Rossabi, 89–90. After her attempts at diplomacy had failed, she handed over the Song dynasty's imperial seal to Bayan, \\"an unambiguous symbol of capitulation.\\"Rossabi, 90. With the submission of Emperor Gong, Bayan ordered that the Song imperial family should be respected, and forbade the pillaging of their imperial tombs or treasuries. Kublai granted the deposed emperor the title \\"Duke of Ying\\", but he was eventually exiled to Tibet where he took up a monastic life in 1296. Any hope of resistance was centered on two young princes, Emperor Gong's brothers. The older boy, Zhao Shi, who was nine years old, was declared emperor on June 14, 1276, in Fuzhou. The court sought refuge in Quanzhou, seeking an alliance with the Superintendent of Maritime Shipping, the Muslim Pu Shougeng. However, he secretly formed an alliance with Kublai, so the Song court was forced to flee in 1277.Rossabi, 93. The court then sought refuge in Silvermine Bay (Mui Wo) on Lantau Island. The older brother became ill and died on May 8, 1278 at age ten, and was succeeded by his younger brother who became Emperor Huaizong of Song, aged seven. The Sung Wong Toi monument in Kowloon commemorates his enthronement. On March 19, 1279 the Song army was defeated in its last battle, the Battle of Yamen, fought against the Yuan army led by the Chinese general Zhang Hongfan in the Pearl River Delta. Song Prime Minister Lu Xiufu is said to have taken the boy emperor in his arms and jumped from his sinking ship into the sea, drowning both of them.Rossabi, 94. With the death of the last remaining emperor, Song China was eliminated, while Kublai Khan established the realm of the Yuan dynasty over China proper, Mongolia, Manchuria, Tibet, and Korea. For nearly a century to follow, the Chinese would live under a dynasty established by Mongols. However, a native Han Chinese dynasty would be established once more with the Ming dynasty in 1368. Historical literature Zhu Xi (1130–1200), the Neo-Confucian philosopher who edited the Zizhi Tongjian historical text originally compiled by Sima Guang. During the Song dynasty, the Zizhi Tongjian (Chinese: 資治通鑒/资治通鉴; Wade–Giles : Tzu-chih t'ung- chien; literally \\"Comprehensive Mirror for/to Aid in Government\\") was an enormous work of Chinese historiography, a written approach to a universal history of China, compiled in the 11th century. The work was first ordered to be compiled by Emperor Yingzong of Song in 1065, the team of scholars headed by Sima Guang, who presented the completed work to Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1084. Its total length was 294 volumes containing roughly 3 million Chinese characters. The Zizhi Tongjian covers the people, places, and events of Chinese history from the beginning of the Warring States in 403 BC until the beginning of the Song dynasty in 959. Its size, brevity, and scope has often been compared to the groundbreaking work of Chinese historiography compiled by the ancient historian Sima Qian (145 BC–90 BC), known as the Shiji. This historical work was later compiled and condensed into fifty nine different books by the Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi in 1189, yet his pupils had to complete the work shortly after his death in 1200.Partington, 238. During the Manchu Qing dynasty, the book was reprinted in 1708, while the European Jesuit Father Joseph Anne Maria de Moyriac de Mailla (1679–1748) translated it shortly after in 1737. It was later edited and published by the Jesuit Abbé, Jean Baptiste Gabriel Alexandre Grosier (1743–1823), in part with Le Roux des Hauterays, where a thirteenth volume and a title page were added.

The son of James Long and his wife Susan Strangways, he was born at Athelhampton and baptised at Melbury House, Dorchester, Dorset in 1682. He was the grandson of Sir James Long, 2nd Baronet and brother of the celebrated Kit-Cat Club beauty Anne Long (c. 1681 – 1711). He succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his brother Sir Giles Long, 4th Baronet, in 1698. He married Henrietta Greville on 6 June 1702 at St Martin in the Fields, Westminster, London. She was the daughter of Fulke Greville, 5th Baron Brooke and his wife Sarah Dashwood, and a descendant of the Earl of Bedford. On the death of his grandmother Lady Dorothy Long in 1710, he inherited the Draycot Estate together with Athelhampton Manor, other land in Wiltshire and Dorset, and an estate near Ripon in Yorkshire. He used the inheritance to purchase more land in Dorset, adjacent to Athelhampton, in the manors of Burleston and Southover. Long was returned as Member of Parliament for Chippenham at the 1705 English general election and again in 1708 and 1710. At the 1715 British general election, he was returned as MP for Wootton Bassett. He did not stand at the 1722 British general election but was returned as MP for Wiltshire in 1727. Long died at his London residence in Jermyn Street on 16 March 1729 from apoplexy. There were four daughters and two sons from his marriage. Four of his six children survived him, including Robert who succeeded to the baronetcy. His daughter Susanna created a scandal by marrying her mother's gardener in 1732, as noted in his diary by Viscount Perceval, (related distantly by marriage to the Longs). Lady Henrietta Long died 19 May 1765 at Bath.  Further reading  *Inheriting the Earth: The Long Family's 500 Year Reign in Wiltshire; Cheryl Nicol *Hand of Fate.

While attending high school, Simmons led the Indians to consecutive 34–0 seasons and Illinois High School Association (ILHA) Class A state championships, becoming one of the most celebrated players in Illinois prep history. Because of Simmons' ability to \\"carry\\" his team the nickname of \\"Mule\\" was given to him during his junior year. His 2,986 career points were the third most in Illinois history when he graduated in 1983. Simmons played for coach Ron Felling, who went on to become an assistant coach at Indiana University.

It originally aired on MTV on August 13, 2007. In the episode, Lauren Conrad ends her friendship with former housemate Heidi Montag after suspecting that Heidi and her boyfriend Spencer Pratt fabricated rumors of a sex tape involving Lauren and her ex-boyfriend Jason Wahler. The ensuing feud between the women becomes a central focus of the series, and is carried through each subsequent season in which Conrad appears. \\"You Know What You Did\\" was produced by Tony DiSanto, Adam DiVello, Liz Gateley, Sara Mast, Andrew Perry, Jason Sands, Robyn Schnieders, Sean Travis, Michael \\"Spike\\" Van Briesen, and Rick Van Meter. The episode was met with generally favorable reviews from critics, who felt that the changed dynamic between Conrad and Montag was entertaining for television. It was additionally notable for Conrad's delivery of the titular line \\"You know what you did!\\" when speaking to Montag, which has since been recognized as an iconic moment from the series. According to Nielsen ratings, \\"You Know What You Did\\" was watched by 3.6 million viewers in its original airing. The episode was released on DVD on July 19, 2008, packaged with the third season set. Plot The third season of The Hills begins with Whitney Port becoming Lauren's boss, after being promoted within Teen Vogue. On their first day returning to work, Lauren informs Whitney of false speculation regarding a sex tape involving herself and her ex-boyfriend Jason Wahler. Lauren comments that she has not spoken with Heidi since she moved into an apartment with Spencer, and the women become suspicious of her possible involvement with the rumors. Meanwhile, Heidi and Spencer are planning their housewarming party; Spencer plans on inviting several of his friends, while Heidi was only planning on inviting Lauren, Whitney, and Audrina Patridge. Visiting Audrina at Epic Records unannounced, she delivers invitations for Audrina and Lauren. Audrina accepts the invitations, although later tells her co-worker that she believes that Heidi and Spencer were speaking badly of Lauren and were responsible for spreading the sex tape rumors. Lauren and Whitney decline their invitations to the housewarming party, and instead plan an impromptu outing at the club Les Deux. Meanwhile, during the housewarming party, Jenn Bunney makes a brief appearance at the apartment, although Heidi is disappointed after realizing that Lauren will not be attending. Unaware that they will run into Heidi and Spencer, Lauren and Audrina attend a birthday party for their friend Frankie Delgado the following day. As Lauren leaves for the bathroom after Heidi gives her a letter, Heidi tells Audrina that she is unsure of the reason for the tension between them. Audrina finds Lauren in the bathroom and they read the letter together, which details Heidi's interest in rekindling their friendship. Angered that Heidi will not acknowledge the sex tape rumors, Lauren decides to exit the club. At the recommendation of Spencer, Heidi confronts Lauren before she is able to leave the club. Lauren and Audrina get into an argument with Heidi and Spencer outside of Les Deux, where Lauren delivers the now-famous quote \\"You know what you did!\\", elaborating that \\"You started a sick little rumor about me! You're a sad, pathetic person.\\" The following morning, Heidi explains to her co- worker Elodie Otto that she was unaware of said speculation, and still wants to reconcile with Lauren. Meanwhile, Lauren tells Whitney that she is saddened by the idea of losing her friend, although admits that she has benefited from their separation. Production \\"You Know What You Did\\" was produced by Tony DiSanto, Adam DiVello, Liz Gateley, Sara Mast, Andrew Perry, Jason Sands, Robyn Schnieders, Sean Travis, Michael \\"Spike\\" Van Briesen, and Rick Van Meter. Rumors of a sex tape involving Conrad and Wahler, in addition to stories alleging that she invaded his house to retrieve it, surfaced in April 2007. Conrad adamantly denied both reports, commenting that \\"if I ever tried to get something back from Jason, it was probably just photo albums and stuff\\" and the producers \\"videotape my life five days out of the week. I don't need additional footage, you know?\\" The president of entertainment for MTV, Brian Graden, commented that the series benefits from the media coverage it receives in between seasons, which he described as a \\"six-month commercial for the show that doesn't five away the narrative in full.\\" He elaborated that MTV wants \\"viewers to watch Lauren and the girls as the characters we know instead of in a show about being the stars of The Hills\\"; the sex tape rumors were consequently presented like a personal conflict between the women, and was intentionally not addressed as a highly publicized controversy. The ensuing feud between Conrad and Montag received extensive media attention since its beginning; Conrad was doubtful of the possibility of a reconciliation, noting that \\"I can see us getting to not hating each other but I don't think we would ever go back to being best friends.\\" When addressing speculation that the conflict was fabricated for television, Conrad stated that \\"I wouldn't fight for the camera. If anything I would try not to.\\" In a separate interview, she revealed that she almost quit the program before the season began, stating \\"it wasn't so much about the filming, but I didn't want to do a show with the other people on it\\", which was assumed to be alluding to Montag and Pratt. Release and reception \\"You Know What You Did\\" was met with generally favorable reviews from critics, who felt that the changed dynamic between Conrad and Montag was entertaining for television. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Jennifer Armstrong provided a favorable review; she opined that the conflict between Conrad and Montag made for the \\"most mature season ever\\" and offered a disclaimer that the term \\"maturity\\" was \\"being relative here, of course.\\" A writer for The Hollywood Gossip stated that the episode \\"didn't disappoint\\", and felt that the storyline clearly categorized Patridge and Port as being part of \\"Team Lauren\\" and Pratt as being part of \\"Team Heidi\\" in the \\"epic war\\". Virginia Heffernan from The New York Times felt that the deterioration of Conrad and Montag's friendship was \\"more convincing than Friends and just about any other comedy about female relationships because — as anyone who has ever been a young woman knows — undying friendships die.\\" Writing for Los Angeles Times, Denise Martin was complimentary of the fact that the conflict was \\"unsullied\\" despite the extensive media coverage it received before the season began, and added that it was \\"better than anything you'd get on All My Children.\\" Furthermore, Conrad's delivery of the titular line \\"You know what you did!\\" when speaking to Montag has been recognized as an iconic moment from the series; the staff from Us Weekly ranked the scene as the most memorable event from the program when recapping highlights from its six seasons in July 2010. In its original broadcast in the United States on August 13, 2007, \\"You Know What You Did\\" was watched by 3.6 million viewers. Consequently, it became the series' most-viewed episode at the time of its first airing; as August 2007, the episode was the network's highest-rated broadcast that year. It was surpassed by \\"Paris Changes Everything\\", which served as the premiere for the second half of the season, on March 17, 2008; it attracted 4.8 million viewers in its original airing. In the United States, the third season was released as a four-disc DVD set on July 19, 2008.

At the time of her death she was Dean of Women at Fisk University. Early life She was born in Athens, Georgia, the fifth of nine children of Isaac Derricotte and Laura Derricotte, a cobbler and a seamstress. As a child, she was hopeful of attending the local Institute and was crushed when her mother told her she would be unable due to her color. This event helped shape Juliette's perception of the world and her desire to change people's racial prejudices. Education and career Her drive for education helped land her in Talladega College, where she ended up getting a scholarship for her public speaking. After she graduated in 1918, she enrolled at the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) Training School. She then became the YWCA secretary of the National Student Council. Her responsibilities included visiting colleges, planning conferences, and fostering ideas and leadership. She is credited with recreating the council in ideology, helping it became more balanced, open, and most importantly, interracial. In 1924, Derricotte became a member of the World Student Christian Federation and began traveling the world as a delegate representing American colleges. In 1927, she received a master's degree in religious education from Columbia University. She resigned her YWCA position in 1929 to become Dean of Women at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee.Lauren Kientz Anderson, \\"A Nauseating Sentiment, a Magical Device, or a Real Insight? Interracialism at Fisk University in 1930\\", in Marybeth Gasman and Roger L. Geiger (eds), Higher Education for African Americans Before the Civil Rights Era, 1900-1964, Perspectives on the History of Higher Education, Vol. 29, New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2012, pp. 75–111. Derricotte was an active member of Delta Sigma Theta, and was affiliated with the sorority's first graduate chapter in New York City. After her death, Delta established a scholarship fund in her honor; it would be awarded to members of the sorority who are employed in the social work field. Deadly discrimination Derricotte died in a traffic accident in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1931. While she was riding in a car driven by a student, they collided with a white couple. Both Derricotte and the student were seriously injured. Although they received emergency treatment from white doctors, they were refused admittance to the local hospital because they were black. They were moved to a local woman's house, and both died by morning. This triggered national outrage and several investigations, one involving the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Legacy In the 1930s, Sue Bailey Thurman who had been inspired by Derricotte's ideas about learning and travel, established a scholarship fund, the Juliette Derricotte Scholarship, which allowed African-American undergraduate women of high academic achievement to study and travel abroad. One of the recipients of her scholarship was Margaret Bush Wilson, who revived the fund decades later. Notes  Further reading  *  References  * Alkalimat, Abdul (2004).

The name originates from the idea that having a positive impact on an individual can \\"snowball\\" into positive results for an entire community and beyond. Motivation Funded in part by the Illinois Department of Human Services, and governed by an elected board of directors, Operation Snowball is founded on the belief that youth and adults can make responsible and healthy life decisions when provided with factual information and an opportunity to develop self-motivation and responsibility. The program provides opportunities for youths and adults to work together cooperatively to plan, implement and evaluate a community-based alcohol and drug prevention program. Purpose Operation Snowball, Inc. believes that the use of alcohol and other drugs during the teen years can be devastating to physical, social and emotional growth. Through the Operation Snowball program, youth learn that it is okay to say no to alcohol and drugs. Students also learn that they are not alone in their decision to stay drug and alcohol free. Operation Snowball strives to create an environment that actively supports the decision to abstain from alcohol and drug use. Operation Snowball also believes that the most effective and comprehensive prevention programs must be undertaken by children and adults in partnership with one another. Operation Snowball also focuses on aiding teens with issues that may arise in their relationships with friends or family. Snowball offers a support system that teaches teens coping skills to help them resolve interpersonal problems. Comprehensive prevention program Operation Snowball is a comprehensive program that: *Includes alcohol and other drug information, responsible decision making skills, opportunities to enhance self-esteem, refusal skills, positive peer support, drug-free alternatives, leadership development, and much more *Gives a clear message to youth and adults that it is OK to say no to alcohol and other drugs and how to do this *Is flexible and can be adapted to any community or school setting. The model fosters youth and adult partnerships that make it ideal for community involvement and builds “A Community of Caring”. *Puts to use the powerful energy and influence of youth to create an atmosphere of positive peer support that makes it easier not to use alcohol and other drugs *Is unique because it recognizes youth as a part of the solution not the cause of the problem, thereby allowing them to learn and practice responsibility and leadership and be agents of community change Operation Snowball is a prevention program and does not provide individual or group treatment. (Operation Snowball does require that youth choosing to serve in active leadership roles make a commitment to lead a drug and alcohol free lifestyle.) Program models Operation Snowball has two types of chapters - school-based and community-based. Operation Snowball includes the following program models: *Operation Snowflurry, Preschool and elementary age youth *Operation Snowflake, Middle school and junior high school age youth *Operation Snowball, High school age youth *Operation Segue, young adults age 18–24 *Operation Blizzard, Families and adults *Operation Snowcap, Senior citizens Each program model focuses on the issues resulting from alcohol and other drug use and abuse in a manner appropriate for each age group. The concept of cross-age teaching and peer helping is an integral part of the Operation Snowball program. The programs follow the same principles and guidelines that may include the following: *Weekly meetings *Weekend retreats *Drug-free alternative activities *Opportunities to be a peer role model and to experience working with adults in a cooperative manor and atmosphere *Opportunities to develop special events that fit the needs of your community *Opportunities to get involved with other programs and events in your community Through the development of leadership skills, Operation Snowball shall be a youth and adult partnership, providing awareness and prevention of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use, while encouraging healthy decision- making in an active community of caring.\\" Operation Snowball site Chapters United States *Antioch High School *Champaign County *District 86 (Hinsdale, IL) *District 113 *District 205 (Elmhurst, IL) *District 211 (Cook County, Illinois) *District 230 (www.d230.org)(Orland Park, IL) *Dunlap High School 323 *East Peoria *Effingham County *Elmwood Park High School (Illinois) *Evergreen Park Community High School (Evergreen Park, IL) * Greater Fox River Valley *Green Bay Area Operation Snowball (Green Bay, WI) *Grayslake Central High School (Grayslake, Illinois) *Grayslake North High School (Grayslake, Illinois) *Havana High School (Illinois) *Homewood-Flossmoor High School *Joliet Central High School *Joliet West High School *Kendall County Snowball *Leyden High School District 212 *Lisle High School *Lyons Township High School *Marian Catholic High School *Metamora *Naperville *Nazareth Academy (La Grange Park, Illinois) *New Trier/Regina High Schools *Northwest Illinois *Oak Park and River Forest High School *Peoria Notre Dame *Westmont *Ridgewood High School (Illinois) *Rich South High School *Rich East High School *Rich Central High School *Adlai E.

It was created with the theory when a person affects another in a positive way, they would go on to positively affect someone else, creating a \\"snowball\\" effect. In 1979, the Superintendent of Barrington Area Schools asked three Barrington High School students to identify ways Operation Snowball could work to have a positive impact on both middle school and high school students. The team of three juniors designed and piloted a peer-to-peer drug and alcohol prevention & intervention program in 1980. In this pilot program Barrington High School student leaders were asked to meet with each Barrington Middle School class to discuss their leadership role, the impact alcohol has had on their lives, their choice to abstain and the additional choices abstaining has created for their lives. Its founders wanted to start a prevention and intervention program for youth, where they would learn leadership skills, feel empowered by making their own decisions, and could readily see the impact of their decision in light of their education and life goals. From its inception, Operation Snowball was planned and directed by teens/youth, with adults serving primarily advisory roles. By 1989, all of Illinois School District 220 was implenting the Barrington model. Within a few years, Operation Snowball chapters began to organize throughout the state of Illinois. At first the program was targeted at high school (Operation Snowball) and junior high school students (Operation Snowflake), but later expanded to include elementary schools (Operation Snowflurry). The model has continued to evolve over time and is now implemented mainly through retreats. Events Participants of Snowball say they: *developed friendships *were able to give and receive support and caring *talked about problems *shared ideas and feelings *felt a positive, supportive atmosphere *had a lot of fun *could speak without fear of rejection *were \\"glad\\" they came to Retreat *would \\"recommend\\" the Retreat to their friends *Overcame difficult obstacles facing them Champaign County Snowball Notes References *NCO Youth *Operation Snowball *HF High School *For more information contact Operation Snowball at 800.252.6301.

With 457 million Internet users currently active in China, the country now has the largest online user base in world, of which two-thirds engage in online game play.Chinese Online Game Market Roundup, Q3 2009 The average online gamer in China is relatively young (18 to 30 years old), male, and has at least completed a secondary level of education.People's Daily Online. \\"China's Online Game Industry on a Roll\\". 2007. Demographically the online gaming user base in China is very similar to base of China Internet users, most of whom live in larger cities.China Internet Network Information Center. \\"19th Statistical Survey Report on Internet Development in China\\". January 23, 2007. Online games in China fall into two primary categories: MMORPGs and MOCGs, the former have a predilection for persistent online worlds where hundreds to thousands of game players can interact simultaneously; the latter is a generic term for games played competitively online without the existence of a persistent online realm (games as simple as online Ma Jiang and online competitive card games would fall under this category). In 2011, there were over 100 million Chinese MMO gamers. Official Chinese statistics regarding online gaming state that as of the close of 2006 revenue from China's online gaming industry reached 8 billion RMB or around 1.04 billion US dollars, with earnings reaching around 33 billion RMB or 4.3 billion US dollars. Additionally, while Japanese, American, and South Korean companies have traditionally dominated the market, Chinese developed software now holds a 65% market share on the mainland, with an additional 20 million in revenue generated by users outside of China. China is the source of some of the largest gaming companies in the world, including Tencent, NetEase and more, and has been increasingly developing and acquiring popular online games throughout the world. The online gaming market in China grew to $1.6 billion in 2007, and is expected to exceed $3 Billion in 2010. According to another estimate, in 2007, China's online games market was worth about US$970 million, with over 36 million gamers. QQ Games is one such popular online game. Growth was driven in part by China's most popular online game, Netease's Fantasy Westward Journey, which now has 1.66 million peak concurrent users. Another contributor is Giant's Zhengtu Online, which has 1.52 million peak concurrent users. China is now the world's largest online gaming market, contributing one-third to the global revenue in this sector in 2009, or 56 percent of the Asia Pacific total. There are 368 million Internet users playing online games in the country and the industry was worth US$13.5 billion in 2013. 73% of gamers are male, 27% are female. Government involvement Ministry of Information Industry The Ministry of Information Industry (MII) of the People's Republic of China (中华人民共和国工业和信息化部) formed in the late 1990s through the integration of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and the Ministry of Electronics Industry. The agency's primary goals include the regulation of Chinese telecommunications and software companies. Listed here are the ministry's stated objectives involving online gaming:Ministry of Information Industry - China Nuclear Forces * Study and formulate the state's information industry development strategies, general and specific policies, and overall plans, revitalize the electronics and information products manufacturing, telecommunications and software industries, promote the information economy and society. * Draw up laws, rules and regulations on electronics and information products manufacturing, telecommunications and software industries, and publish administrative rules and regulations; and supervise the enforcement of laws and administrative rules. * Work out technical policies, systems and criteria of the electronics and information products manufacturing, telecommunications and software industries, and technical systems and criteria of the radio and television transmission networks; certificate the entry of telecom networking equipment to networks and manage the entry of telecom terminal equipment to networks; direct the supervision and management of electronics and information products quality. *Propel the research and development of electronics and information products manufacturing, telecommunications and software industries, organize research of major scientific and technological development projects, and digestion, absorption and creation of imported technologies, and promote the industrialization of scientific and technological research results; support the development of native industry. The ministry is also responsible for a number of initiatives aimed at increasing the number and prominence of natively produced online games. One example of such involvement is the inclusion of online gaming in the 2006–2010 plan for software and information service development. General Administration of Press and Publication The General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP) of the People's Republic of China (中华人民共和国新闻出版总暑) is responsible for monitoring and regulating publication of print based media, electronic media, and audio-visual products (including online games).chinaculture.org. \\"General Administration of Press and Publishing of PRC\\". The ministry has also been instrumental in combating the growing problem of Internet addiction and game addiction in China by teaming up with eight other government outlets concerned with the growing effect of game play on China's youth. The other concerned entities are as follows: Central Civilization Office, Ministry of Education, Chinese Communist Youth League, Ministry of Information Industry, Ministry of Public Security, All China Women's Federation, and China's Care for the Next Generation Work Commission. The GAPP also initiated the China National Online Game Publication Project in 2004. The intent of the project was to promote native game development through the use of government subsidies to game developers. In its third year, the project is to run through at least 2008, and has provided an estimated 300 million RMB to 16 Chinese game development companies.TDC Trade.\\"Business Alert - China\\". January 2005. State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television China's State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT) (国家广播电影电视总局) affected the world of Chinese online games in 2004 by instating a blanket ban on computer game related commercials in the state-run media. The only company to directly contradict this ban is Chinese game provider The9, which teamed with Coca-Cola to jointly promote the release of the popular Western MMORPG World of Warcraft in 2005. Besides this instance, the online game market has thrived without much media promotion. Government programs China's Ministry of Culture has enacted several public health efforts from as early as 2006 to address gaming and internet related disorders. In 2007, an \\"Online Game Anti-Addiction System\\" was implemented for minors, restricting their use to 3 hours or less per day. The ministry also proposed a \\"Comprehensive Prevention Program Plan for Minors’ Online Gaming Addiction\\" in 2013, to promulgate research, particularly on diagnostic methods and interventions. China's Ministry of Education in 2018 announced that new regulations would be introduced to further limit the amount of time spent by minors in online games. In response, Tencent, the owner of WeChat and the world's largest video game publisher, restricted the amount of time that children could spend playing one of its online games, to one hour per day for children 12 and under, and two hours per day for children aged . Game companies The major online game companies in China include NetEase, Tencent, Shanda, Kongzhong, The9, Netdragon, Giant Interactive Group, Perfect World and ChangYou. By revenue The 10 largest online game companies by revenue in 2017: #Tencent #NetEase #YY #37 Interactive #Perfect World #Elex #IGG #Alpha Group #Century Huatong Group (owner of Shanda) #Kunlun Tech Popularity statistics In order to gauge the popularity of online games, both in China and internationally, three benchmarks are commonly implemented. The first is peak concurrent users (PCU), which is the maximum numbers of players online simultaneously at a given time. A high PCU number signifies that a game has a large base of constant user participation, which is essential for the survival of an online world. The second statistic used is the daily active player base; this number is essentially a count of the number of disparate users who sign on in a given 24-hour period. This statistic differs from PCU simply because of its longer time span but the daily user base is still a good quantifier of popularity and usage. The third statistic is simply the total number of registered users for a specific game or service, this statistic is significantly more problematic because most, if not all, online games do not limit the user to a single account or user name. For example, some games claim millions of registered users; a disingenuous statistic given that the most popular MMORPGs in China usually garner only 800,000 to one million peak concurrent users.Gamasutra.\\"The China Angle\\". April 3, 2007. Thus, while registered user numbers can be quite impressive, they are not as accurate a gauge of popularity as the other aforementioned statistics. Investment In 2010, there were 25 investments made into Chinese online gaming companies. Of the 25 investments 20 of these deal disclosed financial details. As a group these 20 deals combined for a total of US$137 million in investment.The China Perspective.\\"E-Commerce, Online Games Lure 64% of Investments in China's Internet Market\\". February 15th, 2011. Tencent Games Tencent Games is the Interactive Entertainment Division (aka IED) of Tencent. Shanda Interactive Entertainment Shanda produces and supports many popular MMORPGs. The company is significant because it introduced a new online payment system with the release of Legend of Mir 2 in 2001. Instead of charging users for the initial purchase of the game, Shanda gave the software away free-of- charge and decided to charge users for time spent playing in game. This payment system specifically counteracted piracy because the company could maintain easier control over the time users spent in the game, rather than attempt to limit the game's distribution.Gamasutra.\\"The China Angle\\". March 20, 2007. Shanda maintains a large number of MMORPGs in China developed by Western, Korean and native Chinese companies; the latter two regions produce Shanda's most popular games. The company also maintains numerous casual games as well, with platforms supporting chess and other non-persistent world games.Shanda Entertainment Netease Netease, a popular online portal in China, also branched out in the space of MMORPGs with the release of Westward Journey. The game, based on ancient westward travels on the Silk Road (a popular theme from Chinese developed MMORPGs), has gone through two iterations; it was re-released as Westward Journey II due to numerous problems with the initial release, and its game engine was used to develop Fantasy Westward Journey, which is currently the most popular MMORPG in China (based on PCU numbers).Gamasutra.\\"The China Angle\\". April 3, 2007 The9 The9 (第九城市) is similar to Shanda Entertainment, it specifically maintains and produces MMORPG content for the Chinese gamer base. The9 is notable because of its partnership with Blizzard Entertainment in bringing World of Warcraft (the most popular MMORPG outside of Asia) to China. World of Warcraft is the most popular western MMORPG in Asia, and one of the most popular in China in general. Recent statistics place its peak concurrent users at around 688,000, easily among the top MMORPGs in the country. The9 also implemented a pay-for- time system for the game, which differs from the monthly subscription payment structure used by Blizzard in other territories. In April 2009, World of Warcraft owner Activision Blizzard announced it had selected The9 competitor NetEase to operate the game in China. The9's license expired on June 7, 2009. Piracy Because of the high amount of software piracy in China, many foreign game companies have been reluctant to enter the country's market with single player or console games. Instead, they have focused on selling online titles such as massively multiplayer online games as income from these titles comes largely from subscription fees or in game item purchases rather than the purchase price of the title itself. Nintendo claims that, as of February 14, 2008, China remains the main source of manufacturing pirated Nintendo DS and Wii games. Farming As of December 2005, there were an estimated 100,000 Chinese employed as \\"farmers\\", video game players who work to acquire virtual currency or items in online games so they can be sold to other players for real currency. Government controls The Beijing Reformatory for Juvenile Delinquents claimed in 2007 that a third of its detainees were influenced by violent online games or erotic websites when committing crimes such as robbery and rape. In a high-profile case from October 2004, 41-year-old Qiu Chengwei was sentenced to death for murdering 26-year-old Zhu Caoyuan over a dispute regarding the sale of a virtual weapon the two had jointly won in the game Legend of Mir 3. Also, in September 2007, a Chinese man in Guangzhou died after playing Internet video games for three consecutive days in an Internet cafe.

Image by Richard Koenig; taken September 15th 2011. The Ames Monument is a large pyramid in Albany County, Wyoming, designed by Henry Hobson Richardson and dedicated to brothers Oakes Ames and Oliver Ames, Jr., Union Pacific Railroad financiers. The brothers garnered credit for connecting the nation by rail upon completion of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. Oakes, a U.S. representative to the United States Congress from Massachusetts, asserted near total control of its construction, whereas Oliver became president of the Union Pacific Railroad (1866 - 1871). In 1873 investigators implicated Oakes in fraud associated with financing of the railroad. Congress subsequently censured Oakes, who resigned in 1873.State wants to attract more visitors to railroad monument, by JODI ROGSTAD. Associated Press. December 7, 2006. He died soon thereafter. The Ames Monument marked the highest point on the transcontinental railroad at However, Union Pacific Railroad Company twice relocated the tracks further south, causing the town of Sherman that arose near the monument to become a ghost town. Richardsonian design The Ames Monument is located about east of Laramie, Wyoming, on a wind-blown, treeless summit south of Interstate 80 at the Vedauwoo exit. The monument is a four-sided, random ashlar pyramid, square at the base and high, constructed of light-colored native granite. The pyramid features an interior passage, now sealed, alongside the perimeter of the structure's base. Noted American architect H. H. Richardson designed the pyramid, which includes two tall bas- relief portraits of the Ames brothers by sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens on the east and west sides of the pyramid's top. Saint-Gaudens chiseled the bas- reliefs from Quincy, Massachusetts, granite. The north side, which at one time faced the railroad tracks, displays one-foot-high letters grouted in the granite noting: \\"In Memory of Oakes Ames and Oliver Ames\\". The monument is one of a half-dozen or more projects that Richardson did for the Ames family. The pyramid is one of only two examples of Richardson's work west of the Mississippi River, the other being the Isaac H. Lionberger House in St. Louis less than two miles from the river. Richardson's monolithic structure employed rough-hewn granite boulders in its construction. The monument's stones at the base are five feet by eight feet and weigh thousands of pounds each. The pyramid narrows from the base to become progressively smaller towards the top at a ratio of four inches to the foot. History The audacity of building a transcontinental railroad in the 1860s was \\"today's equivalent of the mission to Mars: Big, expensive and impossible,\\" according to University of Wyoming historian Phil Roberts. President Abraham Lincoln reportedly told Oakes Ames that if he could get the transcontinental railroad built then he would be \\"the most remembered man of the century.\\" Lincoln personally recruited Oakes after progress by and financial support for Credit Mobilier of America, the construction company charged with building the railroad, ground to a halt. The Ames brothers succeeded where others failed and completed the transcontinental railway. However, in 1873 charges of financial fraud were leveled at Oakes, tarnishing his and the Union Pacific Railroad Company's reputation. Public outcry towards Oakes and other \\"Kings of Frauds\\" associated with scandal threatened the Ames family reputation and the Ames Company that dated back to 1774 when the company started making steel-edged shovels. The Ames Company later sold axes and shovels to miners during the California Gold Rush. The company continued its heritage as earth movers by supplying the government shovels during the Civil War, for excavating the Panama Canal, for mining Pennsylvania coal fields, and for digging the New York City Subway.

Memory of the financial scandal that surfaced in 1873 had not been forgotten when the Union Pacific Railroad Company built the monument honoring the Ames brothers during 1881-1882. The Union Pacific Railroad Board of Directors voted in 1875 to erect the grand Ames Monument, in part to help reclaim some of the company's luster lost during implications of fraud leveled earlier at Oakes Ames. Union Pacific stockholders subsequently authorized the construction at a meeting held in Boston on March 10, 1875. The Norcross Brothers of Worcester, Massachusetts built the monument, employing some 85 workers who lived on site, \\"where reportedly no liquor or gambling was allowed.\\" Workers cut the stone for the pyramid from a granite outcropping common in the area. They then used oxen teams to skid the stone a half-mile to the work site. The rough-faced granite blocks used to construct the monument in many cases weigh several tons. Workers constructed the pyramid about 300 yards south of the tracks on a small knoll. When completed in 1882, the Ames Monument stood south of, and above, the highest elevation of the original tracks of Union Pacific transcontinental railroad at . President Rutherford B. Hayes underscored the importance of the transcontinental railroad and thereby the Ames brothers by attending the monument's dedication ceremony. > However, when completed in 1882, the Ames Monument was visited by many > persons who were allowed to momentarily leave their trains in order to view > the monolithic curiosity. It was said that when the construction of the > monument was almost completed, some people had the opportunity of being > lifted to the top of the monument by a special rig and from their breezy > perch could view the surrounding area for a hundred miles in all directions. Sherman The small town of Sherman arose at the site north of the tracks where trains stopped to change engines on their transcontinental journey. The stop provided a roundhouse with five stalls and a turntable, two section houses, and a windmill with water tank. Trains were inspected at Sherman before beginning the long descent from the Sherman Pass summit, either east towards Cheyenne or west across the high Dale Creek Bridge to the Laramie Valley. The town's death knell came in 1918. The railroad company closed its station house and relocated the tracks about three miles (5 km) south. Residents soon abandoned Sherman, leaving behind a small cemetery that is still present today. The monument today 252x252px Union Pacific donated the railroad monument to the state of Wyoming in 1983. The structure is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is maintained as a Wyoming state historic site. Time and possible vandalism have destroyed some of the features of the bas-relief portraits of the Ames brothers on the monument. The Ames Monument is open year-round, weather permitting. Work took place in 2010 and 2011 to restore the monument. On October 31, 2016, the site received National Historic Landmark status.

He hosted the \\"Golden Days Of Radio\\" program which began in 1949 and aired on the Armed Forces Radio Network from 1967 to 1995. Bresee also created more than a dozen adult-oriented board games, the most notable of which is the drinking game Pass-Out. Background Bresee was born August 20, 1929 in Los Angeles. At age 10, he and his classmates went on a school field trip to the studios of Los Angeles classical music station KFAC. He soon decided he wanted to be in radio. In 1942, he began appearing as \\"Little Beaver\\" on the Red Ryder radio program when the regular actor, Tommy Cook, was away working on motion pictures. That same year, Bresee played Alvin on the Major Hopalong program, which also starred Arthur Q. Bryan and Mel Blanc. Career Bresee attended hundreds of radio broadcasts and collected scripts, transcription discs and other memorabilia. His tape archives of 3,900 reels is held at the Thousand Oaks Library in Southern California. In August 1949, Bresee launched \\"Golden Days Of Radio\\" at CBS' Los Angeles affiliate station KNX, playing transcription discs of old programs. He also often filled in for late-night disc jockey and \\"Honorary Mayor Of Hollywood\\" Johnny Grant. In 1950, Bresee began working as an assistant on Bob Hope's weekly NBC radio show. Bresee also hosted programs on the \\"Yesterday USA\\" internet radio station run by Bill Bragg, the former voice of State Fair of Texas mascot Big Tex.Frank Bresee Collection In the 1950s and 1960s, Bresee also worked in television, coordinating prizes for shows such as Let's Make a Deal. Perhaps his most lasting cultural legacy, however, is the board game Pass-Out, which a 2016 story called \\"essentially Monopoly with booze\\". The game, first sold in 1962, became very popular later in the decade and in the 1970s. The game is still sold today in many countries around the world, although its U.S. retail presence is now mainly limited to Amazon. While Bresee created more than a dozen other adult-oriented board games, Pass- Out was by far the most successful. In the aforementioned 2016 story, his wife Bobbie, a former Playboy Bunny, said that Pass-Out \\"bought this house [in Hollywood], it bought a house in Hancock Park, two Rolls-Royces, dozens of trips to Europe and all my opera dresses.\\" Death Bresee died June 5, 2018, at age 88.

The plant is generally similar to other mustards, but the yellow flowers are not as bright and flashy as closely related species. It is a spreading annual herb with long stems up to in length. Description Leaves of B. tournefortii This mustard is native to the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East. It became notorious during the twentieth century after it invaded the deserts of the United States and Mexico. Recently it has become an abundant weed of low deserts including the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts, plus the desert valleys such as the Coachella and Imperial Valleys of southern California.Dremann, Craig. 2005. California desert and adjacent States Megatransect Survey for the Saharan Mustard, mile- by-mile. Notebooks 192-197 unpublished. http://www.ecoseeds.com/mustards.html. The plant disperses easily at the first hint of rain. When the seed coats are moistened they form a gel and become very sticky and readily adhere to people, animals, and objects. Seeds easily take hold along roadsides and arid desert lands, especially in disturbed habitats. Thick stands of the plant can crowd out native flora. Well-adapted to desert life, it monopolizes any moisture in the soil before other plants can get it and forms seeds before other species do. It produces seed as early in the year as January, especially if the region undergoes a warm spell, which is a common occurrence during southern California winters. It self-fertilizes and drops seeds into the soil, where they persist and survive fires and long periods without rain. The fact that it propagates by leaving large numbers of viable seeds in the soil prevents eradication measures such as pulling, mowing, grazing, and burning. Individual plants have the capacity to separate from the ground and become like tumbleweeds, dropping seeds as they are carried across the desert floor in the breeze.

The official Mazda engine codes are FE-DE and FE-ZE, depending on output level. It is still commonly called the FE3 because of its head castings. The FE-DOHC shares the same dimensions as the original FE-SOHC, including the square 86 mm bore × stroke and it has an ideal 1.74 rod/stroke ratio. The FE-DOHC is usually identified by a gold-coloured cam cover, however not always. There were at least five different FE-DOHC engines available with various compression ratio, camshaft and ECU tuning combinations, however none were fitted with a turbocharger from the factory. Despite this, the FE-DOHC is already built for turbo with large forged connecting rods, large journal dimensions, oil cooler, piston oilers, web-stiffened block with main girdles (and braceplate where equipped). This robust engine design is a favourite of tuners who are aware of its capability because it already has a high-power capacity perfect for custom turbo jobs. As much as 600 whp has been seen on a stock engine. The common FE-DOHC crankshaft is cast while the forged crankshaft is fitted to the aluminum sump engines with both the main bearing braces and the main bearing girdle plate. In European 10.0:1 compression, non-catalytic trim, the FE-DOHC produces 148 ps (108 kW) at 6000 rpm and 133 lb/ft (182 Nm) at 4000 rpm. The 9.2:1 compression, catalytic converter version produces 140 ps. The Japanese domestic market variants produce anywhere between 145 ps and 165 ps. The only vehicle with 165ps was the 96-97 Capellas Wagons, FX (MT or AT) or FX Cruising (Only exists in AT). They had different tail lights to the earlier wagons. Applications The FE-DOHC was a European and Japanese market engine only (excluding use by Kia), and as such was only ever delivered in vehicles by Mazda to countries in those markets, with the exception of New Zealand who also received European market models. The engine was first fitted to the GD model 1988-1992 626 GT, 1987-1991 Capella and the 626 Coupe GT 2.0i/Capella C2 GT-X and GT-R. In South Africa, Samcor who built Mazdas under licence also fitted the FE-DOHC engine to the Mazda 323 from 1991 to 1994. Alongside the sedan, hatch and coupé models the FE-DOHC was also being used in the GV wagon, which ran until 1997. The rest of the world received the FE-DOHC in the 1995–2003 Kia Sportage, built by Kia under license. Kia first introduced the engine in March 1992, when they installed it in the Kia Concord, a license built version of the 1982 Mazda Capella. The Sportage variant was reconfigured for rear-wheel drive configuration with long single-runner intake manifold, low-duration cams and exclusively in the low compression ratio of 9.2:1.

It is a non interference design. There are two valve springs per valve and four valves per cylinder. While a dual valve spring configuration is used, the stock springs are fairly low-sprung. Low spring rates were chosen for fuel efficiency and increased valvetrain longevity, and low friction with the dual valve springs for the reduction of harmonics and increased valve stability. Camshafts The Mazda FE-DOHC came with several different camshaft profiles from the factory. As such there were several camshaft combinations available. {  - ! Camshaft ! Lift (mm) ! Duration (deg) -  FE5A  8.855  250° -  FE3N  8.852  245° -  FEAP  8.650  230 -  KO13  ?  ? -  F8K1  6.800  225 } The F8K1 was the intake camshaft for the F8-DOHC, only listed due to family ties. The combinations available: {  - ! Intake ! Exhaust -  FE5A  FE5A -  FE3N  FE3N -  FEAP  FE3N -  FE3N  KO13 -  F8K1  FE3N } VICS The FE-DOHC featured Mazda's VICS system, short for Variable Inertia Control System, a variable intake setup to optimize runner length and resonance at different engine speeds. Much like Toyota's Acoustic Control Induction System, it had two sets of intake runners, a long set for low-medium RPMs, and a short set for high RPMs. It was operated by a vacuum solenoid based on the engine's current speed, actuating a pair of butterflies inside the manifold to open or close the short runners past 5400 RPM. This system has been used on many Mazda engines since including the BP. The K-series V6 engines used a different principle to the same effect dubbed VRIS. Two versions of the VICS intake system exist, one has steeper straighter runners than the other, which is kinked for vehicle packaging reasons. VICS was not present on the F8-DOHC or Kia version of the FE-DOHC, both of which use a conventional intake manifold design. Head gasket compatibility The head gasket used on the Kia version can be sourced in North America, but the builder must note that the coolant passage holes are configured for a RWD cooling system. Attempting to use the RWD head gasket in FWD cooling configuration will result in improper flow and can result in overheating of cylinder #4.

Window manager Begun in March 2007, version 0.1 was announced Haskell-cafe mailing list by Spencer Janssen in April 2007 as 500 lines of Haskell. xmonad is a tiling window manager, akin to dwm, larswm, and StumpWM. It arranges windows in a non-overlapping pattern and enables managing windows without using the mouse. xmonad is packaged and distributed on a wide range of Unix-like operating systems, such as a large number of Linux distributions, and BSD systems. While originally a clone of dwm (derivative in areas such as default keybindings), xmonad now supports features not available to dwm users such as per-workspace layout, tiling reflection, state preservation, layout mirroring, GNOME support and per-screen status bars; it can be customised by modifying an external configuration file and 'reloaded' while running.Through a combination of swiftly re-compiling and then execing the new xmonad binary; see xmonad features have begun to influence other tiling window managers - dwm has borrowed \\"urgency hooks\\" from xmonad,See the developer discussion on the dwm mailing list has also included Xinerama support (for multihead displays) with release 4.8, and patches exist to reimplement xmonad's Fibonacci layout.Suckless.org: Fibonacci layouts patch to dwm Haskell project In 2007 the man page stated: > By utilising the expressivity of a modern functional language with a rich > static type system, xmonad provides a complete, featureful window manager in > less than 500 lines of code, with an emphasis on correctness and robustness. > Internal properties of the window manager are checked using a combination of > static guarantees provided by the type system, and type-based automated > testing. A benefit of this is that the code is simple to understand, and > easy to modify. Extensions to the core system, including emulation of other window managers and unusual layout algorithms, such as window tiling based on the Fibonacci spiral, have been implemented by the active communityxmonad users generate significant traffic in the #xmonad IRC channel and the xmonad mailing list; in addition, there are a significant number of commits to the extension library from non-core devs (see the xmonad statistic page ) and are available as a library. In addition to obviating the need for the mouse, the xmonad developers make heavy use of semi-formal methods and program derivation for improving reliability and enabling a total line of code count less than 1200, as of version 0.7; window manager properties (such as the behavior of window focus) are checked through use of QuickCheck. This emphasis makes xmonad unusual in a number of ways; besides being the first window manager written in Haskell, it is also the first to use the zipper data structure for automatically managing focus, and its core has been proven to be safe with respect to pattern matches, contributing further to reliability. The developers write: > xmonad is a tiling window manager for the X Window system, implemented, > configured and dynamically extensible in Haskell. This demonstration > presents the case that software dominated by side effects can be developed > with the precision and efficiency we expect from Haskell by utilising purely > functional data structures, an expressive type system, extended static > checking and property-based testing. In addition, we describe the use of > Haskell as an application configuration and extension language.Stewart & > Janssen, 2007 The code is separated into side-effect free code, and a thin wrapper for the side-effects. According to Alejandro Serrano Mena, there's two ways of implementing domain-specific languages for actions in Haskell applications and libraries \\"developing a combinator library\\" or \\"rolling your own monad\\", with xmonad being a successful example of the latter. xmonad was regarded as one of the most well known Haskell projects in a 2013 functional programming book. Reception Linux Magazine included xmonad in a list of \\"My Top Resources of 2009\\". In 2012, How-To Geek described xmonad as having good, but complicated, ability to be configured, and it was included in a 2013 list of eight desktop environments for Linux. Lifehacker wrote that the basic operations of xmonads user interface can be taught using a small set of instructions. A high level of customisation and speed were noted by Network World, and in MakeUseOf xmonad was reviewed positively compared to Openbox. In 2016 Ars Technica said xmonad and Awesome had more advanced tiling ability than Cinnamon. In 2017 it was described as powerful, with application as a windows manager for big data, while in an article on opensource.com on the other hand, dwm was chosen over xmonad. A TechRadar review of the \\"Best Linux desktop of 2018\\" said \\"If there's one desktop environment that stands out from all the others we have here, it's this one.\\" Due to the small number of lines of code of the Xmonad application, the use of the purely functional programming language Haskell, and recorded use of a rigorous testing procedure it is sometimes used as a baseline application in other research projects. This has included re- implementation of xmonad using the Coq proof assistant, a determination xmonad is an imperative program, and studies of package management relating to the NixOS linux distribution.

Burgess has also played for the New England Patriots. Early years Burgess attended Warren G. Harding High School in Warren, Ohio, where he played high school football. He ranked among the nation's best linebackers and defensive backs. College career After graduating from high school, Burgess attended the University of Michigan. He started 20 of the 46 games he played in, and was named an All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention in his junior (2005) and senior (2006) seasons. Professional career First stint with Ravens Burgess was drafted in the sixth round (207th overall) in the 2007 NFL Draft by the Baltimore Ravens. He played in his first eight games for Baltimore, recording four tackles before being placed on injured reserve with a hip injury on November 14. He missed the entire 2008 season, after being placed on injured reserve on August 11 with a broken forearm. Burgess played in the first two games of the 2009 season for the Ravens, picking up two tackles. New England Patriots Burgess was traded to the New England Patriots on September 22, 2009 in exchange for a conditional seventh round draft choice. He was inactive for the Patriots' Week 3 game and waived on September 28. The trade was conditioned on the games Burgess was active for the Patriots; therefore, the Ravens did not receive any compensation from the Patriots. He was re-signed to the Patriots' practice squad on September 30, in advance of their Week 4 against the Ravens, who would have not been allowed to sign Burgess back off the Patriots' practice squad because of this matchup. Second stint with Baltimore Ravens On October 5, the day after their game with the Patriots, the Ravens signed Prescott Burgess off the Patriots' practice squad to take the place of Brendan Ayanbadejo, who went on injured reserve. Burgess continued his role as a backup with Baltimore in and . Third stint with Baltimore Ravens On September 3, 2011, Burgess was released during final cuts. He was re-signed by the Baltimore Ravens on September 28, when Baltimore cornerback Dominique Foxworth was placed on injured reserve. Burgess was active for one game, with no statistics. He was waived again on October 4, after Baltimore signed cornerback Bryan McCann. He was re-signed on October 18. He was placed on Injured Reserve November 2, 2011 and the team signed Edgar Jones as a replacement. He was taken off Injured Reserve on December 3, 2011 and immediately released from the team. While not seeing much time on defense during his stints with the Ravens, he did establish himself as a special teams standout, becoming one of their top tacklers in that unit.

He studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and earned a Master's of Fine Arts degree from Yale University.  Career  West's areas of expertise are painting and drawing, computer graphics, and design. Major influences on his early artistic development included the works of Romare Bearden, Henry Ossawa Tanner, and the 1970s Black arts collective AfriCOBRA. His art has been shown in various art displays since 1970. Examples of his work are held in the collections of the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, the Museo Civico D’arts Contemporaneo Di Gibilina, Palermo, Italy, and the Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati. He took part in the national touring exhibition “To Conserve a Legacy: American Art from Historically Black Colleges and Universities\\". He was a curator for the 1999 \\"HOMAGE TO JAZZ\\" at the Martin Luther King Center in Columbus, Ohio. He has also served on the National Endowment of the Arts Expansion Arts Panel, the International Juror National Exhibition of Zimbabwe, and the Ohio Arts Council. West considers himself an Afrocentric artist. He does not align with modern or post-modern artists. He prefers to integrate the importance of a strong moral society with cultural traditions. Africa is the source for classical art traditions and African and American cultures inspire his imagery. He symbolizes a universal message through the use of traditional tales, mythologies and religion. His most common subject is the black woman. He considers her a symbol for Mother Earth, for the cradle of humanity. She represents the theorized oldest evidence of humanity recently found in Ethiopia. In his work “The Garden” he paints Eve as an enchanting black woman. The painting creates a spiritual energy from the layers of imagery and the balance of color and form. A solo exhibition Urban Warriors: A Retrospective in the Shot Tower Gallery at Fort Hayes, highlights the strength and energy of his body of work. West taught at Ohio State University until he suffered a debilitating stroke in March 2016.

The station is a historical landmark in the City of San Fernando in Pampanga, the Philippines. The station has been closed since the ending of northbound rail services by Philippine National Railways in 1988.  History  The station was inaugurated by Governor- General Eulogio Despujol and Bernardino Nozaleda, the Archbishop of Manila, on February 23, 1892. On June 27, 1892, José Rizal disembarked from this station to meet some recruits for La Liga Filipina and again the next day en route to Bacolor. On April 1942, during the Bataan Death March, the station served as the ending point for the 102-kilometer (63-mile) march from Bataan, from which Filipino and American prisoners-of-war were carted to Capas in Tarlac en route to their final destination, Camp O'Donnell. It was closed, along with all other PNR Northrail stations, in 1988, when the North Main Line ceased its services.

The first academic description of ROSCAs was by Shirely Ardener in 1964. F. J. A. Bouman described ROSCAs as \\"the poor man's bank, where money is not idle for long but changes hands rapidly, satisfying both consumption and production needs.\\"F. J. A. Bouman, Indigenous savings & credit societies in the developing world in Von Pischke, Adams & Donald (eds.) Rural Financial Markets in the Developing World, World Bank, Washington, 1983 They are also known as tandas (Latin America), chama (Swahili-speaking East Africa), Kameti کمیٹی (Pakistan), visi (Gujaratis, India), ekub (Ethiopia), partnerhand (West Indies), cundinas (Mexico), ayuuto (Somalia), stokvel (South Africa), hagbad (Somaliland), susu (West Africa and the Caribbean), hui, 會 (Chinese communities in East & SE Asia), paluwagan (Philippines), Gam'eya جمعية (Egypt), kye (계) (South Korea), tanomoshiko (頼母子講) (Japan), pandeiros (Brazil), cuchubál (Guatemala), juntas, quiniela or panderos (Peru), C.A.R. Țigănesc/Roata (România), arisan (Indonesia) and dhukuti or dhikuti (Nepal). Structure Meetings can be regular or tied to seasonal cash flow cycles in rural communities. These usually coincide with the crop harvest for farmers and pay dates for the employed members where people have sure funds on hand. A slot is equivalent to one periodic money withdrawal. To determine the order of money distribution among members, a drawing of slot is done and agreed prior to the start of periodic fund accumulation. Depending on the intended purpose, a member can swap his slot with another thru mutual agreement. Such switching of slots is allowed prior to the fund accumulation or before the periodic money withdrawal. A member who availed more than one slot may have the reserved right to choose the other slot pay date. Nevertheless, the organizer should be informed of the changes prior to the pay process to avoid confusion. Each member contributes the same amount at each meeting, and one member takes the whole sum once. As a result, each member is able to access a larger sum of money during the life of the ROSCA, and use it for whatever purpose she or he wishes. This method of saving is a popular alternative to the risks of saving at home, where family and relatives may demand access to savings.Stuart Rutherford. The Poor & Their Money Oxford University Press, Delhi, 2000 Every transaction is seen by every member during the meetings. Since no money has to be retained inside the group, no records have to be kept. Though some maintain a crude list of slots. These characteristics make the system a model of transparency and simplicity that is well adapted to communities with low levels of literacy and weak systems for protecting collective property rights. The system further reduces the risk to members because it is time limited—typically lasting no more than 6 months. Each member receives at least once the amount collected. This reduces the size of the loss, should someone take funds early and not pay back. In addition to their simplicity of structure, ROSCAs compensate when two key conditions exist, which make them competitive alternative financial products, even in relatively sophisticated economies: # Erosion of buying power of accumulated savings over long savings horizons in inflationary conditions # Failure of the normal financing market to provide credit to credit worthy borrowers, often due to opportunity cost, regulation, or operational expense Diversity and distribution Variously called \\"committee\\" in India and Pakistan, Ekub in Ethiopia, Susus in Southern Africa and the Caribbean, \\"Seettuva\\" in Sri Lanka, tontines in West Africa, tanomoshiko or mujin in pre-1945 Japan, wichin gye in Korea, arisan in Indonesia, likelembas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, xitique in Mozambique and djanggis in Cameroon, ROSCAs are informal or 'pre-co-operative' microfinance groups that have been documented around the developing world. A famous early study by anthropologist Clifford Geertz documented the arisans of Modjokuto in Eastern Java. He described them as \\"an \\"intermediate\\" institution growing up within peasant social structure, to harmonize agrarian economic patterns with commercial ones, to act as a bridge between peasant and trader attitudes toward money and its uses.\\" The individuals in the ROSCA select each other, which ensures that participation is based on trust and social forces (social capital), and a genuine commitment to participate. In Brazilian consorcios, groups of strangers are assembled into a ROSCA unit by an agent or intermediary, whose role in facilitating the group formation and on-going administration is remunerated. As at 2015, over five million active ROSCA users were reported in Brazil. As the consorcio runs its term, many of the same features of social capital and compliance manifest, as members of the group develop personal contact and trust. Rotating or accumulating? ROSCAs can be compared and contrasted with accumulating savings and credit associations (ASCAs). Documented extensively in South Asia by Rutherford, ASCAs are also time-limited, informal microfinance groups. Unlike ROSCAs however, they appoint one of their members to manage an internal fund. Records are kept and surplus lent out. After a pre-agreed period (often 6–12 months) all the loans are called back and the fund, plus accumulated profit, is distributed to the members. International development practitioners have been intrigued for years by the potential benefits of attempting to link ROSCAs and ASCAs to formal financial systems. But such linkages tend to defeat the voluntary purpose of these groups and distort member incentives towards securing access to external funds. CARE, an American NGO, has spread standardized ASCAs to reach 2 million people in Africa. These standardized ASCAs are called village savings and loan associations (VSLAs), and they usually comprise 10 to 20 participants who conduct saving and loan activities for a fixed period, usually 12 months. Unlike informal ASCAs, these use a triple-locked box to secure the funds, have standardized election procedures and maintain a careful separation of various duties, such as record-keeping, money-counting, meeting facilitation etc. Interest rates on loans typically vary from 5–10% a month, while cycle-end pay-outs in most groups range from 30–60% of invested capital. As of the end of June 2012 development agencies (including CARE, Oxfam, CRS and PLAN) were carrying out projects reaching 1.8 million members in 23 countries, mostly in Africa. The Savings Group Information Exchange, a project of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, provides researchers with an on-line database where indicators like savings and loans per member, country, return on assets and percentage of female members can be compared. Another interesting variant on this theme are the terminating deposits that formed part of product line of building societies in the last half of the nineteenth century. These provided many workers with the funds required to finance their own homes. Online ROSCAs Carlos Veléz- Ibáñez, an anthropology professor at Arizona State University, stated that \\"technology has added a new twist to the savings pools, with 'electronic cundinas[ROSCAs]' being organized on Web sites that can bring together people from across the United States\\". A few of the existing products include eMoneyPool, created by two brothers living in Phoenix, Arizona; Monk, founded by ex-googler and ex-intel employees in Silicon Valley; Puddle, a google- venture backed startups, Moneyfellows UK & African based online mobile and web platform digitizing the ROSCA model; ROSCA Finance, a patent pending startup creating a global, autonomous money sharing platform founded by former Santander bankers; Esusu, founded by ex-Goldman Sachs, PwC and LinkedIn employees in New York and Partnerhand, a patent pending UK based organisation facilitating online 'Pardner's' between verified individuals, founded in 2010. StepLadder, founded in 2016 by finance professionals with distinguished academic work on Consorcios in Brazil is joining the UK market for ROSCA-based collaborative finance by serving prospective first-time UK home buyers. In October 2017 Finlok platform launched a digital ROSCA product in India leveraging NPCI's Unified Payment Interface. Another company which has taken ROSCA online is AZ Fundchain, they are the first team to make ROSCA available on the Ethereum blockchain through a simple mobile app. They were founded in 2018 and launched their app to the public in mid 2019.

Sucrose phosphorylase is in the class of hexosyltransferases. More specifically it has been placed in the retaining glycoside hydrolases family although it catalyzes a transglycosidation rather than hydrolysis. Sucrose phosphorylase catalyzes the conversion of sucrose to D-fructose and α-D-glucose-1-phosphate. It has been shown in multiple experiments that the enzyme catalyzes this conversion by a double displacement mechanism.  Reaction  The method by which sucrose phosphorylase converts sucrose to D-fructose and alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate has been studied in great detail. In the reaction, sucrose binds to the enzyme, at which point fructose is released by the enzyme-substrate complex. A covalent glucose-enzyme complex results, with beta-linkage between an oxygen atom in the carboxyl group of an aspartyl residue and C-1 of glucose. The covalent complex was experimentally isolated by chemical modification of the protein using NaIO4 after addition of the substrate, supporting the hypothesis that reaction catalyzed by sucrose phosphorylase proceeds through the ping- pong mechanism. In the final enzymatic step, the glycosidic bond is cleaved through reaction with a phosphate group, yielding α-D-glucose-1-phosphate. In a separate reaction, α-D-glucose-1-phosphate is converted to glucose-6-phosphate by the action of phosphoglucomutase. Glucose-6-phosphate is an extremely important intermediate for several pathways in the human body, including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway. The function of sucrose phosphorylase is especially significant due to the role α-D-glucose-1-phosphate in energy metabolism.  Structure  The structure of sucrose phosphorylase has been identified in numerous experiments. The enzyme consists of four major domains, namely A, B, B’, and C. Domains A, B’ and C exist as dimers around the active site. The size of the enzyme, as determined by sedimentation centrifugation, was found to be 55 KDa, consisting of 488 amino acids. The active has been shown to contain two binding sites, one designated a water site where hydroxylic molecules such as 1,2-cyclohexanediol and ethylene glycol may bind, and another designated as the acceptor site where the sugar molecule binds. Though the function of the water site has not been completely elucidated, the enzyme’s stability in aqueous solutions indicates that the water site may be involved in hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond. The acceptor site is surrounded by three active residues that have been found to be essential in enzymatic activity. Using specific mutagenic assays, Asp-192 was found to be the catalytic nucleophile of the enzyme, “attacking C-1 of the glucosyl moiety of sucrose”. In fact, in vitro manipulation has shown that D-xylose, L-sorbose, and L-arabinose can replace fructose as the glucosyl acceptor. The only requirement of the acceptor molecule is that the hydroxyl group on the C-3 be cis-disposed to the oxygen atom of the glycosidic bond. Glu-232 acts as the Bronsted acid-base catalyst, donating a proton to the displaced hydroxyl group on C-1 of the glucoside. The most significant residue in the enzymatic activity, however, is Asp-295. Upon cleavage of the fructofuranosyl moiety from sucrose, the resultant glucose forms a covalent intermediate with the enzyme. The carboxylate side chain of Asp-295 hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups at C-2 and C-3 of the glucosyl residue. This interaction is maximized during the transition state of this covalent complex, lending support to the ping-pong mechanism. Finally, phosphorylation of the glucosyl residue at C-1 forms a transient positive charge on the glucosyl carbon, promoting breakage of the ester bond between Asp-192 and the sugar residue. Cleavage yields the product, α-D-glucose-1-phosphate.  Regulation  Since the discovery and characterization of sucrose phosphorylase, few documented experiments discuss mechanisms of regulation for the enzyme. The known methods of regulation are transcriptional, affecting the amount of enzyme present at any given time. Global regulation of DNA molecules containing the gene for sucrose phosphorylase is performed by catabolite repression. First discovered in Gram-negative bacteria, both Cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP Receptor Protein (CRP) function in sucrose phosphorylase regulation. The cAMP-CRP complex formed when both molecules combine acts as a positive regulator for transcription of the sucrose phosphorylase gene. The complex binds to the promoter region to activate transcription, enhancing the creation of sucrose phosphorylase. Genetic regulation of sucrose phosphorylase is also performed by metabolites. Through experimentation it is known that genes encoding for the sucrose phosphorylase enzyme can be induced by sucrose and raffinose. Glucose, on the other hand, represses the transcription of the sucrose phosphorylase gene. These metabolites undoubtedly function in this way because of their implications in cellular metabolism. There has been little research on methods of the allosteric regulation of sucrose phosphorylase, so at this point the function of allosteric molecules can only be hypothesized. Due to the nature of its function in metabolic pathways, it is likely that sucrose phosphorylase is additionally regulated by other common metabolites. For example, the presence of ATP would probably inhibit sucrose phosphorylase since ATP is a product of the catabolic pathway. Conversely, ADP would likely stimulate sucrose phosphorylase to increase levels of ATP. Further research on the subject would be required to support or refute these ideas.  Function  As mentioned above, sucrose phosphorylase is a very important enzyme in metabolism. The reaction catalyzed by sucrose phosphorylase produces the valuable byproducts α-D-glucose-1-phosphate and fructose. α-D- glucose-1-phosphate can be reversibly converted by phosphoglucomutase to glucose-6-phosphate, which is an important intermediate used in glycolysis. In addition, fructose can be reversibly converted into fructose 6-phosphate, also found in the glycolytic pathway. In fact, fructose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate can be interconverted in the glycolytic pathway by phosphohexose isomerase. The final product of glycolysis, pyruvate, has multiple implications in metabolism. During anaerobic conditions, pyruvate con be converted into either lactate or ethanol, depending on the organism, providing a quick source of energy. In aerobic conditions, pyruvate can be converted into Acetyl-CoA, which has many possible fates including catabolism in the Citric Acid Cycle for energy use and anabolism in the formation of fatty acids for energy storage. Through these reactions, sucrose phosphorylase becomes important in the regulation of metabolic functions. The regulation of sucrose phosphorylase can also be used to explain its function in terms of energy consumption and preservation. The cAMP-CRP complex that enhances transcription of the sucrose phosphorylase gene (Reid and Abratt 2003) is only present when glucose levels are low. The purpose of sucrose phosphorylase, therefore, can be linked to the need for higher glucose levels, created through its reaction. The fact that glucose acts as a feedback inhibitor to prevent the formation of sucrose phosphorylase further supports its catalytic role in the creation of glucose for energy use or storage. The glucose-6-phosphate molecule created from the original α-D-glucose-1-phosphate product is also involved in the pentose phosphate pathway. Through a series of reactions, glucose-6-phosphate can be converted into ribose-5-phosphate, which is used for a variety of molecules such as nucleotides, coenzymes, DNA, and RNA. These connections reveal that sucrose phosphorylase is also important for the regulation of other cellular molecules.

Peroxisomal disorders are usually caused by a combination of peroxisomal assembly defects or by deficiencies of specific peroxisomal enzymes. The peroxisome is an organelle in the cell similar to the lysosome that functions to detoxify the cell. Peroxisomes contain many different enzymes, such as catalase, and their main function is to neutralize free radicals and detoxify drugs. For this reason peroxisomes are ubiquitous in the liver and kidney. D-BP deficiency is the most severe peroxisomal disorder, often resembling Zellweger syndrome. Characteristics of the disorder include neonatal hypotonia and seizures, occurring mostly within the first month of life, as well as visual and hearing impairment. Other symptoms include severe craniofacial disfiguration, psychomotor delay, and neuronal migration defects. Most onsets of the disorder begin in the gestational weeks of development and most affected individuals die within the first two years of life. Classification DBP deficiency can be divided into three types: * type I, characterized by a deficiency in both the hydratase and dehydrogenase units of D-BP * type II, in which only the hydratase unit is non-functional * type III, with only a deficiency in the dehydrogenase unit Type I deficient patients showed a large structural modification to the D-BP as a whole. Most of these individuals showed either a deletion or an insertion resulting in a frameshift mutation. Type II and III patients showed small scale changes in the overall structure of D-BP[6]. Amino acid changes in the catalytic domains or those in contact with substrate or cofactors were the main cause of these variations of D-BP deficiency. Other amino acid changes were seen to alter the dimerization of the protein, leading to improper folding. Many mutations have been found in the gene coding for D-BP (HSD17B4) on the q arm two of chromosome five (5q23.1) in Homo sapiens, most notably individuals homozygous for a missense mutation (616S).  D-BP Protein  The D-bifunctional protein is composed of three enzymatic domains: the N-terminal short chain alcohol dehydrogenase reductase (SDR), central hydratase domain, and the C-terminal sterol carrier protein 2 (SDR). The DBP protein (79kDa) also known as \\"multifunctional protein 2\\", \\"multifunctional enzyme 2\\", or \\"D-peroxisomal bifunctional\\"enzyme\\", catalyzes the second and third steps of peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acids and their derivatives . A non-functional D-BP protein results in the abnormal accumulation of long chain fatty acids and bile acid intermediates. The D-BP protein contains a peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) unit at the C-terminus allowing for its transport into peroxisomes by the PTS1 receptor. Inside the peroxisomes, the D-BP protein is partially cleaved exclusively between the SDR and hydratase\\"domains. DBP is a stereospecific enzyme; hydratase domain forms only (R)-hydroxy-acyl-CoA intermediates from trans-2-enoyl-CoAs. D-BP is expressed throughout the entire human body, with the highest mRNA levels in the liver and brain. The hydrogenase and hydratase units of DBP exist as dimers, necessary for correct folding and therefore function of the enzyme.  Genetic  The D-BP gene (HSD17B4), found on the long arm of chromosome 5, consists of 24 exons and 23 introns and is over 100kb in size. Exons 1-12 code for the SDR domain, 12-21 for the hydratase domain, and 21-24 for the SCP2 domain. Transcription is regulated at 400 basepairs upstream of the transcription start site. The missense mutation G16S is the most common mutation that leads to D-BP deficiency. In a 2006 study in which 110 patients were tested, 28 suffered from this frameshift mutation. The second most frequent mutation was the missense mutation N457Y which was seen in 13 of the 110 patients. Type I patients showed only deletions, insertions, and nonsense mutations were identified, most leading to shortened polypeptides. Most type II patients show missense mutations in D-BP hydratase unit as well as some in-frame deletions. Type III\\"individuals commonly show missense mutations in the coding region of the dehydrogenase domain.  Chemistry  Enzymatic activity of D-BP fails if the protein cannot effectively bind the cofactor NAD+, as shown in the G16S mutation. Glycine 16 forms a short loop and creates a hole for the adenine ring of NAD+ to enter. Other amino acid side chains alter the shape of this loop due to steric hindrance, and prevent proper NAD+ binding. Other mutations that exist are due to incorrect polypeptide folding. L405 (leucine located at residue 405) located in the substrate binding domain of the hydratase 2 unit, plays an important role in binding CoA ester moiety. One mutation seen in D-BP deficiency patients is caused by a leucine to proline substitution. This breaks the hydrophobic interactions necessary for proper substrate binding with CoA esters.  Diagnosis  The most common clinical observations of patients suffering from D-bifunctional protein deficiency include hypotonia, facial and skull dysmorphism, neonatal seizures, and neuronal demyelination. High levels of branched fatty acids, such as pristinic acid, bile acid intermediates, and other D-BP substrates are seen to exist. Reduced pristinic acid β-oxidation is a common indicator of D-BP deficiency. D-BP can be distinguished from Zellweger Syndrome by normal plasmalogen synthesis. Recent studies in D-BP knockout mice show compensatory upregulation of other peroxisomal enzymes in absence of D-BP such as palmitoyl-CoA oxidase, peroxisomal thiolase, and branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase.

The changes are often unexpected, unexplained or not understandable due to various types of cultural dynamics. English speaking migrant children in educational and cultural transition. Curtin University of Technology. (Thesis) Studies into cultural dissonance take on a wide socio-cultural scope of analysis that inquire into economics, politics, values, learning styles, cultural factors, such as language, tradition, ethnicity, cultural heritage, cultural history, educational formats, classroom design, and even socio- cultural issues such as ethnocentrism, racism and their respective historical legacies in the cultures. Research Research topics in cultural dissonance tend to be interdisciplinary drawing from a wide range of disciplines and applying the findings to equally diverse fields and industries. Edward J. Hedican wrote an article in the Department of Sociology & Anthropology at the University of Guelph, Ontario. In it he noted the possibility of alleviating acculturative pressures, and their disruptive effects on the sense of aboriginal sense of worth and identity. He proposed, \\"...the development of interethnic communication or ethnopolitics of community competence. This, in turn, will lead to increased native control over educational, economic, & political institutions, decreased cultural dissonance, & a more positive native identity.\\" (Hedican) Paul Bohannan wrote an \\"anthropological treatise\\" outlining \\"Seven organizing principles unique to humans: contract, role, ranking property, markets, networks, & public relations. These characteristics are built on to analyze dyads, triads, & chains, to show how innovation, as well as how cultural dissonance can lead to cultural traps.\\" (Bohannan)  Education  Winifred L. Macdonald concluded in her thesis that, \\"... shared markers of language and ethnicity were not sufficient to ensure that the cultural differences in education systems were not experienced by the families.\\" Macdonald also observed that cultural dissonance is sometimes said to inhibit socio-cultural adaptation. Susan Black, an education research consultant, wrote an article in the American School Board Journal of the National School Board Association that summarized some of the actions recommended by some researchers in education-related cultural dissonance. The recommendations for educators included: # Recognize ethnocentrism # Know and understand the student's cultural heritage # Understand social, economic and political issues and values in different cultures # Adopt the attitude that students—all students—can learn # Create genuinely caring classrooms where all students are appreciated and accepted. Other general findings include: *Geneva Gay (University of Washington in Seattle, Washington), proposed that differences can erupt into cultural clashes *Researchers at the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory notes that many anecdotal case studies show how culturally responsive practices improve students' behavior and achievement.Black, Susan. American School Board Journal; Jan 2006, Vol. 193 Issue 1, p34-36, 3p  Second-generation immigrants  In their book Children of Immigration, Carola and Marcelo Suárez-Orozco discuss dissonance as it relates to Latinos in the United States.Carola and Marcelo Suárez- Orozco, \\"Children of Immigration\\", Harvard University Press, 2001 Suarez Orozco found that second-generation Hispanics face more acute forms of cultural dissonance than their first generation parents. They also noticed that second-generation individuals also face \\"special difficulties\\" that lead to \\"three general patterns of adjustment\\" # attempts to synthesize two cultural traditions # passing as a member of the dominant group # developing of defensive identity such as gang membership  Refugees of war  Suárez- Orozco also compared the experience of exiles from Cuba being reunited with family members with the \\"...alienated refugees from war-torn Central America...\\" as they worked through their own adjustment issues, and concluded that Central Americans had to deal with more cultural dissonance than their Cuban counterparts.  Law enforcement  Larry A. Gould wrote a paper for Northern Arizona University \\"his research reports on the link between feelings of spirituality & how Navajo police officers tend to enforce European-based law. Previous research suggests that a link exists between the officers' depth of feeling of spirituality & the officers' attitude toward the effectiveness traditional methods of social control; however, this research goes a step further & examines the impact of cultural dissonance on the stressors faced by Navajo police officers. The enforcement behavior of the Navajo officers was used as a proxy for the intensity of their feelings concerning the usefulness of traditional vs European-based forces of social control; the underlying assumption being tested is that self-determination is not only a state of law but a state of psychological being. A snowball method of sample development was used to select officers for intensive interviews. The findings suggest that the officers' feeling of spiritual connectedness to his/her culture is inversely related to the strictness of the enforcement of European-based laws. In other words, the more spiritual the officer, the less likely the officer is to rely solely on European-based laws, & the greater the reliance on other methods of problems solving. The finding also suggest that in addition to the stressors normally encounter by all police officers, Navajo officers faced additional stressors that are specific to indigenous officers policing in indigenous communities. 1 Table, 41 References. Adapted from the source document.\\" (Gould)  In sports  Tracy Taylor wrote a paper for the Journal of Sport and Social Issues. In it she wrote \\"...This research investigates issues of cultural diversity & inclusiveness in women's netball in Australia using the rhetoric of exclusion. Women & girls from culturally diverse backgrounds spoke of reinforced difference & cultural assimilation in their netball experiences. Women born in other English-speaking countries recalled feelings of inclusion & limited cultural dissonance & indicated that netball helped them feel as part of their new community & gain social capital via participation. Although experiences of explicit exclusion or racial discrimination were virtually nonreported, some women felt a strong sense of cultural conformity to Anglo-centric expectations of behavior. The women's stories & experiences suggest that women from culturally diverse backgrounds have found few opportunities to express their cultural distinctiveness through mainstream Australian sports such as netball. The conclusion reached after this examination is that the rhetoric of exclusion is pervasive in Australian netball & unlikely to change in the near future. 1 Table, 76 References.

(The 1991–92 and 1949-50 squads are tied for the most victories.) When the Grizzlies defeated Weber State in the Big Sky Tournament final on March 16, 2013, it was their 93rd win over the last four seasons – a school record. Tinkle was recognized for the Grizzlies' success in 2012, as he was named the NABC Division I All- District 6 \\"Coach of the Year\\" by NABC. In 2010–11, he guided Montana to a 21–11 record and a berth in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) tournament. In 2009–10, the Griz went 22–10, won the league's tourney and advanced to the NCAAs, but lost by five points to New Mexico. Tinkle went to the NCAA tournament six times at Montana: three as the head coach and three as an assistant (2002 against Oregon (head coach Don Holst), 2005 vs. Washington, and 2006 against Nevada and Boston College with mentor Larry Krystkowiak). Oregon State On May 19, 2014, Tinkle left for Oregon State of the Pac–12 Conference.

Serving as its executive director, Hamlin’s goal in creating the Festival was \\"to unite black theatre companies in America to ensure the survival of the genre into the next millennium\\". Held biennially since 1989 for six days, the NBTF showcases the best in African- American theater. Beginnings As he was doing research for a magazine article in the late 1980s, Hamlin discovered a disconnect between the number of black theatre companies at that time. He concluded that a festival could serve as a method to bring these companies together, and he contacted renowned author and poet Maya Angelou for support. Together, they raised $500,000 in grants and contributions to finance the festival's operating costs. The first Festival attracted 10,000 people and offered 30 different performances by 17 of America’s best professional black theatre companies. Its theme was \\"An International Celebration and Reunion of Spirit\\". Angelou served as the Festival's first chairperson, and other prominent African-American performers lent their professional and financial support. It was covered by both the national and international media with wide acclaim. Challenges The NBTF has been successful, but not without difficulties. In 2001, the Festival faced serious financial troubles that threatened its existence. Several funding sources reduced support and the budget for the Festival was left with a $300,000 deficit. In spite of this setback, Hamlin did not cancel the festival and was able to raise enough money to compensate the loss. He believed that African-American theatre was important and was able to make his dream a success. Today The NBTF brings nearly 60,000 people to Winston-Salem. In addition to over 100 theatrical performances, highlights of the Festival are the Opening Night Gala, the Readers' Theatre of New Works, the Youth/Celebrity Project, International Colloquia, the International Vendor's Market, a poetry slam, and various workshops and seminars. More than 50 celebrities can be expected to attend the Festival during its run. The 2007 festival was the first without the direct guidance of Hamlin, who died on June 6, 2007; organizers continued preparations though his presence was missed.Winston-Salem Journal: \\"Founder of National Black Theatre Festival dies\\", June 6, 2007.

His teams are known for pressing and playing an unconventional match-up zone, a highly successful variation of the defensive system employed by coach Rick Pitino at Louisville. Coaching career As an assistant / Junior College head coach After graduating from Morehead State University in 1993, Tyndall began coaching at the junior college level. From 1994 to 1996, he was assistant coach at Iowa Central Community College. Tyndall had his first head coaching position in the 1996–97 season at St. Catharine College in Springfield, Kentucky. Tyndall led St. Catharine to a 30–5 record and the school's first-ever NJCAA tournament appearance. In 1997, Tyndall earned NJCAA Region 7 National Coach of the Year and Kentucky Junior College Coach of the Year honors. After his season at St. Catharine, Tyndall got his first NCAA Division I coaching position as an assistant at LSU under John Brady, a position he would hold from 1997 to 2001. Tyndall helped LSU finish first in the SEC West Division in the 1999–00 season and make the Sweet 16 round of the 2000 NCAA Tournament. This LSU team also featured Stromile Swift, the #2 pick in the 2000 NBA draft. In the 2001–02 season, Tyndall served as associate head coach at Idaho under Leonard Perry. From 2002 to 2006, Tyndall was associate head coach at Middle Tennessee under Kermit Davis. Middle Tennessee had winning seasons all four of those seasons. Morehead State (2006-2012) In his first Division I head coaching job, Tyndall served as head coach at his alma mater Morehead State from 2006 to 2012. Morehead State under Tyndall won the Ohio Valley Conference tournaments of 2009 and 2011 and earned automatic NCAA Tournament bids those years. Morehead State also made the 2010 College Basketball Invitational. In August 2010, the NCAA placed Morehead State on two years' probation for violations by boosters.Volunteers fire Donnie Tyndall. ESPN, 2015-03-27. As a #13 seed, Morehead State upset #4 seed Louisville 62-61 in the first round of the 2011 NCAA Tournament. Southern Miss (2012-2014) Tyndall was the head coach at the Southern Miss from 2012 to 2014. Southern Miss made the National Invitation Tournament in 2013 and 2014 and finished first in Conference USA standings for the 2013–14 season. Tyndall went 56–17 as head coach at Southern Miss, but in 2016, the NCAA vacated all 56 wins due to academic fraud. Tennessee (2014-2015) On April 22, 2014, Tyndall was hired as head basketball coach at the University of Tennessee, after spending the previous two seasons as the head basketball coach at Southern Miss. On March 27, 2015, Tennessee fired Tyndall after the NCAA notified Tennessee officials of possible major violations at Southern Miss. The violations centered around improper financial aid for two players, as well as academic problems with junior college transfers. According to a copy of Tyndall's termination letter, Tyndall had lied to Tennessee officials about the extent of the violations on several occasions, and had also deleted several emails from an old email account dating to his time at Morehead State even though he was aware he would have been questioned about activity on that account by the NCAA. Athletics director Dave Hart said that in all likelihood, Tyndall would have faced significant discipline from the NCAA for his role in the violations at Southern Miss. Former coach Bruce Pearl had been slapped with an eight-game suspension during what proved to be his final season in Knoxville for major recruiting violations, and Tennessee didn't want a repeat of that experience. Hart said that he would have never hired Tyndall had the true extent of the violations at Southern Miss been known. On April 8, 2016, the NCAA imposed a 10-year show-cause penalty on Tyndall, to run until April 7, 2026 – tied for the longest ever imposed on a head coach. This means that any NCAA member school that wants to hire him during this period will have to \\"show cause\\" for why it shouldn't be sanctioned for doing so, and could incur severe penalties if he commits another violation during this time. It also stipulates that any penalties imposed on Tyndall will follow him to any NCAA member school if he is ever hired again. According to the NCAA, Tyndall told his assistants to complete papers for players, and also arranged payments to players and tried to cover them up. The NCAA deemed Tyndall's violations to be as egregious as those committed by Dave Bliss at Baylor 16 years earlier; Bliss is the only other head coach to be slapped with a 10-year show-cause. In an unprecedented move, the NCAA required any NCAA member school who hires Tyndall during his show-cause to suspend him from coaching duties--effectively banning him from coaching at any NCAA member school until the end of the 2025–26 season. This was very unusual since Tyndall would have likely found it difficult to return to the collegiate ranks in any event while his show-cause was in effect. A show-cause usually has the effect of blackballing a coach from the collegiate ranks at least for the duration of the show-cause; most schools will not even consider hiring a coach with such a severe penalty on his record. In another unusual move, the NCAA decreed that if Tyndall ever coaches again at an NCAA member school after the show-cause runs out, he must sit out the first half of the first season after his return.2016 infractions report USA Today called it the most severe penalty that the NCAA has ever meted out to a head coach. As a professional coach On November 4, 2016, Tyndall was hired by the Toronto Raptors to be an assistant coach on their development team, Raptors 905. Toronto Raptors head coach Dwane Casey was fired in May 2018 and was then hired as the head coach of the Detroit Pistons; Tyndall then took an assistant coaching role with Grand Rapids Drive, the development team for the Pistons. After one season, he was promoted to head coach of the Drive for the 2019–20 season.  Return to College  On June 17, Tyndall was hired by Chipola College as the head men’s basketball coach. Tyndall replaced Brendan Foley who became an assistant at Buffalo. Head coaching record Junior college College Southern Miss's original records were 27–10 (12–4, 2nd in C-USA) in 2012–13 and 29–7 (13–3, 1st in C-USA) in 2013–14. However, all 56 wins from those seasons were vacated by the NCAA due to participation of academically ineligible players.

Echinacea laevigata (smooth coneflower) determined to be endangered. Federal Register October 8, 1992. of plant found in the piedmont of the eastern United States. Most populations are found on roadsides and other open areas with plenty of sunlight, often on calcium- and magnesium- rich soils. Its current range is within the states of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, and it was historically also found in Pennsylvania and Maryland. It has been rare as long as it has been known, but a number of human activities and associated processes have reduced its range further.Echinacea laevigata. Center for Plant Conservation. Today there are about 100 occurrences, and many of these are in poor condition.Echinacea laevigata. The Nature Conservancy. The amount of appropriate habitat available for this plant has been greatly reduced and it continues to decline. Echinacea laevigata is a rhizomatous perennial herb that resembles its close relative, the common echinacea (Echinacea purpurea). The two can be told apart by the leaves, which are cordate (heart-shaped) in the common species. E. laevigata grows up to about 1.5 meters (5 feet) in height with a mostly naked, smooth, leafless stem. Any leaves are roughly lance- shaped. On top of the stem is a flower head containing narrow pink or purplish ray florets up to 8 centimeters (3.2 inches) long.USFWS. Smooth Coneflower Recovery Plan. April 1995. The florets droop away from the center of the head. The small, tubular disc florets in the center are dark purple. Blooming occurs in May through July. The plant is pollinated by a number of insects, including honeybee (Apis mellifera), bumblebees (Bombus spp.), the bees Psithyrus citrinus and Xylocopa virginica, a number of butterflies, and Lygaeus kalmii, a bug.Gadd, L. E. (2006). Pollination biology of the federally endangered Echinacea laevigata, smooth coneflower, in small, isolated populations. Master's thesis, North Carolina State University. pg 13. The fruit is an achene about half a centimeter long which is likely dispersed by birds and small mammals that collect them for food. Some vegetative reproduction has been observed with more than one stem coming from a shared rhizome or aboveground rosette of leaves. The natural habitat for Echinacea laevigata is sunny openings in forested habitat. Open areas of this kind were made by wildfire, fires set by Native Americans, and the grazing activity of animals. The plant's preferred soils are rich in calcium and magnesium, and include limestone and marble, gabbro, and diabase. Plants that share the habitat included eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) and rattlesnake master (Eryngium yuccifolium). There are several species of oak that occur, but these are stunted such that sunlight reaches the understory. When human impacts began to reduce the amount of forest habitat remaining in the region, the plant survived in other open, sunny habitat types, such as cedar barrens, clearcuts, roadsides, cleared areas around utility equipment, and limestone bluffs. Two thirds of the populations known since the plant was first discovered are now gone. Echinacea laevigata at the National Arboretum in Washington, DC. Populations of Echinacea laevigata were lost when the habitat was destroyed, or when it was degraded as natural processes of disturbance were prevented. The plant requires open habitat where it can receive sunlight. When fire suppression is practiced, the habitat becomes overgrown, and the open areas close; this has led to the extirpation of a number of historical populations. Habitat was destroyed outright during development, agricultural operations, road construction, and installation of utilities such as gas lines. Continuing threats to Echinacea laevigata include further destruction and degradation of the land, collecting of the plant by flora enthusiasts, vandalism, herbicides, and exotic plant species. When the plant was listed as an endangered species in 1992, most of the populations were small, with many containing fewer than 100 plants each, and half were located on roadsides where they are vulnerable to destruction. There is a fear that this plant may be targeted for commercial harvest in the pharmaceutical echinacea trade, but there is little evidence of this threat so far. Echinacea laevigata habitat loss due to off-roading activities Conservation efforts underway include research on the most effective method of restoring the natural cycle of disturbance to the land, for example, by initiating controlled burns.Echinacea laevigata.

The Ming court presented Siam (Thailand) nineteen thousand items of ceramic ware. Three years later it is also noted that the court presented Cambodia with an unspecified quantity of ceramic items. We can assume that the number of items was significant also and the time period for such exchanged continued at least through the early Ming dynastic period.

Normally, the prothrombin precursor undergoes post- translational carboxylation (addition of a carboxylic acid group) by gamma- glutamyl carboxylase in the liver prior to secretion into plasma. DCP/PIVKA-II may be detected in people with deficiency of vitamin K (due to poor nutrition or malabsorption) and in those taking warfarin or other medication that inhibits the action of vitamin K. Diagnostic use Hepatocellular carcinoma A 1984 study first described the use of DCP as a marker of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); it was present in 91% of HCC patients, while not being detectable in other liver diseases. The DCP level did not change with the administration of vitamin K, suggesting a defect in gamma- carboxylation activity rather than vitamin K deficiency. A number of subsequent studies have since confirmed this phenomenon. A 2007 comparison of various HCC tumor markers found DCP the least sensitive to risk factors for HCC (such as cirrhosis), and hence the most useful in predicting HCC. It differentiates HCC from non-malignant liver diseases. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that a combined analysis of DCP and Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) can lead to a better prediction in early stages of HCC. Despite many years of use in Japan, only did a 2003 American study reevaluate its use in an American patient series. It also identified HCC at an earlier stage.

Williams married Corey Norman in 2000. They have two daughters (Addyson and Zera) and two sons (Calvin and Mason). Referring to his boundless energy, his coaches at Navarro College nicknamed him Buzz. Marquette Williams coached Marquette to a 25–10 record in the 2008–09 season, where they lost to the Missouri Tigers in the Second Round of the 2009 NCAA Tournament. He coached Marquette to a 22–12 record in the 2009–10 season, which ended with a close loss to the 11th-seeded Washington Huskies in the First Round of the 2010 NCAA Tournament. During the 2010–11 campaign, Williams led the Golden Eagles back to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 2003. His team went 22–15 including a 9–9 Big East Conference record. They lost in the quarterfinals of the 2011 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament to Louisville. Marquette received an at-large bid in the 2011 NCAA Tournament. There they defeated Xavier in the second round (formerly the First Round) and Syracuse in the Third Round to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. In the Sweet Sixteen, they were defeated by No. 7-ranked and No. 2-seeded North Carolina. Wiliams' 2012 team returned to the NCAA Tournament after finishing second in the Big East regular season, finishing 14–4 in conference play. As a No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament, they defeated BYU and Murray State to advance to their second straight Sweet Sixteen. There, they lost to No. 7-seeded Florida. After winning a share of the Big East Men's regular season championship, Marquette received an at-large bid in the 2013 NCAA Tournament as a No. 3 seed. There, they earned come-from-behind victories over Davidson in the Second Round and Butler in the Third Round. In the Sweet Sixteen, the school's third straight under Williams, they defeated ACC regular season and conference champion Miami to earn a trip to Williams's first Elite Eight, where they lost to Syracuse. The 2013–14 season was Williams' worst at Marquette, finishing 17–15 with a loss to Xavier in the Big East Tournament. Virginia Tech Williams was named the head basketball coach at Virginia Tech on March 21, 2014, replacing James Johnson. The move had critics questioning why would he leave Marquette for Virginia Tech, \\"one of the country’s toughest rebuilding projects.\\" Williams left behind a program at Marquette, which had only nine scholarship players – none taller than 6'7\\" – for new coach Steve Wojciechowski. In Williams' first season, the Hokies finished 15th in the ACC with a 2–16 conference record, matching the lowest ACC win total in Virginia Tech history. However, with several true freshmen playing a significant number of minutes, a young nucleus was established. Expectations grew further when Williams landed commitments from Maryland transfer Seth Allen, and Zach LeDay from South Florida. Both became eligible in the 2015–16 season. After a slow start to the season, the team quickly improved. On January 4, 2016, the Hokies defeated their in-state rival and 4th ranked Virginia at home, marking Williams' biggest win at Virginia Tech to date. The team had continued success in the ACC, ending the regular season with another upset of a top-10 rival, this time 7th ranked Miami. Williams' Hokies finished the regular season at 10–8 in ACC conference play; an improvement of eight wins from the previous year. The Hokies would receive an invite to the 2016 NIT where they advanced to the second round before losing to BYU. On July 13, 2016, Virginia Tech and Williams agreed to a contract extension through the 2022–23 season.

On January 29, 2017, Williams earned his 200th career win as a head coach with a win against Boston College in Blacksburg. After going 5–6 in their first 11 ACC games, the Hokies defeated No. 12 Virginia in double overtime, marking Williams' fourth victory over a top-15 team in the past two years. The Hokies parlayed their success with a trip to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2007. As the No. 9 seed, they lost in the First Round to Wisconsin.

During conference play, Justin Robinson sustained a toe injury that kept him out of over half of the Hokies' conference games. Despite these major setbacks, Williams led the Hokies to a 23-7 regular season with 12 wins in the ACC, the most in program history. In addition, Virginia Tech received the fourth seed in the east bracket of the 2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, tied for the highest seed in program history. After the Hokies defeated Saint Louis University in the first round and Liberty University in the second round, Williams earned a bid to the Sweet 16, the program's first bid since 1967. In their Sweet 16 matchup the Hokies faced ACC rival Duke, a team they defeated earlier in the season. Duke prevailed over Virginia Tech after a missed last second shot by senior Ahmed Hill.

He is recognized as a pioneer in the integration of live performance and interactive digital technology. With choreographer Dawn Stoppiello he is co-founder of Troika Ranch, a New York City based performance group that integrates music, dance, theater and interactive digital media in its performance works. He is also the creator of Isadora, a flexible media manipulation tool that provides interactive control over digital video and sound. Career A native of Nebraska, his career began with a five-year tenure as a producer for American Gramaphone Records, during which time he received a performance of his work by the London Symphony Orchestra. He studied at the California Institute of the Arts with electronic music pioneer Morton Subotnick and received his degree in music composition in 1989. He taught courses in Interactive Music and was on the staff of the Center for Experiments in Art, Information and Technology at CalArts from 1990 to 1994. He also worked as an assistant to film composer Danny Elfman before leaving Los Angeles for New York City in 1994. Coniglio’s work with Stoppiello has been recognized with several honors. Their evening-length work Future of Memory was awarded a 2003 Dance Audience Bessie Award, an honorary mention at the 2004 Prix Ars Electronica Cyberarts Competition, and a 2005 “Eddy” Award from Live Design Magazine in New York City. Coniglio is a two-time recipient of the Digital Artists Fellowship at Dance Theater Workshop, and was selected to facilitate that program in 2005. Recent collaborations outside Troika Ranch include creating video environments for Laurie Anderson's new \\"Homeland\\" concert in New York City, serving as video artist for the production of \\"Die Süße unserer traurigen Kindheit\\" by composer Hans Tutschku, and creating a wireless camera system for choreographer Judith Jamison for a performance by Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater Programming Coniglio remains particularly interested in creating custom interactive systems that allow the movements or vocalizations of dancers to manipulate video, sound, and light in real-time. His first technological breakthrough in this area came in 1989 when he created MidiDancer, a wireless system that measured the angular change at several joints on the dancer's body, allowing the performer interactively control music. He later collaborated with Morton Subotnick to create Interactor, a graphic programming tool that allowed real time manipulate of MIDI audio and other digital media. He continued this process when he created Isadora. Initially created solely to realize the works of Troika Ranch, Isadora is currently in use by hundreds of artists worldwide to facilitate the creation of their interactive performance works or installations.

Summary The theatre was a focal point in the community for close to 40 years. Competition from television caused the theatre to close its doors in the late 1960s. It was later reopened as the Golden Leaf Restaurant and remained in operation until the late 1990s. Converted back into a theatre, the historic building is now known as the Backstage Capitol and is the home of a local dance and theatre groups. Delhi's Backstage Capitol Theatre, with its superior acoustics and intimate setting, attracts audiences and performers alike from all over North America. Open year-round, the theatre not only plays host to children's programs, live performances and concerts, it is also a sought after venue for weddings and other private functions with its European courtyard setting. Thousands of people looking for a unique venue have walked through the doors of the Theatre. Re-opened in 2008, the theatre has quickly become one of Norfolk's most popular destinations.

They allow a teacher to listen to and manage student audio, which is delivered to individual students through headsets or in isolated 'sound booths.' Language labs were common in schools and universities in the United States in the two decades following World War II. They have now largely been replaced by self access language learning centers, which may be called 'language labs.' History The first recorded language lab was established at the University of Grenoble in 1908. Frank Chalfant brought the concept to the United States, establishing a 'phonetics lab' at Washington State University in 1911 or 1912. These early language labs used phonographs to deliver audio, and were not yet divided into individual booths . In the 1940s, linguists at the University of Michigan developed the behaviorist audio-lingual method of foreign language learning. This method relied on repeated listening and speaking drills. This method increased in popularity in the United States and Canada into the 1950s and 1960s. Language labs were well-suited to the audio-lingual method. By 1958, there were over 300 language labs in the US, with the majority in colleges and universities.. In 1958, the National Defense Education Act authorized federal financial assistance for American secondary school foreign language programs. This led to the rapid creation of new language labs. By the mid-1960s, there were an estimated 10,000 secondary-level and 4,000 post-secondary language labs in the United States. Once NDEA funding ended in 1969, the number of traditional language laboratories declined rapidly. Usage of the audio-lingual method also declined following Noam Chomsky's criticism of behaviorist models of language learning. From the 1950s to the 1990s, most used tape-based systems. Current language labs generally contain multimedia PCs. Layout The 'traditional' language laboratory consisted of a teacher console networked to multiple stations for individual students. The teacher console typically included a tape recorder to play the instructional recording, a headset and system of switches to enable the teacher to monitor either the audio being played or an individual student, and a microphone for communicating with students. Each student station generally included a student tape recorder, headset, and microphone. The tape recorder both enabled recording of students' spoken responses and allowed them to record instructional content for later independent study . All but the most simple or first generation laboratories allow the teacher to remotely control the tape transport controls of the student booths (record, stop, rewind etc.) from the master desk. This allows for easy distribution of the master programme material, which is often copied at high speed onto the student positions for later use by the students at their own pace. Better tape laboratories housed the tape machine behind a protective plate (leaving only a control panel accessible to the students) or locked the cassette door. This kept the expensive and sensitive decks free from student misuse and dust etc. Operation Once the master program had been transferred onto the student recorders, the teacher would then hand over control of the decks to the students. By pressing the record key in the booth, the student would simultaneously hear the playback of the program whilst being able to record his or her voice in the pauses, using the microphone. This is known as an audio active-comparative system. From a technological point of view, this overdubbing was made possible by use of a two-channel tape recorder Problems Russian language class in an East German language laboratory (1975) Language laboratories in the 1970s and 1980s received a bad reputation due to breakdowns. Common problems stem from the limitations and relative complexity of the reel to reel tape system in use at that time. Design played a part too; the simplest language laboratories had no electronic systems in place for the teacher to remotely control the tape decks, relying on the students to operate the decks correctly. Many had no way to stop the tape running off the reel in fast rewind or forward wind, which meant time wasting and greater chances of failure through misuse. The tape recorders in use after the early 1970s in the language laboratory were more complex than those in the home, being capable of multitracking and electronic remote control. As a result, they often had several motors and relays, complex transistorised circuitry and needed a variety of voltages to run. They had many rubber parts such as idlers and drive belts which would perish and wear out. Bulbs in the control panels were also in continual need of replacement. Since the student booth tapes were not normally changed from one class to the next but were recorded over each time, these would eventually wear, and shed their oxide on the tape heads leading to poor sound and tangling. The installations were usually maintained under contract by service engineers, but these often served a county or similar wide area, and would only call at three-monthly intervals. This meant that if several booths malfunctioned, then for much of that time the laboratory was out of action. Change of media A modern language laboratory control center Starting in the 1980s, many schools transformed their old language labs into computer suites. However, the advent of affordable multimedia capable PCs in the late 1990s led to a resurgence and transformation of the language laboratory with software and hard drives in place of reels of analogue tape. In the 1990s new digital, hybrid PC based systems allowed extended functionality, in terms of better \\"management' of student / teacher audio with some levels of internet and video formats. Media is 'managed' on these hybrid systems by language lab providers creating a supplementary network over and above the existing PC network for audio connections and communications in fixed locations. These hybrid systems are not without problems, mainly associated with hardware issues as the manufacturers of these hybrid systems have to replace parts and separate cabling. This both adds to the complexity of the product and has a cost implication via manufacturer annual ‘service’ fees. Present day Student terminals and headphones Today all the major manufacturers say they have a ‘digital’ or a ‘just software’ solution. However, in many cases they still rely on proprietary networks or expensive sound cards to successfully deliver their media. There are very few truly software only solutions that just rely on installing designated language lab software onto a network and then directing just the original network to manage the media between teacher and student, student and student or student back to teacher. In the past the quality of school, or university networks may have meant that the speed that the media could be delivered on ‘software only’ labs would have meant a ‘lag’ in the audio feed. These days all professionally run networks are able to work with these ‘software only’ language lab solutions and deliver media synchronously. Software only systems can be easily installed onto an existing PC-based network, making them both multi locational in their access and much more feature rich in how and what media they manage. The content that is now used in the new language labs is much richer and self authored or free: now not just audio, but video, flash-based games, internet etc. and the speed and variety of the delivery of media from teacher to student, student to teacher, is much quicker and therefore much more engaging for both teacher and student. Further developments in language labs are now apparent as access moves from a fixed network and related Microsoft operating systems to online and browsers. Students can now access and work from these new 'cloud' labs from their own devices at any time and anywhere. Students can interrogate and record audio and video files and be marked and assessed by their teachers remotely. Digital language labs The principle of a language lab essentially has not changed. They are still a teacher-controlled system connected to a number of student booths, containing a student's control mechanism and a headset with a microphone. Digital language labs had the same principle. A software-only language lab changes the concept of where and what a language lab is. Software can be installed and accessed on any networked PC anywhere on a school, college, or university campus. Software-only systems can be located in one room, from room-to-room or campus-to-campus.The latest form of the Digital Language was brought out in the year 2000 from India. Orell has been the leading pioneer of Digital language labs from then on. Functionality The levels of functionality of current language labs vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. All labs will have a level of teacher control to manage student licenses / desktops. The more sophisticated ‘software only’ labs have a higher level of teacher management and control over the student desktop. One of the key differences with the ‘high end’ ‘software only’ products is their ability to work ‘live’ with the students as they record and work with media. So instead of waiting to correct student recordings after they have been recorded and collected back it is now possible for a teacher to work synchronously and ‘live’ with students on their own, in pairs and in groups, thus enhancing the immediacy of the teaching and learning experience. The next generation digital language labs allow teachers to monitor, control, deliver, group, display, review and collect, audio, video and web-based multimedia content. The student player is linked to the teacher console and can play audio, video and web- based formats. Students can rewind, stop, start, go back to last silence, record, fast forward, repeat phrase and bookmark.

He was named the 18th coach in University of Colorado men's basketball history on April 19, 2010Colorado Buffaloes hire Tad Boyle as coach - ESPN replacing Jeff Bzdelik. Boyle was named as an assistant coach for USA Basketball a second time in 2015http://northdenvernews.com/buffs-tad-boyle- named-to-usa-basketball-coaching-crew/ He played collegiately at Kansas under coach Ted Owens and Hall of Fame coach Larry Brown. While playing for the Jayhawks, Boyle played on two NCAA Tournament teams in 1984 and 1985. He served as team captain his senior year, which was 1988 NBA Draft choice Danny Manning's freshman season and University of Maryland coach Mark Turgeon's sophomore season. Before heading to play collegiately at Kansas, Boyle was a standout performer at Greeley Central High School, where he led the Wildcats to a state championship as a senior in 1981 and earned Colorado Player of the Year honors, as well as being selected to the Converse All-American team. His high school jersey was retired at the conclusion of his senior season.Tad Boyle CUBUFFS.com BIO - Playing career Boyle played collegiately for legendary coach Larry Brown at Kansas (1981–85). He was a member of two NCAA Tournament teams (1984, 1985) and was part of the 1984 Big Eight Tournament championship squad. As a senior, Boyle captained the Jayhawks, which featured freshman Danny Manning, who three years later led the Jayhawks to the NCAA Championship. Coaching career Early days After earning a bachelor of science degree in business administration from Kansas in 1985, he became a commodities broker in Kansas City.Woodling, Chuck. \\"Armed with degree, Boyle to tackle commodities business\\" Lawrence Journal-World, March 13, 1985. In 1986 he returned to Colorado and continued his career as a Commodities Broker, when Boyle also got back into basketball and went on to serve for six years as a high school basketball coach at various Colorado programs. He was the sophomore basketball coach at Greeley West High School for a year and then was an assistant coach at Loveland High School for two years. From there, he served at Longmont High School for three years. A car accident in 1994 changed Boyle's career forever. Boyle was heading to work one morning when somebody ran a red light and plowed into his vehicle at the intersection of McCaslin Boulevard and South Boulder Road in Louisville, Colorado. The collision crushed the front of Boyle's car. He was knocked unconscious, but the air bag likely saved his life. At that point, Boyle was earning six figures as a stockbroker and considered his \\"other\\" job, as head coach at Longmont High, to be little more than a hobby. Later that year, Boyle received a phone call from his former University of Kansas teammate, Mark Turgeon, the current Maryland coach, then an assistant at Oregon. Turgeon stated that there was an opening on Oregon's staff, but it was a restricted earnings position that earned $16,000 a year. Boyle, not married at the time, decided to take the plunge into a full-time coaching gig.Car accident changed Buffs basketball coach Tad Boyle's destiny Read more: Car accident changed Buffs basketball coach Tad Boyle's destiny - The Denver Post http://www.denverpost.com/cu/ci_14953701 Oregon Boyle coached alongside Turgeon, his former teammate at Kansas, at Oregon under Jerry Green. Beginning in 1994, he spent three seasons in Eugene, helping the Ducks to the 1995 NCAA Tournament and the 1997 National Invitational Tournament. Tennessee In 1997, Boyle followed Green to Tennessee, where he was director of basketball operations when the Vols won 20 games and advanced to the NCAA Tournament. Jacksonville State Boyle reconnected with Turgeon the following year, this time as an assistant coach at Jacksonville State (Ala.), where they helped turn a team that was 8–18 into a 17–11 squad in just one season. Wichita State Boyle spent six seasons as an assistant coach at Wichita State and was part of another turn around that saw the Shockers improve from 9–19 (.321) his first year there to one of the nation's top mid-major teams in 2006 when Wichita State went 26–9 and advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament. The Shockers eventually lost to Final Four Cinderella George Mason in the regional semifinals, but not before they had secured the No. 21 ranking in the final collegiate polls. Northern Colorado A Greeley, Colorado, native, Boyle was named the 17th coach in UNC history on April 25, 2006. At that point, the Bears were in the midst of a transition to Division I in its first season as a member of the Big Sky Conference. Northern Colorado finished 4–24 in his first season when squad finished last nationally in the final RPI rankings for that season. There were, however, flashes of times to come that season, including close losses to both Colorado (88–86) and Colorado State (75–66). Over the next two seasons at UNC, he improved the team's win total from four to 13 and then 14. The Bears defeated Colorado State, 72–59, in his second season and also knocked off San Diego State, 72–59. The Aztecs were ranked among the nation's top 50 teams in the RPI rankings at that time. In year three, the Bears had improved from one conference win his first season to an even 8–8 mark and earned the school's first Division I post season trip, to the Big Sky Conference Tournament. It all came together for Boyle in his fourth season in Greeley, as the Bears advanced to the post season for the first time in school history, advancing to the quarterfinals of the CollegeInsiders.com Tournament while racking up a school record 25 victories. He coached one first-team All-Big Sky member and also the Big Sky Conference Defensive Player of the Year. Prior to his arrival to Boulder, he guided the Bears to a 56–66 record (.459) in four seasons, including a breakout season in 2009–10, when the Bears were 25–8 (.758) and finished second in the Big Sky Conference. For his efforts, he was awarded the NABC Division I All-District Coach of the Year, the Big Sky Coach of the Year by both The Sporting News and CollegeInsider.com, where he was also named a finalist for the National Mid-Major Coach of the Year award.Tad Boyle CUBUFFS.com BIO Colorado \\"This is it (my dream job), there’s no doubt,\\" Boyle said after being named head coach on April 19, 2010. \\"I remember talking with (Maryland men's head coach) Mark Turgeon once when he asked me where I wanted to be in 10 years, and I said the head coach at the University of Colorado. This is a destination job. I'm humbled and honored.\\" In his first season (2010–11), Boyle began to set the standard for exciting things to come, capping the season with a trip to the World's Most Famous Arena - Madison Square Garden and a National Invitation Tournament semifinal appearance. The Buffaloes won a school-record 24 games, including 18 school-best wins at the CU Events Center, establishing one of the best home court advantages in all of college basketball. His initial season saw CU rank fifth nationally in free throw percentage (77.8), 12th in scoring (79.6 ppg) and 19th in field goal percentage (47.3). Boyle earned National Coach of the Week honors (Hoops Report, Jan. 10–16) after leading the Buffs to a 3–0 conference start, including wins over No. 9/8 Missouri and No. 21/20 Kansas State. The win over the Wildcats gave CU its first road win over a nationally ranked opponent since January 1997 (No. 20 Texas Tech). CU defeated four ranked teams, including a 22-point comeback win (second greatest comeback in school history) upsetting No. 5/5 Texas, 91–89. In year two (2011–12), Boyle became the first CU coach to begin the conference season with back-to-back 3–0 starts, and was the first coach since Frosty Cox (1935–36, 1936–37) to win his conference opener in back-to-back years. He also won his 40th game (home win vs. Oregon) in just 61 games tying Cox (1935–39). Boyle continued to make most of his “dream job” a reality for CU fans guiding the Buffaloes to the 2011–12 NCAA Tournament (third round), another 24-win season, and a conference championship in its inaugural season of the Pac-12, winning four games in four days at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. For his efforts, Boyle became the first CU head coach to earn the District 20 Coach of the Year by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), an award voted among his coaching peers. The 48 wins were a school-best in any two-year span of the program. “I’m a believer in Tad Boyle,” said Jay Bilas, ESPN College Basketball Analyst. “He is not only a terrific teacher of the game with great basketball knowledge, he keeps it simple and gives his players an understanding of what you need to do to win, but a firm understanding of how teams lose, too. Boyle has tremendous toughness in him. He is demanding without being demeaning, and he puts his players in position to achieve together without fear of failing. That’s what truly outstanding coaches do, and Tad Boyle is a truly outstanding coach.” In year three (2012–13), Boyle guided the Buffs to another NCAA Tournament appearance, the second year in-a-row, becoming the first CU coach in 50 years to guide the program to back-to-back tournament appearances. CU won 21 games, the third straight season the program eclipsed the 20-win plateau, also a school-first. After the team won their first mid-season tournament since the 2002–03 season, the Charleston Classic, the Buffs reached the nation's Top-25 polls for the first time since 2005–06 (No. 19 AP/USA Today Coaches’ Poll, Nov. 26); AP No. 23 ranked, Nov. 19). Attendance records also set a brand new high standard as the men's basketball team proved to be the best ticket in town setting a number of school records, including seven sellouts; 12 of 15 home games exceeded 10,000 fans or better, in addition to season total (155,884); season average (10,392); conference total (94,371); and conference average (10,486). The attendance surge ranked third nationally among all Division I programs for largest increased average from the previous year. Success continued for Boyle and his coaching staff in year four (2013–14) as the Buffs won 23 games, the third most victories in school history. Another NCAA Tournament followed for a school record third consecutive season, in addition setting a pair of attendance records (season total: 173,429; non- conference total: 84,133). The staff enjoyed their best start to a season in four years (14–2 record) with a No. 15 nationally ranking, the highest a CU team has seen since 1997. In 2014–15, a 16–18 record marked the first time in five years the program failed to notch a winning season, however the Buffaloes reached the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) quarterfinals. The Buffs did defeat NCAA Sweet 16 participant UCLA and the National Invitation Tournament Champion Stanford during the season. Attendance remained steady for the fifth straight year, finishing with third place numbers across the board in all-time marks in season total, season average, and conference total. Conference average was fourth. Overall, Boyle and his CU teams, hold the top five attendance marks in season and conference total, and conference average since 2010–11; and the four of the top five attendance figures in season average. The Buffaloes rebounded nicely in 2015–16, sporting a record of 22–12 and finishing in fifth place in the Pac-12 at 10–8. Boyle led Colorado to 11 straight wins during the nonconference schedule, the fifth longest in program history and best run since 1961–62. Colorado's 21 regular season wins tied a school record – joining the 2013–14 and 1996–97 teams – and 22 overall tied for fourth in the school annals. Colorado reached the NCAA Tournament for the fourth time under Boyle. Boyle's 2016–17 team marked seven-straight years with a postseason tournament appearance; a school record. The Buffaloes were 19–15 overall and 8–10 in the Pac-12, earning a spot in the NIT. Colorado's regular season was highlighted by wins over three ranked teams, including No. 13/14 Xavier and No. 10/10 Oregon, teams that would eventually end up in the Elite Eight and Final Four respectively. In 2017–18, Boyle had the youngest team of his tenure, with nine players that had not played a minute in a Buffaloes' uniform prior to the season. He led Colorado to 17 wins, the program's seventh winning season in the last eight years. Last year's young group had some bright moments including back-to-back wins over Top 15 teams for the first time in program history. Boyle, 55, is entering his ninth year with the Buffaloes and his 166 victories rank third all-time in program history. He owns five of Colorado's nine all-time seasons of 20-plus wins. Boyle is the first CU coach to lead the Buffaloes to seven consecutive postseason appearances and the first to guide the program to three consecutive NCAA Tournaments. His record at the CU Events Center is stellar, leading the Buffaloes to a 113–22 mark at home (.837) over the last eight seasons. He is the first CU coach to win 20 games in each of his first four years. “Tad continues to make Colorado more than relevant,” NCAA.com Basketball Writer Andy Katz said. “He has made them into one of the top teams in the West. Now you can count on Colorado being in play for the top tier in the Pac-12 and an NCAA bid. Colorado may have joined the Pac-12 for football first but the Buffaloes have been a boon in basketball.\\" Boyle has led Colorado to 17 wins over ranked opponents, by far the best in team history. In fact Boyle coached teams, with a record of 17–32, have accounted for 28 percent of the program's wins over ranked opponents (61) since 1949–50. Boyle's postseason success is highlighted by a memorable run of four wins in four days to claim the 2012 Pac-12 Tournament championship. He owns more than half of Colorado's all-time conference tournament wins, with a 13–7 mark in that span (11–6 in the Pac-12, 2–1 in the Big 12). Boyle has led the Buffaloes to a conference semifinal or better three times. He is a perfect 8–0 as Colorado's head coach in the first round of a conference tournament. Overall Boyle's 18 postseason wins and .563 winning percentage (18–14) are tops in Colorado history. Recruiting and Player Development Going into the 2012 off-season Tad has recruited a top 25 class for the first time in CU history. The class included 2 Top-100 recruits in Mater Dei H.S.

Tad rebuffed this interest and stayed at his \\"dream job\\" at CU.CU Buffs' Tad Boyle not leaving for Texas A&M; http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-college-sports/ci_18049230 Following his second season at CU, Boyle continued to draw interest from other programs, and his name was linked with the Nebraska and Kansas State openings, although he once again denied interest in both jobs, stating \\"I want to do something special here at Colorado. I don’t have any interest in other jobs. I would love it if CU were my last job.\\"C-U NEXT YEAR http://www.milehighsports.com/?p=9331 Fan following Under Boyle's leadership, there have been several sell-outs for CU games at Coors Event Center and increased season ticket sales. Several thousand fans also made the trip to Albuquerque for CU-UNLV and CU-Baylor NCAA tournament games. Colorado Athletic Director Mike Bohn responded to increased student interest by flying 50 students, all expenses paid, to Los Angeles for the Pac-12 tournament and taking 100 students to the NCAA tournament games in Albuquerque.Trips for loyal CU Buffs fans cost $67,200 in private donations http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_20210327/trips-loyal-cu-buffs-fans- cost-67-200 After the success of the C-Unit OG 50, Colorado Athletic Director Mike Bohn repeated the trip the following year by taking another group of 50 students on an all-expense-paid trip to Las Vegas for the 2013 Pac-12 tournament. However, the Buffaloes were unable to repeat as champions as they lost in the second round to the eventual runner-up Arizona Wildcats.

He was born in 1830 on the Isle of Corfu off the coast of Greece to British Army Officer Robert Hunt and his wife Margaret. In 1840, the Hunt family moved to Canada, settling in Montreal, Quebec. In 1855 he was commissioned an Ensign, without purchase, in the 6th Foot. In 1853, George married Sarah Selkirk, daughter of William and Allison Selkirk of Montreal. In 1856, George Hunt's cousin Elizabeth married George Selkirk.George and Elizabeth's grandson George Selkirk played for the New York Yankees, and later became the General Manager of the Washington Senators. In 1869, both families traveled together to the unorganized township which was later to be known as Huntsville, Ontario. Captain Hunt built a log cabin on what is now the north corner of Main and John Street, just east of the town swing bridge. Captain Hunt supervised the incoming roadway and directed its course to create what is now the Main Street of Huntsville. He also supervised the extension of the northern highway beyond the town. His voice was instrumental in reversing a provincial government decision to route the northern railroad through either Parry Sound or Hoodstown, and sending it through Huntsville instead, thus securing the industrial expansion which followed and quickly grew the town's population and importance. Captain Hunt was a devout Presbyterian, and was known as a stern teetotaler. Captain Hunt took a prominent role in the first Presbyterian church built in 1873. He also opened the first school, retail store, postal outlet, and legal office. Captain Hunt died in his fifty-second year from complications of pneumonia resulting from Typhoid fever on February 26, 1882. He is buried in the old Madill Church Cemetery just south of Huntsville.

It was the duo's second studio album, and Foxx's third after his return to the music scene in 1997. The album continues along the lines of modern electronics flavoured with early-80s touches that was set out by the duo's 1997 album Shifting City. However, The Pleasures of Electricity is more polished and minimalist than any of Foxx's previous albums (solo or in a group), to the extent that the album sounds almost sterile in places. The lyrics recall themes similar to those in Foxx's classic album Metamatic, dealing with traveling and urban life, including almost bizarre lyrics comparing driving in a car to mathematics in \\"Automobile\\" (all this delivered in Foxx's most deadpan voice). \\"Invisible Women\\" is a track Foxx originally recorded with Nation 12 over a decade earlier (the version here includes a synth riff recycled from Foxx's single \\"Underpass\\" that wasn't included in the Nation 12 version), while \\"Cities of Light 5\\" is a further development of \\"Cities of Light 1\\" that was also recorded with Nation 12. The album’s original press release states: “Taking a cue from Kraftwerk, one of Foxx’s most obvious stylistic touchstones, “Pleasures…” is a streamlined monorail of lock-step computer-generated beats and wiry synthesizer melodies with an equal emphasis on dark, atmospherics and energised, danceable rhythms.” The artwork of the album was designed by Foxx himself, based on his own photography. The main cover depicts a man in a grey suit standing next to a door, his face completely whited out by a bright light that seems to originate from inside him. This, together with the album name, recalled René Magritte's painting Le Principe Du Plaisir, and through it Gary Numan's synthpop classic The Pleasure Principle, the artwork and title of which were inspired by the said painting (sonically The Pleasures of Electricity also resembles The Pleasure Principle and vice versa). In the sleeve notes for the live album The Golden Section Tour + The Omnidelic Exotour Foxx writes of buying a grey suit around 1978 and photographing his friends wearing it, with the face of the person never showing in the pictures. Whether or not the photographs used on The Pleasures of Electricity are from this time is unknown, but based on the description the artwork for this album is similar to Foxx's 1978 photography. No singles were released from the album, however \\"Nightlife\\" was included on the Modern Art compilation released some three months before The Pleasures of Electricity. A 2 CD remastered special edition was released in October 2009. Four tracks on CD 1 featured on the original album were significantly remixed - 'Nightlife', 'Invisible Women', 'Cities of Light 5' and 'Automobile'. Although they feature new sounds and in some cases additional arrangements, they were remixed in the context of the album, and therefore not just added as 'extras' to the package. Disc Two features the original mix of the album plus two previously unreleased bonus tracks 'Screenplay' and 'Twilight Room', thus making it the 'definitive edition' of this album.https://www.myspace.com/foxxmetamatic/blog/509985865 John Foxx official MySpace Blog, 13 September 2009 Track listing 2001 original release # \\"A Funny Thing\\" — 4:18 # \\"Nightlife\\" — 5:54 # \\"Camera\\" — 7:47 # \\"Invisible Women\\" — 5:55 # \\"Cities of Light 5' — 5:26 # \\"Uptown / Downtown\\" — 6:34 # \\"When It Rains\\" — 4:24 # \\"Automobile\\" — 5:56 # \\"The Falling Room\\" — 4:52 # \\"Travel\\" — 6:57 # \\"Quiet City\\" — 5:04 * All tracks written by John Foxx and Louis Gordon. * On Nation 12's album Electrofear, \\"Invisible Women\\" is credited to John Foxx, Shem McAuley, Kurt Rodgers and Simon Rodgers. 2009 Special edition CD1 # A Funny Thing # Nightlife (Alternative Mix) # Camera # Invisible Women (Alternative Mix) # Cities Of Light (Alternative Mix) # Uptown – Downtown # When It Rains # Automobile (Alternative Mix) # The Falling Room # Travel # Quiet City CD2 # A Funny Thing (Original Mix) # Nightlife (Original Mix) # Camera (Original Mix) # Invisible Women (Original Mix) # Cities Of Light (Original Mix) # Uptown – Downtown (Original Mix) # When It Rains (Original Mix) # Automobile (Original Mix) # The Falling Room (Original Mix) # Travel (Original Mix) # Quiet City (Original Mix) # Twilight Room (previously unreleased) # Screenplay (previously unreleased) External links * The Pleasures of Electricity at Metamatic.com References Category:John Foxx albums Category:2001 albums ","title":"The Pleasures of Electricity"},{"id":"10975913","text":"Gerald Dwayne Wilson (born April 2, 1985) is a former American football cornerback in the National Football League for the Carolina Panthers and Dallas Cowboys.

The Black Heath coal mining enterprises were operated by the Heth family between 1785 and 1844, when the mine closed following a fatal explosion. House The mansion of Black Heath was very large and grand and in its early days was said to have been \\"surrounded by all the appurtenances of a home of wealth and taste.\\" The land Black Heath was built on was near some of the first coal mining enterprises in Virginia and the Black Heath coal mine was less than 400 feet south of the house. The name \\"Black Heath\\" was derived from the color of the coal and the Heth family. A history of Midlothian written in 1983 states that the \\"estate, known as Black Heath, had an elegant mansion and beautiful grounds.\\" The mansion house was part brick and part frame, two stories tall, and six bays wide. Black Heath had three types of roofs: hipped, gambrel, and gable. The Byrd family plantation house, Westover, has these three roof types as well. Among the dependencies of Black Heath were a flower garden, an oak grove, a circular brick dovecote or pigeon house, stables, a barn, and other numerous outbuildings. History The land on which Black Heath was built was originally part of a land grant to John Tullitt. He received a land grant for sponsoring the passage of Huguenot refugees. Tullit received 17,653 acres for importing 353 people. This vast tract of land, although recorded as having 17,653 acres, actually had at least 27,500 acres based on the locations of the survey posts and lines seen from satellite imagery today. When Hannah Brummall Tullitt, the widow of John Tullitt, died in 1737, she left land near Falling Creek with coal pits to her brother John's children. John Brummall was the great-grandfather of Elijah Brummall, a local coal mine owner in the early 1800s and the owner of Aetna Hill, a house built in 1791 that was 0.7 miles southwest of Black Heath. In an 1823 court case, Harry Heth and John Stewart (partners in a firm called Heth and Stewart instituted in 1786) are mentioned as having bought in 1795 a certain 99.5 acre parcel of land on which the Black-heath coal-pits lay. They paid 3,150 pounds for this land, of which 1,486 pounds, 1 shilling, and 4 pence were paid to Samuel Swann (who held the mortgage on the land) and 1,663 pounds, 18 shillings, and 8 pence to William Bentley, the administrator of William Ronald, the deceased owner of the land. The Black Heath house was presumably built in the late 1790s or early 1800s by Henry \\"Harry\\" Heth, a Richmond area businessman. It is said that Heth acquired the land in the 1790s, so he most likely built his house soon after he bought the land or a couple years thereafter. Harry Heth operated the Black Heath coal mine located on the property and became very wealthy as a result of the mine's productiveness. The Black Heath mine was among the nation's richest and most productive coal mines in the first quarter of the 19th century. In early 1821, Harry Heth died of consumption in Savannah, Georgia, where he had arrived after a stay in Europe for the improvement of his health. In his will, Harry gave the Black Heath house and surface land to his eldest son, Henry. The subsurface land belonged to the co partnership consisting of Harry's three sons, Henry, John, and Beverly, and his son in law, Beverly Randolph. This partnership was set up to continue the Heth family coal business. Henry Heth was born in 1793/4 probably somewhere around Richmond. Not much is known about his life, except that he married Eliza Ann Cunliffe, the daughter of a neighboring coal mine owner named John Cunliffe (1758-1824), on January 4, 1815, in Chesterfield County, most likely at Black Heath. During the War of 1812, Henry served as a sergeant major under his father in the 1st Regiment (Heth's) Cavalry, Virginia Militia. After the war, Henry probably came to help his father in the coal business and in the 1820 US Census he is recorded as having 44 male slaves and 4 female slaves. In 1821, his father Harry died and Henry inherited the plantation Black Heath. He lived there until he also died, four years later, in 1825. His widow Eliza later married a man named Holden Rhodes. After Henry's death, Black Heath and its land passed to John Heth, Harry's second son and Henry's younger brother. John had been a midshipman in the US Navy during the War of 1812, but resigned in 1822 to marry Margaret Pickett and take over the family coal business. John had eleven children with Margaret between 1823 and 1842, including Confederate Major General Henry Heth, who fought in the American Civil War and was born at Black Heath in 1825. In 1833 John Heth incorporated the Black Heath Company of Colliers with his brother, Beverley Heth, and brother-in-law, Beverley Randolph. This company was the first incorporated coal mining company in the state of Virginia. By 1840 John owned most of the three thousand shares of stock and went to England to advertise for a new company to English investors. This new company was formed in 1841 and was called the Chesterfield Coal and Iron Mining Company. Unfortunately, after returning from England in 1842, John Heth died at Norwood Plantation on April 30. He left his wife and 10 young children with ages varying between 19 years and one month. Major General Henry Heth, John Heth's third child and eldest son, wrote later in his life that the period after his father's death was \\"the most severe calamity I had ever felt.\\" When 17-year-old Henry reported to the military academy at West Point in 1842, he described his family as \\"badly off\\" and in \\"reduced circumstances.\\" John Heth's widow Margaret continued living at Black Heath until she died in 1850, at which point the house was sold to A. F. D. Gifford. A. F. D. Gifford (A. F. D. is for Adolphus Frederick Danberry) was an widowed Englishman who initially came to Virginia as the attorney for the Chesterfield Coal and Iron Mining Company. However, the company had declined since 1844 when a major explosion had killed 11 miners. Gifford later became the vice president of the Richmond and Danville Railroad and was involved in local politics. In 1845 he married Mary Ann Johnson, daughter of the Virginia lawyer Chapman Johnson. They had three children between 1847 and 1853 and also took care of Mary Ann's deceased brother Carter Page Johnson's two children. In 1850 A. F. D. Gifford had 124 slaves (119 men and boys and 5 women and girls), making him a very wealthy man and in 1861 he had two slave children. During the first couple years of the Civil War, Gifford traveled to England in an attempt to secure munitions for the Confederate Army. Upon his return to Virginia in January 1862, however, his ship sunk, probably while trying to run the Union blockade. Gifford's death led to his widow, Mary Gifford, becoming dependent. She, along with many other Southern dependent women, had to apply for a job \\"signing and numbering Confederate notes\\" at the Confederate States Treasury office. With A. F. D. Gifford's death, Black Heath passed to William B. Ball (B. is for Bernard), the fifth and last owner of the estate. In the June 20, 1868 issue of the Richmond Daily Dispatch, William B. Ball is listed as the administrator of A. F. D. Gifford. Ball was probably a friend of Gifford's as he was the administrator of his estate. W. B. Ball graduated from Jefferson Medical College and was a local doctor who served in the Midlothian area of Chesterfield County. At one point he was also one of three company doctors for the Midlothian Coal Mining Company. When the Civil War broke out he became a captain in Company B in the 4th Virginia Cavalry of the Confederate States Army. By 1862 he had been promoted to colonel. After the war he was a surgeon in Chesterfield County and the state commissioner of fish culture. He died on January 10, 1872 at the Exchange Hotel in Richmond. His wife died 28 years later, on April 4, 1900 in Richmond. Col. William B. Ball's administrator was C. H. Flournoy (C. is for Clarence), sheriff of Chesterfield County. Clarence H. Flournoy was from a prominent Huguenot Chesterfield family and was the sheriff of Chesterfield County from 1872-1880. It is unknown what happened to Black Heath after Ball died. At some point between 1870 and 1930, Black Heath fell into ruin and collapsed as a result of the coal mines tunneled under the house. The house and land were owned by the Chesterfield Coal and Iron Mining Company (successor of the Black Heath Company of Colliers), which had ceased mining operations in the area after an explosion in 1854. The company \\"was having difficulty selling the land\\" perhaps because of the large tracts of coal mines sitting around. This would have been an issue to any potential buyers, as nobody was mining coal anymore and open pits were obstacles to farming the land. A WPA Federal Writers' Project guidebook published in 1940 indicates that the Black Heath house was still standing, or at least some portions of it, and that it was in \\"dense undergrowth\\". This same guidebook also tells that to get to the site of Black Heath, a traveler going west on US Route 60 (Midlothian Turnpike) must turn right (north) onto State Route 147 (Huguenot Road). After going 0.5 miles, Black Heath was on the left. In the present day, 0.5 miles north of Midlothian Turnpike on Huguenot Road on the left leads a traveler to another road called Olde Coach Drive, which is 0.3 miles north of Old Buckingham Road. There is a neighborhood surrounding these two roads, with streets having names that probably derive from the Black Heath estate like Heathmere Crescent, Heathmere Court, Black Heath Road, and Olde Coalmine Road. Coal The geology of the area about west of the fall line of the James River near present-day Richmond, Virginia includes a basin of coal which was one of the earliest mined in the Virginia Colony. This natural resource was mined by the French Huguenot refugees who settled there and others beginning around 1700. By the second quarter of the 18th century, a number of private coal pits were operating on a commercial scale in a coalfield located in the area now known as Midlothian. Miners immigrated to Chesterfield from Wales, England and Scotland. The Wooldridge family from East Lothian in Scotland was among the first to undertake coal mining in the area. The mining community was originally called Coalfield after Coalfield Station, a railroad station on the Richmond and Danville Railroad (now Norfolk Southern Railway). Eventually the name changed from Coalfield Village to Midlothian Village, named after the Wooldridge brothers' Mid- Lothian Coal Mining Company and Abraham S. Wooldridge's house, Midlothian. The Heths, beginning with Colonel Henry \\"Harry\\" Heth, who was born about 1760, opened coal pits in the county as early as 1785. Black Heath was the name of a coal basin and also of some mines located in this basin. Mining operations started there in 1785 or 1788. The basin was of an oval shape extending north and south and is at times 40 feet thick. The most famous mine and eponym of the Black Heath basin was the Black Heath pit. There is uncertainty about the date coal was found and when it was first mined. A Hessian doctor, after fighting in the American Revolutionary War, traveled around the new country in 1783 to 1784 and wrote about preliminary operations of the Black Heath mines. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson had the White House in Washington, D.C. heated with the high quality coal from the Black Heath mines. Commenting on the area's coal in his Notes on the State of Virginia, written in 1781–82, then- Governor Jefferson stated: \\"The country on James river, from 15 to 20 miles above Richmond, and for several miles northward and southward, is replete with mineral coal of a very excellent quality.\\" Jefferson was also referring not only to the Midlothian area, but also to the area of western Henrico County adjacent across the James River near Gayton and Deep Run. There were three shafts in the Black Heath mine and at the bottom of each tunnels connected each shaft. Sometime between 1810 and 1830, the Black Heath pits were worked out and abandoned, later having disastrous consequences for the Black Heath house. Later, the nearby Maidenhead pits were known as the Black Heath pits as a result of the association with the Heth coal mining company, the Black Heath Company of Colliers. This company was the idea of the three living members of a four man partnership set up by Harry Heth before his death in 1821. These men, Beverley Randolph, his brother-in-law John Heth, and Heth's younger brother Beverley, petitioned the Virginia General Assembly on January 25, 1832, for the first coal mining corporation to be chartered in Virginia. After substantial opposition to the concept, this was accomplished the following year on February 20, 1833, with the incorporation of the Black Heath Company of Colliers. All of these men had experience in the coal trade. In 1827, Beverley Randolph had also been one of the organizers of the Chesterfield Railroad, a 12-mile gravity line built from Falling Creek to Manchester for the purpose of transporting coal to ships in the navigable portion of the James River for export. Opened in 1831, it was the first commercial railroad in Virginia and second in the United States. The Maidenhead pits had been discovered and opened in 1821 and had many shafts sunk into the property ranging from 150 to 700 feet deep. Some explosions occurred in these mines prior to 1839. The two major and deepest shafts were 700 feet deep (the 1839 explosion happened in this shaft) and 600 feet deep (this shaft was completed in 1840). The coal from these mines was about 36 feet in thickness and in 1841 the Maidenhead mines were estimated to produce 2 million bushels of coal per year (at the rate of 1 bushel = 80 pounds, this would be 80,000 tons per year and about 219 tons a day). In early 1836 a petition was made to the Virginia legislature asking \\"for a charter for a Rail-Road, from the Pits of the Black Heath Company of Colliers to James River, at some point above Bosher's Dam.\\" This railroad, officially called the James river and Blackheath rail-road, was laid out and began construction in the summer of 1837. The route ran downhill from the Maidenhead mines to the James River and intersected the Salle Pits. From there, the coal would be taken across the river and down the Kanawha Canal to Richmond to be sold. This railroad lasted from 1838 to approximately 1850 and was around 3 to 4 miles long. In 1854 the Maidenhead mines closed after one last explosive disaster.  Explosions at the Black Heath mines  Coal mining at Black Heath was both difficult and dangerous work, and there were many fatal explosions. Around 1810 and 1818, two explosions occurred that killed some miners. On March 18, 1839, 53 men, mostly African American slaves, were killed in a 700-foot shaft at the Black Heath mine. On June 15, 1844, a mining explosion at Black Heath killed 11 more men. After the second incident, the mine was closed until 1938. Around 1850, the steam-powered Richmond and Danville Railroad was built through the property of Black Heath. In modern- times, Black Heath Road extends from Old Buckingham Road north through the property on the south of the railroad tracks where a subdivision has been built. North of the railroad and south of State Route 711 (Robious Road), remnants of the Black Heath coal pits were extant in the 1960s. References Further reading *Lutz, Frank E.

Rampart was one of 40 Colorado public high schools to make the 2013 Newsweeks list of top 2,000 public high schools. Rampart had the highest ranking in the Pikes Peak region, coming in at No. 479. Band Rampart High School has a well known music program consisting of a multi-time state championship marching band (2005 and 2006) as well as three concert band, two jazz bands, and a string orchestra programs. The concert bands started attending the CBA state championships for concert band in 2007. The jazz bands attend many different jazz festivals throughout the school year, and have been doing so for many years. During the 2007-2008 school year, the band moved up in class from 4A to 5A. In addition, Rampart's Winter Guard has won the RMCGA State championship four times. Additionally, the Rampart High School Winter Percussion Ensemble won first place at the 2017 RMPA State Championships for the Scholastic Concert Open class. Rivalries Since Pine Creek High School was established, the Rams have had a fierce rivalry with the Eagles. This applies to all sports as they are in the same conference, but most notably basketball, football, and volleyball. The rivalry peaked on February 22, 2013, when during a conference basketball game there were numerous technical fouls (including one on the Rampart fan section). The Pine Creeks coach was ejected and after Pine Creek won the game, there was a minor brawl between the two student sections after the game. State champions In 1998 the Rampart High football team went undefeated en route to a 14-0 finish and a State Championship in the Class 4A, defeating Sierra High School 35-14 at Memorial Stadium in Colorado Springs. Future NFL player Dexter Wynn was a part of all five Ram scores, with two catches for touchdowns, a pass for a touchdown and two special teams scores. He also picked off a pass in the last three minutes of the game to seal the win for the Rams. In 1996 the Rampart Basketball team won the 4A state championship (5A was the highest classification), Rampart 57, Alameda 51. In 1987 the Rampart Boys Basketball Team won the 3A Colorado State Basketball Championship with an undefeated 24-0 record. (this is when the 4A classification was the highest classification.) The 1987 Rampart Boys Basketball was selected to the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame in 2013. This Hall of Fame includes such outstanding athletes such as Goose Gossage (NY Yankees all-star), Coach Fisher DeBerry (Air Force Academy), Peggy Fleming (Olympic Gold Medalist Figure Skating) and several teams that includes the 1980 Olympic Ice Hockey Team. In 2015 the Rampart Boys Basketball was selected by the Gazette Telegraph (readers) as the Greatest High School TEAM of all-time. This team won this award competing against thousands of Colorado Springs sports teams. In 2018 the Rampart Women's Swimming and Diving team won the 4a State Championship, with one individual champion, Edenna Chen, in the 100 br; and two relay titles in the 200 Medley and 400 Free Relays. The 400 FR set a new Colorado 4a record.

On 11 January 2002, Oyak Bank acquired Sümerbank and the combined bank is now known under the Oyak Bank name.Introducing Oyak Bank History Atatürk (center) accompanied by Bayar (to his left) and İnönü (to his right) at the Sümerbank Textile Factory in Nazilli, October 9, 1937. Sümerbank was established in 1933 as a state owned bank for funding the construction of textile factories and the development of the textile industry in Turkey. A year earlier, in 1932, President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and Prime Minister İsmet İnönü had secured a foreign credit loan worth 8.5 million Turkish liras from the Soviet Union (which offered the lowest interest rates to Turkey in that period) for the construction of Sümerbank's first textile factory in Kayseri. The first textile production plant in Kayseri was opened in September 1935.Sümerbank - Kayseri - Reports - Turkey - ESI The Soviet Union also provided credit loans and technical assistance for Turkey's First Five-Year Industrial Plan (Birinci Beş Yıllık Sanayi Planı, 1934–1938) which was partially influenced by the First Five-Year Economic Plan (1928–1932) of the Soviet Union. Economists and planning experts from the Soviet Union and the United States were invited to Turkey and prepared reports on how the country should use its natural resources efficiently for industrialization, and how to optimally distribute the factories and industrial plants across the country's geographical regions.Alkan Soyak: \\"Türkiye'de İktisadi Planlama: DPT'ye İhtiyaç var mı?\\", Doğuş Üniversitesi Dergisi, 4 (2) 2003, p. 172 Sümerbank's textile plants produced the highest quality textiles in Turkey during the early decades of the republic, for relatively cheap prices, which enabled the citizens with low levels of income to afford decent clothing. After 11 years of consecutive wars between 1911 and 1922, namely the Italo-Turkish War (1911–1912), Balkan Wars (1912–1913), First World War (1914–1918) and the Turkish War of Independence (1919–1923), the Turkish economy was devastated and many Turks were poor. Starting from 1929, the global Great Depression, which lasted until the end of the Second World War in 1945, also badly hit the rapidly growing (since 1923) but still weak and fragile Turkish economy. Due to the lack of a strong private sector in Turkey in those years, large scale investments by the government were necessary for initiating the industrialization efforts in the country. Sümerbank was the cornerstone of Atatürk's industrial revolution in Turkey. Sümerbank's factories and plants, which represented the state-led industrialization in the Turkish textile sector for decades, were gradually closed and sold starting from 2002, when Oyak Bank acquired Sümerbank and decided to terminate the company's operations in this field, due to the highly developed private sector and saturated market in the Turkish textile industry by the early 2000s.

In two dimensions, the problem can be solved in polynomial time in a model of computation allowing addition and comparisons of real numbers, despite theoretical difficulties involving the numerical precision needed to perform such calculations. These algorithms are based on two different principles, either performing a shortest path algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm on a visibility graph derived from the obstacles or (in an approach called the continuous Dijkstra method) propagating a wavefront from one of the points until it meets the other.

There are many results on computing shortest paths which stays on a polyhedral surface. Given two points s and t, say on the surface of a convex polyhedron, the problem is to compute a shortest path that never leaves the surface and connects s with t. This is a generalization of the problem from 2-dimension but it is much easier than the 3-dimensional problem. Also, there are variations of this problem, where the obstacles are weighted, i.e., one can go through an obstacle, but it incurs an extra cost to go through an obstacle. The standard problem is the special case where the obstacles have infinite weight. This is termed as the weighted region problem in the literature.

The Blue Sox was one of the inaugural teams in the Israel Baseball League. They had the best regular season record (29-12, .707), and won the inaugural championship August 19, 2007, in Petah Tikva, shutting out Art Shamsky’s Modi’in Miracle 3-0 in the championship game. Californian RHP Rafael Bergstrom pitched a complete game shutout, downing Dominican RHP Maximo Nelson (5-3, 3.55 ERA) who pitched for Modi’in. History left On February 26, 2007, it was announced that former Major League Baseball player Ron Blomberg would be the manager of the Blue Sox. Team colors also reflect Blomberg's stint with the New York Yankees, and hopes that league officials had of creating a rivalry between Art Shamsky's Modi'in Miracle (similar colors to the New York Mets) and the Blue Sox. The first player selected by the Blue Sox in the inaugural draft was Canadian right handed pitcher Jason Benson. Stadium Located at Kibbutz Gezer, Gezer Field was home to the Blue Sox as well as the Modi'in Miracle, as neither city has a baseball stadium. However, a new field was under construction in Bet Shemesh and reportedly would have been reason for the second season in 2008, which was never played. Logo The Blue Sox logo is a mixture of the logos of the Chicago White Sox and the New York Yankees, and its letters make out the initials of the city of Bet Shemesh, written in diagonal from right to left (because the Hebrew language reads from right to left), as opposed to the White Sox which goes left to right. Roster Team success The Blue Sox jumped off to a good start in the beginning of the inaugural 2007 season, winning 9 consecutive game before finally losing one to the Tel Aviv Lightning. The team played well for the rest of the season, taking first place in the regular season, as well as winning the championship game on August 19, 2007, in front of 2,610 fans. The team was the best offensive team in the league, coming in first in the following categories: batting average (.294), runs (286), hits (325), doubles (61), home runs (60), runs batted in (251), and stolen bases (115). 23-year- old Australian right fielder Jason Rees led the league with 17 home runs and 50 runs batted in in 130 at bats. Shortstop Gregg Raymundo, who hit .292 in 7 minor league seasons and played for the Texas Rangers' and Pittsburgh Pirates' AAA teams, was a close second for the league title in batting, with a .459 batting average. Jason Rees was signed to a minor league contract by the New York Yankees for the 2008 season. One of the leading pitchers was Juan Feliciano of Bet Shemesh, who had pitched for the 2005-06 Hiroshima Carp in Japan. He was 7-1, with a 1.97 ERA, and in 50.1 innings gave up only 28 hits while striking out 73. Rafael Bergstrom was 7-2, with a 2.44 ERA. The Commissioner's Award for Distinguished Service was awarded to shortstop Eric Holtz of Bet Shemesh, a player-coach who also filled in as player-manager. Three players from the Blue Sox won season awards for outstanding play: Raymundo shared the Hank Greenberg Most Valuable Player award (along with Eladio Rodriguez of the Modi'in Miracle), Juan Feliciano was named the best pitcher, and Jason Rees received two awards: Best Outfielder (shared with Josh Doane of the Netanya Tigers) and Home Run Champion (17). The Blue Sox had 11 players named to the 2007 All-Star Team: Scott Jarmakowicz (C), Gregg Raymundo (SS), David Kramer (2B), Sean Slaughter (OF), Jason Reese (OF), Johnny Lopez (DH), Rafael Bergstrom (P), Ben Pincus (P), Scott Perlman (P), Juan Feliciano (P), and Jason Benson (P).

Time magazine credited him with 347 executions to that date during a 15-year career. According to later research, a number of 60 to 70 over a period of two years is more credible.French MacLean, The Fifth Field, Atglen 2013, p. 286.  Biography  Born in Wichita, Kansas, Woods joined the US Navy on December 3, 1929, and went absent without leave within months. He was convicted at a general court martial and subsequently examined by a psychiatric board on April 23, 1930. He was diagnosed with \\"Constitutional Psychopathic Inferiority without Psychosis\\", was found \\"poor service material\\" and discharged.French MacLean, The Fifth Field, Atglen 2013, p. 79. Before being inducted into the United States Army in August 1943, Woods was intermittently employed in construction as a laborer, and was working part-time at a feed-store in Eureka, Kansas, when he was registered for Selective Service in 1940. He was married to a nurse, Hazel Woods, but had no children. Before D-Day, American military executions by hanging in the European Theater of Operations occurred in England only and were performed by the civilian executioner Thomas Pierrepoint with assistance by Albert Pierrepoint (his nephew) and other British personnel. When in autumn of 1944 military executions by hanging were scheduled in France, the Army looked for a volunteer enlisted hangman and found Woods, who falsely claimed previous experience as assistant hangman in two cases in Texas and two in Oklahoma. There is no evidence that the U.S. Army made any attempt to verify Woods' claims - if they had checked, it would have been easy to prove that he was lying; the states of Texas and Oklahoma had both switched to electrocution during the period he claimed to be a hangman. The last ever hanging in Texas took place in August 1923 when Woods would have been twelve. Oklahoma did not carry out hangings during the relevant period, the last one taking place three months before Woods was born. There was a single hanging in 1936 under federal jurisdiction, and all other executions in Oklahoma between 1915 and 1966 were carried out by electric chair. In fact, Woods had no documented pre-war experience as a hangman. Woods at that time was a private and a member of the 37th Engineer Combat Battalion. He was promoted to master sergeant and transferred to Paris Disciplinary Training Center.French MacLean, The Fifth Field, Atglen 2013, p. 77. Woods performed as the primary executioner in the hangings of 34 American soldiers at various locations in France over 1944–1945, and assisted in at least three others. U.S. Army reports suggest that Woods participated in at least 11 bungled hangings of US soldiers between 1944 and 1946. Woods also participated in the execution of about 45 war criminals at various locations which included Rheinbach, Bruchsal, Landsberg, and Nuremberg. Donald E. Wilkes Jr., a professor of law at the University of Georgia Law School, noted that many of the executed Nazis fell from the gallows with a drop insufficient to snap their necks, resulting in their death by strangulation that in some cases lasted several minutes.New York Times news blog; The Nuremberg Hangings — Not So Smooth Either, 16 January 2007 After the Nuremberg executions, Woods stated:TIME Magazine, October 28, 1946, p. 34Joseph Kingsbury-Smith: The Execution of Nazi War Criminals .

Biography  Bellenden was the son of Sir John Bellenden of Auchnoul, Lord Justice Clerk, and Barbara Kennedy, daughter of Sir Hugh Kennedy of Girvanmains by his spouse Janet Stewart, daughter to John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh on 1 August 1590, and was ordained a Presbyterian minister on 19 July 1593. In 1608 he was appointed minister of Falkirk, a position he held until 1615. He was promoted to the bishopric of Dunblane, receiving a Crown provision on 24 September 1615 and was consecrated by April of the following year. Balfour Paul states that he was also appointed, c. 1633, Dean of the Chapel Royal at Stirling Castle, and also held, as a personal right, Kilconquhar, succeeding to it upon the death of his nephew James, which was ratified in parliament in 1629.Balfour Paul, Sir James, Lord Lyon King of Arms, The Scots Peerage, Edinburgh, 1905, vol.ii: 66–7 However, it is evident that Bellenden was appointed Dean of the Chapel Royal much earlier than Balfour Paul stated, as in 1621 the Privy Council of Scotland ordered that the widow of the previous Dean, William Couper, Bishop of Galloway, hand over documents relating to the Chapel Royal to Bellenden, and specifically called Bellenden 'deane of his Majesteis Chaippell'.Mason, David (ed.), The Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, volume 12 [1619–1622] (Edinburgh: H.M. General Register House, 1895), pp. 441–2. Bellenden was very active in secular affairs. He was appointed to Charles I's privy council in March 1626 and attended far more sessions than any other Scottish bishop.Sally Tuckett The Scottish Bishops in Government, 1625 – 1638, in Sharon Adams & Julian Goodare (2014), Scotland in the Age of Two Revolutions, The Boydell Press, p. 66 After holding the Dunblane bishopric for several decades, on 2 August 1635, he was given the more prestigious bishopric of Aberdeen. On 13 December 1638, after the anti-Episcopacy Assembly in Glasgow, described by Spottiswoode as \\"the wild Assembly\\", he was deprived of this position and, with many others, excommunicated by the Scottish church. He retired to England, where, in 1642, he was appointed to a parish in county Somerset. (The Parish of St Dubricius, Porlock, 1642 to 1647) On 17 February 1595, Bellenden married Jean, daughter of Henry Abercrombie, of Kersie, St. Ninians. Together they had 10 children, three daughters and seven sons, one of whom, David, was ordained and became minister of Kincardine O'Neil. References Notes * Dowden, John, The Bishops of Scotland, ed.

There are three primary elongation factors (EF-G, EF-Tu, EF-Ts) that are known to be the main contributors to facilitate elongation during protein synthesis; due to LepA's now acknowledged proofreading function in translation, scientists are now lobbying to have LepA renamed as EF-4 (elongation factor 4).  Evolutionary background  LepA has a highly conserved sequence. LepA orthologs have been found in bacteria and almost all eukaryotes. The conservation in LepA has been shown to cover the entire protein. More specifically, the amino acid identity of LepA among bacterial orthologs ranges from 55%-68%. Two forms of LepA have been observed; one form of LepA branches with mitochondrial LepA sequences, while the second form branches with cyanobacterial orthologs. These findings demonstrate that LepA is significant for bacteria, mitochondria, and plastids. LepA is absent from archaea.  Structure  The gene encoding LepA is known to be the first cistron as part of a bicistron operon. LepA is a polypeptide of 599 amino acids with a molecular weight of 67 kDa. The amino acid sequence of LepA indicates that it is a G protein, which consists of five known domains. The first four domains are strongly related to domains I, II, III, and V of primary elongation factor EF-G. However, the last domain of LepA is unique. This specific domain resides on the C-terminal end of the protein structure. This arrangement of LepA has been observed in the mitochondria of yeast cells to human cells.  Function  LepA is suspected to improve the fidelity of translation by recognizing a ribosome with mistranslocated tRNA and consequently inducing a back- translocation. By back-translocating the already post-transcriptionally modified ribosome, the EF-G factor capable of secondary translocation. Back- translocation by LepA occurs at a similar rate as an EF-G-dependent translocation. As mentioned above, EF-G's structure is highly analogous to LepA's structure; LepA's function is thus similarly analogous to EF-G's function. However, Domain IV of EF-G has been shown through several studies to occupy the decoding sequence of the A site after the tRNAs have been translocated from A and P sites to the P and E sites. Thus, domain IV of EF-G prevents back-movement of the tRNA. Despite the structural similarities between LepA and EF-G, LepA lacks this Domain IV. Thus LepA reduces the activation barrier between Pre and POST states in a similar way to EF-G but is, at the same time, able to catalyze a back-translocation rather that a canonical translocation.  Activity  LepA exhibits uncoupled GTPase activity. This activity is stimulated by the ribosome to the same extent as the activity of EF-G, which is known to have the strongest ribosome-dependent GTPase activity among all characterized G proteins involved in translation. Conversely, uncoupled GTPase activity occurs when the ribosome stimulation of GTP cleavage is not directly dependent on protein synthesis. In the presence of GTP, LepA works catalytically. On the other hand, in the presence of the nonhydrolysable GTP – GDPNP – the LepA action becomes stoichiometric, saturating at about one molecule per 70S ribosomes. This data demonstrates that GTP cleavage is required for dissociation of LepA from the ribosome, which is demonstrative of a typical G protein. At low concentrations of LepA (less than or equal to 3 molecules per 70S ribosome), LepA specifically recognizes incorrectly translocated ribosomes, back-translocates them, and thus allows EF-G to have a second chance to catalyze the correct translocation reaction. At high concentrations (about 1 molecule per 70S ribosome), LepA loses its specificity and back-translocates every POST ribosome. This places the translational machinery in a nonreproductive mode. This explains the toxicity of LepA when it is found in a cell in high concentrations. Hence, at low concentrations LepA significantly improves the yield and activity of synthesized proteins; however, at high concentrations LepA is toxic to cells. Additionally, LepA has an effect on peptide bond formation. Through various studies in which functional derivatives of ribosomes were mixed with puromycin (an analog of the 3' end of an aa-tRNA) it was determined that adding LepA to a post transcriptionally modified ribosome prevents dipeptide formation as it inhibits the binding of aa-tRNA to the A site.  Experimental data  There have been various experiments elucidating the structure and function of LepA. One notable study is termed the \\"toeprinting experiment\\": this experiment helped to determine LepA's ability to back-translocate. In this case, a primer was extended via reverse transcription along mRNA which was ribosome-bound. The primers from modified mRNA strands from various ribosomes were extended with and without LepA. An assay was then conducted with both PRE and POST states, and cleavage studies revealed enhanced positional cleavage in the POST state as opposed to the PRE state. Since the POST state had been in the presence of LepA (plus GTP), it was determined that the strong signal characteristic of the POST state was the result of LepA which then brought the signal down to the level of the PRE state. Such a study demonstrated that that ribosome, upon binding to the LepA-GTP complex assumes the PRE state configuration.

Its operational jurisdiction covers all of the consolidated city of Indianapolis and Marion County except for the Airport Authority and the four excluded cities of Beech Grove, Lawrence, Southport and Speedway (see Unigov). It was created on January 1, 2007, by consolidating the Indianapolis Police Department and the law enforcement division of the Marion County Sheriff's Office.  Organization  Crown Victoria Police Interceptor At the time of its formation, the IMPD was headed by the elected sheriff of Marion County, Frank J. Anderson. However, on February 29, 2008, the department came under the control of the mayor of Indianapolis, Greg Ballard, after Ballard and Anderson reached a resolution for the transfer of power and the City-County Council passed Proposal 6 effecting the change. The IMPD is part of the Department of Public Safety. The mayor appoints the Director of Public Safety, who in turn appoints the Chief of Police to administer the daily operations of the department. IMPD has six service districts. Downtown District The Downtown District is under the command of Commander Phillip Burton. Due to the nature of the area and the number of large events held here, this district relies heavily on foot, bicycle, and mounted patrol officers. The headquarters for the district is at 39 W.

Museum of musical instruments, Baku, Azerbaijan Taq-e Bostan carving, Women playing Chang (instrument) while the king is standing in a boat holding his bow and arrows, from 6th century Sassanid Iran. The chang ( ; Turkish: çeng; Arabic: al-ǧank (ṣanǧ); Georgian: ჩანგი changi) is a Persian musical instrument similar to a harp. It was very popular and used widely during the times of ancient Persia, especially during the Sasanian Dynasty where it was often played in the shahs' court. It was also played until the 19th century in the Ottoman Empire but has since disappeared from Turkish folk music.  History  The chang first appears in paintings and wall art in Persia in about 4000 BCE. In these paintings and mosaics, the chang went from the original arched harp to an angular harp in the early 1900s BCE, with vertical or horizontal sound boxes. From the Hellenistic period (~300 BCE) and through beginning of Common Era (~1 CE), the chang changed shape to be less of a handheld instrument and more of a large, standing harp, and subsequently gained in popularity. Sassanian courts were enamored with the Hellenistic chang, which increased its popularity, and by the end of the Sasanian period the chang had been redesigned to be as light as possible. By becoming more slender, the chang lost much of its rigidity and structural soundness, but gained a portability that made it the primary harp for what would soon become Iran. The chang that is used today resembles the last documented transformation.  Structure  The chang is essentially an Iranian harp, but unlike an eastern harp the strings are made of sheep gut and twisted goat hair and sometimes even nylon. This characteristic stringing gives the chang a unique sound; it does not have the resonance of metal strings in other folk- harps. In medieval Azerbaijan, the chang had 18–24 strings but this varies based on how far the chang dates back. In the design of some ancient changs, sheepskin or goatskin was used to amplify the sound making it sound closer to an eastern harp, but its unique sound is desirable and typically preserved. The chang is played by plucking the strings with your right hand finger nails or finger picks and using your left hand to apply pressure on the strings to execute glissandos, vibratos, and other embellishments, and occasionally, plucking techniques. In modern days the chang is made out of special string or the tail of a horse. The past body of the chang typically included goat- or sheep-skin. The skins used on the chang also give it a different sound.  Musicians  The chang was predominantly played by women during ancient times. However, the chang is being revived and is now starting to make its way back into the field of contemporary Persian music. There are depictions from as far back as 4000 BCE that show the chang being played, along with other instruments, and a singer. Since the playing style of the chang does not share any similarities with other Persian instruments, it is a difficult instrument to pick up, play, and master. As a result, the number of chang players is small. There are a few modern players of the chang including Mrs. Parvin Ruhi and her two daughters, Zaynab Baqeri Nejad and Masome Baqeri Nejad. Today the chang is played in small ensembles, such as religious ceremonies and parties. In recent years, the Iranian scholars and instrument makers have been trying to revive the ancient chang back to its former glory.  Other usages in music  Georgian Changi, Svaneti (ჩანგი) The chang (or Chinese chang) is also a name given to the fangxiang, a Chinese metallophone played in China since ancient times. The Uzbek chang is a hammered dulcimer, similar to the Chinese Yangqin. See also * Çeng * The Turkish harpist (Manuchehri) Further reading * Lawergren, Bo (2003, updated 2012). \\"Harp\\".

Its membership approximates 10,800 teachers in active service and 1,200 retiree members. TTUTA's Head Office is in Curepe and it has other offices in San Fernando and Tobago with a further six District Offices. History In 1978 teachers were represented by four unions: de Public Services Association (PSA), led by James Manswell, the Tobago Unified Teachers Association (TUTA), the Trinidad and Tobago Teachers’ Union, (TTTU), whose leader was St. Elmo Gopaul; and the Secondary School Teachers Association (SSTA) headed by Osmond Downer and which represented teachers in the so-called “prestige” schools in the country. The three Trinidad unions were all recognized by the Education Act No. 1 of 1966 as the representative unions for teachers. Teacher dissatisfaction with representation by the three Trinidad unions had grown in the 1970s. There was the view that adversarial relations between the three units had severely hampered Industrial Relations in the Teaching Service. As early as 1966 there was a struggle between two of the three unions to be the sole representative for any class of, or classes of teachers. The Special Tribunal No. 10 of 1974, which stated that any one of the three unions could represent any class or classes of teachers decided this issue. This resulted in rapid changes of membership among teachers. However, not one of these unions emerged as the majority union. The implications of teacher representation by four unions had several serious consequences. Any issue raised by one union with the Chief Personnel Officer (CPO) had to be discussed with each union separately. This resulted in the presentation of conflicting arguments to the CPO and his advisor's by the different unions, a situation which acted to the disadvantage of teachers. Additionally, negotiations were often lengthy with a consequently longer period for settlement. The relationship between the three unions was thus described as one involving a great deal of “inter-union rivalry and fragmentation” which was seen as “the biggest disadvantage when negotiating a collective agreement,”. Teacher Professionalism Mr. Frank B. Seepersad, the first General Secretary of TTUTA, noted that fragmentation of the unions had caused them to pay little attention to advancing the cause of teacher professionalism. Two existing committees, the Appeals Committee and the Assessment of Qualifications Committee were not being closely monitored. The unions were paying little attention to issues, for example, like in-service training for teachers and refresher courses. Also, the unions were not pressing for much needed changes to the syllabuses of both the primary and secondary schools. This failure to adequately address teachers’ issues resulted in irrational promotions and transfers, non-recognition of extra qualifications, and the absence of a clear policy on study leave, staff shortages and late staffing. Seepersad observed that the unions were using teachers as “pawns in a power play”, and not seriously addressing those issues which were vital to teachers professional development and to education. Negotiating problems In 1971 the problems over negotiations continued with the PSA refusing to sit in joint negotiations with what they described as \\"minority unions\\". As a result, the salaries issue was referred to the Special Tribunal and teachers had to wait almost nine years for a settlement of this issue. In 1974, the Special Tribunal called for joint negotiations through a joint negotiations committee but again the PSA refused to join in the process. There was an additional problem in that, in 1971, the PSA, which usually went in first in negotiations, signed a four-contract contrary to the usual procedure as three-year contracts. This contributed to an exodus of teachers from the PSA. Committee for the Unification of Teachers As the decade came to a close, dissatisfaction came to a head in 1979 and on March 31, 1979 approximately 150 teachers gathered at the Mt. Hope Junior Secondary School, headed by Frank B Seepersad, who was a teacher there, to discuss the unsatisfactory state of the teaching profession, and the meeting adopted a resolution seeking to ensure one autonomous body for teachers. A decision was also arrived at to establish a steering Committee of 22 to oversee the formation of one union for all teachers. Volunteers were sought to serve on this committee - the Committee for the Unification of Teachers (COMFUT) Another mass meeting of May 5, 1979 at the Mucurapo Senior Secondary School, adopted a resolution to have COMFUT seek legal advice as to how it should proceed towards its goal of establishing a “…single autonomous professional organisation of teachers, where every individual teacher has a say in policy- determining decisions of the organisation through proper representation in the management of the organisation.” The Unification Committee drew up an action plan which included: * Stirring up teacher participation by using several publicity techniques, bumper stickers, buttons, rallies and public meetings; * Seeking and obtaining about 9,000 signatures to the call for a single union for teachers, and an amendment of the Education Act (Act 1 of 1966) to facilitate teacher representation by a single majority union; * Seeking the resignation of the Officers of the existing unions so as to make room for a single union; * Fund raising activities. Included in the campaign was the demand for an amendment of the Education Act to ensure that one union, the majority union would be recognised as the bargaining body for teachers. Ten thousand (10,000) teachers’ signatures were needed to ensure recognition as the majority union Unity and recognition The period from March 1979 to December 1981, when TTUTA was finally recognised by the Registration, Recognition and Certification Board, was one of relentless struggle with the authorities in support of the cause for one union for all teachers. Thousands of teachers marched around the Red House and through the streets demanding that there be one umbrella body for all teachers. On April 24, 1980 TTUTA was registered as a Trade Union. It is worth noting that TTUTA got its name from adding the word 'Trinidad' to the 'Tobago Unified Teachers Association' thus resulting in the Trinidad and Tobago Unified Teachers Association. In March 1981, the state presented a draft revision of the Education Act 1966, which allowed TTUTA to be recognised as a union for teachers, alongside the three other teachers unions in the country. This proposal was strongly rejected at a mass meeting of members of the Association in March 1981. Under continued pressure from the mass of teachers the government conceded and the Education Act 1966 was amended to give TTUTA full recognition as the majority union for teachers. The Registration, Recognition and Certification Board accorded official recognition of the Association in December 1981. Affiliations TTUTA is affiliated to Caribbean Union of Teachers (CUT) and the Education International (EI), the International federation of teacher associations and trade unions. The Union was affiliated to NATUC until the split which resulted in the formation of FITUN. It is not currently affiliated to any national trade union centre.

A former leader of the National Religious Party, he later led a breakaway faction, Ahi, which merged into Likud in 2009. He served as a member of the Knesset between 2003 and 2009. Biography A Hardal Israeli, he was born in kibbutz Ein Gev and received a secular education. When he was old enough, Eitam joined the Israeli Defense Forces. Eitam has an M.A. in Political Science and in International Relations. He is also a former student of the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva, and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He is married, has eight children, and lives in the Israeli settlement of Nov in the Golan Heights. Military career Eitam was drafted into the IDF in 1971, and volunteered for the Shayetet 13 naval commando force, but was dismissed after a year, and did his military service in the Golani Brigade.Amos Harel, All for a Joyride, Haaretz, July 29, 2008. He was sent to Officer Candidate School and in 1973 was commissioned as an infantry officer and return to the Golani Brigade. During the Yom Kippur War He served as a platoon leader in the Brigade's 12 battalion and fought with his sergeant to stop Syrian tanks from penetrating the Golan Heights' Nafah base, using 3 Bazooka bombs and a heavy machine gun, and later rescued the wounded from Nafah. For his heroism, he has earned Israel's Medal of Distinguished Service. Later on Eitam led the Brigade's Reconnaissance companyMerav Yudilovitch, Shooting ducks?, Ynetnews, March 01, 2007. during Operation Entebbe. Afterwards, he commanded Golani Brigade's 12 battalion in counter-guerrilla operations in South Lebanon and during the 1982 Lebanon War he led an officers' school battalion and a brigade. During the first Intifada, he commanded the Givati Brigade. In 1988, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin ordered the Israeli Army to beat Palestinian rioters. Eitam was heard over a radio telling his troops to beat and break the bones of a 21-year-old Palestinian prisoner named Ayyad Aqel. They beat him to death.Ian Black (2 November 1990). \\"Soldier jailed for intifada killing will sue Rabin.\\" The Guardian. An IDF court-martial convicted four of his soldiers, who testified against him. The Military Advocate General severely reprimanded Eitam and recommended that he never be promoted. Despite that, the IDF's Chief of General Staff, Ehud Barak, decided to promote him to the rank of Brigadier General. During the years 1997-1999, he commanded the 91st Division in counter-guerrilla operations in South Lebanon. He quit the Army in December 2000.Arieh O'Sullivan (27 December 2000). \\"Eitam quits IDF; seen heading for politics.\\" The Jerusalem Post. Political career After his retirement from military service, Eitam entered politics, joining the National Religious Party. Despite not being a member of the Knesset, he was appointed a Minister without Portfolio on 8 April 2002, serving until 18 September that year, when he became Minister of National Infrastructure. In 2002, Eitam called for Yasser Arafat to be killed. Of Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti, then being investigated by Israel, he said, \\"Take him out to an orchard and shoot him in the head.\\"(2002-07-05). \\"NRP leader Eitam: Arafat, Barghouti should be killed\\" The Jerusalem Post. He was first elected to the Knesset in January 2003 and was appointed Minister of Housing and Construction in March 2003. Disengagement plan and NRP split On 10 June 2004, Eitam and Yitzhak Levy quit the government to protest the disengagement plan. However, the National Religious Party refused to leave the coalition. Eventually, Eitam and Levi left the NRP, too, and formed the Renewed Religious National Zionist Party, later renamed Ahi, which would later join the National Union - a Knesset list of right-wing parties. In a harsh speech delivered on 11 January 2005, Eitam called Prime Minister Ariel Sharon \\"refuser of democracy\\" (\\"סרבן דמוקרטיה\\"), and attacked him for refusing to conduct a national poll on the plan. Eitam claimed Sharon was promoting the disengagement plan by threatening and firing objectors, and by making corrupt deals. Eitam also claimed that the left was running an incitement campaign against the settlers, which include provocations and calls to spill their blood, in order to delegitimize that right-wing campaign against the disengagement plan. Despite the harsh criticism, Eitam denounced military refusal and violence. He concluded that at the end of struggle, \\"If you don't listen to the call to bring back the decision to the healthy and strong people, we shall send you home, and it will be painful and shameful, that will erase the achievements of your manhood.\\" In March 2005, after the Israeli Southern Command issued a decree forbidding relocation to the Gaza Strip, Eitam announced his intention to go and live in Gush Katif in order to reinforce the settlers and help prevent their eviction. Eventually, over Passover, Eitam moved to Netzer Hazani. Left-wing members of the Knesset denounced Eitam's move, but the speaker of the house, Reuven Rivlin, said that the move fell under the immunity members of the Knesset have. After the evacuation of Netzer Hazani, Eitam moved to Netzarim, and accompanied them during their evacuation. Because of his objection to military refusal and violence, Eitam was a negotiator between the opposers to the plan and Israeli security forces. He arranged a massive weapons recall in all the settlement due to be removed, in order to prevent any chance of bullets being fired by accident or the heat of the moment.MK Effi Eitam (HaTzionut HaDatit) Maariv, 25 August 2005 He declared that the settlers would not use violence against Israeli security officers. Eitam also insisted that the removal forces would be unarmed. He explained his actions: \\"It is about the expulsion of thousands of people from their homes. It is important to reach negotiation and discussion, it is important to shape the rules of the struggle in such a way that it will be conducted with determination, and on the other hand won't pull Israel to the abyss from which there is no return. It is not about acceptance with the disengagement [plan], but on the contrary, it is a struggle of multitude of people who will struggle with responsibility.\\"Ezra: Whoever participates in the evacuation will not be armed Yedioth Ahronoth, 31 March 2005 In July 2005, Eitam initiated a \\"struggle treaty\\", and got members of the Knesset and rabbis to sign it. The treaty set the rules of struggle against the disengagement [plan] and the red lines. The treaty declared rejection of any kind of violence: :\\"Our struggle will be innocent of any form of violence. No one shall use physical or verbal violence against Israel Defense Forces soldiers, Israeli Police officers, and security forces members.\\" In addition, it was decided that the protest will be done unarmed, in order to prevent blood spilling or the use of firearms. The treaty was distributed in thousands of copies to the ten of thousands of participants of the \\"joining march\\" to Kfar Maimon. On 25 August 2005, Eitam was quoted as explaining that the reason there was no violence was not the security forces, but the settlers' own restraint and decision not to use violence. Eitam rebuked those who said that the settlers didn't use violence because they were afraid from the multitude of officers, and said: \\"We were not afraid from the multitude of cops and horses, it is ridiculous to think that our people, with swift boys, war-though men and its wives and men are scorned by mortar shells, explosive charges and graves, will be afraid of physical confrontation with the cops. This shallow and evil claim miss the main thing, and therefore so dangerous. Prior to the 2009 elections, Ahi merged into Likud allowing Eitam to pass his election financing to the party. Eitam decided to not run in this election. Amona On 2 February 2006, Eitam was injured when Israeli police tried to disperse a protest of thousands of Israeli settlers who were blocking the demolition of nine homes in the Israeli settlement of Amona in the West Bank. The protest became violent, and Eitam, who was one of three Israeli nationalist MKs amongst the crowds, was knocked down. Eitam was hospitalized with minor injuries.Efrat Weiss: MK Eitam: Amona was a pogrom ynetnews, 02.01.06 \\"MK Eitam sustained head wounds and was evacuated on a stretcher to Hadassah Mount Scopus hospital. An Eitam associate said the MK received oxygen and suffered from nausea following the injury.\\" Advocacy of expulsion of Israeli Arabs in 2006 After being re-elected on the joint National Union-National Religious Party list, Eitam caused controversy during a memorial ceremony for a fallen Israeli soldier on 10 September 2006, saying, \\"We'll have to expel the overwhelming majority of West Bank Arabs from here and remove Israeli Arabs from political system\\", and, \\"We have raised a fifth column, a group of traitors\\". Attorney-General Menachem Mazuz warned Eitam at the time that criminal charges could be brought against him if he repeated the statements. Ideology Eitam has called Israeli Arabs a \\"cancer\\": \\"[T]he Israeli Arabs are in large measure the ticking bomb beneath the whole democratic Israeli order inside the [1967] Green Line. Even today, in the Galilee and the Negev, a de facto autonomy of theirs is being created, which could in practice turn Israel into the bubble of Metropolitan Tel Aviv .… Therefore, I say that the State of Israel today faces an existential threat that is characterized by being an elusive threat, and elusive threats by their nature resemble cancer. Cancer is a type of illness in which most of the people who die from it die because they were diagnosed too late. By the time you grasp the size of the threat, it is already too late to deal with it.\\". Commenting on this, the veteran Israeli journalist, Akiva Eldar, wrote in Haaretz, \\"The fact that the Nazis were especially fond of this [cancer] metaphor is probably not lost on the general [public].\\" In 2004, Eitam called the Palestinians \\"dark forces\\", and said: \\"We will have to kill them all... I don’t mean all the Palestinians, but the ones with evil in their heads.\\" Jeffrey Goldberg (31 May 2004). \\"A Reporter at Large: Among The Settlers.\\" The New Yorker. In 2002, the Israeli Army used Nidal Abu Muihsein as a human shield, causing his death; Eitam called this “very moral”. In October 2005, Eitam opposed a Supreme Court of Israel ruling that banned the IDF from using Palestinians as human shields, stating that, \\"Supreme court judges demonstrated today that their pity for the cruel will prove cruel to the merciful and will expose Israeli soldiers to more danger\\". In November 2006, he called for an expulsion of most Palestinians from the West Bank: \\"Expel most of the Judea and Samaria Arabs from here. We cannot be with all these Arabs, and we cannot give up the land.\\"Eitam: Expel Palestinians, dismiss Arab MKs Ynetnews, 9 November 2006 In March 2008, he called for the expulsion of Israeli Arab members of the Knesset: \\"One day, we will expel you to Gaza from this house and from the national home of the Jewish people.\\" Eitam has called on the U.S. to attack Iran and destroy its suspected nuclear weapons program, adding that Israel was well-prepared to take such action alone, as \\"a nuclear Iran is not an option for Israel\\". In February 2007, he stated that in three to four years, Iran would \\"have a [nuclear] bomb and the missile to deliver it”.Israeli Rightist Warns That Bush’s Iraq Policy Could Hurt Effort To Combat Iran In December 2008, Eitam and his Ahi political party merged with Likud.Eitam’s Party Makes Deal With LikudThe Failure of the American Jewish Establishment In 2009-2010, he visited a series of US campuses as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's \\"Special Emissary\\" to the \\"Caravan for Democracy\\" program of the Jewish National Fund.E.

Early life; temperance  Goodell spent several years of his early childhood confined to his room due to illness. It was during this confinement that he first discovered an appreciation for religion and writing. Following the deaths of his parents, William moved to Pomfret, Connecticut to live with his paternal grandmother. He attended school but could not afford to go on to college. As a young adult, Goodell spent several years in various jobs in several different areas of the country, yet none of the work incorporated both of his interests in writing and religion. While working in Providence, Rhode Island in 1823, William met and married Clarissa C. Cady. The couple later had two children. In 1827, at age 35, Goodell became a journalist for a reform journal in Providence, allowing him to write from a religious perspective. His articles focused mostly on temperance. After moving the journal's headquarters to New York, Goodell became the leader of the American Temperance Society.  Abolitionist  In 1833 Goodell helped found the New-York Anti-Slavery Society, as well as the American Anti-Slavery Society (AASS). He worked as an editor of The Emancipator and served on the AASS Executive Committee. In 1835, Goodell quit his job at The Emancipator and directed his energy to the New York State Anti-Slavery Society, editing its paper the Friend of Man in Utica, New York. While in Utica, Goodell focused on achieving abolition through political means. He helped form the Liberty Party in 1840, writing the convention address and party platform. Two year later, Goodell left the Friend of Man and formed his own paper in order to promote church reform that followed abolitionist principles. Goodell believed that it was wrong for a church to hold even a neutral stance on slavery. He hoped to unite all of the churches denouncing slavery into a \\"Christian Union\\" and for nine years Goodell worked as a pastor of the anti-slavery churches in Honeoye, New York. In 1852, Goodell was chosen as the Liberty Party's nominee for President of the United States, with S.M. Bell of Virginia as his running mate. His party fought for the complete abolition of slavery as well as equal rights for African Americans. Although Goodell promoted the same principles, he was also wary of the realities of prejudice. If abolition were to instigate true societal changes, he believed, prejudices would have to be eliminated and equal rights gained for African Americans. Goodell was also a potential candidate for the Liberty Party in 1860. However, he didn't get the nomination. Goodell edited yet another paper called the American Jubilee (later renamed the Radical Abolitionist) during the 1850s. He also wrote an influential book entitled Slavery and Anti-Slavery: A History of the Great Struggle In Both Hemispheres; With a View of the Slavery Question in the United States, published in 1852. The next year he published The American Slave Code in Theory and Practice.William Goodell, The American Slave Code in Theory and Practice (New York, 1853). That book previewed discussions of \\"law in books\\" and \\"law in action\\" made by the legal realists.Alfred L. Brophy, Antislavery Women and the Origins of American Jurisprudence, Texas Law Review 94 (2015):115, 120-21. It also directly countered proslavery writing that increasingly justified slavery on economic grounds. Goodell countered such arguments in two ways. First, he argued that such utilitarian arguments ignored the human costs of slavery; second, he argued that slavery led to great costs and thus was not economically justified. After the Civil War When the Civil War ended, Goodell returned to fighting for his original cause of temperance and assisted in the creation of the Prohibition Party. He moved to Goshen, Connecticut, and later to Janesville, Wisconsin where he died. Goodell's daughter Lavinia Goodell (1839–1880) became the first woman admitted to practice law in Wisconsin, and his grandson, William Goodell Frost, served as president of Berea College.

It is developed by a community of programmers, artists, and academics interested in 3D character modeling. Technology MakeHuman is developed using 3D morphing technology. Starting from a standard (unique) androgynous human base mesh, it can be transformed into a great variety of characters (male and female), mixing them with linear interpolation. For example, given the four main morphing targets (baby, teen, young, old), it is possible to obtain all the intermediate shapes. Interpolation of MakeHuman characters: the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th are targets, while the others are intermediate shapes. Using this technology, with a large database of morphing targets, it's virtually possible to reproduce any character. It uses a very simple GUI in order to access and easily handle hundreds of morphings. The MakeHuman approach is to use sliders with common parameters like height, weight, gender, ethnicity and muscularity. In order to make it available on all major operating systems, beginning from 1.0 alpha 8 it's developed in Python using OpenGL and Qt, with an architecture fully realized with plugins. The tool is specifically designed for the modeling of virtual 3D human models, with a simple and complete pose system that includes the simulation of muscular movement. The interface is easy to use, with fast and intuitive access to the numerous parameters required in modeling the human form. The development of MakeHuman is derived from a detailed technical and artistic study of the morphological characteristics of the human body. The work deals with morphing, using linear interpolation of both translation and rotation. With these two methods, together with a simple calculation of a form factor and an algorithm of mesh relaxing, it is possible to achieve results such as the simulation of muscular movement that accompanies the rotation of the limbs. License MakeHuman is free and open-source, with the source code and database released under the GNU Affero GPL. Models exported from an official version are released under an exception to this, CC0, in order to be widely used in free and non-free projects. These projects may or may not be commercialised. Awards In 2004, MakeHuman won the Suzanne Award as best Blender Python script. Software history The ancestor of MakeHuman was MakeHead, a python script for Blender, written by Manuel Bastioni, artist and coder, in 1999. A year later, a team of developers had formed, and they released the first version of MakeHuman for Blender. The project evolved and, in 2003, it was officially recognized by the Blender Foundation and hosted on http://projects.blender.org.Still online, but stopped in 2004: http://projects.blender.org/projects/makeh/ In 2004, the development stopped because it was difficult to write a Python script so big using only Blender API. In 2005, MH was moved outside Blender, hosted on SourceForge and rewritten from scratch in C. At this point, version counting restarted from zero. During successive years, the software gradually transitioned from C to C++. While performant, it was too complex to develop and maintain. Hence, in 2009, the team decided to go back to the Python language (with a small C core) and to release MakeHuman as version 1.0 pre-alpha. Development continued at a pace of 2 releases per year. The stable version 1.0.0 was officially released March 14, 2014. MakeHuman 1.1.0 has been released May 14, 2016, around two years later. The most recent intermediate version is 1.1.1, as of March 5, 2017.http://www.makehumancommunity.org/wiki/Releases MakeHuman Release Notes A community website was established June 2015 featuring a forum section, a wiki, and a repository for user contributed content for the program.http://www.makehumancommunity.org/frontpage/welcome_to_the_new_community_site.html Welcome to the new Community Site Evolution towards a universal model topology Evolution of the hand topology Evolution of the head topology The aim of the project is to develop an application capable of modeling a wide variety of human forms in the full range of natural poses from a single, universal mesh. For this purpose, the design of a 3D humanoid mesh that can readily be parametrically manipulated to represent anatomical characteristics has been pursued, the mesh includes a common skeleton structure that permits character posing. MakeHuman Team developed a model that combines different anatomical parameters to transition smoothly from the infant to the elderly, from man to woman and from fat to slim. The initial mesh occupies a middle ground, being neither pronounced masculine, nor pronounced feminine, neither young nor old and having a medium muscular definition. Goal was to depict a fair-built androgynous form, named the HoMunculus. The current MakeHuman mesh has evolved through successive steps of MakeHuman project, incorporating lessons learned, community feedback and the results of considerable amounts of studies and experimentation. Evolution of the mesh for the human model: * A first universal mesh prototype (head only), done in 1999 using makeHead script, was adapted for the early MakeHuman in 2000. * The first professional mesh (HM01) for a human model was realized by Enrico Valenza in 2002. * A second remarkable mesh (K-Mesh or HM02) was modelled by Kaushik Pal in 2003. * The third model was created by Manuel Bastioni upon the Z-Mesh or HM03 in 2005. * With experience from preceding versions, a fourth mesh (Y-Mesh or HM04) was done by Gianluca Miragoli (aka Yashugan) in 2007. * The fifth mesh (HM05) was built on the previous one by Gianluca Miragoli and Manuel Bastioni in 2008. * A sixth mesh (HM06) was also created by Gianluca Miragoli in 2010. * Another mesh version was released in 2010 by Waldemar Perez Jr., André Richard, Manuel Bastioni. * The latest and state-of-the-art mesh, released in 2013, was modeled by Manuel Bastioni. Since the first release of makeHead (1999) and MakeHuman (2000), a challenge had been to construct a universal topology that retained all of the capabilities but added ability to interactively adjust the mesh to accommodate anatomical variety found in the human population. This could have been addressed by dramatically increasing the number of vertices for the mesh, but the resultant, dense mesh would have limited performance on processing computers. Technically, the model developed for MakeHuman is: * Light and optimized for subdivision surfaces modelling (15,128 vertices). * Quads only. The human mesh itself is triangles free, using Catmull-Clark subdivision for extra resolution to base meshes, see also polygon mesh. * Only E(5) Pole and the N(3) Pole, without holes and without 6-edge poles. Research usage Because of the freedom of the license, MakeHuman software is widely used by researchers for scientific purposes: MakeHuman mesh is used in industrial design, to verify the anthropometry of a project, and in virtual reality research, to quickly produce avatars from measures or camera views. MakeHuman characters are used in biomechanics and biomedical engineering, to simulate the behaviour of the human body under certain conditions or treatments. The human character model for a project of the construction of artificial mirror neuron systems was also generated by MakeHuman. The software was used for visuo-haptic surgical training system development. These simulations combine tactile sense with visual information and provide realistic training scenarios to gain, improve, and assess resident and expert surgeons' skills and knowledge. Full-body 3D virtual reconstructions have been performed using MakeHuman, and 3D analysis of early Christian burials (archaeothanatology). The tool has also been used to create characters to perform Sign Language movements. MakeHuman can also be used for nonverbal behavior research, like facial expressions, which involve the use of Facial Action Coding System  See also  * Facial Action Coding System * Blender software * Poser * Daz Studio * FaceGen * ManuelbastioniLAB, a free and open source plug-in for Blender for the parametric 3D modeling of photorealistic humanoid characters  References and Related Papers  External links * Category:Free 3D graphics software Category:3D modeling software for Linux Category:Anatomical simulation Category:Free software programmed in Python Category:3D graphics software that uses Qt Category:Windows graphics-related software Category:MacOS graphics software Category:Software using the GNU AGPL license ","title":"MakeHuman"},{"id":"10976695","text":"Aamir is a given name, a variation on the Arabic name Amir, common to the cultures of the Indian subcontinent.

Although he was nicknamed \\"Gorilla\\" for his exceptional reach, Jones is to be distinguished from the original \\"Gorilla Jones\\", who campaigned from 1913 to 1924 and held the World Colored Welterweight title. Jones was never knocked out. He had 52 knockouts out of his 101 wins, with over 141 total fights. He was posthumously inducted into World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1994 and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2009.  Early life and career  Jones was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on May 12, 1906. He dropped out of school and eventually started boxing at age 18. Jones turned professional in 1923 with Stephen \\"Suey\\" Welch as manager and trained with Joe Stanley. Jack McVey fell to Jones on June 25, 1929, in a ten round points decision at Boston's Braves Field before a substantial depression era crowd of 7,000. More of the fighting appeared to take place at long range, with Jones' right connecting most often, as his left was often blocked by McVey's glove. McVey's consistent aggressiveness appeared to turn the crowd in his favor, and he scored on occasion with a few left hooks to the head. The crowd booed the final decision in Jones' favor and resented his presentation of a championship belt from the Massachusetts Boxing Commission.\\"Fans Dislike Award to Gorilla Jones\\", Boston Globe, Boston, Massachusetts, pg. 9, 26 June 1929 He lost to Jewish boxer and reigning world welterweight champion Jackie Fields on October 21, 1929, in San Francisco before a crowd of 10,000. In an action-filled ten rounds, Jones took the early lead and rocked Fields several times with straight rights to the jaw, but Fields's stamina and aggressiveness wore Jones down in the closing rounds. Fields clearly took the ninth and tenth, and had a clear edge in five rounds, but could not defend against repeated rights from Jones throughout the bout.\\"Jackie Fields Defeats Jones\\", St. Cloud Times, St. Cloud, Minnesota, pg. 12, 22 October 1929\\"Fields Wins\\", The San Francisco Examiner, San Francisco, California, pgs. 23, 25, 22 October 1929 In a match two months later on December 13, referee Joe O'Connor stopped the bout, complaining that Jones was not giving his \\"usual exhibition\\" and ordered the promoter to pay the purses for both fighters. The Boston Globe felt the fight was legitimate, however, and that Jones's long arms against Fields's desire to fight at close range made the boxers look as though they were trying to avoid coming to blows.\\"Fields and Jones Ordered From Ring\\", Boston Globe, Boston, Massachusetts, pg. 9, 14 December 1929  World middleweight tournament, 1931  On August 25, 1931, Jones defeated Tiger Thomas in a ten round points decision in Milwaukee, in what several boxing historians would later consider a world middleweight championship bout. The bout, however, was only the first round in a tournament to determine the world middleweight champion to replace Mickey Walker. Jones showed superior speed and took a strong points margin, despite a slow start in the first few rounds. He showed better speed and superior ring craft than his opponent.\\"Gorilla Wins First Battle\\", The Akron Beacon Journal, Akron, Ohio, pg. 16, 26 August 1931 In the second round of the NBA middleweight tournament, Jones defeated Clyde Chastain in a sixth round technical knockout on September 17, 1931. A cut above Chastain's eye caused by the lace of Jones' glove played no small part in the referee's decision to end the bout in the sixth. Jones had the advantage in three rounds, Chastain in only one, and one was even.\\"Knocked Out By Clivelle in Fifth Round\\", Stevens Point Journal, Stevens Point, Wisconsin, pg. 6, 18 September 1931 In a ten round points decision in Milwaukee, Jones defeated George Nichols on November 3, 1931, in the third round of the world middleweight tournament. Though Nichols was the aggressor throughout the early rounds, Jones' great defensive work kept him out of trouble. From the fourth to seventh, Jones acted as the aggressor building up a points lead. Nichols did little damage to Jones until the seventh, landed two strong blows to the body in the ninth, and continued his offensive in the tenth, but Jones' points margin was too great to overcome. Jones was able to coast through much of the eighth and ninth, though the tenth saw both boxers trying for a knockout. The crowd of 3,500 did not find the decision entirely to their liking.\\"2 Advance to Semi-Finals in Ring Tourney\\", News-Record, Neenah, Wisconsin, pg. 5, 4 November 1931\\"Italian, Negro, Win Elimination Bouts for Title\\", Chippewa Herald Telegram, Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, pg. 7, 4 November 1931  Taking the world middleweight championship, January 1932  He won the National Boxing Association World Middleweight Title vacated by Mickey Walker with a technical knockout over Oddone Piazza on January 25, 1932, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The match was the final round of the championship tournament to decide the new world middleweight champion. With hard rights to the head and body in the third, Jones finished the series with two hard blows to the body and one to the head indicating he was close to ending the bout. In the sixth, Jones pounded Piazza with everything he had, when a solid right put Piazza on the canvas for a count of four. When he arose, he tried to cover up when Jones continued to pound at him, but the referee wisely stopped the bout.Lyman, Winthrop, \\"Gorilla Jones Scores Technical Knockout\\", Wisconsin State Journal, pg. 15, 26 January 1932 On March 31, 1932, Jones defeated powerful hitter, Chuck Burns in a third round knockout in Akron, Ohio. Jones floored Burns three times in the third with a flock of lefts and rights, before sending him to the mat for the fourth and final time. Burns had not been knocked out in a previous bout. The first two rounds were slow as Jones assessed his opponent, but he came out roaring in the third.Becker, Fred, J., \\"Gorilla Jones Knocks Out Chuck Burns\\", The Evening Independent, Massillon, Ohio, page 17, 1 April 1932 In a world middleweight title defense, Jones defeated Young Terry on April 26, 1932, in a twelve round unanimous points decision before a partisan crowd of 7,000 rooting for Terry, at the Armory in Trenton, New Jersey. A right to the heart and a short left to the chin made Terry's knees nearly crumble in the eighth, but he avoided a knockout. Terry made Jones miss on occasion, but Jones dominated throughout the bout, took the offensive, and showed better ringcraft in the well fought bout.Schlemmer, James W., \\"Gorilla Retains Title, Outpoints Young Terry\\", The Akron Beacon Journal, Akron, Ohio, pg. 16, 27 April 1932  Losing the world middleweight championship, June 1932  Jones lost the belt later that year on June 11 in Paris, to Frenchman Marcel Thil from an eleventh round disqualification. The New York Times wrote that Jones was losing on points when he was disqualified after having been warned for holding and hitting low. The crowd of 70,000 was the largest to attend a prize fight in Paris for years. On April 19, 1933, Jones fought a six round no contest against Jewish boxer Ben Jeby, reigning world middlweight champion, before a crowd of 8,000 at Public Hall in Cleveland, Ohio. The referee stopped the bout because of a lack of effort from both fighters.\\"Cleveland Commish Witholds Purses of Ben Jeby And Jones\\", The Journal Times, Racine, Wisconsin, pg. 29, 20 April 1933  Taking the American middleweight championship, January 1933  Jones won the American Middleweight Championship in a seventh round knockout against Sammy Slaughter on January 30, 1933 in Cleveland. The title was recognized by the National Boxing Association, but was a national and not a world title, as some reporters later claimed. In the second through sixth, Jones either gained a margin or coasted waiting to strike a telling blow against his opponent. In the fifth and sixth, Slaughter reached Jones' face with high overhand rights which affected the judges' scoring more than Jones. Finally in the sixth, Jones ended the bout with a right to the nose, and a hard right to the jaw, followed by a lighter side blow to the jaw that put Slaughter down for the count.Schlemmer, James, \\"Jones Stops Slaughter in Seventh\\", The Akron Beacon Journal, Akron, Ohio, pg. 22, 31 January 1933  Final attempt at world middleweight championship, January 1937  On New Year's Day 1937, he took on Freddie Steele, the National Boxing Association World Middleweight and NYSAC World Middleweight Title holder, in a title match, but lost in a tenth round unanimous decision. Before a disappointing crowd of 4,000, Steele scored repeatedly with long lefts and right crosses to the head. After a left to the face, Steele dropped Jones in the third with a crushing right to the chin, but Jones was up quickly. From the fourth through the tenth, Steele was the aggressor and built a comfortable points margin. Steele was awarded all but one round from Jones, who took only the second.Steele took all but one round in Weekes, William, \\"Steele Beats Gorilla Jones\\", Green Bay Gazette, Green Bay, Wisconsin, 2 January 1937Dropped Jones in third in Weeks, William, \\"Steele Victor in Title Bout\\", The Indianapolis Star, Indianapolis, Indiana, pg. 13, 2 January 1937 Jones had previously lost to Steele on September 17, 1935, in a ten round uanimous decision in Seattle. On May 22, 1934, the two had fought a ten round decision on points in Seattle. On August 9, 1937, Jones defeated former world welterweight champion Tommy Freeman in a ten round points decision in Council Bluffs, Iowa. In a slow feature bout, Jones took most of the offensive from the third round on.\\"Gorilla Jones Beats Freeman\\", Iowa City Press, Iowa City, Iowa, pg. 9, 10 August 1937 Jones lost to former middleweight champion Babe Risko on May 10, 1938, in a ten round points decision in Akron, Ohio, before a modest crowd of 1,538. Jones was tagged repeatedly by Risko, a heavier boxer with a longer reach. Risko's left jab, which frequently led to following rights was a problem for Jones throughout the bout though he took a number of rounds in the close bout. Jones took quite a beating in the fifth, and performed his best in the seventh, though Risko had enough points to use his left jab for defense to coast a bit in the final two rounds.\\"New Yorker's Left Jab Upsetting to Akronite\\", The Akron Beacon Journal, Akron, Ohio, pg. 16, 11 May 1938 His last win was two years later on January 24, 1939, against Angelo Puglisi, a ten round points decision in Seattle. After his last fight, a loss to Vern Earling on May 29, 1940, he retired from boxing. Jones was already beginning to have mild vision problems from cataracts.\\"Memories of Gorilla Still Linger\\", The Akron Beacon Journal, Akron, Ohio, pg. 71, 19 January 1982  Life and work after boxing  Jones performed some training duties from the mid- to late 1940s until the 1970s, working with Milo Savage, Johnny Wells, Irish Bob Murphy, and later with Suey Welch's boxer Gil King during the early 1970s. Jones served in WWII. In the 1950s, he taught boxing at the Boys Club in Watts. After the war, he worked for Mae West, whom he had known since he was 22, becoming her boyfriend, chauffeur and bodyguard. West was his employer, friend and supporter until her death in 1980. Jones suffered from failing eyesight in his later years from diabetes. He was also among many boxers who attended the funeral of Feab S. Williams (better known as \\"George Godfrey\\").https://ladailymirror.com/2018/08/21/black-l-a-1947-heavyweight- fighter-george-godfrey-the-black-shadow-of-leiperville-dies-at-50/  Death  Jones died from arteriosclerosis and diabetes at his home near McArthur Park on January 4, 1982, in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 75.Morrison, Pat, \\"Gorilla Jones, Fighter and Gentleman\\", Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 25, 6 January 1982 He was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in East Los Angeles.Buried in Evergreen Cemetery, \\"The Southland\\", Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 47, 10 January 1982  Notable bouts   center;\\" colspan=\\"7\\" - center; background:#e3e3e3;\\"  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Result  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Opponent  style=\\"border- style:none none solid solid; \\"Type  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Rd., Time  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Date  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Location  style=\\"border- style:none none solid solid; \\"NotesGorilla Jones' Professional Boxing Record.

It is protected as a state threatened species in Maine. Description Its leaves are kidney-shaped and persistent. Underground shoots are shallow-growing, fleshy rhizomes that branch to form a clump. The flowers bloom from April through June, are hairy, and have three sepals, tan to purple on the outside and lighter inside, with tapered tips and bases fused into a cup. Pollinated flowers develop into a pod, which splits open when ripe to reveal seeds with elaiosomes, structures that are eaten by ants (myrmecochory). The diploid chromosome number is 26. Toxic substance The plant contains aristolochic acid, a carcinogenic compound. The United States Food and Drug Administration warns that consumption of aristolochic acid-containing products is associated with \\"permanent kidney damage, sometimes resulting in kidney failure that has required kidney dialysis or kidney transplantation. In addition, some patients have developed certain types of cancers, most often occurring in the urinary tract.\\" April 11, 2001.  Uses  The long rhizomes of A. canadense were used by Native Americans as a seasoning. It has similar aromatic properties to true ginger (Zingiber officinale), but should not be used as a substitute because it contains an unknown concentration of the carcinogen aristolochic acid and asarone. The distillate from the ground root is known as Canadian snakeroot oil. The odor and flavor are spicy. It has been used in many flavor preparations. Native Americans used the plant as a medicinal herb to treat a number of ailments including dysentery, digestive problems, swollen breasts, coughs and colds, typhus, scarlet fever, nerves, sore throats, cramps, heaves, earaches, headaches, convulsions, asthma, tuberculosis, urinary disorders, and venereal disease. In addition, they also used it as a stimulant or appetite enhancer, and as a charm. It was also used as an admixture to strengthen other herbal preparations. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  A. canadense  A. canadense foliage }  References  External links * * canadense Category:Groundcovers Category:Plants used in traditional Native American medicine Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Plants used in Native American cuisine Category:Flora of Canada Category:Flora of the United States ","title":"Asarum canadense"},{"id":"10976926","text":"Washington Square is a surface light rail stop on the MBTA Green Line C branch, located in the median of Beacon Street in the Washington Square neighborhood of Brookline, Massachusetts.

Since 1982 he has been affiliated with Princeton University, where he is Henry W. Putnam Professor of Religion. Early life and education Albert Raboteau was born into a Catholic family in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, three months after his father, Albert Jordy Raboteau (1899–1943), was killed there by a white man. The boy was named for his late father,Albert J. Raboteau, A Sorrowful Joy: A Spiritual Journey of an African-American Man in Late Twentieth-Century America (Paulist Press, 2002: ), p. 14. who was of African and French Creole descent. His father was killed in an era of white supremacy and legal racial discrimination in the state: the man who killed his father claimed self-defense and was never prosecuted for the crime. His widowed mother moved the family from Mississippi, where she was a teacher, to find a better place in the North for her children to grow up. She married again, to Royal Woods, an African-American minister. They lived in Ann Arbor, Michigan, for a period and in California. Raboteau's stepfather taught the boy Latin and Greek starting at the age of five years, and helped him to focus on church and education as he grew up. Raboteau attended Catholic parochial and high schools. When he was 11 years old he traveled with other choir boys from St. Thomas Catholic Church of Ann Arbor to sing in an international choir festival at the Vatican.\\"St. Thomas Catholic Church Choir Boys Apply For Passports To Rome, April 1954\\", Ann Arbor News, April 3, 1954; \\"Something to Sing About\\", Ann Arbor News, April 18, 1954; accessed August 28, 2018. Raboteau was accepted into college at the age of 16. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree at Loyola University in Los Angeles, California in 1964 and a Master of Arts degree in English from the University of California, Berkeley.Wardell J. Payne (ed.), Directory of African American Religious Bodies: A Compendium by the Howard University School of Divinity (Howard University Press, 1995: ), p. 270. Raboteau married and started a family. Raboteau entered the Yale Graduate Program in Religious Studies, where he studied with American religious historian Sydney Ahlstrom and African-American historian John Blassingame, receiving his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1974. Career Raboteau's dissertation, later revised and published as the book Slave Religion: The \\"Invisible Institution\\" in the Antebellum South, was published just as the black studies movement was gaining steam in the 1970s. It was a time of revolutionary scholarship on American slavery: Blassingame's Slave Community (1972) and Slave Testimony (1977); Eugene Genovese's Roll, Jordan, Roll (1974), Olli Alho's The Religion of Slaves (1976), and Lawrence Levine's Black Culture and Black Consciousness (1977).Raboteau, \\"Afterword,\\" Slave Religion, updated edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004). In 1982 Princeton University hired Raboteau, first as a visiting professor and then as full-time faculty. He is Henry W. Putnam Professor of Religion. His research and teaching focus on American Catholic history, African-American religions, and religion and immigration issues. He chaired the Department of Religion (1987–92) and also served as dean of the Graduate School (1992–93). He received the Lifetime Service Award (Journey Award) in both 2005 and 2006. In 2005, he also received the special Achievement Award (Journey Award). In 2013 Raboteau retired but continues to teach as a professor emeritus. He is studying \\"the place of beauty in the history of Eastern and Western Christian Spirituality.\\" Personal life In the late 20th century, Raboteau converted to Eastern Orthodoxy at a time of personal crisis and divorce from his first wife. At the time of his conversion, he took the name Panteleimon, meaning the \\"all merciful\\".Albert J.

Retrieved June 24, 2009. Early years Born in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1981, Kimmie Weeks was nine years old when he experienced the First Liberian Civil War at first hand. He and his mother, Estina Ntow, were forced to leave their home and marched with many other displaced Liberians to a refugee camp set up in university buildings. A classroom filled to capacity with 30 people became his home. While in the camp, Kimmie became deathly ill - dehydrated due to cholera, he also contracted chickenpox and yellow jaundice.Kathryn Hawkins, \\"A New Hope for Africa: Young Liberian Activist, Kimmie Weeks\\", Gimundo, February 26, 2008.

He saw no doctor, no nurse and was administered no medicine except for a few herbs.Sonia Azad, \\"West African child rights activist – Kimmie Weeks\\", Peace News, March 2008, Issue 2495. When other refugees sharing the classroom with them could no longer find a pulse in Kimmie, it was decided, over his mother's objections, that he had died. He was thrown still alive onto one of many piles of dead bodies in the refugee camp.\\"The Survivor\\", , Retrieved June 24, 2009. Kimmie's mother refused to accept that he was dead. She searched until she found his body and resuscitated him, beating on his chest and shaking him until he regained consciousness. That same night, Kimmie vowed to dedicate the rest of his childhood and adult life to making the world a better place for children. His early projects were small community-based initiatives, which he and groups of children his age carried out to help their own community. At the age of 14, he heard about the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) for the first time and began to organize community initiatives to promote the CRC and the concept that \\"children should be seen AND heard.\\" Initial projects Kimmie Weeks visits internally displaced people camps in Sierra Leone. Weeks co-founded Voice of the Future Inc. (VOF) in 1994 along with Richelieu Allison. The organization set its mission to work as an advocacy organization for the rights of children in Liberia. Over the years, it developed close connections with the United Nations and worked as an implementing partner for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).\\"Too Young to Fight\\", Time For Kids, October 2003. VOF provided informal health care and education to children across Liberia through a network of more than 4,000 volunteers..\\"The Amherst Story Project: \\"Kimmie Weeks' Story\\", 2005. In 1996 Weeks, now 15, founded and chaired the Children's Disarmament Campaign. With support from UNICEF, the campaign lobbied a deadline for the disarmament of child soldiers, meeting warring faction, political, spiritual leaders and heads of civic societies to set a date for the disarmament of child soldiers. Several marches, indoor programs and publicity campaigns were also held to attract attention to the cause.Richardson, Emily: \\"Amherst College graduate Kimmie Weeks wins Brick Award\\", 2007. In 1997, with the holding of general disarmament in Liberia, Weeks established Liberia's first children's information service, The Children's Bureau of Information, which worked alongside Search for Common Ground/Talking Drum Studio to produce radio programs aimed at reintegrating child soldiers into the community. The 15-minute weekly broadcasts are aired on three local radio stations. In 1998, the Liberian government of Charles Taylor made several attempts to assassinate Weeks because of a report he issued on the Liberian government's involvement in the training of child soldiers.Rupert, James, \\"Liberia's Nervous Leader; Taylor Focuses on Security While His Nation Lies Shattered\\", Washington Post, January 14, 1999.

Design and development The United States Navy and Curtiss felt that the F11C-2 possessed development potential, and the Navy decided to procure a variant with retractable landing gear. This variant, which still had the F11C-2's classic \\"Hawk\\" wood wing with its flat-bottomed Clark Y airfoil, was designated XF11C-3 by the Navy and Model 67 by Curtiss. The main gear retraction system was inspired by the Grover Loening-designed system on the Grumman XFF-1 prototype, and was manually operated. The XF11C-3 was first delivered to the USN in May 1933, with a Wright R-1820-80 radial engine rated at . Trials revealed a increase in speed over the F11C-2, but the extra weight caused a decrease in maneuverability. The Navy felt the handling degradation was more than offset by the increase in speed, however. During testing the XF11C-3 had its wood-framed wing replaced by the metal-structured, biconvex, NACA 2212 airfoil wing, and soon after was redesignated XBF2C-1 (Model 67A) in keeping with the new Bomber-Fighter category. Operational history Three BF2C-1s of VB-5 from in 1934. Chinese Hawk III, the primary fighter-bomber of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force opposing the Japanese invasion in 1937, until superseded by Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 fighters Twenty-seven BF2C-1 were ordered by the U.S. Navy, with a raised rear turtledeck, a semi-enclosed cockpit, and a metal-framed lower wing. It was armed with two .30 calibre Browning machine guns and three hardpoints for of external stores. Delivered in October 1934, they were assigned to VB-5 on the aircraft carrier , but served only a few months before difficulties with the landing gear led to their withdrawal. In spite of its short service run many of the innovations developed for the Goshawk line found wide use in Navy aircraft for years to follow. They were the last Curtiss fighter accepted for service with the U.S. Navy. The export version Model 68 Hawk III reverted to the classic wood/Clark Y wings and was powered by a R-1820-F53. Chinese Hawk IIIs served as multi- purpose aircraft when combat operations against the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces began in earnest in August 1937, and were considered the Nationalist Chinese Air Force's frontline fighter-pursuit aircraft along with their inventory of Hawk IIs, Boeing Model 281 \\"Peashooters\\" and Fiat CR.32s. Col. Gao Zhihang scored a double-kill against the superior Mitsubishi A5M \\"Claude\\" (predecessor of the A6M \\"Zero\\") over Nanking on 12 October, 1937 while at the controls of his Hawk III numbered \\"IV-I\\" (4th Pursuit Group, Commander).https://www.historynet.com/high-aviation-ideals.htm These aircraft were used against both the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces and both ground and naval targets with considerable success through the end of 1937, before being superseded by the better-armed and faster Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 fighters. In the summer of 1940, nine surviving Hawk-III fighters, the F11C exported to the Nationalist Chinese Air Force, served as night fighters to defend the Chinese wartime capital Chongqing from Japanese night bombing runs with the 22nd Squadron of the 4th Group. In early 1935, Thailand placed an order for 24 Curtiss Hawk IIIs at a cost of 63,900 Baht each, and a manufacturing license was also bought. The first 12 Hawk IIIs were shipped to Thailand in August and the remaining 12 arrived in late 1935, which were named Fighter Type 10. A total of 50 Hawk IIIs were locally built during 1937 and 1939. The type was used against the French in the Franco-Thai War and the Japanese invaders in December 1941, then relegated for use as trainers. Some of these aircraft were still active in 1949 and one airframe (KH-10) survives in the Royal Thai Air Force Museum.. The RTAF Museum is home to the only surviving Hawk III.

The lead ship of her class, she was named for the USS Catskill, a Civil War monitor and the second U.S. naval vessel to bear the name. Service history Originally classified as CM-6; laid down, 12 July 1941 under Maritime Commission Contract (MC hull 106); reclassified to AP-106 on 1 May 1943; and to LSV-1 21 April 1944. She was launched 19 May 1942 by Willamette Iron and Steel Corporation of Portland, Oregon; sponsored by Mrs. J. G. McPherson; and commissioned 30 June 1944 with Captain R. W. Chambers, USNR, in command. 1944 Catskill sailed from San Diego on 12 August 1944 for Hawaii, where she embarked marines, and proceeded by way of Eniwetok for Manus, where she joined the transport group of the Southern Attack Force for the assault on Leyte. This group sailed 14 October for the return to the Philippines, and entered Leyte Gulf without event, anchoring off Dulag 20 October to launch the initial attack. The landing was successful, and Catskill completed her offloading and was able to retire in the afternoon of 22 October, before the start of the battle for Leyte Gulf. Catskill returned to New Guinea, then sailed to Morotai, where from 5 to 10 November 1944 she loaded troops and cargo under almost continuous enemy air raids. As her convoy proceeded north with these reinforcements for Leyte, it came under enemy air attack on 13 November, and Catskills gunners contributed to shooting down Japanese aircraft. Unloading in Leyte Gulf took place on 14 November, and Catskill got underway at once for Manus, and New Guinea, where she took part in special training. 1945 Returning to Manus 21 December 1944, Catskill sailed 10 days later with the Lingayen Attack Force, which came under air attack, although not in Catskills sector, as it made its final approach. On 9 January 1945 the landings were successfully made on beaches that the Japanese had considered too difficult for an amphibious assault. The force was under repeated air attack, but Catskill accomplished her part of the landing, and cleared Lingayen for Leyte 10 January. Anchoring two days later, she loaded Army troops and cargo for the first reinforcement of Lingayen 27 January. Arriving in the Solomon Islands 11 February 1945 Catskill began intensive training for the Okinawa operation. On 21 March, she anchored in Ulithi, staging area for the massive assault, and on 27 March got underway for the initial assault on 1 April, in which she landed units of the 6th Marines. That night, she moved out to sea, and for the next four days, returned to the beachhead area daily to complete her unloading of men and cargo. Returning to Saipan 9 April, Catskill continued on to San Francisco, arriving 13 May. Between 16 May and 14 June 1945 Catskill made a voyage from San Francisco to Pearl Harbor carrying vehicles and general cargo, and steamed to Pearl Harbor once again. She loaded troops there for Eniwetok, Saipan, and Guam, and after carrying out this assignment, proceeded to Manila, arriving 5 July. Here she remained until 20 September, when she sailed laden with Army troops for the occupation of Japan. Catskill anchored in Wakayama Bay on 25 September, and cleared Japan 1 October for the Philippines, where she embarked homeward-bound servicemen. She arrived in San Francisco 27 October, and sailed again 10 November on the first of two more voyages to bring troops home from Guam, Ulithi, Peleliu, and Eniwetok. On 21 December 1945 Catskill sailed from San Diego for Guam with the 90th Marine Corps Replacement Draft which was eventually headed for China. She arrived in Guam on 18 January 1946. Decommissioning and conversion, 1946–1967 On 10 February 1946 Catskill arrived at San Diego, where she was placed out of commission in reserve 30 August 1946. Laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet, San Diego Group, Catskill was reclassified as mine countermeasures support ship MCS-1 on 18 October 1956. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register 1 July 1961, she was reinstated 1 June 1964. Converted to an MCS in fiscal year 1964 at Boland Machine Manufacturing Company of New Orleans, Louisiana from 25 June 1964 to 8 September 1967, Catskill (MCS-1) was recommissioned 6 October 1967. Vietnam, 1967–1970 During the Vietnam War Catskill participated in the following campaigns: * Tet 69/Counteroffensive (5 to 11 May 1969) * Vietnam Summer-Fall 1969 (9 to 18 June 1969) * Vietnam Winter-Spring 1970 (14 March to 12 April 1970) * Sanctuary Counteroffensive (28 to 30 June 1970) * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase VII (1 July 1970) Decommissioned in December, 1970 at the Naval Shipyard in Long Beach, California, Catskill was struck from the Naval Register and believed to have been scrapped.

During the almost seven decades of his career, he held a series of academic and government advisory positions, founded several organizations, published books and essays on economic policy. His works concerned business cycles, growth theory, history of economic thought and other areas of economics. Lipiński was a fighter for Polish independence and a socialist activist in the Second Polish Republic. In the Polish People's Republic, Lipiński was an influential Marxian economist and a long-term member of the communist party. Outspoken in his criticism of government policies, he became active in opposition circles. Life, career and social activism Lipiński was born at Nowe Miasto, Congress Poland in the Russian Empire. He was briefly jailed in 1906 for protesting Tsarist rule in Poland. Educated in Leipzig from 1909–12, he obtained a doctorate in economics from the University of Zurich prior to World War I. After World War I, in early independent Poland, he participated in the Polish–Soviet War. He organized and directed the Institute of Prices and Business Cycles in 1928. From 1929, he was professor in the Warsaw School of Economics. He founded the Central Statistical Office and the Polish Economic Association. He also served as president of the Economic Association (1945–65), was editor of the periodical Ekonomista ('The Economist'), and a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Being Poland's foremost economist, Lipiński was also a notable author whose works are widely read in his native Poland, though many have not yet been translated into English. In 1938, he actively opposed the antisemitic campaign carried out at institutions of higher learning by Polish nationalistic factions and supported by the Camp of National Unity party, which forced him to resign from his position at the School of Economics. During the occupation of Poland in World War II, Professor Lipiński held underground classes. After the war, he was briefly the chair of economics at the University of Warsaw and became one of the economic advisors to the Polish government. Lipiński was a member of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS-Lewica) since 1906. In 1948, when the PPS was merged with the communist Polish Workers' Party, he became a member of the new communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR). Throughout his postwar career, he frequently clashed with communist government economists regarding their inflexibility in applying Karl Marx's economic principles. An outspoken critic of Stalinism, Lipinski warned that \\"over-organization\\" of economic policy and rigid adherence to the party line, even in the face of rapidly changing conditions that required immediate action beyond the scope of the routine, would stifle growth. Because of his criticism, when the hard line Stalinist faction of Bolesław Bierut gained power in 1949, Lipiński was forced to resign as chair of economics at the university and banned from delivering some of his lectures. After the Polish October of 1956, Lipiński briefly returned as an economic advisor, but when the new government lost its zeal to reform, he became sidelined again. His candidature was one of many that were put forward by the people, but discarded by the government screening commission in the Polish legislative election in 1957. Lipiński became one of the prominent critics of the government. His position as a known Marxist economist shielded him to certain extent from government persecution and allowed him to say things many others were unable to. Till the very end he remained convinced that some form of socialism is preferable to capitalism. He signed three public letters criticizing the communist government: the Letter of 34 in 1964, the Letter of 59 in 1975 and the Letter of 14 in 1976. In 1977 he was expelled from the PZPR. In the spring of 1976, Lipiński sent an open letter to First Secretary Edward Gierek of the PZPR, criticizing the drastic price increase on foodstuffs that Gierek imposed in an attempt to balance Poland's import-based economy that relied heavily on Western loans. Gierek, who came to power after the overthrow of Władysław Gomułka, promised to improve the quality of life of Polish workers by raising wages and stabilizing prices. In his letter Lipiński wrote \\"Socialism cannot be decreed. It is and may only be born of free actions of free people\\" and pledged that \\"the movement of revival shall gain strength and the recently intensified repression will not contain it for much longer…\\" Lipinski's letter came at the time of renewal of massive strikes and riots in Poland. The letter also coincided with the formation of the Workers' Defence Committee, which marked the beginning of successful cooperation of workers and intellectuals. Also known as the KOR, this group founded by Edward Lipiński, Stanisław Barańczak, Jan Józef Lipski and others gave assistance to worker protest participants jailed after the widespread strikes. Lipiński was one of the elder distinguished members of the organization, whose presence added a degree of protection from the authorities. The assistance provided by the KOR and the continual activities of its members helped, after another wave of strikes, make the Gdańsk Agreement of 1980 possible. On 23 September 1981, Lipiński gave a speech to Solidarity independent trade union first national congress, announcing the disbanding of the KOR. He heralded the arrival of Solidarity as a political force, saying \\"The KOR has recognized that its work has ended, and that other forces have arrived on a much more powerful scale. But the task of fighting for an independent Poland, for human and civil rights, is a fight that still must go on.\\" Works Lipiński is the author of nearly 200 books and essays on subjects ranging from the theory of economic fluctuations, a field upon which he wielded a great influence, to industrial performance, prices and planning, market structures, and in his early career, social issues. A great deal of his work was dedicated to socio-economic research. Never relying solely on mathematical models and theory to predict and explain economical phenomena, Lipiński is known for the emphasis on human creativity and spontaneity. In his seminal Karl Marx and Problems of Our Time, Lipiński posits that economics are a \\"complex social phenomena\\" and he draws on sociology and psychology to explain trends, as much as he relies on mathematics.

Hagedorn is a professor of criminal justice at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Biography and Books Hagedorn dropped out of college in 1967 to work full-time in the civil rights and then anti-war movements. He was doing community organizing in Milwaukee in 1981 when he observed gangs forming. He ran the city’s first gang diversion program and returned to school, getting his BS in 1985 and his MA in Sociology in 1987 from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. He studied under Joan Moore and received a PhD in Urban Studies in 1993 from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. Hagedorn’s first book, People & Folks, argued for more jobs than jails and applied William Julius Wilson’s underclass theory to gangs. He was the architect of a neighborhood-based, family centered social service reform that became the subject of his dissertation, published as Forsaking Our Children. With a crew of former gang members he conducted a multi-year re-study of Milwaukee gangs, which led to a second edition of People & Folks. In the first edition, Hagedorn predicted that if jobs were not created Milwaukee’s gangs would entrench in the illegal economy. This prediction, unfortunately, was supported by his subsequent research. Dr. Hagedorn accepted a tenure track position at the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1996. He was editor, along with Meda Chesney-Lind, of Female Gangs in America, reprinting many of the classic academic articles on female gangs. His interest turned to Chicago gangs, and he became immersed in the history of the Vice Lords and the importance of race. His global travels further informed his understanding of gangs, which led him to edit the volume Gangs in the Global City, and later to write A World of Gangs. In A World of Gangs, he applied Manuel Castells’ work in analyzing gangs, arguing that understanding the cultural struggle for identity was crucial in working with gangs. Mike Davis calls Hagedorn’s work the foundation of the critical school of gang studies. His most recent book, The In$ane Chicago Way, looks historically at gangs, organized crime, and corruption in Chicago.

It is owned by Collins-Habovick, LLC and is located in Concord, North Carolina, United States. Their products primarily consist plastic model airplane kits from World War II, though they also make model kits of planes and automobiles from other eras.Accurate Miniatures' Online Catalog History The original Accurate Miniatures was a Charlotte, North Carolina based plastic model company that began business in the mid-1990s. They filed for bankruptcy in June 2001. Later that year, Accurate Miniatures was purchased from the original owners by Hobby Investors LLC, now called Collins- Habovick, LLC. The transfer included the sale of the company name, logo, inventory, and intellectual property. Paul Bedford, former general manager of the original Accurate Miniatures, claims the deal was part cash and part debt assumption. In July 2001, Accurate Miniatures, in an attempt to get out of debt, prepared to sell as much as 70% of their tooling (model molds) to the Bologna, Italy based Italeri. Some of the molds included molds for the Avenger, Dauntless, Grumman F3F, Mustang, Stormovik, and Yak kits. However, the sale to Hobby Investors LLC nullified this deal.Opinions on Kit Manufacturers Unseen to Collins-Habovick was the financial disaster left by the previous management. When the previous management ceased operation, substantial debt remained behind. Mold sets like the B-25 and F-3F were not paid off completely, and mold commitments for the NASCAR stock car, SB2U, and an R-4 were not funded at all even though a fair amount of tooling had been complete. All of this (not including unpaid artists, printers, and many others) had to be overcome before anything else could be achieved. Only through the diligent work and patience of the small staff was Accurate Miniatures able to be resurrected to become a successful company that is praised by model builders for their high-quality kits and attention to detail.

He was a key figure in the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom for which he acted as the Chairman of the Administrative Committee.https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african- americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/100-amazing-facts/who-designed-the- march-on-washington/ Life Cleveland Robinson was born in Swabys Hope, in Manchester, Jamaica. After serving as a local constable and an elementary school teacher, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1944. When he arrived he took a job in a Manhattan dry goods store and very soon became active in District 65. In 1947 he owned his own shop; he went on to become a steward, and then a full-time organizer for the union. He was elected vice-president in 1950 and later in 1952 became secretary-treasurer. He held that position until he retired in 1992. When District 65 was affiliated with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Workers Union, Robinson held the positions of international vice-president and executive board member of that union. After disagreements with the retail, wholesale and department store workers union District 65 pulled out and organized the National Council of Distributive Workers of America and Robinson was elected president of the new body. In 1981, District 65 was affiliated with the United Auto Workers. At that time the union had 33,000 members in 37 states, Canada and Puerto Rico. Robinson was a stalwart of the civil rights movement. In 1957, he participated in the Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom. He was the chairman and one of the key organizers of the August 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. In September 1972, he helped to found the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists (CBTU), successor organization to the Negro American Labor Council (NALC), and served as its first vice-president. Robinson suffered from glaucoma for many years, and was legally blind in 1970. His level of commitment and activity was in no way impaired by this disability. He never lost touch with his Jamaican origins and traveled to the island often, keeping up a keen interest in a number of Jamaican-American political, cultural and fraternal organizations. Robinson died of kidney failure in New York City in August 1995. His papers are held by the Tamiment Library & Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives, New York University.http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/tamwag/wag_006_001/ Family His first wife was Sue Eliza Robinson, they had two sons and a daughter.

Then it was signed by Mayor Rob Waiz on July 13, 2006. The Commission reviews complaints and subjects of interests in the financing and campaigning of political campaigns in the city of Jeffersonville. The basis for the local ordinance was a model document from the National League of Cities and campaign-finance codes from a variety of U.S. cities, including Chicago and San Antonio. Municipal campaign finance code The Municipal Campaign Finance Code also known as the Jeffersonville Ethics Ordinance is what the Jeffersonville Ethics Commission use to enforce political campaigns.

Article II - Code of Conduct and explains things in fifteen sections from fiduciary duty all the way to prohibition of excepting donations from people with pending litigations against the city. Article III - Financial Disclosure refers to 94-OR-17 Section three of a previous ordinance regulating ethics for city officials and employees. Article IV - Board of Ethics which explains how members of the ethics commission are nominated to the position and how they will function and contains two sections. The composition of powers of the board and a Confidentiality clause. Article V - Sanctions for Violation contains three sections explaining the penalties and process of them. Article VI - Miscellaneous Provisions which covers severability. Article VII - Effective Date. Amended version The Municipal Campaign Finance Code would become amended with an ordinance numbering 2007-OR-562007-OR-56 in city records. In this amendment to the Municipal Campaign Finance Code it begins with an introduction, Article I definitions, and then into Article II Section 2.4 Receiving and Collecting Gifts and Favors. Section 2.4 restricts the context in which gifts or favors are given and what can be given. It also explains who can give gifts or favors and what amounts in certain situations can be given.

Then Section 2.6 Use or Disclosure of Confidential Information explains that officials, candidates, and city employees shall not disclose confidential information other than what required by law, performing his or her official duties, and as permitted in section 2.13.

He was drafted by the Carolina Panthers in the fifth round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He played college football for Oregon. He was also a member of the Miami Dolphins, Denver Broncos, San Diego Chargers and Dallas Cowboys. Early years Rosario attended Dayton High School in Dayton, Oregon. His father is Dominican and his mother is from Oregon. In his senior high school season, Rosario was named the 2002 Oregon 2A state defensive player of the year, and earned first-team all-state honors on both offense and defense in 2002 while leading the Pirates to the state 2A title. In a 45-20 victory against Amity in the 2002 2A state title game, Rosario rushed for 126 yards and four touchdowns on 22 carries. He was ranked as the No. 6 linebacker on the West Coast by SuperPrep after posting 144 tackles (75 unassisted), three quarterback sacks, and five interceptions as a free safety/middle linebacker. He returned three of those interceptions for touchdowns. On offense Rosario racked up 1,238 yards and 27 touchdowns rushing, plus two more touchdowns on punt returns. The 6-foot-4 Rosario also played center for the school’s two- time defending state basketball champions. As a junior, he was named first- team all-tournament after averaging 13.5 points and 8.8 rebounds in leading Dayton to its second straight state championship. Rosario also was a competitor on his high school track and field team. College career In 49 games at the University of Oregon, Rosario recorded 94 receptions for 1,003 yards and 11 touchdowns. He also rushed for 84 yards and two touchdowns on 27 carries. Rosario played four different positions for the Ducks - halfback, H-back, fullback and tight end - and also was a special teams star for Oregon. Rosario began his collegiate career at Oregon in 2003 and played H-back after being recruited primarily as a linebacker. He started three games as a freshman and made 12 catches for 131 yards and two touchdowns, and rushed for 55 yards and one touchdown on 17 carries. In his sophomore season (2004), Rosario was shifted to fullback from H-back, and caught 25 passes for 278 yards and six touchdowns. He also rushed for 29 yards and a touchdown in 10 carries. In 2005, Rosario's junior season, he moved to tight end from fullback, and caught 15 passes for 168 yards and two touchdowns.

As a rookie in 2007, he caught six passes for 108 yards (an 18.0 per-catch average) and two touchdowns. Rosario became just the third player in Carolina history to score a touchdown on first career NFL reception when he caught a five-yard pass from quarterback, Vinny Testaverde against the San Francisco 49ers on December 2, 2007. Rosario also returned two kickoffs for 39 yards (a 19.5 average). In the Panthers' 2008 season opener against the Chargers on September 7, Rosario overcame double coverage to catch a 14-yard touchdown pass in the back of the end zone as time expired, to give Carolina a 26-24 victory against the heavily favored San Diego Chargers. It is considered to be one of the most memorable catches in Carolina Panther history. When the game ended, Fox's final statistics leaderboard for the game mistakenly displayed the name of actress Rosario Dawson. He finished the 2008 season with 18 catches for 209 yards and 1 touchdown. He started 22 games for the Panthers over four seasons, but only 6 in 2010.

It is used to reverse the effects of super-potent opioid analgesics such as etorphine and carfentanil that are used for tranquilizing large animals. The drug is not approved for use in humans. Diprenorphine is the strongest opioid antagonist that is commercially available (some 100 times more potent as an antagonist than nalorphine), and is used for reversing the effects of very strong opioids for which the binding affinity is so high that naloxone does not effectively or reliably reverse the narcotic effects. These super-potent opioids, with the single exception of buprenorphine (which has an improved safety-profile due to its partial agonism character), are not used in humans because the dose for a human is so small that it would be difficult to measure properly , so there is an excessive risk of overdose leading to fatal respiratory depression. However conventional opioid derivatives are not strong enough to rapidly tranquilize large animals, like elephants and rhinos, so drugs such as etorphine and carfentanil are available for this purpose. Diprenorphine is considered to be the specific reversing agent/antagonist for etorphine and carfentanil, and is normally used to remobilise animals once veterinary procedures have been completed. Since diprenorphine also has partial agonistic properties of its own, it should not be used on humans in the event that they are accidentally exposed to etorphine or carfentanil. Naloxone or naltrexone is the preferred human opioid receptor antagonist. In theory, diprenorphine could also be used as an antidote for treating overdose of certain opioid derivatives which are used in humans, particularly buprenorphine for which the binding affinity is so high that naloxone does not reliably reverse the narcotic effects. However, diprenorphine is not generally available in hospitals; instead a vial of diprenorphine is supplied with etorphine or carfentanil specifically for reversing the effects of the drug, so the use of diprenorphine for treating a buprenorphine overdose is not usually carried out in practice. Because diprenorphine is a weak partial agonist of the opioid receptors rather than a silent antagonist, it can produce some opioid effects in the absence of other opioids at sufficient doses. Moreover, due to partial agonism of the KOR, where it appears to possess significantly greater intrinsic activity relative to the MOR, diprenorphine can produce sedation as well as, in humans, hallucinations.

Portrayed by Michael Nader, the character was introduced as a love interest for Alexis Colby in the series' fourth season in 1983. He became her third husband, and arguably the second great love of her life, after Blake Carrington. Even after the end of their marriage, Dex remained a strong force in Alexis's life. Dex Dexter remained on the series until its final episode in 1989. Nader did not reprise his role for the 1991 miniseries Dynasty: The Reunion, though the character was mentioned. Appearances Michael Nader first appeared as Farnsworth \\"Dex\\" Dexter on Dynasty in 1983. The character was soon paired with Alexis Colby (Joan Collins), and Nader remained on the series until its cancellation in 1989. Dex did not appear in the 1991 miniseries Dynasty: The Reunion. Jon-Erik Hexum, who had previously starred opposite Collins in a film, was one of the five actors under final consideration for the role. Nader credited his chemistry with Collins with getting him the part. Collins said of Nader, \\"He's a very romantic leading man and he has a certain sinister edge.\\" People noted in 1985 that Dex \\"was conceived as a minor and transitional character\\", but thanks to Nader, he \\"has turned into an unexpectedly popular one.\\" In 1985, Joe Klein of New York described Dex as a \\"multibillionaire-guerrilla-playboy-entrepreneur\\". Storylines Original series (1983–1989) Season 4 After ColbyCo. abruptly abandons its plans to acquire Denver-Carrington, board member Sam Dexter, an old friend of Blake Carrington's, sends his son Dex to meet with Blake to understand why. In episode 69, Dex confronts Blake and his ex-wife Alexis Colby. Dex and Alexis are immediately drawn to each other. Dex gets the best of Alexis in a business deal (he discovers information in her office and acts on it before she can) and offers her a 60-40 split so they can work together. Although Alexis resists, by episode 72 they become lovers. Their relationship is tempestuous and passionate. In episodes 82 & 83, Dex learns that Alexis has slept with Rashid Ahmed in order to sabotage a deal he has with Blake. A furious Dex confronts Alexis. She slaps him - and much to her shock, he slaps her back. Their fight soon turns to lovemaking. However, Alexis continues to demand independence from Dex and he turns to Denver- Carrington PR Director Tracy Kendall for solace in a one-night stand. Tracy tells Alexis about their affair, and Alexis ends their relationship. Season 5 After Alexis was arrested for the murder of Mark Jennings in episode 88, Dex rallies to her defense and bails her out of jail. After she is found guilty, Dex and Adam desperately try to clear her name. They eventually uncover evidence that Neal McVane was the killer and Alexis is freed. Soon after, Dex meets Alexis's daughter, Amanda Carrington, and they are immediately drawn together in a love-hate relationship. Dex argues with Alexis, who refuses to reveal who Amanda's father is, that she's behaving foolishly. This causes a rift between Dex and Alexis and draws Dex and Amanda closer together. In episode 99, Alexis attempts to build a family bond by planning a ski weekend. However, travel plans go awry and Dex and Amanda are snowed in alone. Their heated argument turns to passion, and they give in to their feelings and make love. Soon after, Alexis arrives and announces that she and Dex are going to be married. Now married to Alexis, Dex must rebuff Amanda's amorous advances. She tells Alexis that Dex has a mysterious past with businessman Daniel Reece, stemming from their experiences together in Vietnam. Daniel recruits Dex to accompany him on a top-secret paramilitary maneuver. In episode 109, Dex returns from the mission, without Daniel, suffering from a fever. In his delirium calls out for Amanda, arousing Alexis's suspicions. During his recovery, Amanda makes a final plea to Dex for them to be together, but Dex refuses. Amanda turns to Prince Michael of Moldavia and Alexis, who has a past with Michael's father, King Galen, is all too happy to push them to marry. After recovery, and against Alexis's wishes, Dex returns on his \\"mission\\" to rescue Daniel. When Daniel plans to complete his \\"mission,\\" Dex declines to join him. Unfortunately, in episode 115, Dex receives word that Daniel has been killed. Dex's continued emotions for Amanda will complicate her engagement to Prince Michael. When Moldavia rebels attempt to kidnap Amanda in episode 115, Dex manages to rescue her. Later, Amanda suspects that Michael is sleeping with Elena, a Moldavia noblewoman, and turns to Dex. He comforts her, arousing Michael's ire. Dex and Alexis fight over Amanda and Michael's wedding plans. Dex accuses Alexis of pushing Amanda into a loveless marriage to fulfill her own desires stemming from a thwarted teenage romance with King Galen. As their argument escalates, Dex tells Alexis that he's not going to attend the wedding and will return to Denver. In episode 117, as Dex leaves Moldavia, he encounters deliverymen bringing in crates in the middle of the night. Suspicious, he demands answers as to what they're doing. The deliverymen knock him unconscious and spirit him away. When he comes to, Dex is being held prisoner by the rebels. He realizes that they are planning to attack the wedding. Dex manages to break free and rushes to warn the wedding party. He arrives too late, however, and finds the chapel in carnage. He tries to prevent the rebel mastermind, Yuri, from shooting the King. Yuri manages to hit the King before Dex wrestles him to the ground. As the men struggle, the gun fires, and they both lie still surrounded by the bloody bodies of the entire Carrington family. Season 6 Dex survives the attack, as do most of the wedding guests. Dex is worried when Alexis is not released with the rest of the prisoners. Eventually she is released when Blake pays ransom for both her and Krystle. The King is missing and presumed dead, however, Alexis learns that he is being held for ransom. Dex agrees to help her rescue the King. They sneak into Moldavia where they are captured. In episode 125, Dex escapes and rescues Alexis and Galen. Upon returning to Denver, Dex refuses to let a paralyzed Galen recuperate in their home. Dex suspects (correctly) that Galen is feigning his paralysis and tries to force him to walk. When Alexis rushes to his defense, Dex is driven closer to Amanda. When Dex catches Alexis imagining herself as Queen of Moldavia (complete with crown) in episode 135, he is heartbroken. Amanda finds a drunken Dex and they make love again - only to be caught in the act by Alexis in episode 136. Alexis immediately flies to St Thomas for a quick divorce. In episode 137, Dex tries to reconcile but Alexis rejects him. He turns to Amanda, who soon after divorces the Prince. However, by episode 140, Dex tells Amanda that their relationship has no future. Dex continues to work on the Carrington-Colby pipeline project, hiring Clay Fallmont.

In their usual fashion, the argument turns passionate, and they are soon making love. Dex and Alexis's romance infuriates Ben, who attempts to drive them apart. Dex agrees to help Blake against Ben. Dex and Clay travel to Caracas to rescue Caress, Alexis's sister, whom Ben had falsely imprisoned when she uncovered evidence proving Blake's innocence. Dex meets an old work acquaintance, Leslie Saunders, who turns out to be Ben's long-lost daughter. Leslie works for Dex on the pipeline project. Dex and Alexis's relationship is short-lived. In episode 162, Blake and Alexis are in an oil rig explosion in the South China Sea. Dex and Krystle (Blake's wife) rush to the hospital, only do discover they have disappeared. In episode 163, they find out that Blake is suffering from amnesia, remembering nothing past 1964. Alexis has convinced Blake that they're still married. When Blake's memory returns, Dex accuses Alexis of still loving her ex-husband. They fight, and Dex finally tells Alexis he is leaving her for good in episode 165. In episode 165, Dex and Dominique Deveraux start spending time together, and romance seems poised to bloom. They travel together to Wyoming to visit Dex's father and his best friend, Boyd Curtis. Unfortunately, Boyd and his daughter are killed in a car wreck that same day. Dex convinces Boyd's widow, Sarah, to donate her daughter's heart to Blake and Krystle's ailing daughter, Krystina. At Adam Carrington's wedding, Dex chastises Alexis for her foolish dalliance with playboy Gavin Maurier. Alexis throws a drink in his face and storms out. Moments later, a band of men burst into the Carrington mansion brandishing guns. Dex attempts to stop them, only to be knocked unconscious. Season 8 Dex is held hostage, with the rest of the Carringtons by Krystle's deranged (and presumed dead) ex-lover, Matthew Blaisdel. Dex manages to escape, but is shot while running across the grounds of the estate. He is later found by a search party and rushed to the hospital, where he makes a full recovery. Dex has been casually involved with Leslie Carrington, but their relationship ends when Leslie has a fling with Jeff Colby and goes to work for Alexis. Dex develops a friendship with Jeff's ex- wife (and Blake's daughter), Fallon. In episode 187, Fallon asks Dex to help her investigate a business deal in Africa, where he discovers that the key contact there, Harry Thresher, has ties to Alexis's new husband, Sean Rowan. Dex grows more suspicious and tries to warn Alexis, who dismisses his warnings as jealousy. In episode 194, Leslie confesses to Dex that she has been sleeping with Sean, and learned that he is seeking to destroy Alexis in revenge for the suicide of his father, Joseph Anders, which he believes was caused by Alexis. Dex warns Alexis who fears the worst. Dex and Blake travel to Africa in episode 195, where they discover the business deal was a cover for illegal arms shipments. Sean had planned to set up Alexis and Blake to take the fall. Sean locks Blake and Dex on a tanker and plans to blow up the ship. At the last minute, Dex uses grenades from the arms shipment to blow a hole in the tanker so they can escape. A body washes ashore following the explosion and is presumed to be Sean. When it turns out to be Harry Thresher, Dex assures Alexis that no one could have survived the explosion. However, in episode 198, Dex goes to check on Alexis and finds Sean holding her at gunpoint. The men fight and grapple for the gun. A shot rings out! A horrified Alexis cries, \\"Oh my God!\\" Season 9 Dex has shot and killed Sean. In episode 199, he takes Alexis to Los Angeles to put this terrible time behind them and they make love. Afterwards, Dex tells Alexis that he's not interested in helping her repair the damage that Sean caused ColbyCo, but is ultimately drawn into the mess. He tells her that Sean invested millions of ColbyCo's assets in collusion with Alexis's comptroller, Fritz Heath, in order to bankrupt the company. Dex meets Alexis's cousin, Sable Colby, who attempts to charm information about ColbyCo from him. In episode 204, he unknowingly sells Alexis's hotel to Sable, who plans to evict Alexis. A furious Alexis berates Dex for not investigating the deal more closely. Earlier in the season, a body was found at the bottom of a lake on the Carrington property. The dead body turns out to be Roger Grimes, the man with whom Alexis was sleeping when she and Blake divorced. He had been dead for 20 years but the cold temperatures in the lake preserved his body. Dex suspects that Alexis has unresolved feeling for Roger when she vows to prove Blake killed him. Fallon asks Dex what he knows about the man-made lake, and Dex vaguely mentions that it was used to flood an abandoned mine on the property following a failed business deal between the Colby, Carrington, and Dexter families: Colterton Mines. At some point before this season Sam Dexter has died and Dex and Blake later agree never to reveal \\"the truth about the mine.\\" Dex continues to cross paths with Sable, in dealing with both the African tanker deal and the situation with the abandoned mine. In episode 211, Sable reveals that she was investigating the mine to determine what her ex-husband was hiding, and never meant to hurt Blake or Dex. She promises to abandon her investigation. Dex is attracted to her genuine regret. Unfortunately, Sable's henchman continues his investigation without her - and he's not the only one. Sable is threatened by a deranged, gun-toting, Fritz Heath in episode 212. Sable manages to calm him down and defuse the situation, however. Still feeling shaken by the ordeal, she goes to see Dex and he comforts her, and they wind up in bed. Sable apologizes to Dex saying she respects his love for Alexis. They agree their fling meant nothing - but wind up right back in bed together. Sable and Dex want to protect Blake from Alexis - her quest for information on Roger Grimes will inevitable reveal information about the hidden mine that they want to keep secret. Dex assures Sable that his feelings for Alexis have never prevented him from doing the right thing. Ultimately, it is revealed that 8-year-old Fallon had shot Roger Grimes after finding him beating Alexis, and Blake's father Tom had hid the body in a mine under the lake to protect Fallon. The situation is complicated by the fact that the mine is full of stolen Nazi treasure, hidden there by Blake's late father. Roger's body had been disturbed from its hiding place by someone looking for the treasure. In episode 219, Dex is shocked to learn that Sable is pregnant. Dex is upset when Sable indicates that she will raise the child without him. In the episode 220, the final episode of the series, at the Carlton Hotel Dex confronts Sable and Alexis for using him and throwing him aside. He mentions that Sable is pregnant, much to her chagrin. Alexis and Adam taunt Dex with the news, causing Dex to push Adam to the floor in frustration. When Dex turns his back, Adam rushes him. Dex falls backward into Alexis, sending them both crashing through a railing and falling off a second-story balcony while Adam, Sable, and Monica watch in horror. The Reunion (1991) In 1991's Dynasty: The Reunion an older couple is standing in the Carrington mansion, talking about the fall Alexis and Dex made at the Carlton Hotel. The woman thinks it was right there, at the Carrington mansion and is not listening to the man next to her who tells her otherwise. Krystle, having just arrived and not knowing what's going on, listens to them and asks what and whom they are talking about. The woman tells her that Alexis managed to turn in mid-air and land on top of Dex. It is left unclear whether Dex survived the fall, as the woman continues that Dex \\"didn't fare as well\\" as Alexis did.

In Arabic, it is used as a first name and means 'helper' or 'supporter'. In Pashto and Persian, it means 'saint' or 'the saint of saints' and can be used as a title, a name, or an ethnic surname. The suffix zâda or zâdeh (Persian for son of) is sometimes added in the Persian and Pashto variations to denote \\"son or descendant of a saint\\". It was popularly used to refer to one saint in particular from the region, Shaykh Abdul Qadir Gillani, founder of the Qadiri Sufi order. It is often said the term itself arose with him, since he had the title al-Gauth al Azam (the \\"Supreme Helper\\"), and the root of Dastgir literally denotes a helper or helping hand. Common Uses South Asia Moreover, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Dastgir is common amongst Pashtun peoples. As a surname it is often mated to Ghulam or Amir as first names. Ghulam Dastgir meaning \\"servant of the saint(s)\\" and Amir Dastgir meaning \\"command of the saints\\" or \\"commander of the saints\\" (the latter just emphasizing the original meaning, \\"saint of saints\\") or simply \\"princely saint\\". The former is most likely popular in South Asia due to the cultural importance that saints such as Sufis and other Islamic scholars and/or mystics had in society. Concordantly, Dastgir is usually encountered as an ethnic surname passed down through generations that had some link to a saint. Its use as a title or even first name (barring the Arabic version) has diminished with the cultural shift away from an age where saints were prominent. Its usage in Iran probably follows a similar history, since many of the Sufi saints of renown in the region were initially from Iran.

It is issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and Philippine diplomatic missions abroad, with certain exceptions. The DFA began issuing maroon machine-readable passports on September 17, 2007, and biometric passports on August 11, 2009. The green colored cover non-electronic passports are still valid until they expire. Philippine passports are printed at the APO Production Unit plant in Malvar, Batangas. History A Philippine passport from 1947, issued to Elpidio Quirino. Prior to the Spaniards' arrival to the Philippine islands, indigenous peoples have been travelling freely within the islands and to neighboring Asian states to facilitate trade and commerce, primarily done in the form of seafaring. During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, the Spaniards introduced a travel document to the Philippines called the \\"chapa\\", or a writ of safety to go from one place to another, which the natives used from the 1500s to 1600s. Philippine passports were released after gaining independence from the United States in 1946. Passports were ordered to be printed in Filipino for the first time under Diosdado Macapagal, to be subsequently implemented under Ferdinand Marcos. Currently, it is printed in Filipino with English translations. With the adoption of the 1987 constitution, the power of issuing passports was transferred from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the current Department of Foreign Affairs. The Philippine Passport Act of 1996 governs the issuance of Philippine passports and travel documents. Philippine passports are only issued to Filipino citizens, while travel documents (under Section 13) may be issued to citizens who have lost their passports overseas as well as permanent residents who cannot obtain passports or travel documents from other countries.Republic Act No. 8239: Philippine Passport Act of 1996 On May 1, 1995, green covers were instituted on regular passports for the first time, and barcodes were inserted in passports in 2004. The new security-enhanced passport is a prerequisite to the issuance of new machine-readable passports which was first issued to the public on September 17, 2007.Old RP passports out, new hi-tech passports in, ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs, August 16, 2007 The Philippines used to be one of the few countries in the world that had not yet issue machine-readable regular passportsDFA: ‘RP passport exposes Filipinos to discrimination’ , Philippine Daily Inquirer, March 13, 2007 although machine-readable passports for public officials have been issued since June 18, 2007.DFA issues machine- readable passports to govt execs, Philippine Daily Inquirer, July 13, 2007 On August 2, 2017, Republic Act 10928 was approved by President Rodrigo Duterte, which extends the validity of passport from 5 years to 10 years. Foreign Secretary Alan Cayetano signed the implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of the new Philippine Passport Act on October 27, 2017. The act was implemented on January 1, 2018. Machine-readable passports In 2006, the DFA in cooperation with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas started a five-year passport modernization project designed to issue new Philippine machine-readable passports (MRP). However, an injunction was issued against the project by a lower court, only to be overturned by the Supreme Court and ordering the DFA and the BSP to continue the project. The machine-readable passport is designed to prevent tampering through the use of a special features embedded in the passport cover, similar to other machine-readable passports. It also has more pages than the previous passport (44 pages instead of the previous 32) and processing times were expected to be accelerated. Officials from the DFA have clarified that the older, green, non-MRP passports will expire as scheduled on their original expiration dates.Philippine Embassy Issues Clarification On Validity Of Green Passports – http://www.philippineembassybrunei.net/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=154:philippine- embassy-issues-clarification-on-validity-of-green-passports&catid;=10:press- releases&Itemid;=48 However, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) requires all member states to issue machine-readable passports by April 2010, hence some countries may deny entry to Filipinos still in possession of the green, hand-written passports. Biometric passport In late July 2008, the DFA has announced plans and the possible implementation of a new Biometric Passport System for new passports. It is expected that the government will start issuing biometric passports by the end of 2009. On August 11, 2009, the first biometric passport was released for President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. The e-passport had various security features, including a hidden encoded image; an ultra-thin, holographic laminate; and a tamper-proof electronic microchip costing at around 950 pesos for the normal processing of 20 days or 1,200 pesos for the rush processing of 10 days.http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20090811-219798/President- gets-first-RP-electronic-passport \\"President gets first RP electronic passport\\" As of July 2015, the Philippine passport is printed in the Asian Productivity Organization or APO Productions under the Presidential Communications Group. On August 15, 2016, the new generation e-passport was released by the Department of Foreign Affairs with advanced security features such as the upgraded microchip to capture the personal data of the applicant, invisible ultraviolet (UV) fluorescent ink and thread, and elaborate design when subject to UV light. Security inks were also used to print the passports to prevent forgery. These inks include intaglio, which are visible inks that have a distinct ridged feel and ultraviolet ink that appears when exposed to infrared lights. Other security features include watermarks, perforated passport numbering, embedded security fibers, among others. Aside from making the new e-passport tamper-proof, each leaf of the 44-page document depicts Philippine artifacts, cultural icons, historic places, renowned tourist destinations, and even lyrics of the national anthem. Restrictions With the declaration of martial law on September 23, 1972, travel restrictions were imposed on Philippine citizens. A letter of instruction restricted the issuance of passports to members of the Philippine diplomatic service, although this was relaxed in 1981 with the lifting of martial law. In 1983, there were orders from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs not to issue any passports to the family of opposition senator Benigno Aquino, Jr.. Despite the government ban, Aquino was able to acquire one with the help of Rashid Lucman, a former congressman from Mindanao. The passport identified him as Marciál Bonifacio, an alias derived from \\"martial law\\" and Fort Bonifacio, where he was detained.Services – INQUIRER.net In the late 1980s and early 1990s, passports were stamped with limitations prohibiting travel to South Africa (because of apartheid) and Lebanon (because of the civil war). Passports were previously stamped prohibiting travel to Iraq due to the ongoing violence and because of the kidnapping of Angelo dela Cruz in 2004. However, passports printed after July 1, 2011 no longer bear this stamp. Types First editions of the Philippine biometric passport. From left to right: regular, official, and diplomatic. There are three types of Philippine passports issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs. These are currently designated by the colors maroon (regular), red (official), and dark blue (diplomatic). Regular (maroon) A regular passport is issued to any citizen of the Philippines applying for a Philippine passport. It is the most common type of passport issued and is used for all travel by Philippine citizens and non-official travel by Philippine government officials. Official (red) An official passport is issued to members of the Philippine government for use on official business, as well as employees of Philippine diplomatic posts abroad who are not members of the diplomatic service. It is the second of two passports issued to the President and the Presidential family. As such, this passport does not extend the privilege of diplomatic immunity. Government officials are prohibited from using official passports for non-official business, and as such also have regular passports. This passport has a red cover. This passport has a validity of 6 months. First edition biometric Philippine Official (Red) passport (page 2-3). Diplomatic (blue) A diplomatic passport is issued to members of the Philippine diplomatic service, members of the Cabinet, service attachés of other government agencies assigned to Philippine diplomatic posts abroad and Philippine delegates to international and regional organizations. It is the first of two passports issued to the President of the Philippines and the Presidential family. This passport has a dark blue cover and extends the privilege of diplomatic immunity to the bearer. Other When two Philippine eagles were loaned to Singapore, the birds were issued maroon passports when they were transported out of the Philippines in June 2019. The passports were however not valid as a travel document and are merely symbolic to express a statement that the birds remain Philippine government property. Appearance Philippine passports are maroon, with the coat of arms of the Philippines emblazoned in the center of the front cover. Front cover The word \\"PILIPINAS\\" is inscribed above the coat of arms, which now has hatchings to indicate the tinctures gules (red, for the right field) and azure (blue, for the left field). The word \\"PASAPORTE\\" is inscribed below, with the biometric passport symbol 20px appearing beneath it. Passports issued during the latter years of the Fourth Republic had the order reversed (strikingly similar to the United States passport), with \\"PASAPORTE\\" on top and \\"REPUBLIKA NG PILIPINAS\\" on the bottom. All passports issued since this period have the cover in Filipino. A typical passport has 44 (previously 32 or 64) pages. Languages Philippine passports are bilingual, with both issued text and information page data in Filipino followed by English translations. Brown passports once had all the Filipino text written with diacritics, but this was discontinued in the green and maroon passports. Pages 4–43 have, on one page per 2-page spread, (a) lines(s) of the national anthem, the Lupang Hinirang. The odd pages of pages 3–43 have a Baybayin text that says \\"Ang katuwiran ay nagpapadakila sa isang bayan\\" (\\"Righteousness exalts a nation\\") in reference to Proverbs 14:34 (). Identity Information page Philippine passports have different styles of data pages. Old brown passports have both a data and physical description page, with the picture located on the description page rather than the data page; these are separated by the passport note. Green passports issued before 2004 have the data page on the inner cover followed by the passport note page. Passports issued after 2004 have the passport note and data pages reversed, with the passport note on the inner cover page. The data page contains the following information: * Passport type (P) * Country code (PHL) * Passport number ** Passport numbers vary with each type of passport. Brown passports have a letter followed by six numbers, while green passports issued before 2005 have two letters followed by six numbers. Passports issued after 2005 (including machine-readable and biometric passports issued prior to August 15, 2016) have two letters followed by seven numbers. Passports issued after August 15, 2016 have a letter followed by seven numbers, which is then followed by another letter. * Names ** A bearer's last name goes first, followed by the first names and middle name (mother's maiden last name) * Nationality (Filipino) * Date of birth (written in DD-MM- YYYY date format with months abbreviated) * Place of birth * Sex (M or F) * Date of issue * Date of expiry ** A Philippine passport is valid for ten years for adults and five years for minors from the date of issue. Passports issued from 1981 to 1986 were valid for two years and may be extended for another two years. Passports issued before January 1, 2018 were valid for five years. * Issuing authority ** Valid issuing authorities for Philippine passports include the main office of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila, branch offices of the DFA located in certain cities around the Philippines, and Philippine embassies and consulates. * PhilSys Number * Signature of bearer (for biometric passports) With new maroon-covered passports, the passport data page ends with the Machine Readable Zone. This zone is absent in green-covered passports. Passport note Passports contain a note from the issuing state that is addressed to the authorities of all other states, identifying the bearer as a citizen of that state and requesting that he or she be allowed to pass and be treated according to international norms. The note is first written in Filipino followed by the English translation: in Filipino: ::\\"Ang Pamahalaan ng Republika ng Pilipinas ay humihiling sa lahat na kinauukulan na pahintulutan ang pinagkalooban nito, isang mamamayan ng Pilipinas, na makaraan nang malaya at walang sagabal, at kung kailangan, ay pag-ukulan siya ng lahat ng tulong at proteksyon ayon sa batas.\\" in English: ::\\"The Government of the Republic of the Philippines requests all concerned to permit the bearer, a citizen of the Philippines, to pass safely and freely and in case of need to give him/her all lawful aid and protection.\\" At the last page (on page 44) are the emergency contact details, and a warning about E-Passport 20px in Filipino: ::\\"Ang pasaporteng ito ay naglalaman ng sensitibong electronics. Huwag tupiin, butasan, o ilantad sa labis na init o lamig ang pasaporteng ito. Ingatan din na huwag mabasa.\\" in English: ::\\"This passport contains sensitive electronics. Do not bend, perforate, or expose this passport to extreme temperature, or excess moisture.\\" Signature field A Philippine passport is invalid if the passport is not signed, and normally the bearer affixes his/her signature on the signature field, whose position has varied with various incarnations of Philippine passports. Persons too young to sign a passport previously may have a parent or legal guardian sign the passport on their behalf, although this has since been prohibited. Brown passports originally contained the signature field below the data page at the passport's inner cover. When green passports began being issued in 1995, a field where the bearer must sign the passport appeared below the passport note. Machine- readable passports originally had no signature field, a source of much controversy as Filipinos applying for foreign visas, whether for travel or employment, have either been requested to get a copy of their passport application form to verify their signature,Passport system causing visa applicants, travel agents headaches, The Philippine Star, May 2, 2008 or denied altogether. Newer versions of this passport eventually had the signature field at the back cover, below the important reminders for Philippine passport holders, while older versions have the field stamped on. Biometric passports from August 2009 to August 2016, are the only Philippine passports which do not require the physical signature of the bearer, as an image of the bearer's signature is printed onto the passport data page. Physical signatures are once again required for biometric passports issued after August 15, 2016, with the signature field on page 3. Visa requirements Countries and territories with visa-free entries or visas on arrival for holders of regular Philippine passports As of 14 April 2020, Philippine citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 66 countries and territories, ranking the Philippine passport 76th in terms of travel freedom according to the Henley Passport Index. Fees The new biometric Philippine passport costs 950 pesos (approximately $18) in the Philippines or $60 abroad. Overtime processing for new passports costs an additional 250 pesos. Persons who take advantage of overtime processing get their passports within seven days for applications for Metro Manila (DFA Consular Affairs office, ASEANA, Parañaque, Alabang Town Center, SM Megamall, and Robinsons Galleria); Region 3 (DFA Pampanga regional office, Marquee Mall in Angeles, Robinson Starmills in Pampanga and Xentro Mall in Malolos, Bulacan), Region 4-A (DFA Lucena regional office, Robinsons Lipa in Batangas, SM City Dasmariñas in Cavite, SM City San Pablo in Laguna and SM Cherry Antipolo in Rizal) and 15 to 20 days in other provinces. For Filipinos abroad, it will take up to 120 days. Passports previously could be amended for 100 pesos (approx. $2.50) in the Philippines or $20 abroad, although machine-readable passports are no longer amendable. Lost or stolen passports may be replaced for 700 pesos (approx. $14) in the Philippines, $90 abroad.

Naanee (pronounced LEG-a-doo Nah-NAY, born September 16, 1983) is a former American football wide receiver. He was drafted by the San Diego Chargers in the fifth round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He played college football for the Boise State University Broncos. Naanee has also played for the Carolina Panthers and the Miami Dolphins. Early years Naanee attended Franklin High School in Portland, Oregon and was a student and a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. In football, he was a four-year starter earning awards at quarterback and defensive back. In basketball, he won All- League honors as a junior. College career Although Naanee received scholarship offers from many Pac-10 and Big 12 schools, such as Oregon and Oregon State, Naanee chose to play college football at Boise State University because they were the only major program to offer him a chance to play quarterback, a position he cherished and played in high school. After Jared Zabransky won the starting job in 2004, Naanee realized that if he wanted to play, it had to be at another position.Jay Posner, SignOnSanDiego.com > San Diego Chargers – For Chargers rookie, good comes from new position Naanee filled in at receiver and although the transition and failure at quarterback was difficult, he said being able to \\"feel like you were part of things and contributing, that went out the window\\". He remarked, \\"maybe it was something that was meant to be, for me to go through something like that and then to switch.\\" Professional career 2007 NFL Draft With Naanee playing most of his football career at receiver, the Chargers selected Naanee with the 172nd overall selection in the 5th round of the 2007 NFL Draft. {   colspan=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"  Pre-draft measureables - !Weight !40 yd !20 ss !3-cone !Vert !BP !Wonderlic -  ALIGN=\\"center\\" *  ALIGN=\\"center\\" 4.41*http://www.mattrauch.com/2007-nfl-combine-results.php  ALIGN=\\"center\\" 4.20  ALIGN=\\"center\\" 6.73sLegedu Naanee, WR, Boise State – 2007 NFL Draft Scout Profile, Powered by The SportsXchange  ALIGN=\\"center\\" *  ALIGN=\\"center\\" 19*San Diego Chargers  ALIGN=\\"center\\" X }(* represents NFL Combine) San Diego Chargers Naanee was targeted by Norv Turner to become the next star for the Chargers to become his F-Back project, much like Delanie Walker and Michael Robinson were when Turner was the offensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers.2006 49ers Draft Review and Analysis The F-Back is much like the H-back in other offenses in the sense it is a hybrid position (WR/TE/FB) purposely versatile to take advantage of mismatches. Naanee was the starting number two receiver for the Chargers behind Malcom Floyd for much of the 2010 season. This is due to a holdout by the usual starter Vincent Jackson. Naanee caught a touchdown pass in his first start of the 2010 season on a 59-yard pass from quarterback Philip Rivers in the season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs. Regarding his versatility, head coach Norv Turner said, \\"We're going to continue to move him. He's going to be a guy who's versatile enough to move around. That's going to help him be put in position to make some plays.\\" On December 6, 2009, Naanee completed a pass on a flea flicker to LaDainian Tomlinson. Arrest He was arrested for public intoxication and resisting arrest at the scene of a homicide in Indianapolis on February 12, 2011.http://www.wthr.com/story/14029500/chargers- wr-arrested-at-homicide-scene Carolina Panthers Naanee signed with the Carolina Panthers on August 4, 2011. He played the whole season as the number 3 receiver behind Steve Smith and Brandon LaFell. He caught 1 touchdown pass from Quarterback Cam Newton, but dropped more passes than he caught, including a wide open end zone pass that would have won the game for the Panthers. At the end of the season the Panthers did not renew his contract. Miami Dolphins Naanee signed a one-year deal with the Miami Dolphins on April 17. He was cut on October 2, 2012 after posting only one catch for 19 yards in his four-game tenure with the team.http://espn.go.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/48816/dolphins-add-wr-gaffney- cut-naanee Career statistics {   center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !! rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !! rowspan=\\"2\\"GP !! rowspan=\\"2\\"GS !! colspan=\\"5\\" Receiving !! colspan=\\"5\\" Rushing !! colspan=\\"2\\" Fumbles - !

In modern usage, it has similar connotations to the United States term un-American, however the Australian term is somewhat older, being used as early as 1855 to describe an aspect of the landscape that was similar to that of Britain. Its modern usage was popularised during the 1990s by Prime Minister John Howard and One Nation Party founder Pauline Hanson; however, Stanley Bruce used it in reference to striking workers in 1925 and Joseph Lyons during the 1930s to decry communists and migrants from non-British backgrounds. Judith Ireland - \\"Australia's Un-doing\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 15 March 2005 In recent times, the word has been overused to the point of being a particular favourite of humourists and satirists. It is used in a humorous TV advertising campaign by Meat and Livestock Australia, in which ex-AFL footballer Sam Kekovich declares that not including lamb in one's diet is \\"un-Australian\\". Modern usage While the origins of the term go back to the 1850s, the term \\"un-Australian\\" has risen in popularity since the mid-1990s. The definition of the word has changed from simply defining something, particularly art or literature, as not Australian in character to a broader, more negative connotation suggesting an activity, behaviour, belief or policy that is seen to be violating Australian cultural norms. In this sense, then, its usage is generally subjectively applied according to the user's beliefs. Furthermore, usage of the word in political campaigning is with the intention of sparking Nationalistic ideals in the general public in order to increase and grow political support. Judith Ireland, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald notes John Howard is perhaps most responsible for the proliferation of the word, having used it in the 1980s to describe the proposed Australia Card legislation. During his term as Prime Minister, Howard repeatedly used the term \\"un-Australian\\" to describe striking workers, anti-globalisation and anti-war protestors and Opposition proposals to withdraw the country's military from Iraq. Millionaire businessman, philanthropist and human rights campaigner Dick Smith also described the Howard Government's policies towards convicted terrorism supporter David Hicks and asylum seekers as \\"un-Australian\\".Hugh Mackay, \\"Just Who is Unaustralian?\\", The Age, 19 June 2005 In a more vernacular sense, the word is also often used in a jocular form for anything that could be considered not in accordance with the wider Australian community.ABC News Radio - unAustralian In 2006, the Cultural Studies Association of Australasia convened its annual conference under the title 'UnAustralia' at the University of Canberra with Keynote speeches at Parliament HouseUnaustralia - Home Also in 2006, Melbourne artist, Azlan McLennan burned an Australian flag to coincide with Australia Day. The artwork, \\"Proudly UnAustralian\\" was controversially removed from its public billboard display by local authorities, prompting much debate about free speech versus police powers.

[1] The draft of the first version of the link, later named Zveno-1 and consisting of the TB-1 bomber and two I-4 fighters, was submitted to Vakhmistrov in June 1931 by the head of the UVVS of the Red Army, I. I. Alksnis, and received his approval. On December 3 of the same year, Vakhmistrov as a second pilot of the bomber participated in the first flight tests of \\"Link-1\\" consisting of TB-1 and two I-4s with dismantled lower planes.

On July 26th, a triple SPB bombed around Constance without losses, followed by attacks on the Cernavodsky bridge on 10 and 13 August 1941 .

The structural execution and shape can vary greatly, often in the form of a pavilion or tempietto, more or less open on the sides. Schönbrunn Palace garden gloriette The largest and probably best-known gloriette is in the Schönbrunn Palace garden in Vienna. Built in 1775 as the last building constructed in the garden according to the plans of Austrian imperial architect Johann Ferdinand Hetzendorf von Hohenberg as a \\"temple of renown\\" to serve as both a focal point and a lookout point for the garden, it was used as a dining hall and festival hall as well as a breakfast room for emperor Franz Joseph I. The dining hall, which was used up until the end of the monarchy, today has a café in it, and on the roof an observation platform overlooks Vienna. The gloriette's decorative sculptures were made by the famous Salzburg sculptor Johann Baptist von Hagenauer. The gloriette was destroyed in the Second World War, but had already been restored by 1947, and was restored again in 1995, when its central part was closed with glass panes and converted to a café. The gloriette is dedicated as a Monument to Just War, that which leads to peace. With the succession to the throne of Maria Theresa came first the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748) and later the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). The front face bears the following inscription: IOSEPHO II. AVGVSTO ET MARIA THERESIA AVGVSTA IMPERANTIB. ERECT. CIƆIƆCCLXXV. (\\"Erected under the reign of Emperor Joseph II and Empress Maria Theresa, 1775.\\") The way of writing of the year uses a Latinization of the Greek letter Φ (phi) for 1000. In Ancient Rome it was also common to represent the number 1000 by phi instead of with an M. An essential part of the inscription is the addition of AVGVSTO and AVGVSTA, used as a link to the first Roman emperor and state god AVGVSTVS by his heirs and successors as finally the Habsburgs in their functions as emperors of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. The gloriette served as the sixth 'Pit Stop' on The Amazing Race 23. Other architectural gloriettes Other buildings designated \\"gloriettes\\" are, for example, *in the garden of Schloss Esterházy in Eisenstadt (Burgenland, Austria); *in the Park von Muskau (Germany); *in the Bergpark Wilhelmshöhe in Kassel (Germany); *in Trogir (Croatia); *in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic); *Maiers-Gloriette, Fertőboz (Hungary); *in the garden of the Brukenthal Palace in Sibiu (Romania); *in the garden of Villa Olmo in Como (Italy); *in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris (France); *in Portmeirion (North Wales); *in Leeds Castle (Kent); *in Parque de María Luisa (Seville) there are numerous structures;https://www.sevilla.org/servicios/medio-ambiente-parques- jardines/parques/parques-y-jardines-historicos/parque-de-maria-luisa *and in Corfe Castle (Dorset). Non-architectural gloriettes The word \\"gloriette\\" can also refer to a large birdcage, similar in form to the architectural gloriette, often made out of wrought iron or, more rarely, wood. In the garden of the Priory of Notre-Dame d'Orsan, many wood gloriettes decorate and overshadow the alleys. Climbing plants are often associated with this type of construction.

Originally built in 1923, it was extended in 1936 and was designated as a Grade II listed building on 19 April 2017. It operates with two trains, each containing three four-bench cars, seating two people per bench.  History   Construction and expansion  The coaster was first built in 1923 by John Miller. It was extended in 1936 by the American engineer Charles Paige, whose work at the Pleasure Beach is all that survives from 13 wooden coasters he is known to have built, adding arches over the south entrance of the park and additional drops. The British architect Joseph Emberton designed the ride station.  Refurbishment  On 13 February 2010, the Big Dipper reopened after months of refurbishment following the August 2009 accident. The 1935 station was upgraded in a sympathetic manner; the track was refurbished; a new fountain was added; and the trains were repaired and repainted dark blue with new exterior panels with an arrow design similar to the 1990s design. The grab rails were replaced in 2014.  Incidents  On 26 June 1975, part of the main lift hill and first drop were severely damaged by fire. On 11 August 2009, two trains carrying a total of 32 guests collided. 21 riders required hospital treatment for injuries ranging from whiplash and broken noses to cuts and bruises. On 5 June 2010, part of a train derailed. There were no injuries and the ride resumed operations a short time later.  Records  In August 1998, Richard Rodriguez set a world record by riding the Big Dipper for over 1000 hours. There is a plaque commemorating this event in the ride's station. Although he doubled this mark two years later to 2000 hours, Guinness World Records nullified the achievements by altering the rules in 2007, and Rodriguez's new record was set on the Big One and the Big Dipper and stands at 405 hours 40 minutes. In popular culture The Big Dipper is referenced in the Jethro Tull song \\"Big Dipper\\", from their 1976 album Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!. In the 1994 television series Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge, Joe Beazley (played by John Thomson) talks about Blackpool Pleasure Beach, saying the big dipper is \\"the biggest rollercoaster in the world\\" and that \\"[w]e were going about 200 miles an hour.\\" Both claims are incorrect, as the tallest point is 20 metres, and the maximum speed is 40mph.

Established with the aid of disability advocate and former United States Paralympic soccer player Eli Wolff, the accolade's trophy, designed by sculptor Lawrence Nowlan, is presented to the disabled sportswoman adjudged to be the best at the annual ESPY Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. The Best Female Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award was first bestowed as part of the ESPY Awards in 2005 after the non-gender specific Best Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award was presented the previous three years (all won by sportsmen). Balloting for the award is undertaken by fans over the Internet from between three and five choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee, which is composed of a panel of experts. It is conferred in July to reflect performance and achievement over the preceding twelve months. The inaugural winner of the Best Female Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award at the 2005 ceremony was American swimmer Erin Popovich, who is affected by achondroplasia. She won seven gold medals at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens. She is one of three people to have won the Best Female Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award more than once, winning again at the 2009 awards. Fellow swimmer Jessica Long has the most victories of any other sportswoman, collecting the award three times at the 2007, 2012 and 2013 awards with one further nomination at the 2009 ceremony, while cross-country skier Oksana Masters has been nominated the most times (four) without winning. Swimmers have been successful at the awards with eight victories and three nominations, followed by paratriathles with three wins and six nominations. It was not awarded in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2017 winner of the Best Female Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award is swimmer Rebecca Meyers. She achieved her second win after receiving the accolade at the 2015 ceremony. The incumbent holder is American triathlete Allysa Seely after being announced as the winner at the 2019 ceremony.

Early life Stawell was born at Kew, Melbourne, Victoria, the sixth son of Sir William Stawell, Chief Justice of Victoria and his wife, Mary Francis Elizabeth née Greene. Stawell was sent to England to be educated at Marlborough school, but returned to Australia due to health issues and went to Hawthorn Grammar School under Professor Irving. He then went to Trinity College at the University of Melbourne and graduated M.B., B.S. in 1888, with the scholarship in medicine at the final examination, and M.D. in 1890. Stawell did post-graduate work from 1890 to 1892 in bacteriology, biochemistry and physiology at the National Hospital for Diseases of the Nervous System, Queen's Square, and the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children. After completing the Diploma of Public Health (London) in 1891, he did further research at Tübingen, Germany, and visited clinics in the United States of America before returning home. Career Stawell returned to Australia in 1893 and began to practise at Melbourne; earlier hopes of a private income faded with the bank crash. Stawell was appointed a member of the honorary medical staff of the Children's hospital 1893–1914 and became recognized as a specialist in children's diseases. From 1894 to 1900 he was honorary co-editor of the Australian Medical Journal, and from 1895 to 1906 was on the committee of the Medical Society of Victoria. He worked actively for the amalgamation of that society with the Victorian branch of the British Medical Association. From 1902 to 1924 Stawell was a member of the honorary medical staff of the Melbourne hospital. The clinical teaching before his appointment was not satisfactory, and it was largely due to Stawell's influence and example that an immense improvement took place. He was an ideal teacher of medicine, and it has been said of him that Stawell was elected a vice-president of the Victorian branch of the British Medical Association in 1908 and became president in 1910. He worked successfully for the amalgamation of the two Australian medical journals, the Australian Medical Gazette (NSW) and the Australian Medical Journal (Victoria), and in 1914 the two were absorbed in the new weekly journal, the Medical Journal of Australia. in World War I, Stawell served as Lieutenant-Colonel in charge of the medical section with the 3rd Australian General Hospital at the front in 1915 but was brought back to Australia in 1916 to continue his clinical teaching and other important home service work. Stawell became a physician to in-patients at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in 1919 and was also a member of the medical advisory committee to the Repatriation department of the Commonwealth. In the following year he was president of the medical section at the Australian medical congress at Brisbane. He resigned the position of physician to in-patients at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in 1921 and became a consulting physician to the hospital. He had joined the committee of the hospital in 1905 and in 1928 was elected president; he did important work for many years as chairman of the house committee. Late life In 1930 Stawell was first president of the Association of Physicians in Australasia and delivered the Halford oration at Canberra in November of that year. He was made vice-president at the centenary meeting of the British Medical Association in 1932. He was to have been president at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association at Melbourne in September 1935 but died at Melbourne on 18 April 1935. Stawell married Evelyn Myrrhee Connolly, daughter of H. J. Connolly, on 12 August 1908 who survived him with a son and two daughters. Stawell was created K.B.E. in June 1929. In 1933 his work for the profession was recognized by the founding of the Sir Richard Stawell Oration. Stawell was tall and slightly built and an excellent tennis player in his youth and represented Victoria in intercolonial tennis. In later years he was a keen golfer and fly-fisher. He was president of the Melbourne Club in 1920. His quiet, slightly austere manner did not at first suggest his great personal charm, but among his intimates he could let his inner sense of fun have full play or talk with distinction on music or art. He was a good public speaker and an excellent committee-man. An authority on children's and nervous diseases, a great clinical instructor and possibly the ablest physician in the history of Australian medicine he was honoured and loved by the whole profession. The great immunologist Sir Macfarlane Burnet found him 'a man of much wisdom and immense charm', but with 'a waspish intolerance of stupidity'.

The ultimate yield of xenon-135 from fission is 6.3%, though most of this is from fission-produced tellurium-135 and iodine-135. 135Xe effects on reactor restart In a typical nuclear reactor fueled with uranium-235, the presence of 135Xe as a fission product presents designers and operators with problems due to its large neutron cross section for absorption. Because absorbing neutrons can detrimentally affect a nuclear reactor's ability to increase power, reactors are designed to mitigate this effect; operators are trained to properly anticipate and react to these transients. During periods of steady state operation at a constant neutron flux level, the 135Xe concentration builds up to its equilibrium value for that reactor power in about 40 to 50 hours. When the reactor power is increased, 135Xe concentration initially decreases because the burn up is increased at the new higher power level. Because 95% of the 135Xe production is from decay of iodine-135, which has a 6.57 hour half- life, the production of 135Xe remains constant; at this point, the 135Xe concentration reaches a minimum. The concentration then increases to the new equilibrium level (more accurately steady state level) for the new power level in roughly 40 to 50 hours. During the initial 4 to 6 hours following the power change, the magnitude and the rate of change of concentration is dependent upon the initial power level and on the amount of change in power level; the 135Xe concentration change is greater for a larger change in power level. When reactor power is decreased, the process is reversed., pp. 35–42. Iodine-135 is a fission product of uranium with a yield of about 6% (counting also the iodine-135 produced almost immediately from decay of fission-produced tellurium-135)., p. 35. This 135I decays with a 6.57 hour half-life to 135Xe. Thus, in an operating nuclear reactor, 135Xe is being continuously produced. 135Xe has a very large neutron absorption cross-section, so in the high- neutron-flux environment of a nuclear reactor core, the 135Xe soon absorbs a neutron and becomes almost-stable 136Xe. Thus, in about 50 hours, the 135Xe concentration reaches equilibrium where its creation by 135I decay is balanced with its destruction by neutron absorption. When reactor power is decreased or shut down by inserting neutron-absorbing control rods, the reactor neutron flux is reduced and the equilibrium shifts initially towards higher 135Xe concentration. The 135Xe concentration peaks about 11.1 hours after reactor power is decreased. Since 135Xe has a 9.2 hour half-life, the 135Xe concentration gradually decays back to low levels over 72 hours. The temporarily high level of 135Xe with its high neutron absorption cross-section makes it difficult to restart the reactor for several hours. The neutron- absorbing 135Xe acts like a control rod, reducing reactivity. The inability of a reactor to be started due to the effects of 135Xe is sometimes referred to as xenon-precluded start-up, and the reactor is said to be \\"poisoned out\\". The period of time that the reactor is unable to overcome the effects of 135Xe is called the \\"xenon dead time\\". If sufficient reactivity control authority is available, the reactor can be restarted, but the xenon burn-out transient must be carefully managed. As the control rods are extracted and criticality is reached, neutron flux increases many orders of magnitude and the 135Xe begins to absorb neutrons and be transmuted to 136Xe. The reactor burns off the nuclear poison. As this happens, the reactivity and neutron flux increases, and the control rods must be gradually reinserted to counter the loss of neutron absorption by the 135Xe. Otherwise, the reactor neutron flux will continue to increase, burning off even more xenon poison, on a path to runaway criticality. The time constant for this burn-off transient depends on the reactor design, power level history of the reactor for the past several days, and the new power setting. For a typical step up from 50% power to 100% power, 135Xe concentration falls for about 3 hours.Xenon decay transient graph Failing to anticipate and manage xenon poisoning and compensate for the subsequent burn-off properly was a contributing factor to the Chernobyl disaster; during a run-down to a lower power, a combination of operator error and xenon poisoning caused the reactor thermal power to fall to near-shutdown levels. The crew's resulting efforts to restore power, including the manual withdrawal of control rods not under the SKALA computer's automated control, placed the reactor in a highly unsafe configuration. A failed SCRAM procedure, resulting in the control rods being jammed at a level that actually increased reactivity, caused a thermal transient and a steam explosion that tore the reactor apart. Reactors using continuous reprocessing like many molten salt reactor designs might be able to extract 135Xe from the fuel and avoid these effects. Fluid fuel reactors cannot develop xenon inhomogeneity because the fuel is free to mix. Also, the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment demonstrated that spraying the liquid fuel as droplets through a gas space during recirculation can allow xenon and krypton to leave the fuel salts. However, removing xenon-135 from neutron exposure also causes the reactor to produce more of the long-lived fission product caesium-135. Decay and capture products A 135Xe atom that does not capture a neutron undergoes beta decay to 135Cs, one of the 7 long-lived fission products, while a 135Xe that does capture a neutron becomes almost-stable 136Xe. The probability of capturing a neutron before decay varies with the neutron flux, which itself depends on the kind of reactor, fuel enrichment and power level; and the 135Cs / 136Xe ratio switches its predominant branch very near usual reactor conditions. Estimates of the proportion of 135Xe during steady-state reactor operation that captures a neutron include 90%,CANDU Fundamentals: 20 Xenon: A Fission Product Poison 39%–91%Utilization of the Isotopic Composition of Xe and Kr in Fission Gas Release Research and \\"essentially all\\". For instance, in a (somewhat high) neutron flux of 1014 n·cm−2·s−1, the xenon cross section of σ = cm2 ( barn) would lead to a capture probability of s−1, which corresponds to a half-life of about one hour. Compared to the 9.17 hour half-life of 135Xe, this nearly ten-to-one ratio means that under such conditions, essentially all 135Xe would capture a neutron before decay. But if the neutron flux is lowered to one- tenth of this value, like in CANDU reactors, the ratio would be 50-50, and half the 135Xe would be converted into 135Cs before neutron capture. 136Xe from neutron capture ends up as part of the eventual stable fission xenon which also includes 136Xe, 134Xe, 132Xe, and 131Xe produced by fission and beta decay rather than neutron capture. Nuclei of 133Xe, 137Xe, and 135Xe that have not captured a neutron all beta decay to isotopes of caesium. Fission produces 133Xe, 137Xe, and 135Xe in roughly equal amounts but, after neutron capture, fission caesium contains more stable 133Cs (which however can become 134Cs on further neutron activation) and highly radioactive 137Cs than 135Cs. Spatial xenon oscillations Large thermal reactors with low flux coupling between regions may experience spatial power oscillations and because of the non-uniform presence of xenon-135. Xenon-induced spatial power oscillations occur as a result of rapid perturbations to power distribution that cause the xenon and iodine distribution to be out of phase with the perturbed power distribution. This results in a shift in xenon and iodine distributions that causes the power distribution to change in an opposite direction from the initial perturbation. The instantaneous production rate of xenon-135 is dependent on the iodine-135 concentration and therefore on the local neutron flux history. On the other hand, the destruction rate of xenon-135 is dependent on the instantaneous local neutron flux. The combination of delayed generation and high neutron-capture cross section produces a diversity of impacts on nuclear reactor operation. The mechanism is described in the following four steps. # An initial lack of symmetry (for example, axial symmetry, in the case of axial oscillations) in the core power distribution (for example as a result of significant control rods movement) causes an imbalance in fission rates within the reactor core, and therefore, in the iodine-135 buildup and the xenon-135 absorption. # In the high-flux region, xenon-135 burnout allows the flux to increase further, while in the low-flux region, the increase in xenon-135 causes a further reduction in flux. The iodine concentration increases where the flux is high and decreases where the flux is low. This shift in the xenon distribution is such as to increase (decrease) the multiplication properties of the region in which the flux has increased (decreased), thus enhancing the flux tilt. # As soon as the iodine-135 levels build up sufficiently, decay to xenon reverses the initial situation. Flux decreases in this area, and the former low-flux region increases in power. # Repetition of these patterns can lead to xenon oscillations moving about the core with periods on the order of about 24 hours. With little change in overall power level, these oscillations can significantly change the local power levels. This oscillation may go unnoticed and reach dangerous local flux levels if only the total power of the core is monitored. Therefore, most PWRs use tandem power range excore neutron detectors to monitor upper and lower halves of the core separately.

Established with the aid of disability advocate and former United States Paralympic soccer player Eli Wolff, the accolade's trophy, designed by sculptor Lawrence Nowlan, is presented to the disabled sportsman adjudged to be the best at the annual ESPY Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. The Best Male Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award was first bestowed as part of the ESPY Awards in 2005 after the non-gender specific Best Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award was presented the previous three years (all won by sportsmen). Balloting for the award is undertaken by fans over the Internet from between three and five choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee, which is composed of a panel of experts. It is conferred in July to reflect performance and achievement over the preceding twelve months. The inaugural winner of the Best Male Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award in 2005 was Paralympic track and field competitor Marlon Shirley, who won two medals at the 2004 Summer Paralympics and was the first para-athlete to go below eleven seconds in the men's 100 meter category with a time of 10.97 seconds. In 2015, South African wheelchair racer Krige Schabort was selected as the recipient of the award. , he is the only athlete born outside of the United States to have won the accolade, though three additional foreign sportsmen have earned nominations. Track and field athletes have won more awards than any other sport with four with two winners each coming in sledge hockey, mixed martial arts, triathlon and wrestling. It was not awarded in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2019 winner of the Best Male Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award was American triathlete Mark Barr.

C (red line) and one with 0.4% wt. C and 2% weight Mn (green line). P = pearlite, B = bainite and M = martensite. Isothermal transformation diagrams (also known as time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams) are plots of temperature versus time (usually on a logarithmic scale). They are generated from percentage transformation-vs time measurements, and are useful for understanding the transformations of an alloy steel at elevated temperatures. An isothermal transformation diagram is only valid for one specific composition of material, and only if the temperature is held constant during the transformation, and strictly with rapid cooling to that temperature. Though usually used to represent transformation kinetics for steels, they also can be used to describe the kinetics of crystallization in ceramic or other materials. Time-temperature-precipitation diagrams and time-temperature- embrittlement diagrams have also been used to represent kinetic changes in steels. Isothermal transformation (IT) diagram or the C-curve is associated with mechanical properties,microconstituents/microstructures, and heat treatments in carbon steels. Diffusional transformations like austenite transforming to a cementite and ferrite mixture can be explained using the sigmoidal curve; for example the beginning of pearlitic transformation is represented by the pearlite start (Ps) curve. This transformation is complete at Pf curve. Nucleation requires an incubation time. The rate of nucleation increases and the rate of microconstituent growth decreases as the temperature decreases from the liquidus temperature reaching a maximum at the bay or nose of the curve. Thereafter, the decrease in diffusion rate due to low temperature offsets the effect of increased driving force due to greater difference in free energy. As a result of the transformation, the microconstituents, pearlite and bainite, form; pearlite forms at higher temperatures and bainite at lower. Austenite is slightly undercooled when quenched below Eutectoid temperature. When given more time, stable microconstituents can form: ferrite and cementite. Coarse pearlite is produced when atoms diffuse rapidly after phases that form pearlite nucleate. This transformation is complete at the pearlite finish time (Pf). However, greater undercooling by rapid quenching results in formation of martensite or bainite instead of pearlite. This is possible provided the cooling rate is such that the cooling curve intersects the martensite start temperature or the bainite start curve before intersecting the Ps curve. The martensite transformation being a diffusionless shear transformation is represented by a straight line to signify the martensite start temperature.

It may be Massinger's earliest extant solo work. Performance Firm data on the play's date of authorship and initial theatrical production have not survived; scholars estimate a date in the early 1620s, perhaps 1621–23. The title page of the earliest edition states that the play was acted by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre — though that company did not exist under that name prior to 1625. The title page may refer to performances in the 1625–32 period rather than the work's debut. John Philip Kemble, an admirer of Massinger's dramas, staged an adaptation of the play called Camiola, or The Maid of Honour, at Drury Lane in 1785. It starred his sister Sarah Siddons; but it was not a success, and lasted only three performances.Phelan, p. 57.Campbell, pp. 188–20. Publication The 1632 quarto, published by the bookseller Robert Allot, bore a commendatory poem by Massinger's friend Sir Aston Cockayne, which indicates that the publication of The Maid of Honour followed that of The Emperor of the East in the same year. The quarto bears Massinger's dedication of the play to two of his patrons, Sir Francis Foljambe and Sir Thomas Bland, in gratitude for their \\"frequent courtesies and favours.\\"Though friends of Massinger, Foljambe and Bland had conducted a legal dispute between them, over the rights to some coal mines. Gifford, p. 224. A second quarto appeared in 1638. Synopsis The play is set in Palermo and Siena in Italy. The court of King Roberto of Sicily receives an ambassador from Roberto's ally Ferdinand, the duke of Urbino. Ferdinand has launched a military assault on the duchy of Siena, because the duchess, Aurelia, has refused his proposal of marriage. Ferdinand and his forces have taken Siena, but now face a vigorous counterattack, led by the general Gonzaga, a member of the Knights of Malta. Ferdinand has sent an appeal to his ally Roberto for help. Roberto, however, responds that the alliance between Sicily and Urbino is purely defensive in nature—the two have promised to come to each other's aid if attacked. The alliance does not cover aggressive warfare; and on that basis Roberto refuses to send any troops. The King's sensible decision is protested by his \\"natural\\" (illegitimate) half-brother Bertoldo, another Knight of Malta. Bertoldo is a fiery character who has his own following among the kingdom's younger nobility and gentry, and he criticises his brother's caution and passivity. Roberto allows Bertoldo to lead a contingent of volunteers to Ferdinand's assistance—as long as it is understood by all concerned that their mission is unofficial and will receive no direct support from the Sicilian monarch. This is Roberto's way of ridding his kingdom of troublesome malcontents, especially Bertoldo. The play's second scene introduces Camiola, the title character. Her \\"beauty, youth, and fortune\\" make her the target of several suitors, including: Signior Sylli, a ridiculously vain \\"self-lover;\\" Fulgentio, the corrupt and egomaniacal favourite of the king; Adorni, a retainer of Camiola's late father; and Bertoldo himself. Bertoldo is the man Camiola loves; but her high principles lead her to reject his suit. (They could only marry if Bertoldo obtained a dispensation from his vows as a member of a knightly monastic order—a course of action Camiola cannot approve.) After a touching farewell, Bertoldo leads his followers off to war. The situation in Siena has gone badly for Ferdinand. Gonzaga's army is starving out the forces of Urbino, and can take the city at any time. His captains are eager for plunder, but the capable Gonzaga delays the final assault, since he expects a counter-attack. His expectation is fulfilled when Bertoldo and his forces arrive; but Gonzaga's troops have no trouble in defeating the new arrivals. (Many of Bertoldo's followers are effete courtiers inexperienced in combat—their antics provide some of the play's comedy.) The courtiers are ransomed from prison for two thousand crowns apiece; but Gonzaga is incensed that a member of his order has led the opposition, and sets Bertoldo's ransom at fifty thousand crowns. Roberto not only refuses to pay the ransom, but forbids any of his subjects to pay it either. At home in Palermo, Camiola is oppressed by the arrogant attentions of Fulgentio. She refuses him, and when he slanders her in revenge, she protests to the King, leading to the favourite's disgrace. Bertoldo languishes in chains in a dungeon—but he is redeemed when Camiola pays his ransom. Roberto has decreed that no man among his subjects pay for Bertoldo's freedom; but Camiola is not a man. Bertoldo's difficulties have worked a change on Camiola's resolution. Her ransom comes with a price: Bertoldo signs a marriage contract to attain his freedom. The ransom becomes moot, however, once Aurelia, the duchess of Siena, catches sight of Bertoldo. She falls in love with him instantly, and orders the ransom returned, much to Gonzaga's displeasure. The pair travel to Palermo, where the story comes to its climax. Camiola challenges the intended marriage of Bertoldo and Aurelia. But then she surprises everyone by rejecting Bertoldo and entering a nunnery; she distributes her fortune to worthy causes and asks Roberto to forgive Fulgentio and restore him to his place. The play's overt comedy comes from several directions—Signior Sylli most notably, but also Fulgentio, the effete courtiers Antonio and Gasparo, and the soldiers of Gonzaga's army. Dramatic analysis The play has been called \\"an improbable and escapist drama\\" comparable to Beaumont and Fletcher's A King and No King and other plays of its period.Peter F. Mullany, quoted in Logan and Smith, p. 102. Other critics, though, have seen in the play the \\"un-Fletcherian moral earnestness\\" typical of Massinger.Foster, pp. 91–3. It has been argued that a passage in The Maid of Honour served as a source for \\"The Definition of Love,\\" one of Andrew Marvell's most famous poems.Legouis, pp. 63–5.Bland, p. 267.

Life He is the oldest son of Fred Bernstein (1922-2001) and Marilyn [Berman] Bernstein (1927-2016); his siblings are the artist Linda A. Bernstein (1958-2004) and the engineer, technology specialist, musician, and expert on BMW Steven J. Bernstein (1962--). He was educated in the New York City public schools, graduating from Stuyvesant High School in 1973. He attended Amherst College, where he was graduated with a B.A. magna cum laude in 1977 in American Studies. While at Amherst, he was a research assistant to Henry Steele Commager. He was graduated from Harvard Law School with a J.D. in November 1980. After three years practicing law, Bernstein left the legal profession to return to the study of history, doing graduate work at New York University. From 1983 to the present he has been a member of the New York University Legal History Colloquium, and he has been active in the writing of legal and constitutional history and in activities to promote the historical profession. From 1984 to 1987 he was research curator for the Constitution Bicentennial Project of The New York Public Library, working with Kym S. Rice under the supervision of Richard B. Morris, Gouverneur Morris Professor of History Emeritus at Columbia University. Among the products of this project was Bernstein's first book, Are We to Be a Nation? The Making of the Constitution, published by Harvard University Press. From 1987 to 1990 Bernstein was historian on the staff of the New York City Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution, and from 1989 to 1990 he was research director of the New York State Commission on the Bicentennial of the Constitution. In the spring of 1988 Bernstein was a visiting part-time lecturer in history at the Newark, New Jersey campus of Rutgers University. In 1991, he was named an adjunct assistant professor of law at New York Law School, where he has taught courses on American legal history and law and literature through 2014. In 2007 he was named Distinguished Adjunct Professor of Law. In 1997-1998 he also was the Daniel M. Lyons Visiting Professor of History at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York. From 1997 to 2004 Bernstein was co-editor of book reviews for H-LAW, the listserv co- sponsored by H-NET (Humanities and Social Sciences Network On-Line) and the American Society for Legal HIstory. He is also a member of H-LAW's editorial board. For three years he served on the editorial board of Law and Social Inquiry, the journal of the American Bar Foundation. In 2004 he was elected to the board of directors of the American Society for Legal History for a three- year term (2004-2007); in 2011, he was elected for a second term as a director of the society, which expired in 2014. In the fall semester of 2011, Bernstein joined the Skadden, Arps Honors Program in Legal Studies at the City College of New York as an adjunct professor of political science. In the fall semester, he taught American Constitutional Development; in the spring semester of 2012 he taught Early American Political Development. In the fall semester of 2012 he again taught Early American Political Development and a section of the one-semester survey course on American history; in the spring semester of 2013 he taught two sections of the survey course, and a political science course on the American judiciary. His repertoire of courses now includes courses on the American judiciary, the U.S. Congress, and the American presidency; American Political Thought; African American Political Thought; and Early American Political Development. Beginning in the fall 2015 semester, he was named a full-time lecturer in law and political science teaching classes like \\"The Presidency\\". In 1993, Bernstein changed his byline from Richard B. Bernstein to R. B. Bernstein to avoid confusion with the several other Richard Bernsteins active in journalism and law. In November 2002, in addition to his scholarly activities, Bernstein became director of online operations at Heights Books, Inc., a used-bookstore in Brooklyn. He ended his connection with Heights Books when the business closed at the end of February 2011. Scholarship Among the products of the New York Public Library's Constitution Bicentennial Project was Bernstein's first book, Are We to Be a Nation? The Making of the Constitution, published by Harvard University Press. Following Are We to Be a Nation?, Bernstein published Amending America: If We Love the Constitution So Much, Why Do We Keep Trying to Change It?, a history of the U.S. Constitution's amending process and the successful and unsuccessful attempts to amend the Constitution from 1789 through the early 1990s; Thomas Jefferson and Bolling v.

House slaves had many duties such as cooking, cleaning, serving meals, and caring for children. In antiquity In classical antiquity, many civilizations had house slaves. In Greece The study of slavery in Ancient Greece remains a complex subject, in part because of the many different levels of servility, from traditional chattel slave through various forms of serfdom, such as Helots, Penestai, and several other classes of non- citizen. Athens had various categories of slave, such as: * House-slaves, living in their master's home and working at home, on the land or in a shop. * Freelance slaves, who didn't live with their master but worked in their master's shop or fields and paid him taxes from money they got from their own properties (insofar as society allowed slaves to own property). * Public slaves, who worked as police-officers, ushers, secretaries, street-sweepers, etc. * War-captives (andrapoda) who served primarily in unskilled tasks at which they could be chained: for example, rowers in commercial ships; or miners. Houseborn slaves (oikogeneis) often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school; they were \\"pedagogues\\" in the first sense of the term.Carlier, p.203. Some of them were the offspring of the master of the house, but in most cities, notably Athens, a child inherited the status of its mother. Sexual reproduction and \\"breeding\\" It appears that the Greeks did not breed their slaves, at least during the Classical Era, though the proportion of house born slaves appears to have been rather large in Ptolemaic Egypt and in manumission inscriptions at Delphi.Garlan, p.59. Sometimes the cause of this was natural; mines, for instance, were exclusively a male domain. Also known as a writer of Socratic dialogues, Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that \\"… nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad.\\"The Economist, IX. Trans H. G. Dakyns, accessed 16 May 2006. The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap,Pritchett and Pippin, pp.276–281. so it may have been cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one.Garlan, p.58. Finley (1997), p.154–155 remains doubtful. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.Garlan, p.58. In Socratic dialogues and Greek plays A house slave appears in the Socratic dialogue, Meno, which was written by Plato. In the beginning of the dialogue, the slave's master, Meo, fails to benefit from Socratic teaching, and reveals himself to be intellectually savage. Socrates turns to the house-slave, who is a boy ignorant of geometry. The boy acknowledges his ignorance and learns from his mistakes and finally establishes a proof of the desired geometric theorem. This is another example of the slave appearing more clever than his master, a popular theme in Greek literature. The comedies of Menander show how the Athenians preferred to view a house-slave: as an enterprising and unscrupulous rascal, who must use his wits to profit from his master, rescue him from his troubles, or gain him the girl of his dreams. We have most of these plays in translations by Plautus and Terence, suggesting that the Romans liked the same genre. And the same sort of tale has not yet become extinct, as the popularity of Jeeves and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum attest. In the Americas The leader of the Haitian revolution, Toussaint L'Ouverture, was a former house slave. House slaves existed in the New World. Haiti In Haiti, before leading the Haitian revolution, Toussaint Louverture had been a house slave. Toussaint is thought to have been born on the plantation of Bréda at Haut de Cap in Saint-Domingue, owned by the Comte de Noé and later managed by Bayon de Libertat.Bell, pp.59-60, 62 Tradition says that he was driver and horse trainer on the plantation. His master freed him at age 33, when Toussaint married Suzanne. \\"Toussaint L’Ouverture\\", HyperHistory , accessed 27 Apr 2008 He was a fervent Catholic, and a member of high degree of the Masonic Lodge of Saint- Domingue.David Brion Davis, \\"He changed the New World\\", Review of Madison Smartt Bell's Toussaint Louverture: A Biography, The New York Review of Books, 31 May 2007, p. 55 In 1790 slaves in the Plaine du Flowera rose in rebellion. Different forces coalesced under different leaders. Toussaint served with other leaders and rose in responsibility. On 4 April 1792, the French Legislative Assembly extended full rights of citizenship to free people of color or mulattoes (gens de couleur libres) and free blacks. United States In many households, treatment of slaves varied with the slave's skin color. Darker-skinned slaves worked in the fields, while lighter-skinned house servants had comparatively better clothing, food and housing.Genovese (1967) As in President Thomas Jefferson's household, the presence of lighter-skinned slaves as household servants was not merely an issue of skin color. Sometimes planters used mixed-race slaves as house servants or favored artisans because they were their children or other relatives. Several of Jefferson's household slaves were possibly children of his father-in-law John Wayles and the enslaved woman Betty Hemings, who were inherited by Jefferson's wife upon her father's death. In turn Jefferson himself had a long relationship with Betty and John Wayles's daughter Sally Hemings, a much younger woman who was mostly of European ancestry and half-sister to Thomas Jefferson's wife. The Hemings children grew up to be closely involved in Jefferson's household staff activities; one became his chef. Two sons trained as carpenters. Three of his four surviving mixed-race children with Sally Hemings passed into white society as adults.Annette Gordon-Reed, The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family, New York: W.W.

It is the formal structure of role and status that can form in a small, stable group. An individual may belong to multiple social systems at once; examples of social systems include nuclear family units, communities , cities, nations, college campuses , corporations, and industries. The organization and definition of groups within a social system depend on various shared properties such as location, socioeconomic status, race, religion, societal function, or other distinguishable features.  Notable theorists  The study of social systems is integral to the fields of sociology and public policy. Social systems have been studied for as long as sociology has existed.  Talcott Parsons  Talcott Parsons was the first to formulate a systematic theory of social systems, which he did as a part of his AGIL paradigm. He defined a social system as only a segment (or a \\"subsystem\\") of what he called action theory. Parsons organized social systems in terms of action units, where one action executed by an individual is one unit. He defines a social system as a network of interactions between actors. According to Parsons, social systems rely on a system of language, and culture must exist in a society in order for it to qualify as a social system. Parsons' work laid the foundations for the rest of the study of social systems theory and ignited the debate over what framework social systems should be built around, such as actions, communication, or other relationships.  Niklas Luhmann  Niklas Luhmann was a prominent sociologist and social systems theorist who laid the foundations of modern social system thought. He based his definition of a \\"social system\\" on the mass network of communication between people and defined society itself as an \\"autopoietic\\" system, meaning a self-referential and self-reliant system that is distinct from its environment. Luhmann considered social systems as belonging to three categories: societal systems, organizations, and interaction systems. Luhmann considered societal systems, such as religion, law, art, education, science, etc., to be closed systems consisting of different fields of interaction. Organizations were defined as a network of decisions which reproduce themselves; his definition is difficult to apply in terms of finding a real- world example. Finally, interaction systems are systems that reproduce themselves on the basis of communication rather than decision making.  Jay Wright Forrester  Jay Wright Forrester founded the field of system dynamics, which deals with the simulation of interactions in dynamic systems. In his work on social systems, he discusses the possibilities of social system dynamics, or modeling social systems using computers with the aim of testing the possible effects of passing new public policies or laws. In his paper he recognized the difficulty of producing a reliable computer model system, but argued that an imperfect model was better than none and simply implementing new policy. Forrester argued that unsuccessful public policies aim to treat the symptoms rather than the causes of social issues and that they also generally focus on efforts rather than on results. This occurs because there is either an incomplete understanding or a misunderstanding of the causes of an issue on the part of the policymakers, which often leads to ineffective or detrimental policies which aggravate the issues they were implemented to correct or cause other issues to arise. Another problem Forrester notes is that some policies which may work in the long run may aggravate an issue in the short run. A successful policy according to Forrester must target the correct leverage points, in this case the aspect of the social problem which, if modified, will produce a sizeable enough effect to correct the problem.  Modeling  One significant problem with studying social systems is the difficulty of forming and testing theories; social systems are not easily manipulated or controlled and large-scale systems cannot be reproduced in a lab setting. However, the rapid increase in the availability of digital data over the last decade gives scientists studying the behaviors of social systems very detailed and much more holistic pictures of how social systems respond to various events and how networked social systems behave. Additionally, the development and popularity of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter offer new ways to study the evolution of social systems and social networking behaviors with social graphs. Even though the behaviors of these systems may be surprising or not yet well understood, the digital age offers a new frontier for the study of social systems. Notable past models are the WORLD2 and WORLD3 models: these both aimed to outline the world's distribution of resources. WORLD3 was based on the Club of Rome's Limits to Growth.

The Best Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award trophy, designed by sculptor Lawrence Nowlan, was presented to the disabled sportsperson adjudged to be the best at the annual ESPY Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. For the 2004 ceremony, the winner was chosen by online voting through choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee. Before that, determination of the winners was made by an panel of experts. Through the 2001 iteration of the ESPY Awards, ceremonies were conducted in February of each year to honor achievements over the previous calendar year; awards presented thereafter are conferred in July and reflect performance from the June previous. The inaugural winner of the Best Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award at the 2002 edition was mountain climber Erik Weihenmayer who suffers from a total visual impairment and he became the first blind person to reach the summit of Mount Everest in May 2001. He is one of three people to have won the award during its three-year history; sprinter Marlon Shirley won the accolade at the 2003 ceremony for becoming the first amputee in history to set a time below eleven seconds in the men's 100 metres at the Utah Summer Games, and Kyle Maynard was voted the winner of the award in the 2004 iteration because of his strong form in freestyle wrestling in high school despite being born with congenital amputation that resulted in the shortening of all his limbs.

Its systemic name is barbiturate amidohydrolase (3-oxo-3-ureidopropanoate-forming). Barbiturase acts as a catalyst in the second step of oxidative pyrimidine degradation, promoting the ring-opening hydrolysis of barbituric acid to ureidomalonic acid. Although grouped into the naturally existing amidohydrolases, it demonstrates more homology with cyanuric acid amidohydrolase. Therefore, it has been proposed that barbiturase, along with cyanuric acid, should be grouped into a new family. KEGG Background Barbiturase consists of four identical subunits, each bound to a zinc (Zn) atom. Absorption spectrum analysis illustrates that zinc is the only cofactor present in barbiturase. Unlike other zinc containing amidohydrolases, the zinc binding motif of barbiturase is found on the carboxylic acid terminus, specifically at amino acids 320 to 324. Several highly conserved histidine residues were found in the zinc binding motif region of barbiturase, suggesting that histidine residues are involved in zinc binding and are necessary for the catalytic activity of barbiturase. Experiments have shown that barbiturase is sensitive to metal ion chelators. Finally, barbiturase activity can be blocked upon addition of other metal ions, such as copper and mercury. The molecular weight of barbiturase is 172000 kD. Its Km is 1.0 mM. Its Vmax is 2.5 µmol/min/mg. The highest enzymatic activity of barbiturase is at pH 8 and 40-45 °C. Above 55 °C barbiturase loses its activity. Reaction The equilibrium of the reaction favors the formation of barbituric acid. Barbiturase is very specific to barbituric acid and will not react with derivatives. Urea, malonate, and cyanuric acid inhibit the hydrolysis of barbituric acid. Dihydro-L-orotate is an intermediate in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway and competitively inhibits barbiturase. In addition, barbituric acid inhibits multiple enzymes that are involved in de novo pyrimidine synthesis. These last two points suggest a connection between pyrimidine anabolism and oxidative catabolism. Barbiturase activity or the existence of oxidative pyrimidine metabolism has not yet been discovered in mammals.

Following his descent into the Underworld Orpheus disobeys Hades’ and Persephone’s condition for release of his wife Eurydice. > \\"To you this tale refers, Who seek to lead your mind Into the upper day; For > he who overcome should turn back his gaze Towards the Tartarean cave, > Whatever excellence he takes with him He loses when he looks on those > below.\\" [ “Boethius, Consolation of Philosophy 3.52] (Cited in “Greek > Mythology Link: Orpheus”) The Gaze of Orpheus has since been evaluated by many a philosopher and literary critic. Common analogies are made between Orpheus’s gaze and writing processes, philosophical interpretation, and artistic origins. Some of the most famous uses of the gaze of Orpheus can be found in Maurice Blanchot’s work The Gaze of Orpheus, Geoffrey Sirc’s, The Composition’s Eye/Orpheus’s Gaze/Cobain’s Journals, and Jaques Lacan’s work on the mirror stage  Interpretations   Maurice Blanchot  Blanchot's interpretation or use of the Gaze of Orpheus is in artistic creation. Some have offered, “…the Orpheus myth as a model which provides ways to discuss many of the features of Blanchot's work, which until now appeared not to have common thematic links” (Champagne 1254). The path taken by Orpheus from light to dark and back to light is symbolic of the artist’s journey from reality to the edges of the surreal, “…the force that enables Orpheus to cross the boundaries of light and life, and to descend to Eurydice, according to Blanchot, is that of art. Rendering this dark point, the lure, the point in which the artist's control is undermined, is also the object of the work of art.” (New Media Narratives). Blanchot uses the myth to transcribe the creative process. “Eurydice's disappearance symbolizes a loss that is recuperated by the compensatory gift of Orpheus's song” (Huffer 175).  Geoffrey Sirc  Another interpretation or usage of the gaze of Orpheus is by Geoffrey Sirc. Sirc uses Orpheus’s moment of violation as argument for creative form in writing versus the standard polished text. Urging the adolescent writer to break free of formal notions of form, Sirc views the journal as the media through which Orpheus yearns for Eurydice. “If the Work is freed of concern, the gaze is transgressive, then we’re clearly not talking about the polished text, especially one oriented dutifully around the tiny truths available through an analysis of middle-brow media” (Sirc 14). Sirc’s primary reference to this is in Kurt Cobain’s Journal’s.  Jaques Lacan  Lacan’s perspective on the gaze of Orpheus is more a matter of desires and yearning. On one hand we have Orpheus gazing towards the underworld, which serves to dissolve the connection between Orpheus and his desire, Eurydice. On the other hand, Orpheus’ role in the upper world is to use his creativity and artistic talent to transform his desires into a recreated form. Lacan uses the topography of the myth to construct his mirror stage. “The mirror stage is not an isolated event or situation that results in a particular configuration of vision: it is both a loss (of primordial polymorphous, autoerotic wholeness) and an ‘achieved anxiety’ (a precocious anticipation of an impossible maturity or return to wholeness” (Linder 82)  See also  *Orpheus *Aornum *Pimpleia *Leibethra  References  *Champagne, Roland A. “Maurice Blanchot et le déplacement d'Orphee (Review)” The French Review, Vol. 74, No. 6, Special Issue on Pedagogy.

The village of Hilliards started out as a mill town, known as Hilliards Mills (for the owner of the gristmill) and became known as Hilliards Station when the Shenango and Allegheny Railroad extended a small route to the community in 1876 to provide service to local coal and oil industries. The village of Hilliards became the southern terminal for the line and provided passenger service for the villages of Eau Claire, Argentine, Annisville, North Washington, Higgins Corners, and Whiskerville until 1935. Eventually, the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad would assume control over the line and called it the Hilliards Branch. In the early 2000s the railroad was abandoned and removed. The headwaters of the popular Slippery Rock Creek is formed in Hilliards, which continues through northern Butler County, then flows through the scenic McConnells Mill State Park, until it is received by Connoquenessing Creek in Ellwood City. Today, the community is much quieter than from the railroad days, but is still serviced by a small church and post office. *the post office is now closed and does not service the village of Hilliards any longer.

RTPases generate 5'-diphosphate-ended mRNA and a phosphate ion from 5'-triphosphate-ended precursor mRNA. mRNA guanylyltransferase then adds a backwards guanosine monophosphate (GMP) group from GTP, generating pyrophosphate, and mRNA (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase methylates the guanine to form the final 5'-cap structure. There are two families of RTPases known so far: *the metal-dependent family. Yeast, protozoan, and viral RTPases require a metal co-factor for their activity, which is most often either Mg2+ or Mn2+. This class of enzymes is also able to hydrolyze free nucleoside triphosphates in the presence of either Mn2+ or Co2+. *the metal-independent family. These groups do not require metals for their activity, and some enzymes have been shown to be inactivated in the presence of metal ions. These enzymes are very much similar to protein tyrosine phosphatases in their structure and mechanism.

The Harmonie would be employed for outdoor or recreational music, or as a wind section of an orchestra. Music composed for Harmonie is often called . Terminology Horace Fitzpatrick writes (reference below): > From about 1756 onward the Emperor [in Vienna] and the Austrian nobles kept > house bands called Harmonien, usually made of pairs of oboes, horns, > bassoons, and after about 1770, clarinets. These wind groups formed part of > the household musical staff, and provided serenade for banquets and garden > parties. Joseph II kept a crack Harmonie for his private delectation, drawn > from the principal wind players of the Imperial opera. His successor Franz > II carried on this practice. According to Haydn biographer Rosemary Hughes: > \\"Feldharmonie\\"German: \\"field Harmonie\\", or simply \\"Harmonie,\\" was the wind > band, maintained by most noblemen even when they could not afford a larger > orchestra, for performing at hunting parties and other outdoor > entertainments.'' Roger Hellyer, writing in the Grove DictionaryHellyer (2008) notes that while the Harmonie generally had an aristocratic patron, the same music was sometimes also played by street musicians. A letter by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to his father Leopold (3 November 1781) noted that street musicians had serenaded him with his own composition, the wind serenade K. 375. In English, the word \\"Harmonie\\" exists only as a technical term of historical musicology. In other European languages, such as Dutch, French and German, the term may also refer to a modern wind band. The expression , used in Dutch, is the abbreviation and contraction of \\"Harmonie\\" (concert band), \\"Fanfare\\" (fanfare band and/or fanfare orchestra, usually with a marching band connotation) and \\"Brassband\\" (brass band), an umbrella term for all types of wind bands, including the types with additional non-wind instruments such as the typical battery of a marching band. \\"Harmonie\\" as wind section The aristocrats who employed a Harmonie would often also maintain a small orchestra, numerically dominated by, or consisting entirely of, the string section. When members of the Harmonie participated in performances with such orchestras, it became possible for the composer to enrich the musical texture with wind parts, without increasing the payroll cost of his patron. Thus, \\"Harmonie\\" came also to designate the wind section of a small orchestra. Of this practice, Fitzpatrick writes, \\"It was [Franz II's Harmonie] who made up the wind section in Beethoven's orchestra of 1800 [at the premiere of the composer's First Symphony].\\" Joseph Haydn's Mass in B flat major, (H. 22/14, 1802) is nicknamed the \\"Harmoniemesse\\", because (unlike the other masses Haydn wrote during this time) it includes parts for a whole wind section, thanks to the recent reinstatement of these instruments in the musical establishment of Prince Nikolaus Esterházy II.  Music arranged for Harmonie  The 18th- century German expression \\"auf Harmonie setzen\\" (: set onto Harmonie) means arranging a piece of music for performance by a Harmonie. For instance Der Messias, Mozart's arrangement of Handel's Messiah, included that several movements became \\"\\". History During the historical period of the Harmonie, the ensemble gradually grew in size. Hellyer (2006) suggests that during the early period, in the 1750s, a Harmonie could consist of just five instruments (two oboes, two horns, and one bassoon), though a second bassoon could be included as well.Hellyer 2006, 532 The Harmonie compositions of Haydn and Mozart (see below) all use at least six instruments. A later expansion of the Harmonie can be traced with the accession of Joseph II to the throne of the Austrian Empire in 1780. Joseph expanded music-making at his court in a number of ways, including the introduction of a Harmonie, as noted above. This Harmonie consisted of eight players, with two clarinets added to the traditional two oboes, two horns, and two bassoons. Other nobles then followed the Emperor's lead.Source for this paragraph: Hellyer 2006, 535 The Emperor's Harmonie included some distinguished players, notably the clarinettist Anton Stadler, who was the inspiration for a number of important works by Mozart. It also included Anton's younger brother Johann, as well as the oboist , a composer of over 80 works for Harmonie,Keefe 2006 and oboist/composer Josef Triebensee. The Harmonie continued as a lively musical tradition until the Napoleonic Wars forced aristocrats to retrench financially, cutting down on the number of musicians they employed. The tradition had been largely abandoned by the mid-1830s.Grove, \\"Harmoniemusik\\" Examples of Harmonie music Some of Joseph Haydn's early works, called divertimenti or Feldpartien,German for \\"field partitas\\"; Hughes were written for the Harmonie of his first full-time employer, Count Morzin around 1760.Hughes, 1974 Haydn became Vice-Kapellmeister for the Prince Paul Anton Esterházy in 1761, which was the same year that the Prince established a six-member Harmonie; Hellyer suggests that some of Haydn's early works for Harmonie were intended for this ensemble.New Grove, \\"Harmoniemusik\\" Mozart also wrote for Harmonie. As a teenager traveling in Italy, he wrote the early Divertimenti K. 186 and K. 166 (1773); see Divertimenti for ten winds (Mozart). He wrote further divertimenti between 1775 and 1777, while working at the Salzburg court (K. 213, 240, 252, 253, 270). Some time after his move to Vienna (1781), Mozart wrote his most extended work for Harmonie, the Serenade in B flat, K. 361 (a.k.a. Gran Partita). This is for an amplified wind ensemble of 13 instruments (two oboes, two clarinets, two basset horns, four (French) horns, two bassoons, and a string bass).Hellyer 2006, 533-534 dates the work somewhere between 1781 and 1784; for further discussion see Serenade No. 10 for winds. His E flat serenade of 1781, K. 375, is written for a Harmonie consisting of clarinets, bassoons and horns, curiously mismatching what the new Emperor had arranged as his Harmonie; Hellyer suggests Mozart, who was seeking a job at court at the time, was misinformed. Mozart later revised the work to include two oboe parts. Perhaps the weightiest of all music for Harmonie is Mozart's Serenade No. 12 for winds in C minor, K. 388, written in 1782 for Joseph II's eight- player Harmonie.For discussion see http://www.answers.com/topic/serenade- no-12-for-winds-in-c-minor-nacht-musique-k-388-k-384a Hellyer calls it \\"a curiously sombre and powerful work which often conveys a mood of dramatic intensity totally alien to the informal background music normally associated with the serenade type.\\"Hellyer 2006 535 At the banquet in the finale of Don Giovanni, Mozart has a \\"Harmonie\\" perform parts from Una cosa rara by Vicente Martín y Soler, I due litiganti by Giuseppe Sarti and the aria \\"Non più andrai\\" from his own The Marriage of Figaro. The scoring is for the full eight-part Harmonie, two each of oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns.

Personal background  Rondón was born into extreme poverty in San José de Río Chico, Miranda, Venezuela, and decided to escape his poor surroundings by enlisting in the Venezuelan military at an early age.  Professional career  When Rondón turned professional, his year of birth was listed as 1944; in fact it was 1938. Rondón began fighting as a middleweight and made a name for himself with upset victories over former world welterweight champion Luis Rodríguez and middleweight contender Bennie Briscoe. However, Rondon was growing and quickly established himself as a top rated light heavyweight with impressive wins over Roger Rouse, Eddie Talhami, and Allen Thomas. World Light heavyweight Champion Bob Foster did not seem eager to fight the #2 ranked Rondón or the #1 rated Jimmy Dupree. The WBA stripped Foster of his title and matched Rondón and Dupree. In an exciting slugfest, Rondón climbed off the canvas in the second round to stop the favored Dupree at 2:58 of the 6th round. At the time of the stoppage, referee Zack Clayton had the fight scored even at 47–47. Judge Dimas Hernandez also scored the bout 47–47, and judge Gustavo Vargas favored Rondón, 48–47. Following the fight, a controversy broke out with Dupree claiming he was drugged. The United Press International published a story of the claim. In the UPI article, Charliese Smith, a registered nurse and friend of Dupree said, \\"I believe Jimmy was drugged. I saw Jimmy after the fight and he was very very weak. His vision was blurry and he couldn't even see the other side of the room.\\" She went on to say, \\"I know of muscle relaxants that can be administered in food and I'm convinced that Jimmy was given something.\\" Regardless of the charges, the World Boxing Association recognized Rondón as world champion, while The Ring magazine viewed Bob Foster as the legitimate Light heavyweight king. 1971 was an outstanding year for Rondón with a number of title defenses. He became the first and only fighter to stop Gomeo Brennan. Many experts felt that Rondón could and would defeat Bob Foster. Rondon flopped badly against Foster in 1972; being destroyed in two rounds. A venture into the heavyweight ranks proved just as bad, as he was beaten by Earnie Shavers, Ron Lyle and José Urtain. Rondón did better in 1973 as he started to trim down in weight. He looked highly skilled and impressive by scoring a 10 round decision over undefeated prospect Oliver Wright on Miami Beach. Shortly after, he stopped heavyweight Mike \\"Jim\\" Boswell in four rounds. Sadly, Rondón's private life was full of demons. He was developing a drinking problem and spending money like it was going out of style. An attempt to regain the light heavyweight title, saw him drop a decision to number 1 rated Len Hutchins, and then suffer a 9th round technical knockout to John Conteh. In 1974, Rondón, weighing 188 pounds, went back to the heavyweight division, where he would be largely unsuccessful. He was unable to get off the stool for round three in his fight with Rodney Bobick at Miami Beach, Florida. In his next fight he was knocked out in two rounds by former world heavyweight title contender José Roman.  Life after boxing  Shortly thereafter Rondón's career hit the skids and so did he. He was confined to a mental hospital, and later arrested on charges of robbing a store for $150. Rondon served a prison sentence, and there are unconfirmed reports that he boxed some exhibitions or possibly a professional match while incarcerated. Rondón was released from prison a physical wreck. Vicente Paul Rondón, the boxing idol of his country, died forgotten, broke and in poverty in Santa Ana de Carapita, a slum of Caracas. Rondón had been living with his elderly mother at the time. He was 54 when he died.

Maeda was designed by The Aeronautical Institute of the Imperial University in Tokyo. It was designed with all the requirements that the Army's Troop Transport Command needed. The main problem that the army faced was the difficulty of moving armored fighting vehicles long distances over the main islands of Japan to resist seaborne invasion. They came up with the idea that it could be done by equipping the vehicle with wings, empennage, and take-off carriages. Once landed, all the items that needed to make the vehicle airborne would be quickly detached to allow it to go into action as a ground vehicle. In 1939, the Japanese Amy Air Force Examination Department began the Special Tank Project Number 3 that was given the name Sora-Sha (“air vehicle”). Later it became Kuro-Sha which means “black vehicle”. The kuro-Sha became the Ku-6, its gliding series. While Mitsubishi built the special tank, Maedo Koken Kogyo constructed the wing and empennage.

History Previously Hinjawadi was a village until the construction of the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park. Now it is one of the epicenters of IT industry in Pune. To improve the overall planning and development of Hinjewadi area, it was brought under the jurisdiction of PMRDA. The state government in the past rejected the demands to bring the area under the jurisdiction of either PMC or PCMC as the area needed special attention park comprises three phases with further phases planned. Hinjawadi Industries Association (HIA) was laid out to provide a joint forum to all stakeholders based out of Hinjawadi and nearby places. Hinjawadi is a proposed hub for integrated townships in Pimpri- Chinchwad. The new Special Township Policy Act of the Maharashtra government has laid down an integrated approach to the development of townships to de- congest Pune Municipal Corporation areas and encourage new settlements in its periphery though higher FSI (floor space index) than what is normally allowed in the municipal limits.  Transport  Road transport Due to rapid development, Hinjawadi is facing serious traffic problems during peak hours. From 8.00 AM to 12:00 PM and 5.30 PM to 8.00 PM, HMVs (Heavy Motor Vehicles) are not allowed to enter the area due to high congestion on the roads and the number of vehicles are increasing due to a lot of career opportunities. Above 2.5 Lacs employees travel daily to and from the IT park. In Rainy seasons people starting from Phase 3 or Phase 2 used to spend minimum 1 hour in just crossing Hinjawadi and to reach till Wakad bridge which is merely 3 Kilometer distance. The roads are potholes laden and full of encroachments. The Hinjawadi Industries Association (HIA) had logged numerous complaints to the local and state government, but nothing has moved. The employees of IT companies also protested by forming a human chain, but it has made no impact on the authorities. As this was not enough, the small lanes within the IT park were dug up for pipeline work and then never reconstructed. Because of the worst road conditions, minor accidents involving IT employees is a regular picture. Back, Neck and Shoulder injuries are common among the engineers. There are two more approach roads proposed to reduce the traffic congestion, but almost after 15 years of establishment of the IT park, these roads still remain proposed. The Wakad bridge is a planning marvel in itself. When the authorities were planning for Phase 1 till Phase 4 of the IT park, this bridge was constructed with only 2 lanes. So from both sides, 3 lanes merge into single lane, creating traffic mess day and night. Hinjawadi Line-3 Pune Metro Railways Hinjawadi Metro Line 3 (Pune Metro) is under construction.

It is the most significant long-lived fission product of uranium fission, producing the largest fraction of the total long-lived radiation emissions of nuclear waste. Technetium-99 has a fission product yield of 6.0507% for thermal neutron fission of uranium-235. The metastable technetium-99m (99mTc) is a short-lived (half-life about 6 hours) nuclear isomer used in nuclear medicine, produced from molybdenum-99. It decays by isomeric transition to technetium-99, a desirable characteristic, since the very long half-life and type of decay of technetium-99 imposes little further radiation burden on the body. Radiation The weak beta emission is stopped by the walls of laboratory glassware. Soft X-rays are emitted when the beta particles are stopped, but as long as the body is kept more than 30 cm away these should pose no problem. The primary hazard when working with technetium is inhalation of dust; such radioactive contamination in the lungs can pose a significant cancer risk. Role in nuclear waste Due to its high fission yield, relatively long half-life, and mobility in the environment, technetium-99 is one of the more significant components of nuclear waste. Measured in becquerels per amount of spent fuel, it is the dominant producer of radiation in the period from about 104 to 106 years after the creation of the nuclear waste.K. Yoshihara, \\"Technetium in the Environment\\" in \\"Topics in Current Chemistry: Technetium and Rhenium\\", vol. 176, K. Yoshihara and T. Omori (eds.), Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, 1996. The next shortest- lived fission product is samarium-151 with a half-life of 90 years, though a number of actinides produced by neutron capture have half-lives in the intermediate range. Releases An estimated 160 TBq (about 250 kg) of technetium-99 was released into the environment up to 1994 by atmospheric nuclear tests. The amount of technetium-99 from nuclear reactors released into the environment up to 1986 is estimated to be on the order of 1000 TBq (about 1600 kg), primarily by nuclear fuel reprocessing; most of this was discharged into the sea. In recent years, reprocessing methods have improved to reduce emissions, but the primary release of technetium-99 into the environment is by the Sellafield plant, which released an estimated 550 TBq (about 900 kg) from 1995-1999 into the Irish Sea. From 2000 onwards the amount has been limited by regulation to 90 TBq (about 140 kg) per year. In the environment The long half-life of technetium-99 and its ability to form an anionic species make it (along with 129I) a major concern when considering long-term disposal of high-level radioactive waste. Many of the processes designed to remove fission products from medium-active process streams in reprocessing plants are designed to remove cationic species like caesium (e.g., 137Cs, 134Cs) and strontium (e.g., 90Sr). Hence the pertechnetate escapes through these treatment processes. Current disposal options favor burial in geologically stable rock. The primary danger with such a course is that the waste is likely to come into contact with water, which could leach radioactive contamination into the environment. The natural cation-exchange capacity of soils tends to immobilize plutonium, uranium, and caesium cations. However, the anion-exchange capacity is usually much smaller, so minerals are less likely to adsorb the pertechnetate and iodide anions, leaving them mobile in the soil. For this reason, the environmental chemistry of technetium is an active area of research. In 2012 the crystalline compound Notre Dame Thorium Borate-1 (NDTB-1) was presented by researchers at the University of Notre Dame. It can be tailored to safely absorb radioactive ions from nuclear waste streams. Once captured, the radioactive ions can then be exchanged for higher-charged species of a similar size, recycling the material for re-use. Lab results using the NDTB-1 crystals removed approximately 96 percent of technetium-99. Transmutation An alternative disposal method, transmutation, has been demonstrated at CERN for technetium-99. This transmutation process bombards the technetium (99Tc as a metal target) with neutrons, forming the short-lived 100Tc (half-life 16 seconds) which decays by beta decay to stable ruthenium (100Ru).

Named for USS Ozark, a civil war monitor, she was the third U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name.  Constructed in Oregon  Originally laid down as CM–7 by the Willamette Iron and Steel Corporation of Portland, Oregon 12 July 1941, the ship was launched on 15 June 1942; sponsored by Mrs. A. J. Byrholdt. Ozark, a $12,500,000 vessel, and her sister Catskill, were the largest naval vessels constructed in the Columbia River area to that time.Wire service, \\"Cruiser- Minelayer Launched in Oregon\\", San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 17 June 1942, Volume 48, page 3. The ship was redesignated AP–107 on 1 May 1943 and again redesignated LSV–2 on 21 April 1944. The vessel was commissioned on 23 September 1944 with Captain Frederick P. Williams in command.  World War II service   Philippine operations  Following shakedown, Ozark sailed for Manus, Admiralty Islands, where she reported 16 November to Commander, U.S. 7th Fleet, for assignment to the 3rd Amphibious Force. After intensive training the new vehicle landing ship departed 31 December for Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, Philippine Islands as a unit of invasion Task Group 79.1. On 9 January, S-Day for the Lingayen invasion, Ozark supplied 15 DUKWs carrying two battalions of supporting artillery, which were landed before noon.Morison, Samuel Eliot, \\"History of United States Naval Operations in World War II, Volume XIII: The Liberation of the Philippines - Luzon, Mindanao, the Visayas 1944-1945\\", Little Brown and Company, Boston, 1959, 1989, Library of Congress card number 47-1571, page 127.  Iwo Jima operations  Subsequent to that successful operation, she steamed for the Marianas where she joined Transport Squadron 15 at Saipan for the invasion of Iwo Jima. She landed three waves of troops there 19 February 1945 and continued logistic support to the beach until 27 February.  Supporting Okinawa operations  After transporting wounded marines to Guam for hospital care, Ozark reported to Transport Squadron 13 at Leyte rehearsing for the invasion of Okinawa. She landed her troops and equipment on Okinawa 1 April and again remained to lend logistic support to beach operations until departing 10 April for Guam.  End-of-war operations  With the end of World War II in the Pacific near, Ozark was chosen to transport select occupational units to Japan. In an operation that took two days working around the clock, 911 officers and men were transferred to her at sea by breeches buoy from 9 aircraft carriers, 3 battleships, 2 cruisers, and 6 destroyers. Ozark entered Tokyo Bay 30 August where she debarked her special landing force. After making two complete tours with the \\"Magic Carpet\\" Fleet returning overseas troops to the United States after the war, Ozark transited the Panama Canal and arrived Barrow, Alaska 31 January 1946 where she was placed in upkeep status. She commenced pre-inactivation overhaul in Orange, Texas 14 March and decommissioned 29 June.  Operating as MCS-2  Ozarks hull classification was changed 7 February 1955 from LSV–2 to MCS–2. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register 1 September 1961, she was returned to the Maritime Administration and placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet and berthed at Beaumont, Texas. USS Ozark at sea on 31 August 1966. She was reacquired by the Navy 19 June 1963 for conversion to a mine countermeasures support ship by the Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Corporation and reinstated on the Naval Register 1 October 1963. Recommissioned USS Ozark (MCS-2) on 24 June 1966 (complete with the ship's bell from the second ) she was assigned to MinRon 8, homeported in Charleston, South Carolina where she became flagship for Commander, Mine Forces, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. After shakedown and intensive training at Guantanamo Bay, she remained in port for the rest of the year. With the Navy’s first minesweeping launches (MSL, Mark IV) and helicopters (RH-3A) on board, Ozark conducted her first mine countermeasures training in the Charleston area early in 1967. USS Ozark as a target ship, aground near Perdido Key in 1979. After a cruise to several western European ports in 1967, she continued to operate in the Charleston, South Carolina, area until deploying to the Mediterranean 18 November. Returning to Charleston 14 February 1969 she began material maintenance and upkeep followed by periodic deployment to the West Indies and the South Atlantic Ocean. Decommissioned and struck from the Naval Register, 1 April 1974, she was towed to a location south of Destin, Florida and anchored there while being used as a target by the Air Force from Eglin Air Force Base. Ozark was hit multiple times with large practice (non-explosive) bombs but was not sunk. In September 1979, Ozark was ripped loose from her anchorage by Hurricane Frederic and driven onto the beach near Perdido Key, Florida. Naval units from Norfolk, Virginia, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Hawthorne, Nevada, participated in a salvage effort that began in October 1979. Sinking This photo shows Ozark listing at 16 degrees to starboard 12 hours before she sank. This photo shows the entry hole of a Maverick missile milliseconds after impact.After salvage, she was returned to Destin, and unintentionally sunk with a Maverick missile launched from a United States Air Force F-4 Phantom II from Eglin Air Force Base in 1981. The missile's warhead entered on her starboard side approximately above the waterline, went through two decks, and exploded above the hull, leaving a hole approximately in diameter in her hull. The hole in the bottom of the ship was not noticed until the next day when U.S. Air Force personnel and Hughes Missile Systems Company engineers entered the ship for damage assessment. By this time, she was listing 16 degrees and all personnel were ordered off the ship. The wreck currently lies upright and intact in the Gulf of Mexico in approximately of water, due south of Destin at .

Bersanov served as the head of the Chechen-Ingush Ministry of Culture for nearly forty years, and his prolific writings edified moral responsibility and ethics in Chechen culture.  Biography  Bersanov was born in the village of Shami-Yurt to Chechen parents. His father died at the age of five, leaving his mother to struggle to raise her four children. Nevertheless, Bersanov was regarded as intellectual youth among his community—he had advanced two grades within one academic year at the boarding school in the nearby village of Sernovodsk—and was often seen as wise and helpful. Bersanov was unable to finish school, however, as it had been closed during the war against Finland in 1939, and all senior students were conscripted into the Red Army while the others were forced to return home. He returned to work as a secretary in his native village. At the age of seventeen Khozh-Akhmed and his family were removed from Shami-Yurt to Kazakhstan on February 23, 1944, as a result of the forced deportations of most Chechens to Central Asia. The experience would profoundly affect his life and writing, as his time in the Kazakh steppes led him to develop a more conscious appreciation for his Chechen homeland. Bersanov returned with his family to Chechnya in 1957, acquiring his diploma and working in various government jobs, both in Chechnya and Kazakhstan. He realized, however, that his passion was the development of Chechen as a literary language, as many of the folk histories and cultural traditions had not been written down at the time, and they risked being lost to future generations after the deportation. He joined the faculty of the Chechen-Ingush Ministry of Culture in the mid-1960s, a time when increased cultural awareness had flourished throughout much of the North Caucasus. During this time, Bersanov wrote articles describing the Chechen people to newspapers internationally, as his writings were featured in Bulgaria, Germany, Poland, and the United States, as well as throughout the Soviet Union. He also published the storybooks Lame Starling and Adventures of Hadji Murad in 1966, to popular reception from critics and the press, and gave him a certain degree of renown throughout the region. By the end of the decade, Khozh-Akhmed had become the head of the Chechen-Ingush Ministry of Culture, a position he would hold until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Over the years, Bersanov published numerous books, many of which were tailored to a younger audience: In the Wake of the Father (1971) dealt with the experiences of Soviet World War II veterans, and the novels Spring (1979) and Golden Ring (1979) explored the lives of the veterans' sons. Horseman Steel Horse (1983) recounted the exploits of Chechen resistance during the Caucasian War and the history of the Chechen people during peacetime. Friendship, Bonded by Blood (1986) told of the friendship between Chechen war veteran Magomed Gaysurkaev and Russian Ivan Shumov, and probably his best- known book, Treasure of Wisdom, the Path to Happiness (1990), painted a reflective discourse on the Chechen code of honor. The book's circulation soon exceeded five million, and drew glowing reviews from literary editors worldwide. He once said, \\"Only books with a view to building and nurturing a whole human being will certainly benefit children. And not every book written on an excellent topic is in itself beautiful.\\" On April 12, 2006, Bersanov celebrated his eightieth birthday in the auditorium of the Chechen Ministry of Culture. Attending guests included writers, poets, journalists, leaders of the Chechen Republic Ministry of Culture, and former colleagues.http://chermo.org/forum/showthread.php?t=768 He is married with ten children, twenty-two grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

He refereed at the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, and regularly took charge of Super Rugby and Currie Cup matches. He also acted as a TMO at the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan. Career Jonker began playing rugby at school. After matriculating at Hoerskool Gert Maritz in Pietermaritzburg, he joined the South African police force and played rugby as a fly-half for Pietermaritzburg Police. He also gained diplomas in Human Resources and Labour Relations. In September 1994, he moved to Richards Bay to take up employment with Bell Equipment, and played rugby for North Coast Rhinos of Empangeni in Zululand. He then played for Richards Bay, where he was the captain of the first XV and the club captain. His refereeing career began by chance in 2000 when the referee failed to turn up for a local game in Richards Bay and Jonker took his place. In 2004, Jonker refereed at the Under-19 World Championship, which was held in South Africa, and had charge of the final, between France and New Zealand. The following year he made his debut in the Super 12 and Currie Cup and also officiated at the Under-21 World Championship in Argentina, where he refereed a semi-final. In August 2005, he made his international debut when he was in charge of a Rugby World Cup qualifying match between Uganda and Zimbabwe in Kampala. In June 2006 he refereed the Pacific Nations Cup match between the Junior all Blacks and Samoa and the mid-year international between Fiji and Italy. In November he was the referee for the Autumn International between Ireland and Australia, which was the last game to be played at the old Lansdowne Road ground. In March 2007 he took charge of his first Six Nations match, the Calcutta Cup match between Scotland and England. A month later, despite having handled only seven internationals, Jonker was named as one of three 'debutants' (the others were Wayne Barnes of England and Nigel Owens of Wales) in the 12-man panel of referees for the pool stages of the 2007 Rugby World Cup; he refereed three games, including Scotland v New Zealand, and was one of the touch judges for the semi-final between England and France. Jonker was placed third on merit in South Africa's 12-man panel of national referees in November 2008, behind Jonathan Kaplan and Mark Lawrence. Together they and fourth-placed Craig Joubert were included in a merit panel of nine referees chosen by SANZAR to handle the majority of matches in the 2009 Super 14 regardless of nationality; he became the first South African to referee as a non-neutral in South Africa when he had charge of the first-round match between the Bulls and the Queensland Reds in Pretoria on 14 February 2009. In addition to his refereeing activities, Jonker is Security Manager for the Bell Group. He and his wife, Belinda, have two children, Rynhardt and Brenda. Jonker retired from refereeing at the end of the 2014 season, with an international match between and the last one in which he refereed.

Comparison example: Palm Springs is considered \\"Low Desert\\", at above sea level. In contrast, Landers is considered \\"High Desert\\", at above sea level. The term is used commonly to refer to Joshua Tree National Park, Twentynine Palms, and the Morongo Basin. The High Desert may be used to describe the area as extending as far north as Victorville and Lancaster, and as far northwest as Palmdale, and north to the Barstow desert. High Desert has also been incorporated into the names of businesses and organizations in these areas.High Desert Mavericks BaseballHigh Desert Academy of Applied Arts. Geography Old Woman Springs Ridge in the high desert, Johnson Valley, California Depending on how the boundaries of the Mojave and the Colorado Desert region are defined, the High Desert either includes the entire California portion of the Mojave Desert (using a smaller geographic designation than its ecoregion) or the northern portion of the California desert (using a larger geographic designation including the ecotope area of the lower and adjacent Sonoran Desert). The name of the region comes from its higher elevations and more northern latitude with associated climate and plant communities distinct from the Low Desert, which includes the Colorado Desert and the below sea level Salton Sea. The High Desert is typically windier than the Low Desert, and averages between 12 degrees to 20 degrees Fahrenheit cooler in both the winter and summer seasons. Regions The High Desert is often divided into the following regions: *The Los Angeles County portion, containing the Antelope Valley, part of the Palmdale-Lancaster Urbanized Area, and in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. This is the most populous area of the High Desert region, with close to 320,000 residents in the incorporated places alone. *The San Bernardino County portion, containing Victor Valley, which is part of the Inland Empire area of Southern California, along with the Antelope Valley and the Morongo Basin, where Yucca Valley and the Twentynine Palms Marine Base are located, are all considered to be part of the Greater Los Angeles Area. Just after sunset, Landers, California Other parts of the San Bernardino County portion include the northeastern reaches of the High Desert, where the Fort Irwin National Training Center and the Searles Valley are located, and the far eastern edge of the state where places like Needles and Earp are located along the Colorado River. San Bernardino County's portion of the High Desert region contains the most land mass of the four involved counties, making up approximately 70% of the total county's area. *The Kern County portion, containing part of two valleys, with the southeastern part in the Antelope Valley, including Rosamond, California City, Boron, Edwards Air Force Base, and Mojave, which are all a part of the Palmdale-Lancaster Urbanized area, and the northeastern part being in the Indian Wells Valley, including the communities of Inyokern and Ridgecrest. *The Inyo County portion, north of Kern County and containing the northern end of the Indian Wells Valley, Panamint Valley, and Saline Valley. This is the most sparsely populated area of the High Desert, with a single major community, Lone Pine in the southern Owens Valley. Cities and communities Sunset over the Mojave The major metropolitan centers in the region are primarily centered on the cities of Lancaster and Victorville. Lancaster, the largest city in the High Desert, is located in the Antelope Valley next to Palmdale and anchors the area's largest and most populous region with a metro area of just over 500,000. The Victor Valley area, which includes cities and communities such as Victorville, Hesperia, Adelanto, Apple Valley, and Lucerne Valley, boasts a population around 335,000. The Barstow area, to the north of Victor Valley, and the Morongo Basin near Joshua Tree National Park both have populations of around 60,000.

He turned pro in 1927, and knocked out \\"Battleship Sword\\" in the fall of that year. Early career, 1931-2 On May 22, 1931, New York native Yale Okun became his fifth round knockout victim in Miami. The final blow was a straight right to the jaw.

Cancela drilled staggering rights to the head of a groggy Knight in the closing round. Many ringside believed Cancela, the bout's consistent aggressor, should have earned the decision with a comfortable margin.\\"Joe Knight Defeats Cancella in Miami\\", The Tampa Times, Tampa, Florida, pg. 8, 8 January 1932 Don Petrin, who claimed a late foul, fell to Knight in a fourth round knockout at Miami's Biscayne Arena on February 15, 1932.

He closed strong in the final rounds scoring several times with lefts to the head.\\"Joe Knight Defeats Belanger in Boston\\", The Tampa Times, Tampa, Florida, pg. 8, 24 May 1932 The decision was unpopular with the crowd who felt Belanger had gained a winning margin on points in the last six rounds.\\"Joe Knight is Winner Over Winnipeg Boxer\\", Tallahassee Democrat, Tallahassee, Florida, pg. 2, 24 May 1932 On the first of July, 1932, Knight challenged Bob Godwin for the Southern Light Heavyweight Title at Daytona Beach, and received a ten round draw decision.

Losing the NBA World Light Heavyweight Title to Bob Godwin, March, 1933 Knight lost the NBA World Light Heavyweight title to contender Bob Godwin on March 1, 1933 in a ten round points decision at Legion Arena in West Palm Beach, Florida. Godwin employed excellent blocking and though he took many hard licks in the lengthy bout, he was the aggressor throughout and won the infighting, particularly after Knight tired by mid-bout.\\"Bob Godwin Gets Another Decision Over Joe Knight\\", The Tampa Times, Tampa, Florida, pg. 10, 2 March 1933 Godwin took two of the first five rounds, with three even. Drawing on remarkable stamina, the 21-year old Godwin won the next four rounds, leaving the tenth even. Godwin took a beating in the bout, with both eyes badly swollen by the end. It was a primitive match requiring limited boxing skill or ring generalship.\\"Bob Godwin Beats Joe Knight to Win N.B.A. Fistic Crown\\", The Journal Times, Racine, Wisconsin, pg. 13, 2 March 1933 Knight won only two of the five meetings between him and Godwin.\\"Knight Beaten by Bob Godwin\\", The Miami News, Miami, Florida, pg. 10, 2 March 1933 Max Marek, the tenth ranked heavyweight in the world, fell to Knight in a ten round points decision at Miami Beach on April 13, 1936. Though giving up fifteen pounds, Knight used his speed and experience to his advantage. The bout one of Knight's best displays of skill. In the third, he nearly staggered Marek with a left to the chin, but Marek fought back harder, and remained the aggressor throughout much of the bout, delivering a variety of solid punches. In a brutal bout, Knight closed well in the last three rounds, clipping two lefts to the chin of Marek in the tenth.Bell, Jack, \\"Over the Sport Desk\\", The Miami News, Miami, Florida, pg. 16, 14 April 1936\\"Knight Gets Palm in Mill at Miami\\", The Palm Beach Post, West Palm Beach, Florida, pg. 8, 14 April 1936 Knight beat Lou Scozza at the Biscayne Arena in Miami on June 12, 1933 in a ten round points decision.

The referee and one judge scored the match as a dead heat giving three rounds to each contestant, but Sam Roberts, the remaining judge gave the bout to Knight by the slimmest margin of one round. Rosenbloom employed his common but controversial habit of flicking and backhanding his opponent's face and body with an open glove. Whether this was a foul or fair determined whether the judges scored Knight or Rosenbloom the winner. Most ringside, however, felt Knight deserved the winning vote and the title.Godwin, Frank, \\"Champion Gains Huge Advantage With Slapping\\", The Miami News, Miami, Florida, pg. 14, 6 February 1934 Knight lost to Tony Shucco, New England Light Heavyweight Champion, on May 11, 1934 before 3,358, in a close ten round unanimous decision at Boston Garden. Knight appeared to have the better of the early bout, but Shucco rallied in the closing rounds.\\"Tony Shucco Beats Joe Knight in East\\", The Des Moines Register, Des Moines, Iowa, pg. 8, 12 May 1934 Through much of the bout, Shucco stood off at long range and flicked jabs at Knight's head to avoid his withering blows.\\"Joe Knight Loses Hairline Verdict to Shucco in Boston\\", The Miami News, Miami, Florida, pg. 8, 12 May 1934 One reporter gave Shucco only five rounds, Knight four, and one even.\\"Tony Shucco Receives Nod Over Joe Knight\\", The Winnipeg Tribune, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, pg. 23, 12 May 1934 Knight defeated Carl Knowles on June 8, 1934 in a tenth round technical knockout in a brutal bout in Savannah.

Beaten and exhausted, Knight remained strictly on defense after the fifth round. Though he would fight on for two more years, he tried to officially retire shortly after the bout.\\"Knight Loses to Al Gainer\\", Miami Daily News, Miami, Florida, pg. 10, 2 June 1936\\"Joe Knight Quits Fighting Career\\", The Tampa Times, Tampa, Florida, pg. 16, 5 June 1936\\"Colored Fighter Captures Every Round\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 16, 2 June 1936 Fellow Southpaw Melio Bettina won a decisive ten round decision over Knight at Miami Beach on June 18, 1937.

It was first awarded as part of the ESPY Awards in 2004 after the non-gender-specific Best Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award was presented the previous two years (with American snowboarder Shaun White receiving the 2003 award). The Best Male Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award trophy, created by sculptor Lawrence Nowlan, is presented to the male adjudged to be the best action sports athlete in a given calendar year. Balloting for the award is undertaken by fans over the Internet from between three and five choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee, which is composed of a panel of experts. It is conferred in July to reflect performance and achievement over the preceding twelve months. The inaugural winner of the Best Male Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award at the 2004 awards was freestyle BMX rider Ryan Nyquist. During 1997 and 2003, Nyquist won eleven out of eighteen available freestyle BMX medals at the X Games. He became the first freestyle BMX rider to be nominated for, and thus the first to win, an ESPY Award. The 2006 winner of the Best Male Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award was Shaun White. He was nominated a further five consecutive times between the 2008 and 2012 ceremonies, all of which he won, making him the athlete with the most victories with six. The two other athletes to have earned successive awards are street skateboarder Nyjah Huston and motocross rider Ryan Dungey. Canadian snowboarder Mark McMorris became the first non-American to win the accolade in 2017 by earning three medals at that year's X Games in Minneapolis. Snowboarders are the most successful sportspeople (with seven awards), followed by motocross riders and street skateboarders (three). It was not awarded in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In March 2018, it has been announced that, following the departure of lead producer Kim Tae-ho, all current members have stepped down from the show, bringing the program to an end. The last episode was aired on March 31, 2018, but the program has continued for 3 more weeks with recap special that looks back at the program over the years. Contents Infinite Challenge is recognized as the first \\"Real-Variety\\" show in Korean television history. The program is largely unscripted, filmed in almost-secrecy and followed a similar format of challenge-based reality television programs. The challenges are often absurd or impossible to achieve, so the program takes on the satirical comedy aspect of a variety show rather than a standard reality or competition program. In earlier episodes, the show's six hosts and staff would continuously proclaim that, in order to achieve its comedic purposes, the program had to be \\"3-D\\": Dirty, Dangerous, and Difficult.'Infinite Challenge Dictionary' got hugely popular (Korean), Dkbnews, Retrieved on January 22, 2007 It gives people fun to try things that seem impossible. Recurring segments These segments were featured in multiple episodes over the years due to their popularity. * \\"Infinite News\\" – a parody on news broadcast in which most of the reported stories happened to some or all of the cast members. Those stories revolve around their personal life and tend to balance between facts and the comedic side of them. * \\"Infinite Company\\" – an unscripted skit that parodied on the lives of office employees, similar to The Office. Initially, the skit was a reproduction of the late comedian Kim Hyung- gon work, called President, President, Our President, portraying a situational comedy around a board of directors of a company before it was changed to be about a group of employees in a small department. * \\"Ha & Su\\" – an unscripted situational comedy around the petty quarrels between Jeong Jun-ha and Park Myeong-su, where the latter is aggressive and hot-tempered while the former is timid and simple-minded. In 2011, they were awarded a \\"Best Couple\\" award for their performance. * \\"Jimotmi\\" – it stands for 지켜주지 못해서 미안해 (jikyeojuji motaeseo mianhae), which means \\"Sorry I could not look out for you\\" In this segment, the members play hidden-camera pranks on each other to see how they react to certain contrived situations. * \\"Introducing My Ugly Friends Festival\\" – A segment where the members invited their acquaintances which they considered visually unappealing. Afterwards, the members organize a party where they celebrate with various games. * \\"Saturday, Saturday's, I Am A Singer\\" – Suggested by Park Myeoung-Su and Jeong Jun-ha where the program arranges a stage where old artists were given chances to return and perform their hit songs. Sechs Kies and H.O.T. were able to reunite and came out of retirement through this segment. * \\"Please, be...\\" – a segment which was introduced to instill common principles to all of the members. '\\"Please, come early\\"' forces the members to be punctual during filming day as the staff will not inform them when they would filmed the segment. '\\"Please, be friendly\\"', featuring Haha and Jeong Hyeong-don, were created to encourage both members to be more comfortable around each other. * \\"Ah-Ha\\" – a Korean word game in which one member says a word, and the next person must then say that word backwards. Members who failed or made mistakes would be hit over the head. This segment premiered in the 2nd season (Infinite Challenge – The Master of Quiz) and was played occasionally in following seasons. * \\"One-flash Telepathy\\" – after hearing a word which was given from the production booth, each member presented a gesture that would best represent that word. A round is cleared if all six members perform the same gesture and punishments were given when they failed. The original alleged purpose of this segment was to unite the minds of the members; however, they have yet to succeed. Voice narration for this segment was provided by Na Gyeong-eun, an announcer and Yoo Jae-suk's wife. * Television Advertisements – throughout the episodes, the hosts create some satirical Korean television advertisements. * Calendar-making Project – the members created a series of unique calendars and donated all profits from these sales to charity. This project has succeeded every seasons. National events Some of the segments of Infinite Challenge also grew and become a national event where it also actively involved the audiences as well. * 2008 Host-in-Chief Elections – after a humorous request by Park Myeong-su to have a new leader in 2008, all Infinite Challenge members and staff held a vote for a new 'host-in-chief' on December 31, 2007, at the nation's own natural gas field near Ulsan. Prior to the election, each member created campaign pledges to encourage voters to vote for them. All entertainment managers, coordinators, MBC staff and the members voted at the South gate of the MBC Headquarters and the votes were counted on the morning of New Year's Day. Afterwards, Park Myeong-su was declared the new host-in-chief, but evidence showed him of tempering the voting box. The new host-in-chief was given 3 weeks to prove his leadership skills. However, after poor performances for 3 whole weeks, Park Myeong-su announced at an Infinite Challenge press conference that he would step down and wait for the new election to take place. In the aftermath, Yoo Jae-suk was appointed as interim host-in-chief on February 2, 2008. The second host-in-chief election was held on February 4, 2008 at the MBC Dream Center in Ilsan and Yoo Jae-suk won the majority of the votes and was once again reinstated as the host-in-chief. * WM7 – the \\"Wrestling Muhan 7\\" project is an attempt by the members to perform at a professional wrestling event. From July 2009, the members started training by inviting Sonstar, junior-professional wrestler and the drummer of Cherry Filter, as their coach and Park Myeong-su as their club leader. After numerous injuries, including a concussion suffered by Jeong Hyeong-don, setbacks and delays, the members finally put on a performance in front of a live audience on August 19, 2010 at Jangchung Gymnasium. It was broadcast over 11 episodes and MBC also released a DVD edition of this challenge, featuring several unaired segments, stories and the full uncut performance. * 2014 Decision – the show held another host-in-chief election in 2014 where the show elected a host-in-chief with 10 years tenure. A nationwide election was held, which also promoted the citizen's participation on South Korea's 2014 local elections. Similarly, the members created campaign pledges to attract viewers to vote for them in the preliminary internet polls. The second internet poll was held after the special's first episode was aired. In the aftermath of the second poll, Haha and Jeong Jun-ha decided to support Jeong Hyeong-don while Park Myeong-su forfeited to support Yoo Jae-suk. About 50,000 people, including the members of Infinite Challenge, cast their votes on May 22, 2014 on the polling stations at ten major cities on South Korea (Seoul, Incheon, Daejeon, Daegu, Ulsan, Gwangju, Busan, Jeju, Chuncheon, and Jeonju). Another 34,000 people cast their votes earlier on the preliminary voting on May 17–18, 2014. Internet voting also held at the same time of actual poll for the people who were not able to cast their votes on the polling stations and 363,047 people participated on it. Combining the live polls and the internet votes, Yoo Jae- suk won the election by defeating Noh Hong-chul with 45,310 marginal votes or 8.29% of the combined votes. * Infinite Challenge Song Festival – started in 2007, the members randomly collaborate with real musicians in order to compete for the \\"Infinite Challenge Song Festival\\" that is held every two years.

With the success of the program, other broadcasters have also produced real variety programs. The advantage of Real Variety was to ensure that even a popular celebrity who had been recognized as a special person was no different from an ordinary person. Season 1 The title of Season 1 was Rash Challenge (무모한 도전). Led by Yoo Jae-suk, six or more Korean entertainers (with Noh Hong-chul and Jeong Hyeong-don as a regular members) tried to complete a 'sporting' mission in an outdoor studio, which was based on a viewer's suggestion submitted through the show's homepage. Some of the absurd challenges included racing in a foot-powered swan-shaped paddle boat against a motor boat, playing a tennis match against Maria Sharapova, appearing live on stage at a public fashion show, and playing football against Thierry Henry. A large part of the humor comes from the fact that the cast is generally not well-suited to the challenges they attempt. This program can be compared to the filmed-in-studio Wetten, dass..? of Germany, as the program mainly focuses on the process and progress of the challenges, rather than focusing on the accomplishment of a mission.Showmanship, demolished the wall (Korean), The Hankyoreh, Retrieved on June 8, 2007. This format lasted only from April 23, 2005 to October 22, 2005. Despite having a strong following, its average ratings were very low (roughly 5 percent). Due to its sports- related theme, reruns of Season 1 and sports-related episodes of Season 4 (i.e. WM7) episodes are frequently aired on MBC Sportsplus, MBC's satellite and cable network for sports-casting. Season 2 and 3 From October 29, 2005 to April 30, 2006, Season 2 was titled Excessive Challenge (무리한 도전). For the first few episodes, the program was fairly similar to the first season. However, because the cast members wanted to redefine their characters, they decided to change the whole program concept, calling it Infinite Challenge - Master of Quiz in the third season. Since then, six hosts (with Yoo Jae-suk as 'host-in-chief') played a Korean-letter game called 'Ah-ha' (see below); competed in their knowledge and mental power; participated in on-line popularity polls about specific themes; and explored other comic features.Korean True-face, Infinite Challenge (Korean), Hankyoreh 21, Retrieved on October 31, 2006 Although the average ratings were low, the unity and dynamics of the members significantly improved. A panelist from Season 1, Park Myeong-su, came back as a co-host, and Haha and Jeong Jun-ha also became co-hosts of the program. Season 4 On May 6, 2006, the fourth and final season (format) of the program that now simply known as Infinite Challenge (무한도전), went on air. Special coverage of 2006 World Cup Germany was featured for the entire month of June 2006, along with some 'Ah-ha' specials (with Shinhwa, for example) at the beginning of each episode. However, on July 8, 2006, the program took its memorable first step as the first 'Real-Variety' television program in Korean television history, with the airing of a segment called 'Please, come early': The six members were asked to come to the recording session on time or experience some form of punishment (일찍 와주길 바래, a part of the 'Please, be...' series see below), combining elements of both Reality TV and Variety programming, including comic characters from each of the Infinite Challenge members, see 'hosts'). Thereafter, the program has created challenges with regard to anything related to real life (excluding some critical issues such as religions and sexual preferences), in outdoor studios, with little use of acting or heavily based plotting. Since December 2, 2006, the program has received the highest ratings of prime-time lineups for Saturday evening.The rating of Infinite Challenge renewed again to its highest mark (Korean), Starnews, Retrieved on November 26, 2006 In January 2012, the program took a 6-month hiatus due to a labor strike conducted by MBC's reporters and producers. During this period, new episodes were not produced and MBC, instead, aired reruns of previous episodes. In November 2015, Infinite Challenge arranged special exhibition and expo titled \\"Infinite Challenge Expo\\", in KINTEX. The program took a 7-week hiatus from broadcast in early 2017, which Kim Tae-ho, the main PD, signified as a period to normalize the production process which has been shortened considerably where the production team had less time and always rushed to meet the deadline. The PD also reveals that the program still continues their regular shooting schedules while being off the air. The program took another 10-week hiatus from September 9, 2017, due to a labor strike by MBC's reporters and producers. During the strike, new episodes were not aired and reruns of previous episodes were broadcast. The strike ended on November 13, and Infinite Challenge returned to regular broadcasting on November 25. In March 2018, the program came to an end marked by the departure of Kim Tae-ho, the lead producer, which was followed by the members. However, after the last episode was aired, the program returned for 3 more weeks where it aired recap specials that pays tribute to the achievements of the program called \\"13 Years of Saturdays\\".

Oct. 2005 - March 2018   Park has continuously proclaimed his nickname (Geo- seong, or Giant Star). He is often referred to as \\"Father\\" by the rest of the members due to his elderly look and his position as the oldest member of the program. This is especially prevalent when Myeong-su's receding hair is flattened or his make-up is removed. See his page for more details. His (on- air) persona is that of a veteran grumpy \\"upperclassman\\" of the other members. He often shouts or reprimands his \\"underclassmen,\\" usually about humorously trivial matters. Thanks to his current work as the co-host of Infinite Challenge, Park Myeong-su gained more than 250 nicknames throughout his appearances on the program as listed by the netizens. -  Jeong Jun-ha (정준하)  March 2006 - March 2018   His character is mainly defined by 3 things: his size (often referred to as being 0.1 tons, or 100 kilograms), appetite, and a degree of slowness in judgment. His extraordinarily large head (supposedly 8 kg) has gotten him, on a few occasions, called \\"Chivas Degal\\" (Degal = is a shortened word for \\"Degari\\", a vernacular word for \\"head\\"). In the 50th episode special of season 3, he was challenged to eat 50 plates of noodles in five minutes. The plates altogether weighed about 10–30 kg. (He succeeded, but had to go straight to the lavatory and subsequently slept in the back of the studio). On episode 61 of season 3, he went to a hair salon with Hong-chul to curl Hong-chul's hair. He asked a woman who was working there if she knew Jun-ha's name, but she said Joong-ang by mistake. Since that time, the members, including the creator Yoo Jae-suk, have frequently teased him as Mr. Jeong Joong-ang (정중앙씨), which means 'Mr. Square-in-the-middle'. -  Haha (하하) (Ha Dong-hoon, 하동훈)  December 2005 - March 2008 March 2010 - March 2018   Haha is long considered the cutest and best- looking member of the cast. He is also the most-educated member, having obtained a Master of Arts in Theatre & Film at Daejin University; however, during the episode of the 50th special, he only got 20 points on a 100-point elementary-level spelling test. In episode 62 of season 3, he sang a song called 'A Little Boy's Story' (키작은 꼬마 이야기) as a tribute to his short height, which is a constant target of ridicule among the cast. It was a huge sensation with viewers. Haha temporarily left the show from March 2008 through March 2010 in order to fulfill his mandatory military service. In his final episode before entering the service, Haha performed at a guerrilla concert that was secretly organized by his fellow co-hosts. - Hwang Kwanghee (황광희) April 2015 - March 2017 Kwanghee Hwang Kwanghee was the youngest member among the cast of Infinite Challenge while he was on the show. A member of ZE:A idol group, Hwang Kwanghee joined the Infinite Challenge cast in April 2015. He was selected through the Sixth Man project which was held in order to fill the empty position after Noh Hong-chul left the program following a drunk driving incident. Kwanghee left the program in March 2017 in order to fulfill his military duty. -  Jun Jin (전진) (Park Chung-Jae, 박충재)  July 2008 - November 2009   In June 2008, Shinhwa member Jun Jin appeared on the show to replace Haha. Jin showed his extraordinary physical talent and was a target for all the other members of Infinite Challenge, who envied his looks and abilities during many challenges. -  Gil (길) (Gil Seong-joon, 길성준)  April 2009 - April 2014   Gil made his first appearance on an episode which featured Korean figure skater Kim Yuna in April 2009, ostensibly substituting for Jeong Jun-ha, who had to leave the episode recording early. He remained a de facto member of Infinite Challenge until he became a full member later that year. During the Boxing episodes in January 2010, Gil showed off his 9-year-long training in the sport. Gil is often called the Unfunny Friend due to his inability to ad-lib as quickly as the other co-hosts. On April 23, 2014, Gil was caught by the police due to drunk- driving. Fans of the variety show have been flooding the board with requests for Gil to leave the show for his inappropriate actions. Eventually, the MBC executives announced his leave on the same day. -  Noh Hong-chul (노홍철)  April 2005 - November 2014   '돌+아이/Dol+I' was created by Yoo Jae-suk during episode 22 of season 3. Quickmouth was his original character, due to his ability to speak very rapidly. 돌+아이 (when written without the plus sign) is a Korean curse word meaning psychopath, or an extremely crazy person. Since this is a show watched by families, the staff humorously put a plus (+) sign in the middle to separate the word so its literal meaning becomes 'Stone+Kid' when in actuality it means 'psycho'. On-screen graphics often depict this nickname by displaying a large capital 'I' that looks to be made of stone ('아이' is pronounced like the letter 'I'). Similarly to former member Gil, Noh Hong-chul was caught driving under influence of alcohol on November 7, 2014. Following the incident, Noh Hong-chul released an official apology to the public through MBC. On the afternoon of November 8, MBC announced that Noh Hong-chul would be leaving the show and Infinite Challenge would continue on with the five remaining cast members. -  Jeong Hyeong-don (정형돈)  April 2005 - November 2015   A comedian by profession before joining the team, Jeong Hyeong-don used to appear in the Korean comedy show Gag Concert (where Do-Re-Mi Trio being one of his many skits). However, over many episodes, he has demonstrated remarkable talent in everything imaginable (for example, catching grapes with his mouth or playing a Korean jump-rope game) except being funny. He is teased by the other members for this. His character is also defined by the ability to make anyone around him feel awkward (as seen in the earlier episode) In November 2015, Jung Hyeong-don had suspended all broadcasting activities due to health reasons. On July 29, 2016, Jeong Hyeong- don's label, FNC Entertainment, officially announced that Jeong Hyeong-don would permanently leave the show after a nine-month hiatus from the broadcast due to poor health condition. -  Yang Se-Hyung } Occasional appearances * There are a number of people who both individually work for this program and irregularly appear with Infinite Challenge members (hosts). They are frequently referred to as 'the 8th member' (제8의 멤버). {  - ! style=\\"width:12%;\\" Name ! style=\\"width:15%;\\" Nickname ! style=\\"width:23%;\\" Occupation ! style=\\"width:50%;\\" Character Description and Notes -  Defconn (데프콘)   Singer Long-time buddy of Jeong Hyeong-don  Since MuDo's 'Rowing challenge' during the Spring-Summer season of 2011, he is the frequent pinch-hitter of this programme, while one or more cast members in absence. Together with Jung Hyung-don, he formed a hip-hop duo \\"Hyeongdon and Daejoon\\" (형돈이와 대준이). Defconn was the cast member of KBS2 Sunday variety show, 2 Days & 1 Night. -  Jeong Seok-kwon (정석권)   Long-time buddy & Entertainment Manager of Park Myeong-su  While serving as a manager, Jeong Sil-jang had aspirations to be a comedian in his own right. Whenever he was given a chance to appear on-screen, he was often ridiculed by other cast members for attempting to constantly outperform others and for overacting in order to gain attention. As such, many of his parts were usually edited out of the final broadcast. To restrain his growing popularity, Park Myeong-su often teasingly ordered that his manager not appear on the show again. -  Choi Jong-hun (최종훈)   Entertainment Manager of Jeong Jun-ha  As Jeong Jun-ha's coordinator, Choi also hoped to become a rising star as a professional actor his common hope of rising stardom (as a professional actor), with a lot of help from Jeong Jun-ha himself.Choi Jong-hoon; \\"My common dream is to become an actor\\", Starnews, Retrieved on July 16, 2007 He prepared a bunch of radishes for the members on 'Kimchi Preparation' (S03E30) and 'Jun(Semi-) Hines Ward'(S03E77) episodes well, and he presented his professional agricultural skills on the episodes 'MD Goes to country' (S03E25) and 'Rice- planting' (S03E56). -  Kim Oak-jeong (김옥정)   Mother of Haha  As has been regularly reported by the hosts, Kim has minimal cooking skills and is often humorously featured on the show to feed the cast members. She appeared for the first time in episode 83 of the third season; her closing comment of 'Hit that jackpot!' (Dae-bak Teo-ji-se- yo! 대박 터지세요) became an enormously popular new-year greeting. -  TEO Kim Tae-ho (김태호)   Executive Producer of Infinite Challenge  A pioneer of Korean entertainment, Kim Tae-ho produces and directs the show. Besides helping to create the unique Real-Variety format, Kim also innovated Korean television by adding unique captions to the show. Although captions are commonplace on Korean variety shows, Kim's captions went beyond simple descriptions or commentary, adding information on cast members' emotions and expressing reactions to the show, giving the captions an interactive feel that aligned with the viewing audience's thoughts. With high sensitivity for fashion, he gained extraordinary popularity when he officially opened his 'Cyworld' webpage. Although his presence is mostly felt through his captioning and occasional off-screen soundbites, he appeared as a witness of the Moot court challenge, which aired on February 20, 2010. -  Kim Tae-hee (김태희)   Writer of Infinite Challenge  As a high-profiled co-writer of Infinite Challenge and a Korean actress-namesake, she enjoys her huge popularity from dedicated viewers. During the 'Making a song for X-mas challenge'(S03E33) episode, she became very popular when Noh Hong-chul said that she 'has the posterior of (actress) Kim Tae-hee, but the front of Infinite Challenge.' -  Shin Mi-so (신미소)   Fashion Co-ordinator of Yoo Jae-suk  A Busan-native who helped assemble Yoo Jae-suk's wardrobe, Shin was also a popular 'guest' on the show. She debuted during a '100-minute Debate' (episode 42 of season 3), in which she was caught falling asleep in the audience. This incident made her name the top online keyword of March 2007. She was also featured when she accidentally broke a set of illuminators when Lee Young-ae appeared on Infinite Challenge (episode 52 of season 3). She eventually appeared as a co-host of 'Madness Couples' (episode 75 of season 3) with the Host-in-chief Yoo Jae-suk. She was known to be able to argue with all six members of the show, earning her the nickname 'Aegis ship.' - } Awards and nominations {  - ! Year !! Award !! Category !! Recipients !!

It was first awarded as part of the ESPY Awards in 2004 after the non-gender-specific Best Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award was presented the previous two years (with the American snowboarder Kelly Clark receiving the 2002 award). It is given to the female, irrespective of nationality or sport contested, adjudged to be the best action sports athlete in a given calendar year. Balloting for the award is undertaken by fans over the Internet from between three and five choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee, which is composed of a panel of experts. It is conferred in July to reflect performance and achievement over the preceding twelve months. The inaugural winner of the award was the American wakeboarder Dallas Friday. During 2003 and 2004, Friday won 12 of the available 14 professional women's titles, including national and world championships. She became the first wakeboarder to be nominated for, and hence to win, an ESPY Award. Athletes from the United States have won more times than any other nationality with seven (three times to snowboarder Jamie Anderson), followed by Australians with three, two of which went to the surfer Stephanie Gilmore. Snowboarders are most successful sportspeople (with eight awards), followed by surfers (four). It was not awarded in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2017 winner of the Best Female Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award was the Austrian snowboarder Anna Gasser.

Tramadol is demethylated by the liver enzyme CYP2D6 in the same way as codeine, and so similarly to the variation in effects seen with codeine, individuals who have a less active form of CYP2D6 (\\"poor metabolizers\\") will tend to get reduced analgesic effects from tramadol. This also results in a ceiling effect (dependent on CYP2D6 availability) which limits tramadol's range of therapeutic benefits to the treatment of moderate pain. Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics (+)-Desmetramadol is a G-protein biased μ-opioid receptor full agonist. It shows comparatively far lower affinity for the δ- and κ-opioid receptors. The two enantiomers of desmetramadol show quite distinct pharmacological profiles; both (+) and (−)-desmetramadol are inactive as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but (−)-desmetramadol retains activity as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and so the mix of both the parent compound and metabolites contributes significantly to the complex pharmacological profile of tramadol. While the multiple receptor targets can be beneficial in the treatment of pain (especially complex pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain), it increases the potential for drug interactions compared to other opioids, and may also contribute to side effects. Desmetramadol is also an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, via competitive inhibition. This suggests that the apparent anti-depressant properties of tramadol may be at least partially mediated by desmetramadol, thus prolonging the duration of therapeutic benefit. Inhibition of the 5-HT2C receptor is a suggested factor in the mechanism of anti-depressant effects of agomelatine and maprotiline. The potential selectivity and favorable side effect profile of desmetramadol compared to its prodrug, tramadol, makes it more suitable for clinical use, although no such large scale controlled trials have been conducted with patients. Upon inhibition of the receptor, downstream signaling causes dopamine and norepinephrine release, and the receptor is thought to significantly regulate mood, anxiety, feeding, and reproductive behavior. 5-HT2C receptors regulate dopamine release in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and amygdala, among others. Research indicates that some suicide victims have an abnormally high number of 5-HT2C receptors in the prefrontal cortex. There is some mixed evidence that agomelatine, a 5-HT2C antagonist, is an effective antidepressant. Antagonism of 5-HT2C receptors by agomelatine results in an increase of dopamine and norepinephrine activity in the frontal cortex. Pharmacokinetics Metabolites Desmetramadol is metabolized in the liver into the active metabolite N,O-didesmethyltramadol via CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. The inactive tramadol metabolite N-desmethyltramadol is metabolized into the active metabolite N,O-didesmethyltramadol by CYP2D6. History Development of tapentadol The opioid medication tapentadol was developed to mimic the actions of desmetramadol in order to create a weak-moderate analgesic which is not dependent on metabolic activation. Tapentadol, however, is generally considered to be a stronger analgesic than tramadol. This may be illusory due to the metabolism-dependent effects of tramadol. Society and culture Recreational use Desmetramadol has recently been marketed as a currently legal substitute for illegal opioid drugs, either in powder form or mixed into various other preparations. One such blend sold under the brand Krypton and containing powdered kratom leaf (Mitragyna speciosa) laced with desmetramadol was reportedly linked to at least 9 accidental deaths from overdose during 2010–2011. Legality United Kingdom Desmetramadol was made a Class A drug in the United Kingdom on 26 Feb 2013.

Together, they form a complete city traffic environment that also includes farms and factories. Majo-kits are made from plastic materials with a certain amount of detail. They were designed for children and should not be considered an accurate representation of anything in particular. The separate pieces snap together to form scale size towns and cities for Majorette or other similar size model vehicles. Children are introduced to rules of the road by laying out and obeying traffic signs, and learn to navigate streets with road issues, roundabouts and traffic lights. The Majo-kit buildings are actually too big for the Majorette vehicles but they needed to be a certain size to make them easy to assemble for smaller children. Many different kits with their own theme were made and all are compatible with each other. This allows children (it was mostly aimed at boys) to keep adding streets and structures. The kits were sold in Europe, Canada, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. All of the Majo-kit figures are men, and there are no women or children.

Through the 2001 iteration of the ESPY Awards, ceremonies were conducted in February of each year to honor achievements over the previous calendar year; awards presented thereafter are conferred in July and reflect performance from the June previous. The inaugural winner of the Best Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award was American snowboarder Kelly Clark at the 2002 edition. During 2001 and 2002, she won seven major worldwide snowboarding competitions, which included the gold medal in the women's halfpipe at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and first place at the Winter X Games. Clark became the first female snowboarder to be nominated for, and hence to win, an ESPY Award. Americans won both times the accolade was given out with fellow snowboarder Shaun White being voted the only male winner of the award at the 2003 ceremony. The Best Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award was by gender in 2004, since which year Best Female Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award and the Best Male Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award have been presented.

Before that he worked on a farm, for over a year, as a farmhand. Personal life In May 2007, Owens publicly came out as gay in an interview with Wales on Sunday. Reaction was mostly supportive. Owens said that coming out was a difficult decision, and that he had contemplated suicide when he was 26. > It's such a big taboo to be gay in my line of work, I had to think very hard > about it because I didn't want to jeopardise my career. Coming out was very > difficult and I tried to live with who I really was for years. I knew I was > 'different' from my late teens, but I was just living a lie. Shortly after the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Owens was named 'Gay Sports Personality of the Year' at gay rights group Stonewall's awards ceremony in London. He was a patron of the LGBT Centre of Excellence Wales, until its disbandment in late 2012, but he is still that of the Wooden Spoon Society rugby charity. In 2013 Owens became a patron of Bullies Out charity in Wales. Owens was subjected to racist and anti-gay abuse when refereeing England and New Zealand in November 2014.

The speech Alternate version of Abraham Lincoln's Farewell Address, published by The American News Company On February 11, 1861, several thousand citizens of Springfield, Illinois gathered to see Lincoln depart for his inauguration in Washington, D.C. In response, he gave this brief, impromptu speech from his railroad car: > My friends, no one, not in my situation, can appreciate my feeling of > sadness at this parting. To this place and the kindness of these people, I > owe everything. Here I have lived a quarter of a century, and have passed > from a young to an old man. Here my children have been born, and one is > buried. I now leave, not knowing when, or whether ever, I may return, with a > task before me greater than that which rested upon Washington. Without the > assistance of that Divine Being who ever attended him, I cannot succeed. > With that assistance I cannot fail. Trusting in Him who can go with me, and > remain with you, and be everywhere for good, let us confidently hope that > all will yet be well. To His care commending you, as I hope in your prayers > you will commend me, I bid you an affectionate farewell. The speech moved members of his entourage so much that after the train started, he was asked to put his words into writing. Because of the difficulty of doing so on a moving train, Lincoln asked his personal secretary, John Nicolay, to finish copying it down after a few sentences. A second version of the speech was published in a Springfield newspaper a few days later.

The work lasts approximately 70 minutes and is a setting of the Latin text from the Gospel of John, chapters 18 and 19, plus a brief introduction and conclusion. History When Pärt left Estonia for Austria in 1980,New York City Ballet program notes, Playbill, January 2008. he took with him the first sketches for the St. John Passion, which would become the culmination of the tintinnabuli style. He eventually finished the work in 1982 and it was published in 1989. Since then, it has been recorded three times, and remains one of his most popular works. In much the same way that Pärt was inspired by medieval music in his creation of tintinnabuli, here too he is inspired by the earliest monophonic settings of the Passion. The St. John Passion is a through-composed setting of the text of John 18–19, preceded by a short introduction (Exordio) and followed by a brief conclusion (Conclusio). He uses a baritone soloist for Jesus, a tenor for Pilate, and a Soprano-Alto-Tenor-Bass (SATB) quartet for the evangelist. In addition, there are four solo instruments, oboe, violin, cello and bassoon, organ and SATB choir. The work lasts about 70 minutes and is not broken into movements. Structure In composing the work, text setting and declamation were foremost in Pärt's mind: all of the musical elements in the piece, from rhythm to pitch, are in some way determined by the text. Tonally, the work centers on a series of overlapping fifths: D-A-E-B. The rhythmic values are established by the text. Each character has a basic note value, and this is lengthened depending on the punctuation and its position within the phrase. Since a period at the end of a sentence generates a note longer than does a comma in the middle of it, the hierarchy of the textual phrases is reflected in the music. Value assignment:Hillier 1997, p. 127 # In the last word of a phrase ending with a comma, the stressed syllable would be medium. # In the last word of a phrase ending with a colon or period, each syllable would be long. # In the first word of a new sentence (or phrase beginning after a colon), the stressed syllable would be medium. # In the last word in a phrase ending with a question mark, each syllable would be medium. # Otherwise all syllables are short. Pärt divides the Evangelist text into four sections (50 phrases each), plus a final concluding section of 10 phrases, for a total of 210. Each section begins with a different solo voice, an instrument then joins it, and this pattern continues until all 8 are sounding. The alto and bass voices and oboe and bassoon are always M-voices (Hillier's coinage, referring to the melody voice in a tintinnabuli configuration); the soprano and tenor voices and violin and cello are always T-voices (again, Hillier's coinage referring to the harmonizing voice). In the case where a T-voice is presented alone, the M-voice is simply implied. Christ always has the longest and lowest notes, creating a stark contrast with the other characters. The pitch center for Christ is E, and it is accompanied by a drone and T-voice in the organ. For the turba, the pitch center is again E. The alto and bass voices, again always playing an M role, are mirrored, and the soprano and tenor T-voices alternate above and below the M-voices. While both are centered on E, the M-voices use E Phrygian against E major in the T-voices; this makes for striking cross-relations between G-natural and G-sharp, though the two never sound at the same time. Pilate, like Christ, is accompanied only by the organ, but sings in faster rhythmic values and has a higher tessitura. Pilate's part is the most unstable in the piece, created in part through the use of an M-voice centered on B and a T-voice centered on F (a tritone apart) and through the refusal of Pilate to be either a T-voice or M-voice, always alternating between these two roles.

Pacific Edge Voices (formerly The Pacific Mozart Ensemble (PME)) is a volunteer choral organization based in Berkeley, CA. The group was formed to provide a chorus of professional quality for highly skilled and experienced singers who did not wish to make singing a full-time profession. It was to be large enough to perform the major concert literature, but small enough to remain highly selective. PEV presents a wide range of choral musical styles, including, but not limited to, traditional choral literature, new works by contemporary composers and a cappella jazz and pop. PEV performs at least three self- produced concerts sets each year, along with various collaborations, often with prominent artists including Dave Brubeck, Meredith Monk, Kent Nagano & Sufjan Stevens. The first and second concerts of the year (typically Nov and March) are classically oriented programs. Over the years these programs have tended toward 20th-century composers. The chorus has become known around the San Francisco Bay Area for its innovative programming. A particular highlight came in 2002 when the chorus performed Kurt Weill’s Der Lindberghflug alongside works by Philip Glass, Meredith Monk and David Lang. The concert was presented in the East Bay on the aircraft carrier Hornet and in San Francisco in the newly constructed Aviation Museum at SFO. The 3rd concert set each year is an all a cappella ‘pops’ concert featuring the group in various formations from 2 up to 50, performing arrangements of jazz, pop, rock, & folk tunes.  Origins  Pacific Edge Voices was formed, as Pacific Mozart Ensemble, in 1980 by members of Berkeley Chorus Pro Musica. The core group of singers had a history of singing together in the SF Bach Choir and the Presidio Protestant Post Chapel Choir. The decision to strike out on their own came when one of the members was informed that since he joined Pro Musica, there was “too much jocularity in the bass section.” Shortly thereafter they reemerged as The Pacific Mozart Ensemble, rehearsing in the then new Julia Morgan Theater (alternate names for the group included the Morgan Tabernacle Choir). First Performance: Sunday, June 28, 1980, 5 P.M.--- Julia Morgan Centre for the Performing Arts, College Avenue, Berkeley, suggested donation $3.50. Bach Cantata #106, \\"Gottes Zeit ist der allerbeste Zeit\\"; Songs by John Dowland; Mozart \\"Vesperae Solennes de Confessore\\" K.339---  Collaborations  PME had a long history with the Berkeley Symphony and Kent Nagano. In 2005 Nagano recruited PME to open the Symphony's season with the Lygeti’s a cappella work Lux Aeterna. Other Berkeley symphony collaborations include Beethoven’s Christus am Ölberge, Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms and Oedipus Rex, San Francisco composer David Sheinfeld's The Earth Is a Sounding Board, Busoni's Doktor Faustus, Olivier Messiaen's St. François d'Asisse, Beethoven's 9th Symphony, and Berlioz’s Romeo and Juliet. In 2006 members of PME performed the world premier of Kurt Rohde’s oratorio, Bitter Harvest. In 2003 PME performed the Bernstein Mass with the Deutsche Symphonie-Orchester under the direction of Kent Nagano at the Berlin Philharmonie. In 2005, the Harmonia Mundi recording of the concert was nominated for a Grammy. In the 1990s, PME collaborated with Dave Brubeck on performances of his oratorios, including “Gates of Justice.\\" In 2006 the relationship was renewed when PME commissioned Brubeck to fill in one of the missing movements of Mozart's Mass in C Minor for their 25th anniversary concert. They collaborated on numerous occasions with Meredith Monk, most recently traveling to New York in 2005 to participate in the 40th Anniversary Concert in Carnegie Hall as well as a performance at the World Financial Center Winter Garden, broadcast on WNYC. In the fall of 2006, members of PME performed with Sufjan Stevens at Zellerbach Hall and John Zorn at Hertz Hall in Berkeley, CA.

(2005) The Human Predator: A Historical Chronicle of Serial Murder and Forensic Investigation, Berkley Books, p. 220. They were suspected in the disappearances of 18 women in Illinois in 1981 and 1982.  Murders  The first victim of the gang was 28-year-old Linda Sutton, who was abducted on May 23, 1981. Ten days later, her body was found in a field in Villa Park, Illinois. Her body had been mutilated and her left breast amputated. It was almost a year before the gang struck again. On May 15, 1982, they abducted Lorraine Borowski, just as she was about to open the realtor's office where she worked. Her body was discovered five months later, in a cemetery in Clarendon Hills. On May 29, they abducted Shui Mak from Hanover Park, a village northwest of Villa Park. Her body was not found for four months. Two weeks after they abducted Mak, they picked up Angel York in their van, handcuffed her and slashed her breast before throwing her out of the van, still alive. York's description of her attackers failed to produce any leads. The gang did not strike again for two months. On August 28, 1982, the body of Sandra Delaware was discovered on the bank of the Chicago River. She had been stabbed, strangled, and her left breast was amputated. On September 8, 31-year-old Rose Davis was found in an alley, having suffered almost identical injuries as Delaware. A month later, the gang committed their last crime. Their victim, Beverley Washington, was found by a railroad track on December 6. In addition to other injuries, her left breast had been amputated and her right breast was severely slashed. She survived the attack, and was able to give descriptions of her attackers and the van they had used to abduct her. The men were suspects in the disappearance of Carole Pappas, wife of Chicago Cubs pitcher, Milt Pappas. She disappeared on September 11, 1982. Her body was recovered five years later, and the death was ruled an accident. Arrest and convictions When Gecht was first arrested, he had to be released because the police had little evidence connecting him to the crimes. After further investigation, though, the police discovered that in 1981, he had rented a room in a motel along with three friends – each with adjoining rooms. The hotel manager said that they had held loud parties and appeared to be involved in some kind of cult. Police then tracked down the other men, Edward Spreitzer and the Kokoraleis brothers. When interrogated, Thomas Kokoraleis confessed that he and the others had taken women back to Gecht's place – what Gecht called a \\"satanic chapel.\\" There they had raped and tortured the women, and amputated their breasts with a wire garrotte. Kokoraleis went on to say that they would eat parts of the severed breasts as kind of a sacrament, and that Gecht would masturbate into the breasts before putting them in a box. Kokoraleis claimed that he once saw 15 breasts in the box. The Kokoraleis brothers and Spreitzer confessed to their crimes, but Gecht protested his innocence. After a series of trials, Thomas Kokoraleis was convicted of murder but only sentenced to life imprisonment as his reward for his initial confession. Since then his life sentence has been commuted and he was scheduled to be released on September 30, 2017, but his parole was denied by Illinois officials. He was released on parole the morning of March 29, 2019. Gecht is serving 120 years in the Menard Correctional Center for the attempted murder and rape of Beverly Washington and will be eligible for parole in 2042. Andrew Kokoraleis was sentenced to death and was executed by lethal injection on March 17, 1999. Edward Spreitzer was sentenced to death but the sentence was commuted in George H. Ryan's last-minute commutation of all death sentences in Illinois in 2003. Incidentally, Andrew Kokoraleis' was Governor Ryan's only execution, just over two months into his administration. Kokoraleis was also the last inmate executed in Illinois, almost 12 years before Governor Pat Quinn signed legislation to abolish the death penalty on March 9, 2011, and commuted 15 death sentences to life imprisonment without parole. The Kokoraleis brothers were raised Greek Orthodox. The Orthodox Church attempted unsuccessfully to keep Andrew Kokoraleis from being executed. Demetrios Kantzavelos, at that time a chancellor (later a bishop) of the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Chicago, became an anti-death-penalty activist as a result of the execution, and helped lobby in favor of ending the death penalty in the state. Thomas Kokoraleis was released from prison in March 2019 after serving half of his 70-year sentence. As of June 30, 2019, Kokoraleis lives at Wayside Cross Ministries at 215 E. New York St. in Aurora, Illinois.

As a regional Community Center it sponsors cultural, educational, civic, wellness and spiritual activities. On June 12, 1796, twenty of Philadelphia's intellectual leaders formed the First Unitarian Society of Philadelphia, becoming the first continuously functioning church in the country to name itself \\"Unitarian\\". The founders were directed and encouraged by the Unitarian minister Joseph Priestley, and its first settled minister was the Rev. Dr. William Henry Furness. William Henry Furness The small but growing congregation was lay-led until 1825, when Rev. Dr. William Henry Furness was persuaded to serve as the first minister at the age of 22. Starting in the 1830s, Furness became one of the few abolitionist ministers in the city, known for his anti-slave sermons and Underground Railroad activities. His speeches were so impassioned that both he and the congregation feared reprisals from Southern sympathizers, so several members of the church quietly armed themselves and watched over the pulpit on Sundays. His attacks on the Fugitive Slave Law drew discussion in one of President Buchanan's cabinet meetings of indicting the minister for treason.\\"John Brown's Philadelphia\\" prepared by V. Chapman-Smith, National Archives at Philadelphia Furness served as minister for 50 years, and remained involved in the church until his death in 1898. Architecture First building (1813–1828) The Octagon Building (begun March 1812, dedicated February 14, 1813): The first church building, located at the northeast corner of 10th & Locust, was designed by Robert Mills, thought to be the first architect born and trained in the United States. Its octagonal shape was unusual for Philadelphia, however it followed the pattern of Unitarian churches in England such as the Octagon Chapel, Norwich (1756, Thomas Ivory) and Octagon Chapel, Liverpool (1763). These typically used an octagonal design in a symbolic move away from the traditional cross-shaped floor plans of orthodox Christian churches. The construction cost was approximately $25,000 and the finished church seated 300 people. Second building (1828–1885) Second building Desiring a larger and more elegant edifice to reflect the growth of the congregation, church members voted to construct a second building. Using the same location (10th & Locust), the cornerstone of the \\"Doric Building\\" was laid on March 24, 1828. Greek Revival architecture was then very popular. Designed by William Strickland, this building was described in contemporary books as one of the most outstanding churches in the city. Dedicated on November 5, 1828, this remained the congregation's worship space until moving to the present site at 2125 Chestnut Street in 1885. Third building (1885–present) Frank Furness, the architect of The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and son of the Church's first minister, designed the current church building. Begun in 1883, and dedicated in 1885, it was completed in 1886. The tall pyramidal tower/porte cochere at the church's southeast corner was removed in the early 20th century. The sanctuary features a hammer-beam ceiling, painted rust red and stenciled with gold-leaf daffodils, which is complemented by blue walls. The church's stained glass windows are by Louis Tiffany & Co. and John La Farge. Later additions include a concert-grade Casavant pipe organ with 3 manuals and 50 ranks. In addition to the sanctuary, the building also contains a basement level housing Griffin Hall, which includes a stage and commercial-size kitchen. The rear portion of the building contains the Parish Room for meetings, and a smaller chapel. The mezzanine and 3rd floors contain a variety of offices, meeting rooms, storage, and daycare facilities. Notable members Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, the first woman of African descent to have her writings published in the United States, was a member of First Church from 1870 until her death in 1911. She is best known for her fiction and poetry, but was also a political activist and lecturer who promoted, civil rights, temperance, and women's rights. Laura Matilda Towne, was one of the first Northern women to go south to work with freed slaves. Towne opened the Penn School, the first school for freedmen, while the Civil War was raging. Unlike most of those who went south at the time, Laura Towne made a life for herself on St. Helena Island, South Carolina, and ran the Penn School until her death in 1901.

The day after John Brown was executed, his body came to Philadelphia for a private vigil attended by William Henry Furness, then was taken to North Elba, New York, and buried. National Archivist, V. Chapman-Smith writes, \\"A supporter of John Brown, who reached out to provide comfort and aid to Brown's wife, Furness was a prominent speaker at the Philadelphia \\"Martyr Day\\" (December 2, 1859) vigil at National Hall. Furness' zeal against the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law captured attention at one of President Buchanan's cabinet meetings, where consideration was given to indicting Furness for treason!\\" When Martin Luther King Jr. was a seminary student in nearby Chester, Pennsylvania, he attended a lecture about how Mohandas K. Gandhi integrated Henry David Thoreau's theory of non-violent civil disobedience that inspired King's non-violent protests for civil rights. This lecture is reputed to have taken place at the First Unitarian Church in Philadelphia.\\"Our Legacy,\\" archives of the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia In April 2006, the church officially became a \\"Welcoming Congregation\\" to the bisexual, transgender, lesbian, and gay community. In 2007, Nathan C. Walker became its first openly gay minister. In July 2010, executives from Monsanto visited the church to discuss the adoption of a code of ethics for the field of biotechnology, a sort of Hippocratic oath, akin to a doctor's pledge to \\"do no harm\\".\\"Dinner with Monsanto\\" by Michelle Bates Deakin, \\"Dinner with Monsanto,\\" UU World 34:4 (Winter 2010) Nathan C.

First Unitarian is home to a concert-grade Casavant pipe organ. With its convenient Center City location, First Church is known as a prime entertainment venue for all ages. Music-for-Children classes, classical music concerts by Dolce Suono, and for young indie rock fans, alternative and punk rock concerts. Music and Arts at First Philadelphia are among the strongest and most diverse of the Center City Philadelphia Churches. In November 2007, Rolling Stone magazine featured the church as one of the top alternative rock venues thanks to the success of the events organized by R5 Productions in the basement, chapel, and sanctuary. Since the mid-90s, the church's basement, Griffin Hall, known colloquially as \\"The Church\\" or simply \\"First Unitarian\\" by show goers, has been a popular venue for small-scale independent music concerts in the city. The concerts have featured mostly punk and indie rock artists in the past but have expanded to include other genres as well. Children and daycare centers First Church is the longtime home of two daycare centers: the Beacon Center and Little Miracles. Both centers boast long-tenured staff. Members of First Church founded the Beacon Center in the early 1980s to exemplify the values of the church. First Unitarian also draws parents of young children and youth with religious education programs that promote value-based learning about one's responsibility to one another and to the Earth. The Neighboring Faiths program teaches teens about the importance of other religious traditions and thereby promotes open-mindedness and respect. Child dedications, conducted with a thornless rose, are a special rite of passage for Unitarian Universalist families.

In 1894, her mother married Edward O'Connor, a Roman Catholic Irish commercial traveller, and she was raised as Mary O'Connor. She was the eldest of four sisters (she also had an elder stepsister, Isabel Peacock, who later appeared in American films as Isabel Daintry). She was educated at St. Monica's in Skipton, Yorkshire, and at the Convent of the Sacred Heart School in Roehampton. She adopted the professional name Mary Murillo after being compared in looks to a Murillo painting of the Madonna. Career In 1908, she traveled to America with her stepsister to start a stage career, and in February 1909, she made her debut in the chorus of the Broadway musical comedy Havana. She toured the United States, finding only small parts until 1913, when she started sending scenarios to film companies. Her first script to be accepted was bought by the husband-and-wife team of Phillips Smalley and Lois Weber. Other commissions followed, and the first film known to be credited to her is 1914's A Strand of Blond Hair, a Vitagraph comedy short starring John Bunny and Flora Finch.Profile of Mary Murillo at womenandsilentbritishcinema.wordpress.com She wrote five melodramas for Theda Bara during the 1910s popularity of vamp films.

Early life and military career Gonatas was born in Patras. He entered the Military Academy in 1892 and graduated in 1897. As a lieutenant, he participated in the Macedonian Struggle (1907–1909), and became aide-de-camp to Colonel Nikolaos Zorbas immediately following the 1909 Goudi Revolt. He also participated in the 1912-13 Balkan Wars and in the Allied Expedition to the Ukraine in 1919. Subsequently, he took part in the Asia Minor Campaign with the rank of colonel, first as a staff officer and later as divisional commander. The September 1922 Revolt Gonatas with Plastiras and Georgios Papandreou in Ano Mousounitsa, October 1922 In August 1922, the Greek Army suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of the Turks, which forced it to evacuate Anatolia in great haste. In Greece, this disaster led to a political crisis, and military revolts broke out in September amongst the evacuated troops in Thessaloniki, Chios and Lesbos, headed primarily by Venizelist officers. The army contingents in Lesbos formed a Revolutionary Committee headed by Colonel Gonatas, which dispatched by airplane the following demands to Athens: the dismissal of the government, the dissolution of Parliament, the holding of new elections, and the abdication of King Constantine in favour of the Diadoch, Prince George. The revolutionary movement swiftly spread to other centres of old and new Greece, aided by the Fleet, which had joined their cause. The cabinet immediately resigned, and on September 27 King Constantine abdicated for the second time in the course of his career, and the Diadoch succeeded to the throne of Greece as King George II. On September 28 the revolutionary troops, headed by their leaders, Colonels Nikolaos Plastiras and Gonatas, entered Athens amidst wild scenes of enthusiasm. The revolutionary committee which took charge selected Alexandros Zaimis as Prime Minister, but as he was out of the country, Sotirios Krokidas was appointed as interim Prime Minister. As prime minister Gonatas with Foreign Minister Apostolos Alexandris, March 1923 The first cabinet formed under the regime of the Revolutionary Committee (which had established itself as the real master of Greece with King George II merely as a figurehead) underwent several slight changes, the chief of which was caused by the refusal of Zaimis to retain the premiership (which remained vacant, with Sotirios Krokidas as acting premier), and after having been in power for less than two months resigned on November 24, chiefly owing to internal differences arising from the Trial of the Six (ex-ministers, statesmen, and military leaders tried by a revolutionary tribunal on the charges of high treason). The British government, through its minister in Athens, Lindley, urged that the accused should be treated leniently. While certain members of the cabinet were prepared to accept the British suggestion, the more irreconcilable elements refused to submit to what they considered as foreign intervention in Greek internal affairs, and the cabinet accordingly resigned. On November 27, 1922, a new cabinet, composed exclusively of members of the Revolutionary Committee and of the republican group which formed the committee's most active supporters, was appointed. Colonel Gonatas was appointed premier, and Konstantinos Rentis, one of the leaders of the republican group, as acting minister for foreign affairs (see 1922 Government Crisis). The Gonatas government served until 11 January 1924, when it resigned in favor of fellow-liberal Eleftherios Venizelos, who had returned from exile in Paris. For his service, Gonatas was given the Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer. On 31 May 1924, the National Assembly promoted him and Plastiras to the rank of lieutenant general. Later political career After his service as Prime Minister, Gonatas resigned his commission in the army. In the same year, a Republic was proclaimed and the legislature expanded to include a second house: the Senate. Gonatas ran for and was elected to the Senate as a Liberal in the 1929 election representing Attica and Boeotia. He was re- elected and later served as President of the Senate from 1932 to its dissolution in 1935. During the Nazi Occupation of Greece, Gonatas was imprisoned in the Haidari concentration camp for four months. After the German withdrawal, Gonatas was freed and re-entered political life. When he quarrelled with Themistoklis Sophoulis, the leader of the Liberal Party, he formed his own party, the Party of National Liberals (Κόμμα Εθνικών Φιλελευθέρων) which contested the 1946 general election in coalition with the conservative People's Party. Gonatas' party elected 30 members of Parliament. Having joined forces with the monarchist party, Gonatas committed himself to support the restoration of the monarchy in the 1946 plebiscite, which restored King George II to the throne. In the Konstantinos Tsaldaris government from 1946–1947, he served as Minister for Public Works. In the 1950 general election, Gonatas' party first allied with Napoleon Zervas' National Party of Greece but when he was discredited for his collaboration with the Nazis, Gonatas decided to run in coalition with the Liberal Party. In this election, for the first time in his political career, Gonatas was not elected. He never sought public office again; continuing only to serve as former Prime Ministers did on the Crown Council advising the King until his death on March 29, 1966, in Athens.

CASP2 orthologs have been identified in nearly all mammals for which complete genome data are available. Unique orthologs are also present in birds, lizards, lissamphibians, and teleosts.  Function  Sequential activation of caspases plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. Caspases exist as inactive proenzymes that undergo proteolytic processing at conserved aspartic residues to produce two subunits, large and small, that dimerize to form the active enzyme. The proteolytic cleavage of this protein is induced by a variety of apoptotic stimuli. Caspase 2 proteolytically cleaves other proteins. It belongs to a family of cysteine proteases called caspases that cleave proteins only at an amino acid following an aspartic acid residue. Within this family, caspase 2 is part of the Ich-1 subfamily. It is one of the most conserved caspases in different species of animal. Caspase 2 has a similar amino acid sequence to initiator caspases, including caspase 1, caspase 4, caspase 5, and caspase 9. It is produced as a zymogen, which contains a long pro-domain that is similar to that of caspase 9 and contains a protein interaction domain known as a CARD domain. Pro- caspase-2 contains two subunits, p19 and p12. It has been shown to associate with several proteins involved in apoptosis using its CARD domain, including RIP-associated Ich-1/Ced-3-homologue protein with a death domain (RAIDD), apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC), and death effector filament-forming Ced-4-like apoptosis protein (DEFCAP). Together with RAIDD and p53-induced protein with a death domain ([PIDD])(LRDD), caspase 2 has been shown to form the so-called PIDDosome, which may serve as an activation platform for the protease, although it may also be activated in the absence of PIDD. Overall, caspase 2 appears to be a very versatile caspase with multiple functions beyond cell death induction.  Interactions  Caspase 2 has been shown to interact with: * BH3 interacting domain death agonist, * CRADD, and * Caspase 8.

He is best known for the unusual manner of his death, as documented by the composer Giovanni Pacini.Pacini, Giovanni, Le mie memorie artistiche, p. 34: Florence, 1865 (accessible for free on line in books.google) Singing the second tenor part in a performance of Pacini's opera Cesare in Egitto, Sbigoli took part in a vocal quintet with first tenor Domenico Donzelli. In the course of the quintet, Sbigoli's character was to sing a phrase \\"closely resembling one sung just previously by Donzelli\\".Weinstock, Herbert, Donizetti, pp. 26–27: New York, 1963 Attempting to match Donzelli's powerful voice, Sbigoli overstrained himself, burst a blood vessel in his neck, and died shortly thereafter. While tragic in and of itself, this incident also had a small but significant impact on the course of music history, as Sbigoli was scheduled to sing the role of Abenamet in the premiere of Gaetano Donizetti's opera Zoraida di Granata at the Teatro Argentina. No other tenors were available to replace Sbigoli, and the premiere was no more than a week or two thereafter, on January 28; thus, Donizetti had to hurriedly revise the opera, transforming the tenor Abenamet —a military general— into a newly created role for female contralto.Ashbrook, William, Donizetti and his operas, pp. 22–23: Cambridge, 1982 Despite this last-minute revision, the opera was hugely acclaimed upon its premiere, and marked Donizetti's first major success, boosting his career immeasurably. According to the diary of Prince Agostino Chigi, the Teatro Argentina held a benefit on Feb. 15, 1822 for the widow and children of Americo Sbigoli, raising six thousand lire.Weinstock, p. 26 (note) References Category:Year of birth missing Category:1822 deaths Category:Italian operatic tenors Category:Musicians who died on stage Category:19th-century Italian opera singers Category:19th-century male singers ","title":"Americo Sbigoli"},{"id":"10978226","text":"Adalelm (died 8 April 894) was the Count of Troyes from 886 to his death.

The Kayan consists of the following groups: Kayan Lahwi (also called Padaung, ), Kayan Ka Khaung (Gekho), Kayan Lahta, Kayan Ka Ngan. Kayan Gebar, Kayan Kakhi and, sometimes, Bwe people (Kayaw). Padaung (Yan Pa Doung) is a Shan term for the Kayan Lahwi (the group in which women wear the brass neck rings). The Kayan residents in Mae Hong Son Province in Northern Thailand refer to themselves as Kayan and object to being called Padaung. In The Hardy Padaungs (1967) Khin Maung Nyunt, one of the first authors to use the term \\"Kayan\\", says that the Padaung prefer to be called Kayan. On the other hand, Pascal Khoo Thwe calls his people Padaung in his 2002 memoir, From the Land of Green Ghosts: A Burmese Odyssey. Pascal Khoo Thwe, From the Land of Green Ghosts: A Burmese Odyssey (2002), Google books In the late 1980s and early 1990s due to conflict with the military regime in Myanmar, many Kayan tribes fled to the Thai border area.Thai Burma Border Consortium / A brief history of the Thailand Burma border situation Among the refugee camps set up there was a Long Neck section, which became a tourist site, self-sufficient on tourist revenue and not needing financial assistance.Burmese Border Consortium Relief programme: January to June 2003 According to U Aung Roe (1993:21ss) Kayan number about 40,000 in Shan State (around the Pekon Township area) and 20,000 in Kayah State (around Demawso and Loikaw). A 2004 estimate puts the population at approximately 130,000. About 600 Kayan reside in the three villages open to tourists in Mae Hong Sorn, or in the Ban Mai Nai Soy refugee camp.  Geography   Present settlement of the Kayans  Woman and child, 1905. According to Kayan tradition the Kayan settled in the Demawso area of Karenni State (Kayah State) in 739 AD. Today, they reside in Karenni (Kayah) State around Demawso and Loikow, in the southern region of Shan State and in Mandalay’s Pyinmana and Karen’s Than Daung township. There are three Kayan villages in Mae Hong Son province in Thailand. The largest is Huay Pu Keng, on the Pai river, close to the Thai Myanmar border. Huai Seau Tao is a commercial village opened in 1995. Many of the residents of Ban Nai Soi Kayan Longneck village moved into the Karenni refugee camp in September 2008, but 20 families and 104 residents remain there, according to the sign at the entrance as of February 2001.  Culture   Brass coils  Women of the Kayan tribes identify themselves by their forms of dress. Women of the Kayan Lahwi tribe are well known for wearing neck rings, brass coils that are placed around the neck, appearing to lengthen it. Girls first start to wear rings when they are around 5 years old. Over the years, the coil is replaced by a longer one and more turns are added. The weight of the brass pushes the collar bone down and compresses the rib cage. The neck itself is not lengthened; the appearance of a stretched neck is created by the deformation of the clavicle. Many ideas regarding why the coils are worn have been suggested. Speculation by anthropologists, who have hypothesized, that the rings protected women from becoming slaves; making them less attractive to other tribes. It has also been theorised that the coils originate from the desire to look more attractive by exaggerating sexual dimorphism, as women have more slender necks than men. It has also been suggested that the coils give the women resemblance to a dragon, an important figure in Kayan folklore. The coils might be meant to protect from tiger bites, perhaps literally, but probably symbolically. Kayan women, when asked, acknowledge these ideas, and often say that their purpose for wearing the rings is cultural identity (one associated with beauty). The coil, once on, is seldom removed, as the coiling and uncoiling is a lengthy procedure. It is usually only removed to be replaced by a new or longer coil. The muscles covered by the coil become weakened. Many women have removed the rings for medical examinations. Most women prefer to wear the rings once their clavicle has been lowered, as the area of the neck and collarbone often becomes bruised and discolored. Additionally, the collar feels like an integral part of the body after ten or more years of continuous wear. In 2006, some of the younger women in Mae Hong Son started to remove their rings, either to give them the opportunity to continue their education or in protest against the exploitation of their culture and the restrictions that came with it. In late 2008, most of the young women who entered the refugee camp removed their rings. One woman who had worn the rings for over 40 years removed them. After removing the rings, women report discomfort that fades after about three days. The discoloration is more persistent. The government of Myanmar began discouraging neck rings as it struggled to appear more modern to the developed world. Consequently, many women in Myanmar began breaking the tradition, though a few older women and some of the younger girls in remote villages continued to wear rings. In Thailand, the practice has gained popularity in recent years, because it draws tourists who bring revenue to the tribe and to the local businessmen who run the villages and collect an entry fee of 500 to 600 baht per person. The Karenni National People's Liberation Front (KNPLF), an armed cease-fire group, have made attempts to invite the Kayan to return to Kayah State to set up their own tourist villages. In January 2008, the UNHCR expressed reservations about tourists visiting the Kayan villages in Northern Thailand due to the provincial government’s refusal to allow registered Kayan refugees to take up offers of resettlement in developed countries.BBC news / Burmese women in Thai 'human zoo' It is believed this policy was linked to their economic importance to the area. This policy was relaxed in late 2008 and a small group of Kayan have left for New Zealand in August 2008.huaypukeng.com Others entered the main Karenni refugee camp (which is not open to tourists) in September 2008 and they are now eligible for resettlement.  Courtship & Marriage Rituals  In the past the choice of marriage partners was usually the responsibility of the parents; but today young people often select their own partner. The rule of marriage is only those genetically related are allowed to marry. It is preferable for first cousins to get married. However, marriage between different generations is taboo. Marriages with in-laws or conflicting clans who have sworn not to marry for several generations is forbidden. It is believed that if these rules are violated, misfortune falls upon all their relatives. When a young man has decided upon a girl, his parents will approach her parents with a gift. If the girl accepts then the couple are now engaged. The young man’s family have to provide a dowry to seal the contract. Usually the daughter-in-law will move in with her husband upon marriage and in that case, the price is higher than if the man moves in with his wife. The contract ceremony may be ended by the families eating together chicken provided by the groom’s family. In this way, the couple will love each other forever. The bride price consists of several parts: * the initial lascion or pledge; * the tacu or the purchase proper, in money, buffalos etc. which belongs to the father of the girl to pay him for his guardianship; * the talio which is divided up among the closest relatives, and consists for the most part of utensils, mats, household goods etc. * the maithu or “milk compensation”, which belongs to the mother of the bride to compensate her for the milk given when the girl was a baby, and usually consists of a silver coin or even a little buffalo, which the mother keeps for her funeral; * the tiki or little gift of money given to the bride before they are united. * rice, pork, Thi (rice wine) and other food items or betel nuts for the wedding feast  Traditional religion  Image:Kay_htoe_bo_poles.jpgKay Htoe Boe poles. Image:Kay_htoe_bo_dance.jpgThe Pwai dance. Image:Kay_htoe_bo_procession.jpgFollowing the pwai dance the women sprinkle the men with water using eugenia leaves. Image:Chicken_bone_reading1.jpgFowl bone prognostication. The Kayans' traditional religion is called Kan Khwan, and has been practiced since the people migrated from Mongolia during the Bronze Age. It includes the belief that the Kayan people are the result of a union between a female dragon and a male human/angel hybrid. The major religious festival is the three-day Kay Htein Bo festival, which commemorates the belief that the creator god gave form to the world by planting a small post in the ground. During this festival, held in late March or early April, a Kay Htoe Boe pole is erected and participants dance around the pole. This festival is held to venerate the eternal god and creator messengers, to give thanks for blessings during the year, to appeal for forgiveness, and pray for rain. It is also an opportunity for Kayan from different villages to come together to maintain the solidarity of the tribe. The Kayan have a strong belief in augury and nothing is done without reference to some form of divination, including breaking thatch grass, but most importantly consulting the chicken bones. In present times, the annual Kay Htein Bo festival is always accompanied by a reading of the chicken bones to predict the year ahead. Fowl bone prognostication can be witnessed in the Kayan villages in Thailand's Mae Hong Son province during the annual festival, and during \\"cleansing ceremonies\\" that a family holds when it has encountered ill fortune. They also use dreams to make predictions. Image:Cleansing1.jpgCleansing Ceremony Rituals Image:Cleansing2.jpg Image:Cleansing3.jpg Image:Cleansing4.jpg  Current religious practices  Although many of the Kayan still participate in these traditional festivals, in the 19th century Italian missionaries worked amongst them for many years and today the majority of Kayan and Kayaw people are Roman Catholics. Statistics published in 2005 list 306 Kayan villages, out of which 209 are Roman Catholic, 19 Kan Khwan, 32 Baptist, and 44 Buddhist, of which 2 belong to the Byamaso civil society organization.

The Soviets believed that the economic policies that helped them recover would similarly help the Eastern European counties recoup. Countries in the Eastern Bloc were instructed to build up the industries present in the Soviet Union – regardless of whether or not they had the natural resources to support those industries – or to concentrate on developing pre-existing industries which could benefit the Soviet Union. In the case of Czechoslovakia, the state was told to concentrate on heavy industry. This concentration on heavy industry depleted the country's natural resources at an extraordinarily fast rate and produced an excessive amount of pollution. Effects The pollution produced by heavy industry seriously degraded air quality. The air contained high concentrations of sulfur dioxide because the energy production was largely based on combustion of fuel high in sulfur. As a result, 50 percent of the forests were either dead or dying. Cases of bronchitis and asthma in children almost doubled with the increase in the use of sulfur dioxide. The water, too, was affected by the excessive pollution, both from industrial fertilizers and oil spills. The lack of water waste treatment meant that a large portion of the water was undrinkable for the population, and some of the water was so bad that it was even unusable by the industry. Conditions were worst in Northern Bohemia, which was a part of the so-called ‘triangle of death’ that also included South-East East Germany and South-West Poland, but the effects were also felt beyond the region in which the pollution originated. The Danube River carried much of the pollution to other areas of the state and other countries, and acid rain brought the pollution directly to the cities, where it could eat away at the buildings and statues.Adamova, Eva. “Environmental Management in Czecho-Slovakia”. Environmental Action in Eastern Europe. Ed. Barbara Jancar-Webster. Armonk, New York: M.E. Sharpe, 1993. 42-57. The government's role While pollution was increasing, records and information relating to pollution became increasingly inaccessible to the public. Students who tried to make the public aware of the problems were arrested and detained by the police.Students Take Word of Protests to Czechoslovak Towns, Villages; Communist Authorities Try to Stop Activists from Spreading the News, The Washington Post, November 24th, 1989. Often no records were even kept on the industrial effects on the environment. There were some people involved with non-governmental organizations that tried to correct the situation, but these groups were largely interested in acting as an adversary of the state. Under the 1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia, the state was legally required to protect the quality of the environment as far as necessary to protect human health, but in northern Czechoslovakia, pollution reportedly shortened a person’s life by three to four years. The government even acknowledged these poor living conditions by offering a bonus to people who lived in the area for more than ten years – called burial money by the people in the area.East Europe: Greening of the Reds, The Washington Post, December 24, 1989. The government faced problems in trying to solve environmental problems because there was no central branch responsible for environmental safety and protection. Instead, there were many different branches responsible for different aspects of the environment – one for water, one for land, one for air, etc., and these different branches often had conflicting interests. Each branch would try to enforce its own environmental priorities without regard to the overall environmental picture. Furthermore, these branches were in charge not only of the environmental issues in their area, but also of the economic issues, giving each branch a set of conflicting priorities, and economic needs would generally win out. When the government imposed fines for failures to comply with pollution regulations, it would also help industry pay off the fines, leaving industry with little incentive to change policies.

During his freshman year, he was twice named Ivy League Men's Basketball Rookie of the Week for the 1993–94 team. That season the 11–3 Tigers could not match the who were led by Jerome Allen and Matt Maloney. Johnson provided heroics for the 1994–95 Tigers on a couple of occasions.

The win ended an eight-game losing streak to Penn. The win earned the team the conference automatic bid to the 1996 NCAA Tournament and following the game head coach Pete Carril announced his retirement. The thirteen seeded team was matched against the defending national champion UCLA Bruins in its first round pairing. He was the team's leading scorer with 11 points in the 43–41 first round victory over UCLA in the 1996 NCAA Tournament. The team fell behind 41–34 with over six minutes remaining. His 3-of-7 three point shooting performance included a shot to bring the team to within 4. He also made the game-tying layup to knot the score at 41. He also defended Toby Bailey's last second shot after Princeton took the lead with 3.9 seconds remaining. During the game, UCLA jumped out to a 7–0 lead at the first TV timeout, and Johnson's leadership held the team together early when UCLA looked strong. As a senior, his new head coach, Bill Carmody described him as a shutdown defender. He was 1997 Ivy League Men's basketball Player of the Year. Johnson earned the award for his defense and was the first winner with a single-digit scoring average.

During Johnson's third season, the 2009–10 team rebounded from a 2–4 start to win 20 of its final 25 games and earn a berth in the 2010 College Basketball Invitational. Princeton's 22 wins were its most since 1999, as were its two postseason wins, and the postseason berth was its first since 2004. In the March 17, opening round game at home, Princeton defeated the Duquesne Dukes 65–51. The game was Princeton's first postseason appearance since the 2003–04 team went to the 2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament and the first postseason victory since the 1998–99 team won two games in the 1999 National Invitation Tournament.

Completed in December 1951 as a \\"gift to Joseph Stalin from the Hungarians on his seventieth birthday\\", it was torn down on October 23, 1956 by enraged anti-Soviet crowds during Hungary's October Revolution. Monument The monument was erected on the edge of Városliget, the city park of Budapest. The large monument stood 25 metres tall in total. The bronze statue stood eight metres high on a four-metre high limestone base on top of a tribune eighteen metres wide. Stalin was portrayed as a speaker, standing tall and rigid with his right hand at his chest. The sides of the tribune were decorated with relief sculptures depicting the Hungarian people welcoming their leader. The Hungarian sculptor, Sándor Mikus, created the statue and was awarded the Kossuth Prize, the highest distinction that can be attained by a Hungarian artist. Background The Stalin Monument in Budapest The Stalin monument was built during the classical period of Socialist Realism, the official art of Stalinism, which was a tool to instill the ideology of the Party into the people. This realistic and didactic aesthetic style celebrated the hard working proletariat and especially the cult of personality surrounding figures like Vladimir Lenin, Stalin and other Eastern European Communist leaders. Stalin statues sprang up everywhere in Eastern Europe from the 1930s to the 1950s. They were cult objects that demonstrated the almost mystical powers of Stalin. Upon the completion of the Stalin statue, a journalist in Budapest said: > Stalin was with us earlier; now he will be with us even more. He will watch > over our work, and his smile will show us the way. I have been told that in > Moscow it is customary to pay a visit to Comrade Lenin in Red Square before > beginning, or after finishing, an important task, either to report or to ask > his advice. Undoubtedly the same will occur here with the statue of Comrade > Stalin. The monument not only demonstrated Stalin's power, but the power of the Hungarian Working People's Party as well. Directly across from Stalin's monument was MÉMOSZ, the house of the builder's union, condemned for its modernist architecture influenced by the West. After the death of Stalin in 1953, Socialist Realism went into decline, in connection with the political changes initiated by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956 at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, when he denounced Stalin's cult of personality. Destruction Grand Boulevard. The remains of the monument after its destruction in 1956. On October 23, 1956, around two hundred thousand Hungarians gathered in Budapest to demonstrate in sympathy for the Poles who had just gained political reform during the Polish October. The Hungarians broadcast sixteen demands over the radio, one of them being the dismantling of Stalin's statue. A hundred thousand Hungarian revolutionaries demolished the Stalin statue, leaving only his boots, in which they planted a Hungarian flag. The bronze inscribed name of the Hungarians' leader, teacher and \\"best friend\\" was ripped off from the pedestal. Before the toppling of the statue, someone had placed a sign over Stalin's mouth that read \\"RUSSIANS, WHEN YOU RUN AWAY DON'T LEAVE ME BEHIND!\\"Åman, Anders. Architecture and Ideology in Eastern Europe During the Stalin Era. Cambridge, MA: The MIT P, 1992. 195. The revolutionaries chanted \\"Russia go home!\\" while pulling down the statue. \\"W.C.\\" and other insulting remarks were scrawled over the fragmented parts of the statue. The account of the incident by Sándor Kopácsi, head of Budapest's police: \\"[The demonstrators] placed ... a thick steel rope around the neck of the 25-metre tall Stalin's statue while other people, arriving in trucks with oxygen cylinders and metal cutting blowpipes, were setting to work on the statue's bronze shoes. ... An hour later the statue fell down from its pedestal.\\" Present \\"Stalin's boots\\", Memento Park, Szoborpark. The site of the former Stalin Monument is now occupied by the Monument of the 1956 Revolution, completed in 2006 for the 50th anniversary of the historic event.

Héroes has 6 episodes. Each one of them relates the history of one of the principal figures of the Chilean history in the 19th century: Bernardo O'Higgins, José Miguel Carrera, Manuel Rodríguez, Diego Portales, José Manuel Balmaceda and Arturo Prat. The miniseries is one of the most ambitious project of Canal 13 for the commemoration of the bicentenary of the independence of Chile, in 2010. The miniseries has the support of the Ministry of Education and the Chilean Army. Episodes \\"O'Higgins, vivir para merecer su nombre\\" :\\"O'Higgins, Live to Deserve his Name\\" :Hero: Bernardo O'Higgins :Released: March 26, 2007 The film is set during 1817 to 1823, on the events of the Patria Nueva, but it has some flashbacks when O'Higgins was a kid (years unrevealed) and when he was learning who his father (Ambrosio O'Higgins) was. Its main plot surrounds the events of his governments, and the changes on his popularity among the people. In this film, Bernardo O'Higgins is portrayed by the actor Julio Milostich, and gives an \\"emotional\\" side to the hero, to explain why he acceded to kill the Carrera brothers and Manuel Rodriguez. Other co-stars are Daniela Jaccques as Rosario Puga, Elsa Poblete as Isabel Riquelme, Hector Noguera as Ambrosio O'Higgins, Diego Muñoz as José Antonio Pérez Cotapos, Pedro Vicuña as General De La Cruz, Daniel Muñoz as José de San Martín, and Benjamín Vicuña as Manuel Rodríguez. \\"Carrera, el príncipe de los caminos\\" :Carrera, the Prince of the Roads :Hero: José Miguel Carrera :Released: April 30, 2007 The film is set during 1796 (just a brief scene in which Carrera is a young boy) to 1821. When José Miguel is having his worst moments, he remembers a memory from his youth: a scorpion trying to escape from fire. Its main plot surrounds Carrera's journey back to Chile and the revenge he has for O'Higgins. Here, José Miguel Carrera is portrayed by a new young actor, Diego Casanueva, who makes a very good interpretation to the character, especially his moments in which he is more revengeful. Other co-stars are Javiera Díaz de Valdés as Mercedes Fontecilla, Sebastián Layseca as José María Benavente, Daniel Muñoz as José de San Martín, Benjamín Vicuña as Manuel Rodríguez, Julio Milostich as Bernardo O´Higgins, Alfredo Allende as Luis Carrera, and Gabriel Sepúlveda as Juan José Carrera. \\"Rodríguez, hijo de la rebeldía\\" :\\"Rodriguez, Son of the Rebelliousness\\" :Hero: Manuel Rodríguez :Released: June 24, 2007 The film is set during 1808 to 1818, especially highlighting the period of the Reconquista and having as its main plot surrounding Rodriguez's time as a spy. Additionally, the film is narrated by Rodriguez's father, Carlos Rodriguez. This is the third film and the final one of the independency trilogy. Manuel Rodriguez is portrayed by Benjamín Vicuña, and though it is the third time he appears in an Héroes film, now he has a much larger role. Other co-stars are María Elena Swett as Francisca de Paula Segura y Ruiz, Alejandro Trejo as Carlos Rodriguez, Carmen Disa Gutiérrez as Loreto Erdoíza, Erto Pantoja as Miguel Neira, Mariana Loyola as Ana, Julio Milostich as Bernardo O'Higgins and Diego Casanueva as José Miguel Carrera. \\"Portales, la fuerza de los hechos\\" :\\"Portales, the force of the Facts\\" :Hero: Diego Portales :Released: September 2, 2007 The film is set only in 1837, when Diego Portales is arrested along with Necochea. Throughout the movie, there are several flashbacks showing Portales's father's arrest, his relationship with his mother, the deaths of his wife and daughters, and his rise to power. Another theme in the movie is religion and the tendency that Portales has to always blame God for the deaths of his loved ones. Diego Portales here is portrayed by the actor Carlos Concha, who perfectly reflects both of the hero's sides. He portrays his kind side when he is joking with Necochea or with his family. And his more ruthless side is when his family is already dead. Other co-stars are Luis Gnecco as Necochea, Paola Giannini as Chepita, Paulina García as María Encarnación, Ingrid Isenee as Constanza, Marcial Edwards as José Portales, Pablo Schwarz as Santiago Florín and Pablo Krögh as Viadurre. \\"Balmaceda\\" :Hero: José Manuel Balmaceda :Released: September 30, 2007 The only film to feature a President of Chile, and the Chilean Civil War of 1891. \\"Prat, Espada de honor\\" :\\"Prat, sword of honor\\" :Hero: Arturo Prat :Released: May 24 and 31, 2009 Released in honor of the 130th anniversary of the Battle of Iquique that made him Chile's great national naval hero of the War of the Pacific (thus making it also the only episode from this great and important part of the nation's history). Even through it was made very late in 2008, this two-part film focuses on Arturo Prat's life and the battle that made him a hero for the nation, at his life's cost.

In humans, this protein (XIAP) is produced by a gene named XIAP gene located on the X chromosome. XIAP is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis family of proteins (IAP). IAPs were initially identified in baculoviruses, but XIAP is one of the homologous proteins found in mammals. It is so called because it was first discovered by a 273 base pair site on the X chromosome. The protein is also called human IAP-like Protein (hILP), because it is not as well conserved as the human IAPS: hIAP-1 and hIAP-2. XIAP is the most potent human IAP protein currently identified. Discovery Neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein (NAIP) was the first homolog to baculoviral IAPs that was identified in humans. With the sequencing data of NIAP, the gene sequence for a RING zinc-finger domain was discovered at site Xq24-25. Using PCR and cloning, three BIR domains and a RING finger were found on the protein, which became known as X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein. The transcript size of Xiap is 9.0kb, with an open reading frame of 1.8kb. Xiap mRNA has been observed in all human adult and fetal tissues \\"except peripheral blood leukocytes\\". The XIAP sequences led to the discovery of other members of the IAP family. Structure XIAP consists of three major types of structural elements (domains). Firstly, there is the baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domain consisting of approximately 70 amino acids, which characterizes all IAP. Secondly, there is a UBA domain, which allows XIAP to bind to ubiquitin. Thirdly, there is a zinc-binding domain, or a “carboxy-terminal RING Finger”. XIAP has been characterized with three amino-terminal BIR domains followed by one UBA domain and finally one RING domain. Between the BIR-1 and BIR-2 domains, there is a linker-BIR-2 region that is thought to contain the only element that comes into contact with the caspase molecule to form the XIAP/Caspase-7 complex.. In solution the full length form of XIAP forms a homodimer of approximately 114 kDa .  Function  XIAP stops apoptotic cell death that is induced either by viral infection or by overproduction of caspases. Caspases are the enzymes primarily responsible for cell death. XIAP binds to and inhibits caspase 3, 7 and 9. The BIR2 domain of XIAP inhibits caspase 3 and 7, while BIR3 binds to and inhibits caspase 9. The RING domain utilizes E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and enables IAPs to catalyze ubiquination of self, caspase-3, or caspase-7 by degradation via proteasome activity. However, mutations affecting the RING Finger do not significantly affect apoptosis, indicating that the BIR domain is sufficient for the protein’s function. When inhibiting caspase-3 and caspase-7 activity, the BIR2 domain of XIAP binds to the active-site substrate groove, blocking access of the normal protein substrate that would result in apoptosis. Caspases are activated by cytochrome c, which is released into the cytosol by dysfunctioning mitochondria. Studies show that XIAP does not directly affect cytochrome c. XIAP distinguishes itself from the other human IAPs because it is able to effectively prevent cell death due to \\"TNF-α, Fas, UV light, and genotoxic agents\\". Inhibiting XIAP XIAP is inhibited by DIABLO (Smac) and HTRA2 (Omi), two death-signaling proteins released into the cytoplasm by the mitochondria. Smac/DIABLO, a mitochondrial protein and negative regulator of XIAP, can enhance apoptosis by binding to XIAP and preventing it from binding to caspases. This allows normal caspase activity to proceed. The binding process of Smac/DIABLO to XIAP and caspase release requires a conserved tetrapeptide motif. Clinical significance Deregulation of XIAP can result in “cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmunity”. High proportions of XIAP may function as a tumor marker. In the development of lung cancer NCI-H460, the overexpression of XIAP not only inhibits caspase, but also stops the activity of cytochrome c (Apoptosis). In developing prostate cancer, XIAP is one of four IAPs overexpressed in the prostatic epithelium, indicating that a molecule that inhibits all IAPs may be necessary for effective treatment. Apoptotic regulation is an extremely important biological function, as evidenced by \\"the conservation of the IAPs from humans to Drosophila\\". Mutations in the XIAP gene can result in a severe and rare type of inflammatory bowel disease. Defects in the XIAP gene can also result in an extremely rare condition called X-linked lymphoproliferative disease.  Interactions  XIAP has been shown to interact with: * ALS2CR2, * Caspase 3. * Caspase 7, * Caspase-9, * Diablo homolog * HtrA serine peptidase 2, * MAGED1, * MAP3K2, * MAP3K7IP1, and * XAF1.

Raymond Sackler founded Purdue Pharma together with his brothers Arthur M. Sackler and Mortimer Sackler. Purdue Pharma is the developer of OxyContin, the drug at the center of the opioid epidemic in the United States. Sackler, along with his brother Arthur, have been linked with the rise of direct pharmaceutical marketing and eventually to the rise of addiction to OxyContin in the United States. There are concerns that the Sackler family's philanthropy is used as \\"reputation laundering\\" from profits acquired from the misselling of opiates. Early life Born in Brooklyn, New York to a Jewish family, in 1920, Sackler was educated at Erasmus High School, and attended New York University where he received a bachelor's degree in 1938. Due to Jewish quotas imposed by the major U.S. medical schools during that era, he started his medical education at Anderson College of Medicine in Glasgow, Scotland, which he attended from 1938 to 1940. When World War II began, he stayed in Scotland and volunteered in the British Home Guard and also served as a plane spotter. He returned to the U.S. and completed his studies at Middlesex University School of Medicine (a school on the site of current day Brandeis University in Waltham, MA.) where he received an MD in 1944. Sackler married Beverly Feldman in 1944. They had two sons, Richard S. Sackler and Jonathan D. Sackler. Beverly Sackler died on October 15, 2019 at the age of 95.  Medical career  Sackler was certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (P) in 1957, and was a Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association. Sackler, with his two brothers, Arthur and Mortimer, co-founded the Creedmoor Institute for Psychobiological Studies in New York City, where they engaged in research in the psycho-biology of schizophrenia and manic depressive psychosis. They received two awards from the Medical Society of the State of New York: the First Award for Scientific Research; and one year later, Honorable Mention for Scientific Research. In 1998, Sackler was awarded a Doctor of Law Honoris Causa from the University of Cambridge.  Pharmaceutical business  With lessons learned in research, Sackler and his brother Mortimer transitioned into the development of numerous pharmaceutical, manufacturing, and research companies, Sackler being closely associated with the now global reach of Purdue Pharma in the United States and Canada and Mundipharma, Ltd. in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Purdue Pharma, which is 100% privately owned and operated by the families of Raymond and Mortimer Sackler, is well known for successful research and development, and particularly for marketing the opiate drug Oxycontin and related compounds.  Controversy  On October 30, 2017, The New Yorker published a multi-page exposé on Raymond Sackler, Purdue Pharma, and the Sackler family. The article links Raymond and Arthur Sackler's business acumen with the rise of direct pharmaceutical marketing and eventually to the rise of addiction to OxyContin in the United States. The article implies that Raymond Sackler bears moral responsibility for the opioid epidemic in the United States. In 2019, the New York Times revealed that Sackler had told company officials in 2008 to “measure our performance by Rx’s by strength, giving higher measures to higher strengths.” This was verified by legally obtained documents tied to a new lawsuit filed in June 2018 by the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey. The lawsuit claims that Purdue Pharma and members of the Sackler family knew that putting patients on high dosages of OxyContin for long periods increased the risks of serious side effects, including addiction. Nonetheless, they promoted higher dosages because stronger pain pills brought the company and the Sacklers the most profit. On February 1, 2019, Healey released unredacted documents showing that the Sacklers directed doctors to overprescribe the drug and listed doctors (under the code name \\"Region Zero\\") who overprescribed Oxycontin for the Sackler family's profit rather than patients' health.

It is available in either 9×19mm Parabellum or .40 S&W; chamberings. It was first shown in 2007 at the IWA & OutdoorClassics and is a slim polymer framed weapon of similar size to the Walther PPK pistol. The PPS is however technically much more based on the Walther P99 pistol.Walther Defense Catalog 2011 PPS pistols manufactured by Walther in Ulm, Germany are imported to the United States through Walther Arms.http://www.waltherarms.com/ The PPS pistols are also made under license in Poland by Fabryka Broni Radom.PPS Semiautomatic Pistol at en.abrykabroni.pl Design details Operating mechanism The Walther PPS is a short recoil-operated locked breech semi-automatic pistol that uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol. The PPS has a glassfiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools. Features The pre-loaded internal striker is a variant of the partially cocked striker system of the Walther P99 Quick Action model. When the trigger is pulled, the already partially cocked striker is fully cocked and released, firing the pistol. An indicator on the back of the slide shows if the striker is partially cocked. The 'QuickSafe' trigger variant main difference with the Walther P99 Quick Action trigger is that removing the PPS pistol's backstrap will disable the gun for safe storage by decocking and blocking the striker until the backstrap is reinstalled. The PPS has a trigger travel of approximately and a trigger pull of approximately . Unlike many other trigger systems preset internal strikers have a let-off point and trigger pull that remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker.Safety & Instruction Manual WALTHER PPS Pistol on the official German Walther (multilingual) Ergonomics were a key focus in the design of the firearm, and as a result, three interchangeable grip backstraps are included (small, medium and large) to accommodate various hand shapes and sizes; this feature permits most shooters a comfortable and efficient grip on the firearm The injection molded grip frame contains 4 steel guide rails for the slide: two at the rear of the frame, and the remaining pair above the front of the trigger guard. The polymer grip has a non-slip surface on the sides and both the front and rear straps and a slightly funneled magazine well to aid magazine insertion. Under the dust cover the grip frame has an integrated mounting MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail for attaching accessories, such as a tactical light or laser pointer. The slide and other metal parts of the pistol are Tenifer treated (a ferritic nitrocarburizing process also used on Glock pistols). The Tenifer finish is between and in thickness, and is characterized by extreme resistance to wear and corrosion; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth.Kasler, 137 The Tenifer process produces a matte gray-colored, non- glare surface with a 64 Rockwell C hardness rating (by comparison, an industrial diamond has a rating of 70 HRC) and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications),Kokalis, 321 making the PPS particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol concealed as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration. PPS pistols are delivered in a polymer pistol case containing; the pistol, 2 backstraps of different sizes, 2 magazine (small and medium), magazine loader, instruction manual, warranty papers, factory test target showing 5 shots fired at distance and an envelope with the case of the proof round fired during the proof test at the C.I.P. accredited Beschussamt Ulm (Proof House Ulm). Barrel PPS made under licence in Poland by Fabryka Broni Radom. The PPS M1 pistol has a traditional barrel with conventional (spiral grooves and lands) rifling, and PPS M2 has polygonal rifling. Safety The PPS features three safeties (trigger safety, internal firing pin safety and QuickSafe feature) of which the external integrated trigger safety inner lever mechanism contained within the trigger serves as an additional passive drop safety. The pistol has a loaded chamber indicator in the form of a witness opening at the top of the slide/ejection port. By looking into this opening the user can see if a cartridge is present in the chamber. Feeding The PPS feeds from single stack magazines of varying capacity. The various magazine capacities are achieved by small, medium (+1) or large (+2) magazine floorplates. The small magazine is flush with grip bottom. The extended +1 and +2 floorplates integrate with the gripframe adding finger rest space for better grip. The magazines are made of steel for Walther by the Italian subcontractor MEC-GAR and have an anti friction coating for easy loading and anti-corrosion and witness holes to view how many rounds are in the magazine. A steel spring drives a plastic follower. The standard PPS magazines weigh (6/5 rounds of 9×19mm Parabellum/.40 S&W;), (7/6 rounds of 9×19mm Parabellum/.40 S&W;) and (8/7 rounds of 9×19mm Parabellum/.40 S&W;). After the last cartridge has been fired, the magazine follower exerts upward pressure on the slide stop causing it to engage the slide stop notch thereby holding it in the \\"open\\" position. The slide stop release lever is located on the left side of the frame directly beneath the slide and can be manipulated by the thumb of the shooting hand for right handed shooters. When a cartridge is present in the chamber the pistol can be fired without the need of having a magazine inserted in the weapon. Walther does however offer a magazine disconnect as an optional safety on some PPS pistols that will prevent discharging the pistol without a magazine present in the pistol.Safety & Instruction Manual WALTHER PPS Pistol on the USA Walther website Empty magazines are released by depressing ambidextrous magazine release levers incorporated into the trigger guard. Sights The standard low profile iron sights are made of steel. The rear sighting element is adjustable for windage by drifting and the front sighting element can be adjusted for elevation by exchanging the front sight. For this Walther offers front sight elements in four differing heights. The standard sights have 3 high-contrast dots which serve as contrast enhancements and have been painted with afterglow paint to aid target acquisition under unfavourable lighting conditions. Tritium illuminated night sights are also available. Due to product evolution in the Walther pistol line the PPS maintains compatibility with Walther P99 sights. The sight radius is . Overpressure ammunition German definitive smokeless powder proof marks (eagle over N figure) issued by the Beschussamt Ulm C.I.P.-accredited Proof House (antlers figure) on a Walther PPS pistol. According to Walther, “Plus-P” (+P) overpressure ammunition may affect the wear characteristics of the PPS pistol or exceed the margin of safety. Use of “Plus-P” ammunition may, according to Walther, result in the need for more frequent service. Walther recommends against the use of “Plus-P-Plus” (+P+) overpressure ammunition in Walther firearms. This marking on the ammunition designates that it exceeds established industry standards, but the designation does not represent defined pressure limits and therefore such ammunition may vary significantly as to the pressures generated. Accessories Factory accessories include: fixed metal three-dot iron sights, fixed tritium night sights, adjustable sports iron sights, adjustable optic fibre iron sights, laser pointers, tactical lights, magazine flashlight adapters, holsters, magazines, and magazine loaders are offered as factory accessories.Walther Defense Accessories Variants Currently four PPS models are available for purchase in the United States. Two are chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum with part number WAP10001 for the standard model and part number WAP10006 for the Massachusetts compliant model and two in .40 S&W; with the part number WAP10002 and part number WAP10007 for the Massachusetts compliant model. Previously another was available in 9 mm which had \\"First Edition\\" printed on the slide and a blue-tinted frame (part number WAWAP10003FC). U.S. models are currently sold in plastic hard cases with both backstraps and a two magazines (7 and 8 round capacity in 9mm, 6 and 7 round capacity in .40 S&W;).http://galleryofguns.com/genie/default.aspx?pg=list&mfg;=Walther%20Arms%20Inc&cat;=1&type;=Pistol:%20Semi- Auto&mdl;=PPS&cal;=All M2 series In 2016 the PPS M2 chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum was introduced, and as of 2018, it has never been available in any other caliberhttps://www.waltherarms.com/handguns/pps-m2/. The PPS M2 general ergonomic design shares similarities with the Walther PPQ M2 series. Dimensionally the M2 series are similar to the original PPS variants. The PPS M2 features a push button magazine release, front and rear slide serrations and a redesigned grip. The PPS M2 has a trigger travel of approximately and a trigger pull of approximately . The PPS M2 is also available in an LE edition with phosphoric iron sights. The magazines are available in 6, 7 and 8 round capacity in 9×19mm Parabellum and 5, 6 and 7 round capacity in .40 S&W.; Additionally, the PPS M2 magazines are not compatible with the original PPS magazines. The integrated mounting MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail for attaching accessories, such as a tactical light or laser pointer found on the PPS is omitted on the PPS M2.  Slide stop modification  Walther modified the slide stop lever and an accompanying spring on the PPS pistols to improve reliability. Early PPS pistols can be modified but need an enlargement of a hole in the pistol gripframe before the new style slide stop and spring can be installed. For this the pistol has to be sent in to the Walther customer service.

Courtesy of the University Archives, The George Washington University William Staughton (January 4, 1770 - December 12, 1829) was a Baptist clergyman, educator, and music composer. He was also a Chaplain of the United States Senate and the first President of Columbian College from 1821-1827, which is the original name and oldest division (1821) of The George Washington University.Guide to the William Staughton Collection, 1795-1964, Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University Life Staughton was born on January 4, 1770 in Coventry, Warwickshire, England to Sutton and Keziah Staughton. In 1792, he graduated from Bristol Baptist College. He became a preacher in Northampton, and in 1792 helped found the Baptist Missionary Society. Staughton moved to Charleston, South Carolina in 1793. After marrying Maria Hanson shortly after his arrival, he preached in Georgetown, South Carolina for approximately two years. In 1795, Staughton moved to York City and then to Bordentown, New Jersey, where he preached at a Baptist church, headed an academy, and was ordained a Baptist minister on June 17, 1797. He continued his educational studies at Princeton University and received a Doctor of Divinity in 1801.

Formation and decay 129I is one of seven long-lived fission products. It is primarily formed from the fission of uranium and plutonium in nuclear reactors. Significant amounts were released into the atmosphere as a result of nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s. It is also naturally produced in small quantities, due to the spontaneous fission of natural uranium, by cosmic ray spallation of trace levels of xenon in the atmosphere, and by cosmic ray muons striking tellurium-130.R.

Fission product 129I is one of the seven long-lived fission products that are produced in significant amounts. Its yield is 0.706% per fission of 235U. Larger proportions of other iodine isotopes such as 131I are produced, but because these all have short half-lives, iodine in cooled spent nuclear fuel consists of about 129I and the only stable iodine isotope, 127I. Because 129I is long-lived and relatively mobile in the environment, it is of particular importance in long-term management of spent nuclear fuel. In a deep geological repository for unreprocessed used fuel, 129I is likely to be the radionuclide of most potential impact at long times. Since 129I has a modest neutron absorption cross-section of 30 barns,http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/reColor.jsp?newColor=sigg, NNDC Chart of Nuclides, I-129 Thermal neutron capture cross-section, accessed 16-Dec-2012. and is relatively undiluted by other isotopes of the same element, it is being studied for disposal by nuclear transmutation by re-irradiation with neutronsJ.A.

However, its long half-life and its relative mobility in the environment have made it useful for a variety of dating applications. These include identifying very old waters based on the amount of natural 129I or its 129Xe decay product, as well as identifying younger groundwaters by the increased anthropogenic 129I levels since the 1960s.https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/234761.pdf P.

Meteorite age dating  In 1960 physicist John H. Reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly in the form of an overabundance of 129Xe. He inferred that this must be a decay product of long-decayed radioactive 129I. This isotope is produced in quantity in nature only in supernova explosions. As the half-life of 129I is comparatively short in astronomical terms, this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the 129I. These two events (supernova and solidification of gas cloud) were inferred to have happened during the early history of the Solar System, as the 129I isotope was likely generated before the Solar System was formed, but not long before, and seeded the solar gas cloud isotopes with isotopes from a second source. This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud.

The underlying assumption is that all mental illness results principally from such parenting, even including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Despite the therapy's association with the theory and practice of transactional analysis in the field of psychology, there is not much empirical evidence for its effectiveness, and some significant suggestions that it can in fact be harmful; most mental health practitioners do not regard reparenting as a legitimate form of therapy. History In the late 1960s, Jaqui Lee Schiff developed a form of therapy based on transactional analysis theory. She would dub this form of therapy as total regression reparenting. Schiff and her followers claimed success with curing clients with schizophrenia using reparenting, which resulted in the expansion of its practice. The promising findings of reparenting by Schiff led other therapists to develop their own application and forms of reparenting. The other most notable forms of reparenting that later came include time-limited, spot, and self-reparenting. Some people consider reparenting to be one of the many forms of New Age psychotherapy. Mechanism Deriving from transactional analysis theory, reparenting seeks to treat problems associated with defective parenting. The theory of reparenting states that psychological problems due to defective parenting can be overcome by reforming the parent ego state of the client. This is achieved by regressing the client to a state of mind that is vulnerable to new experiences, called the child ego state in transactional analysis theory. Once the client is in the child ego state, the therapist adopts the role of the client's parent and attempts to correctly reparent the client. The nature of reparenting by the therapist should be more positive and influence the client into developing a healthier parent ego state, which ultimately negates the psychological problems the client may have experienced before reparenting therapy. Methods Due to the wide varying forms of reparenting, each therapist may adopt different methods when treating clients. However, the mechanism that underlie the theory of reparenting is generally agreed upon. Typically, reparenting starts with the regression of the client to the child ego state. The therapist accomplishes this by partaking in child- rearing acts such as bottle feeding, lap pillows, and other techniques wherein the client consciously adopts physical positions and behaviors of a small child. These actions will also gain the client's trust in the therapist as his or her new parent. Once the ideal level of closeness is achieved, the therapist can finally proceed to providing the messages that reform the client's negative way of thinking by lecturing, entering discussions, or other forms of communication appropriate in a parent-child relationship. Forms of Reparenting Total Regression Developed by Jaqui Lee Schiff, this form of reparenting was the first form of therapy built upon transactional analysis theory. Typically, the patient lives with the therapist for up to several years at an institution. During this time, the patient is totally immersed in the reliving of his or her childhood. The therapist provides all the care and nurturing with the goal of totally reforming the client's parent ego state. Total regression reparenting is famously associated with the Cathexis Institution, which was founded by Jaqui Lee Schiff. Time-Limited Regression Thomas Wilson developed time-limited regression reparenting for the purpose of treating patients with schizophrenia. But unlike Schiff's therapy, the patient is only required to attend five two-hour sessions with the therapist instead of living with the therapist. Nurturing is also more intensive and more structured than total regression reparenting. Spot Reparenting Spot reparenting was developed by Russell Osnes. In addition to also being less time intensive than Schiff's total regression reparenting, Osnes's form of reparenting focuses more on patients traumatized by specific experiences and incidents rather than by general disturbances in childhood. Self-Reparenting Self-reparenting was developed by Muriel James. Unlike prior forms of reparenting, James's form of reparenting did not attempt to totally replace the parent ego state of the client. Instead, the therapy confirms the positive aspects already apparent in the client's ego. The client is also the primary agent in therapy instead of the therapist. Del Casale's Method Developed by Del Casale, this form of reparenting, like Wilson's time-limited regression reparenting, focused primarily on treatment for schizophrenic patients. But unlike both Schiff and Wilson, Del Casale proposes that the therapist does not play the role of the parent for the client. Instead, Del Casale had the client's actual parents become an active participator in the therapy. Del Casale bases this model on the belief that some parts of the client's parent ego state is still healthy, and that defective parenting is not at the fault of the parents, but of the weak communication between the parent and child. Efficacy Kline Case Dr. David Kline practiced Schiff's total regression reparenting and was a staff member of the Cathexis Institute. Among his most noted clients was a young girl diagnosed with severe anorexia nervosa. Dr. Kline theorized that the patient's anorexia was due to her mother's strict expectations. Reparenting was then used to counteract the negative influence of the patient's mother's parenting style. According to the patient, the therapy was a success, and she now lives with more confidence in her image as suggested by her therapist's reparenting. Biochemical  Jaqui Lee Schiff conducted a study to attain biochemical evidence for reparenting's effectiveness on schizophrenics. Schiff based this study on the observation that individuals with schizophrenia tend to have low levels of tryptophan reuptake. In the study, 20 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were divided into three groups: a group going through reparenting treatment at the Cathexis Institute, a group going through separate treatment at the Lafayette Institute, and a control group that did not receive reparenting treatment. The results show that the subjects going through reparenting treatment at the Cathexis and Lafayette Institute had a mean tryptophan reuptake of 3.32 and 3.75 respectively. The control group had a group mean of 2.13. The numbers show that subjects that received reparenting had significantly higher tryptophan reuptake at the end of the experiment. Self-Esteem Lilian M. Wissink conducted a study to determine self- reparenting's effect on self-esteem. Human subjects were divided into two groups, a treatment group that consisted of 10 people, and a control group that consisted of 12 people. The sample group was made up of students and staff from a rural university, and only the treatment group went through self- reparenting treatment. The subjects were given questionnaires to measure their level of self-esteem before and after treatment. The result showed that subjects that received self-reparenting had significantly increased levels of self-esteem while the control group had decreased levels of self-esteem. Crime Rehabilitation A psychologist by the name of Gloria Noriega conducted a study to analyze the effects of self-reparenting on female delinquents in jail, who were between the ages of eleven and eighteen. In the study, all of the subjects received exactly the same treatment to support the theory that the effects of self-reparenting can be directly replicated. According to the results, twenty seven of the twenty eight subjects expressed less aggression, fewer conflicts with parents, increased motivation to achieve goals, and increased self-esteem in comparison to how they were before treatment. The subject that didn't show change was a drug abuser and clinicians concluded that more specialized treatment was required. Controversies Terminology and Definitions Although reparenting is widely practiced, there is no set system of terminology among practitioners. In addition, the definitions of commonly used terms differ in definition among practitioners. The vagueness produced by these two weaknesses present danger of miscommunication between the therapist and the patient during treatment. The patient may also not fully understand the information shared with them when contracting or terminating treatment. Therapist-Patient Relationship The nature of reparenting often requires the therapist to develop a close relationship with the client. There is no protocol to provide the boundary as to what the therapist can or cannot do. Often, it is up to the therapist to determine the plan of action to take when faced with a dilemma during treatment. As a result, there is risk of the therapist becoming too extreme in their methods, which can endanger the client and lead to new psychological problems. Due to the dominant role of the therapist in the relationship, the therapist has greater power over the client, which may lead to them abusing this authority and exploiting the client. There is also risk toward the therapist in that he or she may become too attached to the client, which can hinder professional judgement. Frame of Reference There is no way to objectively determine the success in completely replacing the client's parent ego state after reparenting therapy. The therapist can only rely on the client's subjective statement, which may conflict with the therapist's account of the results. This conflicts leads to questioning whether the therapy actually succeeded in reforming the Parent ego state. Monitoring This problem is especially true for total regression reparenting. Clients in therapy are totally immersed in an environment that promotes regression into the child ego state. However, during this time at which the client may spend months or years, the client is left at the mercy of the therapist and the institution. There is no higher authority to monitor the actions of the therapist as well as the well being of the client. The client is left to trust his or her therapist throughout therapy. Scientific Efficacy Although some studies have been done to prove the efficacy of reparenting, the amount of statistically powerful studies available are few. Few studies try to confirm the mechanism or isolate moderating variables of reparenting. The transactional analysis theory in which reparenting theory is based on is already a heavily debated topic. As a result, most of the scientific community gives little support for reparenting theory.

Reaching her destination on 1 May, Osage unloaded trucks and disembarked troops, and after fueling and provisioning sailed from Apra Harbor to return to Saipan, arriving on 4 May, where she launched the remaining vehicles via her stern ramp, and began a period of post-voyage repairs to her main and auxiliary engines. For a little over a month, Osage awaited orders at Saipan, painting ship and conducting inspections and training, after which time she received orders to proceed to Noumea, New Caledonia. Sailing on 6 June, the ship crossed the equator on 10 June at approximately 164º0' E, observing the event with appropriate ceremonies, during which time some 400 \\"pollywogs\\" received initiation into the realm of \\"King Neptune.\\" Arriving at her destination on 15 June 1945 Osage received engine repairs at Nouméa, culminating in trials on 25 June, then embarked the men and loaded the vehicles and equipment of the 47th Naval Construction Battalion, taking departure for Guam on 6 July. Unloaded and ready for sea four days later, she departed Guam on 11 July, and after a brief pause at Saipan to load supplies, pushed on for San Francisco, reaching her destination on 25 July for voyage repairs at the Kaiser yard at Richmond, California. During that period of yard work, that coincided with the cessation of hostilities with Japan, she received repairs to her engines, a drydocking, general repairs, and a revision of her paint scheme from \\"green and black camouflage to over-all gray.\\" She was ultimately reported \\"ready for sea\\" on 22 August. August–October 1945 Five days later, on 27 August 1945, with approximately 1,400 officers and enlisted men (United States Army) embarked, replacements for troops in the forward areas, Osage sailed for Ulithi, in the Western Carolines, arriving there on 10 September where she refueled, then continued her voyage to the Philippines, reaching Tacloban two days later to disembark almost half of her embarked soldiers. Underway for Manila on 14 September, the ship reached her destination two days later to disembark the balance of her passengers. Sailing on 21 September with nine officers and 496 enlisted infantry, field artillery, engineering, signal, quartermaster and chemical warfare division passengers, she reached Batangas later the same day, where she loaded 61 army vehicles. Having completed her work in the Philippines, Osage sailed for Japan in company with the attack cargo ship and attack transport , the trio later joining with Task Group 34.8 to comprise a convoy of 23 ships and two escorts. The ship arrived in Tokyo Bay on 3 October, to discharge her passengers and cargo at Yokohama. Ordered thence to perform \\"Magic Carpet\\" duty, transporting veterans back to the United States, Osage sailed for Okinawa on 7 October. Receiving typhoon warnings while en route, the ship steered courses and speeds designed to evade the bad weather, and stood in to Buckner Bay on 11 October, where she embarked some 75 officers and over 1,600 enlisted men on 13 October for transportation to San Francisco and release from the naval service. She sailed for the west coast the same day. October 1945 – June 1946 Osage arrived at her destination on 26 October 1945 but would soon be underway on a return voyage to the Far East on 10 November. Calling first at Shanghai, China and then Buckner Bay, the ship returned to the West Coast immediately thereafter. Then, following a period of repairs at Portland that ended in mid- January 1946, the ship remained at San Pedro until 1 May, when she sailed for Panama. Although she had been earmarked for conversion to a net cargo ship, she remained a vehicle cargo ship due to the selection of Montauk for the change. After transiting the Panama Canal (9 to 12 May), Osage shed her port propeller on 12 May. She then put into New Orleans (16 May to 9 June), then moved to Mobile for overhaul, the availability of funds dictating when urgent repairs could be accomplished. Decommissioning and sale, 1947–1975 Osage was towed to Orange, Texas by , where she was inactivated and placed out of commission, in reserve on 16 May 1947. Redesignated as a mine warfare command and support ship, MCS-3, effective 18 October 1956, Osage remained in reserve until delivered to the custody of the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Beaumont, Texas on 19 September 1960. Stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 September 1961 the ship was delivered to the Maritime Administration, on permanent transfer, on 1 September 1962. Returned to the Navy for stripping on 8 November 1972 incident to her future disposal, she was returned to the Maritime Administration on 27 November 1973. Sold to Luria Brothers and Company, Inc. of Cleveland, Ohio on 11 December 1974, the ship was delivered to her purchasers on 6 January 1975 to be broken up. Osage received one battle star for service in World War II.

There are several variations (various notions of effective dimension) of which the most common is effective Hausdorff dimension. Dimension, in mathematics, is a particular way of describing the size of an object (contrasting with measure and other, different, notions of size). Hausdorff dimension generalizes the well-known integer dimensions assigned to points, lines, planes, etc. by allowing one to distinguish between objects of intermediate size between these integer-dimensional objects. For example, fractal subsets of the plane may have intermediate dimension between 1 and 2, as they are \\"larger\\" than lines or curves, and yet \\"smaller\\" than filled circles or rectangles. Effective dimension modifies Hausdorff dimension by requiring that objects with small effective dimension be not only small but also locatable (or partially locatable) in a computable sense. As such, objects with large Hausdorff dimension also have large effective dimension, and objects with small effective dimension have small Hausdorff dimension, but an object can have small Hausdorff but large effective dimension. An example is an algorithmically random point on a line, which has Hausdorff dimension 0 (since it is a point) but effective dimension 1 (because, roughly speaking, it can't be effectively localized any better than a small interval, which has Hausdorff dimension 1).  Rigorous definitions  This article will define effective dimension for subsets of Cantor space 2ω; closely related definitions exist for subsets of Euclidean space Rn. We will move freely between considering a set X of natural numbers, the infinite sequence \\\\chi_X given by the characteristic function of X, and the real number with binary expansion 0.X.  Martingales and other gales  A martingale on Cantor space 2ω is a function d: 2ω → R≥ 0 from Cantor space to nonnegative reals which satisfies the fairness condition: : d(\\\\sigma)=\\\\frac12 (d(\\\\sigma 0)+d(\\\\sigma 1)) A martingale is thought of as a betting strategy, and the function d(\\\\sigma) gives the capital of the better after seeing a sequence σ of 0s and 1s. The fairness condition then says that the capital after a sequence σ is the average of the capital after seeing σ0 and σ1; in other words the martingale gives a betting scheme for a bookie with 2:1 odds offered on either of two \\"equally likely\\" options, hence the name fair. (Note that this is subtly different from the probability theory notion of martingale. That definition of martingale has a similar fairness condition, which also states that the expected value after some observation is the same as the value before the observation, given the prior history of observations. The difference is that in probability theory, the prior history of observations just refers to the capital history, whereas here the history refers to the exact sequence of 0s and 1s in the string.) A supermartingale on Cantor space is a function d as above which satisfies a modified fairness condition: : d(\\\\sigma) \\\\geq \\\\frac12 (d(\\\\sigma 0)+d(\\\\sigma 1)) A supermartingale is a betting strategy where the expected capital after a bet is no more than the capital before a bet, in contrast to a martingale where the two are always equal. This allows more flexibility, and is very similar in the non-effective case, since whenever a supermartingale d is given, there is a modified function d' which wins at least as much money as d and which is actually a martingale. However it is useful to allow the additional flexibility once one starts talking about actually giving algorithms to determine the betting strategy, as some algorithms lend themselves more naturally to producing supermartingales than martingales. An s-gale is a function d as above of the form : d(\\\\sigma) = \\\\frac{e(\\\\sigma)}{2^{(1-s)\\\\sigma}} for e some martingale. An s-supergale is a function d as above of the form : d(\\\\sigma) = \\\\frac{e(\\\\sigma)}{2^{(1-s)\\\\sigma}} for e some supermartingale. An s-(super)gale is a betting strategy where some amount of capital is lost to inflation at each step. Note that s-gales and s-supergales are examples of supermartingales, and the 1-gales and 1-supergales are precisely the martingales and supermartingales. Collectively, these objects are known as \\"gales\\". A gale d succeeds on a subset X of the natural numbers if \\\\limsup_n d(Xn)=\\\\infty where Xn denotes the n-digit string consisting of the first n digits of X. A gale d succeeds strongly on X if \\\\liminf_n d(Xn)=\\\\infty. All of these notions of various gales have no effective content, but one must necessarily restrict oneself to a small class of gales, since some gale can be found which succeeds on any given set. After all, if one knows a sequence of coin flips in advance, it is easy to make money by simply betting on the known outcomes of each flip. A standard way of doing this is to require the gales to be either computable or close to computable: A gale d is called constructive, c.e., or lower semi-computable if the numbers d(\\\\sigma) are uniformly left-c.e. reals (i.e. can uniformly be written as the limit of an increasing computable sequence of rationals). The effective Hausdorff dimension of a set of natural numbers X is \\\\inf \\\\\\\\{s : \\\\mathrm{some\\\\ c.e.}\\\\ s\\\\mathrm{-gale\\\\ succeeds\\\\ on\\\\ } X \\\\\\\\}. The effective packing dimension of X is \\\\inf \\\\\\\\{s : \\\\mathrm{some\\\\ c.e.}\\\\ s\\\\mathrm{-gale\\\\ succeeds\\\\ strongly\\\\ on\\\\ } X\\\\\\\\}.  Kolmogorov complexity definition  Kolmogorov complexity can be thought of as a lower bound on the algorithmic compressibility of a finite sequence (of characters or binary digits). It assigns to each such sequence w a natural number K(w) that, intuitively, measures the minimum length of a computer program (written in some fixed programming language) that takes no input and will output w when run. The effective Hausdorff dimension of a set of natural numbers X is \\\\liminf_n \\\\frac{K(Xn)}n. The effective packing dimension of a set X is \\\\limsup_n \\\\frac{K(Xn)}n. From this one can see that both the effective Hausdorff dimension and the effective packing dimension of a set are between 0 and 1, with the effective packing dimension always at least as large as the effective Hausdorff dimension. Every random sequence will have effective Hausdorff and packing dimensions equal to 1, although there are also nonrandom sequences with effective Hausdorff and packing dimensions of 1.  Comparison to classical dimension  If Z is a subset of 2ω, its Hausdorff dimension is \\\\inf \\\\\\\\{s : \\\\mathrm{some}\\\\ s\\\\mathrm{-gale\\\\ succeeds\\\\ on\\\\ all\\\\ elements\\\\ of\\\\ } Z \\\\\\\\}. The packing dimension of Z is \\\\inf \\\\\\\\{s : \\\\mathrm{some}\\\\ s\\\\mathrm{-gale\\\\ succeeds\\\\ strongly\\\\ on\\\\ all\\\\ elements\\\\ of\\\\ } Z \\\\\\\\}. Thus the effective Hausdorff and packing dimensions of a set X are simply the classical Hausdorff and packing dimensions of \\\\\\\\{X\\\\\\\\} (respectively) when we restrict our attention to c.e. gales. Define the following: :H_{\\\\beta} := \\\\\\\\{X \\\\in 2^\\\\omega : X\\\\ \\\\mathrm{has\\\\ effective\\\\ Hausdorff\\\\ dimension\\\\ } \\\\beta \\\\\\\\} :H_{\\\\leq \\\\beta} := \\\\\\\\{X \\\\in 2^\\\\omega : X\\\\ \\\\mathrm{has\\\\ effective\\\\ Hausdorff\\\\ dimension\\\\ } \\\\leq \\\\beta \\\\\\\\} :H_{< \\\\beta} := \\\\\\\\{X \\\\in 2^\\\\omega : X\\\\ \\\\mathrm{has\\\\ effective\\\\ Hausdorff\\\\ dimension\\\\ } < \\\\beta \\\\\\\\} :P_{\\\\beta} := \\\\\\\\{X \\\\in 2^\\\\omega : X\\\\ \\\\mathrm{has\\\\ effective\\\\ packing\\\\ dimension\\\\ } \\\\beta \\\\\\\\} :P_{\\\\leq \\\\beta} := \\\\\\\\{X \\\\in 2^\\\\omega : X\\\\ \\\\mathrm{has\\\\ effective\\\\ packing\\\\ dimension\\\\ } \\\\leq \\\\beta \\\\\\\\} :P_{< \\\\beta} := \\\\\\\\{X \\\\in 2^\\\\omega : X\\\\ \\\\mathrm{has\\\\ effective\\\\ packing\\\\ dimension\\\\ } < \\\\beta \\\\\\\\} A consequence of the above is that these all have Hausdorff dimension \\\\beta. H_{\\\\beta}, H_{\\\\leq \\\\beta} and H_{< \\\\beta} all have packing dimension 1. P_{\\\\beta}, P_{\\\\leq \\\\beta} and P_{< \\\\beta} all have packing dimension \\\\beta.

It was named after Weldon Fader DeLong, who was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his action at Guadalcanal. During World War II DeLong served primarily as a training ship for officers and men that were about to embark on ships assigned to anti-submarine warfare (ASW) duties. In early 1946 DeLong was decommissioned and assigned to the Reserve Fleet at Green Cove Springs, Florida. Following the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, DeLong was reactivated and on 7 February 1951 was again commissioned. After a short training period DeLong was assigned to Escort Squadron Eight, Destroyer Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. During this period of service DeLong participated in several Fleet Exercises and Midshipmen Cruises. In addition to routine fleet support missions, DeLong often served as a training ship for the Fleet Sonar School, Key West, Florida. On 3 January 1958, DeLong was assigned Group II status, joining the newly formed Reserve ASW Program in the 3d Naval District. During the Berlin Crisis of 1960–1961, DeLong was assigned to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet as part of Escort Squadron 18 and homeported in Newport, Rhode Island. During this period DeLong operated extensively in the Caribbean area. On 1 August 1961, DeLong resumed her Group II status, operating under Commander, Naval Reserve Destroyer Division, 3d Naval District. Stationed at Fort Schuyler Naval Reserve base located in the Bronx, New York, 10465.

He currently fronts Reigning Sound and is signed to Merge Records. After moving away from Memphis in the mid-2000s, he has since lived with his family in Asheville, North Carolina. Cartwright is also a founding member of the Memphis '90s garage bands The Compulsive Gamblers, The Oblivians and Greg Oblivian & the Tip Tops. As of 2019, Cartwright has reformed his past band Greg Oblivian & the Tip Tops and is playing shows. Aside from also playing occasional solo performances (including one that led to his solo record \\"Live at Circle A\\"), Cartwright also plays in The Parting Gifts, a band also featuring Lindsay \\"CoCo\\" Hames of The Ettes and Patrick Keeler of The Raconteurs and The Greenhornes, and a guest appearance from Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys. The band's debut album, \\"Strychnine Dandelion,\\" was released in September 2010 on In the Red Records. Cartwright has also played in a handful of other bands, including guitarist in The Detroit Cobras and as drummer for '68 Comeback. He has also collaborated with The Deadly Snakes, contributing to their album I'm Not Your Soldier Anymore. In 2007 he wrote songs and co-produced \\"Dangerous Game,\\" a comeback album by Mary Weiss of The Shangri-Las. Early years Born in 1972, Cartwright was raised in Frayser, Memphis – a neighborhood located on the north side of Memphis. His last two years of high school were spent in the suburbs after his family relocated outside of the city. His father was a factory worker, employed by the Firestone tire company in Memphis. With his parent's busy work schedule, Cartwright spent his summer vacations and weekends at his grandmother's Memphis home. This is where he was first introduced to musical instruments. At six years old, Cartwright already owned a portable record player, and was introduced to rock and roll music by his father's record collection, which included a huge catalog of British Invasion albums and other '50s and '60s rock bands. Around this time he also inherited his aunt and uncle's 45rpm collections, which according to Cartwright, included a lot of \\"oddball Memphis stuff you wouldn't hear on the radio.\\" After becoming exposed to music, Cartwright began writing songs and forming bands as early as seventh grade. By his teens, Cartwright was becoming drawn to other, more abrasive and on-the- fringe genres of music. He also began going to punk rock shows at the Antenna Club, a now defunct Memphis music venue. At the Antenna is where he first saw a Tav Falco's Panther Burns show when he was 16 years old. Panther Burns is fronted by Tav Falco, a '50s-style Memphis rocker who blends blues with rockabilly and soul music – a mix that most touring punk bands were not playing in the 1980s. That show nudged him in the direction that would ultimately lead him toward the garage-punk, soul and country sound he is known for. Cartwright recalled that Tav Falco show in a 2009 interview with Turn it Down Interviews. \\"It instantly clicked with me,\\" Cartwright said. \\"Although it was chaotic, there was definitely a wild, almost punk element about Tav Falco & Panther Burns. Tav was into all the kind of stuff that really turned me on. That was Tav's thing – blues, rockabilly, country, odd R&B.; Suddenly I thought I’ve been wasting my time trying to like hardcore punk and here's this thing that was in my own backyard that I was totally unaware of. From there on I started looking for more bands like that. Then you get into The Cramps and all of these other things that kind of ride that line, that are really good, gritty rock‘n’roll, but are also on the outside of culture, like punk. So that was a real eye opener. I continued to hunt records in thrift stores and junk shops.\\" After that show, Cartwright would begin heavily collecting rare garage, country, soul and doo-wop records – and also formed a few high school bands. It was at that point his style began to take shape. Shortly after finishing high school he would meet Jack Yarber and form his first notable band, The Compulsive Gamblers. Cartwright and Yarber would also form The Oblivians in 1993, along with another Memphis musician, Eric Friedl, who now owns Goner Records. Compulsive Gamblers Cartwright started taking his music more seriously in the late '80s when he formed the Memphis garage-rock outfit \\"The Painkillers.\\" Fellow Memphis native Jack Yarber was the other key figure in the band. After the addition of keyboardist Philip \\"Flipper\\" Tubb, drummer Rod \\"Bushrod\\" Thomas, and fiddler Greg Easterly, the new lineup was rechristened \\"The Compulsive Gamblers\\" and work began on their first four-song EP, Joker, which was recorded in 1991 in a friend's kitchen. The album was released a year later, and was followed by two further vinyl singles, \\"Church Goin'\\" and \\"Goodtime Gamblers.\\" By 1995, after the relocation of Thomas and Easterly to New Orleans, the band was finding it difficult to stay together and was forced to split up. Their recordings were compiled on CD under the title Gambling Days are Over, released in 1995 by Sympathy for the Record Industry. During the summer and fall of 2009 The Compulsive Gamblers played two reunion shows in Memphis, TN. One show was an Antenna Club Reunion Show (a tribute to the defunct Memphis rock venue). The other show was at GonerFest 6, an annual punk rock festival hosted by Goner Records. Oblivians Cartwright's next band, again with Yarber, and with the addition of Eric Friedl, was the garage-rock outfit, The Oblivians. Formed in 1993 out of the ashes of the Compulsive Gamblers, the Oblivians took a more primitive, punk- influenced approach to rock and roll. Each member served as singer, guitarist, and drummer, switching between instruments and vocal duties during performances. In 1995 the band released its first album, Soul Food. This was followed in 1996 by Sympathy Sessions, a compilation album featuring a collection of songs recorded with Doug Easley for the record label Sympathy for the Record Industry. The Oblivians released their second album, Popular Favorites, in 1996, and their third and final album, ...Play 9 Songs with Mr Quintron, in 1997. In 2009, The Oblivians reunited for a European tour with The Gories. The bands kicked off the tour in their hometowns, Memphis and Detroit, they also played at the VICE Garage Fest in Lawrence Kansas in Oct 2010. Greg Oblivian and the Tip Tops During the breakup of the Oblivians in 1997, Cartwright released 1997's \\"Head Shop\\" LP under the moniker Greg Oblivian & the Tip Tops. The album, which featured Cartwright's wife Esther on drums and guest spots by Jack Yarber, is a lo-fi record that featured the first, more mellow version of The Oblivians fan-favorite \\"Bad Man.\\" The song \\"Twice as Deep\\" is featured in the cult zombie film Wild Zero. Reformation of the Gamblers In 1999, Cartwright and Yarber reformed the Compulsive Gamblers, this time as a three piece, with Rod Thomas on drums. In this incarnation they released the 1999 album Bluff City. With the addition of keyboardist Brendan Lee Spengler and bassist Jeff Meier, the group released the studio album Crystal Gazing Luck Amazing and the live album Live & Deadly: Memphis-Chicago before again disbanding. The band also reunited for two shows in Memphis, TN during the summer and fall of 2009. Reigning Sound While still a member of the Oblivians, Cartwright had begun to amass a number of songs he deemed too moody or melancholy to be released under the Oblivians moniker. These songs would eventually become the basis for his next band, Reigning Sound, a more R&B-focused; act. The original version of the band consisted of Cartwright, Alex Greene (guitar/keyboards, vocals), Jeremy Scott (bass, vocals), and Greg Roberson (drums). With Reigning Sound, Cartwright released the 2001 album, Break Up, Break Down and the 2002 album Time Bomb High School. In 2004, Reigning Sound released Too Much Guitar, an album recorded live at Cartwright's Memphis record store Legba Records, which harkened back to Cartwright's earlier, harsher Oblivians sound. 2005 saw the release of three non-studio albums. There were two live albums: \\"Live at Maxwells\\" (Spoonful) and \\"Live at Goner Records\\" (Goner). The other release was an outtakes compilation, Home For Orphans (Sympathy) – which has two slower, moodier versions of tracks from Too Much Guitar. In 2007 he co- produced and wrote nine out of 14 songs for \\"Dangerous Game\\" – an album by Mary Weiss of the '60s girl-group the Shangri-Las. It was released by Norton Records. Reigning Sound released Love and Curses (In the Red Records) on August 10, 2009. This was the first studio album featuring the new lineup of members, and was mainly recorded in Asheville, NC. In 2010 Reigning Sound contributed a cover of \\"Mind Over Matter\\" for the Daddy Rockin Strong: A Tribute to Nolan Strong & The Diablos (The Wind Records / Norton Records). Cartwright, a Nolan Strong fan, previously covered \\"I Want to Be Your Happiness,\\" another Strong cover, on The Compulsive Gamblers \\"Crystal, Gazing, Luck, Amazing\\" LP. Cartwright, along with CoCo Hames of The Ettes, collaborated and formed The Parting Gifts. The band shares songwriting duties and recorded an album, \\"Strychnine Dandelion\\" (In the Red Recordings). The band's debut single, \\"Walking Thru The Sleepy City,\\" a Rolling Stones cover, was released in October 2010 by Norton Records. Solo performances Cartwright began playing periodic solo performances at venues around 2003. A 2006 performance at the Circle A, a small club in Milwaukee, was recorded and released by Dusty Medical Records in 2009 as Greg Cartwright: \\"Live at the Circle A\\". The album, like many of his performances, features songs from each of Cartwright's bands, and some cover songs. The album came about by chance after Cartwright was already in Milwaukee recording an album for The Goodnight Loving. The vinyl album, which is also available for digital download came accompanied with a free vinyl 7-inch, featuring The Goodnight Loving acting as Cartwright's backing band. Producer Cartwright has acted as producer for a number of bands since his solo career began. He has produced albums by The Ettes, Mary Weiss, Mr. Airplane Man, Porch Ghouls, The Cuts, Detroit Cobras, The Horrors, The Deadly Snakes, Goodnight Loving, and Andre Williams. Legba records For a time, Cartwright was the owner of Legba Records, an independent music store in the Cooper-Young District of Memphis. Legba records served as a makeshift studio for the recording of the Reigning Sound's album, Too Much Guitar. When Cartwright relocated to Asheville, North Carolina, Legba records changed hands and became a Goner Records store, home to the independent record label of former Oblivians bandmate Eric Friedl.

He was the launch controller of BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2 in 1967, and the controller of BBC2 television from 1969 to 1974. Early career Born Robin Hugh Scutt, he was educated at Bryanston School and read modern languages at Jesus College, Cambridge before joining the Intelligence Corps. He was discharged through illness in 1942, and joined the BBC. While in the BBC's French Service he commented on major events, including VE Day and VJ Day. During this time he changed his name to Scott, because his French contacts found his original name difficult to say. He moved into television in the late 1950s, and produced programmes including Miss World, Come Dancing and It's a Knockout. During this time he wrote the song \\"Softly, Softly\\", a British number one hit for Ruby Murray. Scott moved to the BBC Paris bureau in 1958, and was seconded to Trans-Europe Television between 1964 and 1966. Controller of Radio He was appointed Controller of the Light Programme in March 1967, and devised a format for the corporation's new popular music station. His vision deliberately echoed the pirate radio broadcasters that would be outlawed by the Marine Broadcast Offences Act in August 1967. The new pop station, BBC Radio 1, launched on 30 September 1967, with a signature tune commissioned by Scott, Theme One, recorded by George Martin. He was also Controller of BBC Radio 2, the successor to the Light Programme. He was succeeded as Controller of Radio 2 and Radio 1 by Douglas Muggeridge. Controller of BBC2 Scott was appointed Controller of BBC2 television in 1968, succeeding David Attenborough. During his five years in the post, his aim was to secure 15% of the overall viewing audience by balancing highbrow and populist programming. To achieve this aim, he commissioned such memorable programmes as Elizabeth R, The Pallisers, an adaptation of War and Peace, and documentary series including Alistair Cooke's America and Dr. Jacob Bronowski's The Ascent of Man. Later career In 1974, Scott was made the head of the forward-planning department Development in Television, a remit that included the prospect of satellite broadcasting. He later became the Deputy Managing Director of Television, the second-most senior post in television. After he retired from the BBC in October 1980, he was part of an unsuccessful submission to broadcast breakfast television on ITV. He subsequently joined the board of London Weekend Television, and produced television versions of opera and ballet productions for the National Video Corporation. He was appointed CBE in 1976.

It was the first recording in which Brown collaborated with a performer associated with hip hop, a then-new idiom heavily influenced by Brown's own funk music. The record's title and its cover showing the two performers clasping hands express solidarity between the two styles. The song's music is similar in its structure to Brown's own funk songs of the late 1960s and 1970s, but uses the drum machine and keyboard-generated timbres of electro. The song's rapped lyrics are on the themes of \\"Peace, unity, love, and having fun\\". The single charted #87 R&B.;White, Cliff (1991). \\"Discography\\". In Star Time (pp. 54–59) [CD booklet].

A videotape was shot of the vocal recordings of the song in Studio A at Unique Recording Studios, NYC. The tape was given to Fred Seibert and Alan Goodman of Fred/Alan Inc. to make into an inexpensive music video. The team worked with their in- house producer/director Tom Pomposello and creative director Marcy Brafman and Peter Caesar to create the video. The video entered rotation on MTV in mid- October 1984.

TowCommand has since been added to the full-size Ford F-150 pickup and the full-size Ford Expedition SUV. It is built and engineered jointly with Tekonsha who are known for their Prodigy TBC. With adjustable +/- trailer braking gain in a digital readout from 0.0 (no trailer brakes) to 10.0 (full trailer braking) in 0.5 increments and a manual override lever (to test trailer braking action), the Ford 'built into the dash' TBC provides smooth braking even when pulling up to a 15,000 lb 4-axle conventional (receiver mounted) or 26,000 lb 4-axle 5th Wheel (bed/frame mounted) trailer. TowCommand being different from most aftermarket TBCs, ties into the trucks' computer and hydraulics, so it senses truck brake pressure and can apply trailer brakes as fast as the truck's brakes. Master Brake Systems 'BrakeSmart' TBC is the only other TBC that taps into the trucks hydraulic lines in modern trucks. The TowCommand TBC is made of three major components; the in-dash TBC module, a TowCommand master cylinder with a brake pressure transducer, and an activated PCM (Powertrain Control Module) parameter by a Ford dealer's NGS or WDS programming method. All 2005 and newer Ford Super Duty trucks are pre-wired for the TBC from the factory, no matter if the TBC option was ordered and installed at the time of the trucks assembly or not. Before ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) came to trucks in the 1980s, most TBCs were activated by the trucks' brake hydraulic action. In an emergency situation with the trucks ABS activated, Ford's TowCommand can automatically reduce the trailer brake pressure (gain) as it communicates with the truck's computer for faster reaction time with proportional trailer brake control, to prevent the trailer brakes from locking up even though trailers do not have ABS sensors. TowCommand will also inform the driver with an audible alarm and in the digital readout if the trailer wires and/or trailer disconnects from the truck. Next to the TowCommand is an empty storage tray or the $85 optional 4 AUX (auxiliary) toggle switches for winches, snow plow, off-road lights, etc. The only disadvantage, unlike aftermarket TBCs, is that it cannot be transferred from one truck to another. Another advantage, unlike aftermarket TBCs, any Ford service center can have it serviced. The TowCommand is covered by the standard bumper-to-bumper warranty as long as it is not discovered to be an actual trailer problem. The TowCommand has only been verified to be compatible with trailers having electric-actuated drum brakes (one to four axles) and not hydraulic surge or electric-over-hydraulic types.

It is a membrane protein that is commonly known as chlase (, CLH) and systematically known as chlorophyll chlorophyllidohydrolase. Chlorophyllase can be found in the chloroplast, thylakoid membrane and etioplast of at least higher plants such as ferns, mosses, brown and red algae and diatoms. Chlase is the catalyst for the hydrolysis of chlorophyll to produce chlorophyllide (also called Chlide) and phytol. It is also known to function in the esterification of Chlide and transesterification. The enzyme functions optimally at pH 8.5 and 50 °C. Role of chlorophyllase in chlorophyll breakdown Of high importance to all photosynthetic organisms is chlorophyll, and so, its synthesis and breakdown are closely regulated throughout the entire life cycle of the plant. Chlorophyll breakdown is most evident in seasonal changes as the plants lose their green color in the autumn; it is also evident in fruit ripening, leaf senescence and flowering. In this first step, chlorophyllase initiates the catabolism of chlorophyll to form chlorophyllide. Chlorophyll degradation occurs in the turnover of chlorophyll, as well as in the event of cell death caused by injuries, pathogenic attack, and other external factors. Chlorophyllase’s role is two-fold as it functions in both de-greening processes, such as autumnal coloration, and is also thought to be involved in turnover and homeostasis of chlorophylls. Chlorophyllase catalysis of the initial step of chlorophyll breakdown is important for plant development and survival. The breakdown serves as a prerequisite in the detoxification of the potentially phototoxic chlorophyll and chlorophyll intermediates as it accompanies leaf senescence to non-fluorescent catabolites. Rapid degradation of chlorophyll and its intermediates is therefore necessary to prevent cell damage due to the potential phototoxicity of chlorophyll. Reaction and mechanism catalyzed by chlorophyllase Chlorophyllase catalyzes the hydrolysis of ester bond to yield chlorophyllide and phytol. It reacts via transesterification or hydrolysis of a carboxylic ester in which its natural substrates are 13-OH-chlorophyll a, bacteriochlorophyll and chlorophyll a. Hydrolysis of chlorophyll starts with the attack of a carbonyl group of chlorophyll by the oxygen of the hydroxyl group of the crucial serine residue of the chlorophyllase. This attack forms a tetrahedral transition state. The double bond of the attacked carbonyl reforms and the serine is then esterified to chlorophyllide. The phytol group consequently leaves the compound and replaces the serine residue on the chlorophyllase enzyme. The addition of water to the reaction cleaves the phytol off the enzyme. Next, through the reverse reaction, the oxygen on the hydroxy group from the water in the previous step attacks the carbonyl of the intermediate in order to form another tetrahedral transition state. The double bond of the carbonyl forms again and the serine residue returns to chlorophyllase and the ester of the chlorophyll is now a carboxylic acid. This product is chlorophyllide. Chlorophyllide is then broken down to Pheophorbide A. After Pheophorbide a is formed, the poryphin ring is cleaved by Pheophorbide an oxide to form RCC causing the plant to lose its green color. RCC is then broken down into pFCC. Regulation Posttranslational Regulation Citrus sinesis and Chenopodium album were the first plants from which the genes encoding chlorophyllase were isolated. These experiments revealed an uncharacteristic encoded sequence (21 amino acids in Citrus sinensis and 30 amino acids in Chenopodium album) located on the N-terminal that was absent from the mature protein. The chlorophyllase enzyme is a smart choice as the rate limiting enzyme of the catabolic pathway since degreening and the expression of chlorophyllase is induced in ethylene-treated Citrus. Recent data, however, suggests that chlorophyllase is expressed at low levels during natural fruit development, when chlorophyll catabolism usually takes place. Also, some data suggests that chlorophyllase activity is not consistent with degreening during natural senescence. Finally, there is evidence that chlorophyllase has been found in the inner envelope membrane of chloroplast where it does not come in contact with chlorophyll. Recent studies inspired by inconsistent data revealed that chlorophyllase in Citrus lacking the 21 amino sequence on the N-terminal results in extensive chlorophyll breakdown and the degreening effect that should occur in vivo. This cleavage occurs in the chloroplast membrane fraction. Both the full chlorophyllase and the cleaved, mature chlorophyllase, however, experienced similar levels of activity in an in vitro assay. This data suggests that the mature protein comes in contact with its substrate more readily because of the N-terminal sequence and some natural regulation occurs that directly affects enzyme activity. Another possibility is that the suborganelle compartments breaking down allowing a greater amount of enzyme activity. Other forms of regulation Chlorophyllide, the product of the reaction catalyzed by chlorophyllase, spontaneously combines with plant lipids such as phosphatidylcholine liposomes along with sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol. These two lipids cooperatively inhibit the activity of chlorophyllase, but this inhibition can be reversed by the presence of Mg++, a divalent cation. The activity of chlorophyllase also depends on the pH and ionic content of the medium. The values of kcat and kcat/Km of chlorophyllase in the presence of chlorophyll showed pKa values of 6.3 and 6.7, respectively. Temperature also affects chlorophyllase activity. Wheat chlorophyllase is active from 25 to 75 °C. The enzyme is inactivated at temperatures above 85 °C. Wheat chlorophyllase is stable 20 °C higher than other chlorophyllases. These other chlorophyllases can stay active at temperatures up to 55 °C. Ethylene induces the synthesis of chlorophyllase and promotes the degreening of citrus fruits. Chlorophyllase was detected in protein extracts of ethylene treated fruit. Ethylene treated fruits had chlorophyllase activity increased by 5 fold in 24 hours. Ethylene, more specifically, induces increased rates of transcription of the chlorophyllase gene. There is also evidence of a highly conserved serine lipase domain in the chlorophyllase enzyme that contains a serine residue that is essential for enzyme activity. Histidne and aspartic acid residues are also a part of the catalytic triad of chlorophyllase as a serine hydrolase. Specific inhibitors for the serine hydrolase mechanism, therefore, effectively inhibit the chlorophyllase enzyme. Also, mutations at these specific amino acid residues causes complete loss of function since the mutations change the catalytic site of the chlorophyllase enzyme.

Williams is the all-time winningest coach at UC Santa Barbara with a 19-year record of 313–260.  Coaching career  Prior to his arrival at UCSB, Williams spent eight years at UC Davis. His UC Davis teams recorded 20 or more wins five times and had an eight-year record of 158–76 record. In Williams’ final season at UC Davis, the Aggies went 31–2, won the NCAA Division II National Championship. Williams was named NABC Division II Coach of the Year. Williams took over a UCSB program that had not recorded a winning season in five years. In 1998–99, the Gauchos won 15 games and won the West division of the Big West. The 2002 Gauchos won the school’s first Big West Tournament title, advancing to the NCAA Tournament. In 2003, they won the league’s regular season title and played in the NIT. In 2007–08, UCSB set the all time school record for most wins in a season with 23. They won the Big West regular season title for a second time and received a bid to the 2008 NIT. The 2009–10 season marked the fourth Big West Regular Season title captured during Williams' tenure at UCSB. It also was the first time in the basketball program's history that the Gauchos won both the Big West Regular Season and Big West Tournament championships in the same year. Williams was also awarded the 2010 Big West Coach of the Year Award, his third. It marked the school's second trip to the NCAA Tournament under Williams. On Feb. 5, 2011, he recorded his 400th career win when his team defeated UC Davis. The 2011 team also garnered their second consecutive NCAA Tournament bid. Williams became UCSB’s all-time leader in coaching victories when, on January 2, 2012, his team defeated Cal Poly. The 2015–16 Gauchos were invited to play at the inaugural Vegas 16 at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The postseason bid was the eighth for the program under Williams and a victory over Northern Illinois in the first round was its first postseason win since 1990. Following a disappointing 2016–17 season, Williams was informed that he would not return as head coach after 19 years with the school.

Seattle Seahawks After going undrafted, Lulay signed with the Seattle Seahawks on May 1, 2006, but was released during final cuts in September. He was re-signed by the Seahawks on January 4, 2007, and was assigned to the Berlin Thunder of NFL Europa. He was waived on April 8, 2008. New Orleans Saints On May 14, 2008, Lulay signed with the New Orleans Saints. He was waived on July 18. Seattle Seahawks (II) On October 10, 2008, the Seattle Seahawks re-signed Lulay to their practice squad. He was released again on December 3, 2008. BC Lions 2010 home opener.thumbright Lulay signed with the BC Lions on May 20, 2009, and impressed the coaching staff enough in training camp to insert him in the second pre-season game for three series, where he completed 8 of 10 passes for 140 yards with one touchdown and one interception. He saw limited action in the regular season as the Lions used a total of five different quarterbacks due to injuries. In 2010, Lulay made his first professional start in the fourth game of the season against Toronto following injuries to starter Casey Printers and was expected to lead the Lions until Printers was ready to make his return to the lineup. However, Lulay was replaced by Jarious Jackson during the fourth quarter of the August 7th game against Calgary and also started the following game against Saskatchewan. Printers returned for the next game and won three out of the five games he started, but due to his turnover-filled back-to-back performances, he was replaced with Lulay as the starter in Game 13 against Winnipeg, which the Lions won. After Lulay had a minor injury in the following game, again against Winnipeg, Printers came into the game to protect a 21-point lead. The Blue Bombers stormed back to tie the game and force overtime, which was decided by Printers' game-clinching interception. It was Casey's last game with the Lions as Buono released him soon after the game. Consequently, Lulay became the undisputed starting quarterback, finishing the season 4–5 as a starter. 2011 season home gamethumbleft The Lions got off to a slow start, losing their first five games of the season and falling into last place in the league. The Lions stopped their five-game losing skid in week 6, defeating the Saskatchewan Roughriders, 24–11. In the following game against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers Travis Lulay struggled and was replaced in the third quarter by Jarious Jackson. Following the loss to the Bombers, the Lions then went on to win eight games in a row, as not only Lulay but the team as a whole played much better football. Lulay earned CFL Offensive Player of the Week Honours during weeks 10 and 18 and earned CFL Offensive Player of the Month for October. The Lions won the final two games of the regular season to finish with a record of 11–7, but more importantly they earned 1st place in the Western Conference. Lulay was named the 2011 CFL's Most Outstanding Player. In the Western Conference Finals game, Lulay threw for almost 300 yards as the Lions disposed of the Edmonton Eskimos and advanced to the Grey Cup Final which was held in BC Place. On November 28, 2011, Lulay and the BC Lions defeated the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in front of over 50,000 fans. Lulay threw for 320 yards and two touchdowns and was named the Grey Cup Most Valuable Player. In 2012, Lulay had another strong season, leading the Lions to another first-place finish and a berth in the West Final. Despite playing in just 16 games, he set career highs for completions, completion percentage and passer rating. Lulay also spent much of the season chasing history, as he was approaching the record for most consecutive games played with at least one touchdown pass. In the 15th game of the season, he extended the streak to 26 games, but injured his shoulder and did not play in the next game. Because he dressed in the game, by CFL rules, the streak ended. However, the CFL amended the rules and declared the streak intact since he did not play in the next two games.Lions' Travis Lulay's touchdown passing streak declared intact Lulay played in the last game of the season, but only for 18 minutes, and did not throw for a touchdown, ending his streak at 26 games, second only to Sam Etcheverry's 34.Defence rules as Lions shut down Riders in finale Lulay was named the CFL's offensive player of the week for week 12 and the offensive player of the month for September. For the second consecutive season, he was the Lions' nominee for the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award. The Lions' hopes of repeating as Grey Cup champions ended in the West Final where they lost to the Calgary Stampeders. Lulay completed 33 of 46 passes for 274 yards and one touchdown, but it was not enough as the Lions lost, 34–29. In January 2013, it was reported that Lulay signed a two-year contract extension worth a reported $450,000 per season. In Week 12 of the 2013 regular season Lulay suffered an injury to his throwing shoulder when he impacted Alouettes defensive back Geoff Tisdale on a 19-yard rushing touchdown. The touchdown put the Lions up 29–7 with less than 9 minutes in the fourth quarter. The Lions ultimately won the game and opened the season with a record of 7–4. Lulay missed the next six games for the Lions; in that span they went 3–3. He returned to action in the last regular season game of 2013, but he only played for a limited amount of time, attempting only 4 passes, completing 3 of them for 54 yards. The Lions qualified for the playoffs as the 3rd seed in the West Division with a record of 11–7. Lulay started the playoff game against the Roughriders. He completed 20 of 26 pass attempts for 211 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. He also ran the ball 5 times for 60 yards. Nonetheless, the Lions were defeated by Saskatchewan 29–25, thus ending their 2013 season. In November 2013 Lulay underwent shoulder surgery to repair the damage done from his September injury. Lulay missed the first half of the 2014 CFL season while he rehabilitated his throwing shoulder. During that time Kevin Glenn led the Lions to a record of 5–4. After playing briefly in Week 9, Lulay returned to start for BC in Week 11, following their first bye week. Lulay completed 18 of 27 passes for 167 yards in a game dominated by the defense, but left with just under a minute to go in regular, his shoulder causing him extreme discomfort, 357 days since his last start. Lulay would not return to the field for the remainder of the 2014 season. Lulay was again injured in Week 11 of the 2015 CFL season; suffering a torn MCL in the game against the Montreal Alouettes. Due to the emergence of rookie quarterback Jonathon Jennings during his absence, Lulay became the backup quarterback when he returned from injury. On February 8, 2016, Lulay resigned with the Lions on a two-year contract. Lulay spent the 2016 CFL season as the Lions' backup quarterback, behind Jennings. On July 15, 2017, during a Week 4 match against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Lulay set a new CFL record for most passing yards when coming off the bench. He threw 436 passing yards (a career-high) after replacing Jennings who left the game due to injury, helping the Lions win the game 41–26. Lulay started the next three games for the Lions, winning two of them, before a suffering a minor shoulder injury, which coincided with Jonathon Jennings' return to health in Week 8. Nevertheless, Jennings struggled in the next three games, resulting in Lulay being forced into action in all three matches (all of which were losses). With Lulay having greatly outplayed Jennings head coach Wally Buono announced Lulay as the starter for the team's Week 12 match against Montreal. However, Lulay suffered a non-contact injury to his knee early in the game and did not return. On September 12, 2017, the Lions announced that Lulay would miss the remainder of the season with a torn ACL, which required surgery and minor damage to his MCL, which did not require surgery. On February 12, 2018, one day before the start of free agency, Lulay and the Lions agreed to a one-year contract extension. On July 13, 2018, the Lions announced that Lulay would be the team's starting quarterback in their Week 5 match against the Blue Bombers. Incumbent starting quarterback Jonathon Jennings, who struggled in 2017, continued his poor play into the early weeks of the 2018 season. Lulay started and finished the following six games for the Lions, winning twice. He suffered a concussion in Week 13 against the Redblacks. Then the following week was knocked out of the contest in the first quarter after suffering a separated shoulder. In the days following the Lions announced they expected Lulay to miss four to six weeks recovering. The Lions revealed that Lulay would return from injury in time for the team's Week 18 match against the Calgary Stampeders. In the off-season the Lions brought in All-Star Mike Reilly to be the starting quarterback. As a free agent Lulay received multiple offers from other teams looking to sign him to a contract, however on February 28, 2019, he ultimately decided it was time to retire from professional sports.

Plot summary A lonely boy grows up just outside Brighton in a caravan park with his over-sexual mother and the tenant Mr Broadhurst, who takes the boy on a disturbing and often violent journey. The novel works as a strange Bildungsroman, in which the main character, Ian Wharton, learns the art of black magic from Broadhurst, who is also known as the Fat Controller. At the Fat Controller's behest Ian engages in a series of strange acts including time travel and trips to an alternate reality called the Land of Children's jokes, a grotesque alternate universe inhabited by the menacing and deformed characters from jokes. The protagonist's education culminates in bizarre rites of bestiality and necrophilia. However, he finds that in exchange for knowledge of the black arts Broadhurst begins to take over more and more aspects of his life. The novel may also be seen as an example of an unreliable narrator, as it is unclear whether the strange events in the novel are meant to be real or hallucinatory. Reviews Nicholas Lezard said of the book that \\"No one else I can think of writes about contemporary Britain with such elan, energy and witty intelligence.

Relocation to Forest Hills In 1915 the national championship was relocated from Newport, Rhode Island to the West Side Tennis Club at Forest Hills, New York. Already in 1911 an effort was made by a group of tennis players, headed by Karl H. Behr from New York, to relocate the tournament to New York but by a vote of 95 to 60 it was decided to remain in Newport. In early 1915 the issue resurfaced when a group of about 100 tennis players signed a petition in favor of the move, arguing that most tennis clubs, players and fans were located in the New York area and that it would therefore be beneficial for the development of the sport to host the national championship there. This view was opposed by another group of players which included eight former national singles champions. The contentious issue was brought to a vote at the annual United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) meeting on Feb 5, 1915 and with 128 votes in favor and 119 against it was decided to relocate to Forest Hills.

In April 2009 Pope Benedict XVI advanced her beatification process by formally recognizing a miracle attributed to her.Pope approves heroic virtues for ten on path to canonization, including the Brazilian ‘Mother Teresa’ Catholic News Agency. April 3, 2009. She was beatified on Sunday 30 May 2010 at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome by Archbishop Angelo Amato, Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in the Roman Curia. Although he was not present for the beatification Mass, Pope Benedict XVI noted her \\"extraordinary devotion\\" to the Holy Face of Christ at the Angelus audience the following Sunday.Vatican website: Pope Benedict XVI Angelus, 30 May 2010 Early years She was born Giuseppina De Micheli in Milan on 11 September 1890.\\"Beata Maria Pierina\\", Santi e Beati, May 19, 2009 She had been aware from an early age of the Holy Face of Jesus devotion, which had been started almost a century earlier by a French Carmelite nun, Sister Marie of St Peter, of Tours, France. Giuseppina joined the Congregation of the Daughters of the Immaculate Conception in October 1913, and took the name Sister Maria Pierina on 16 May 1914, when she made her vows. She was then sent to the motherhouse in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she remained until 1921.\\"Venerable Mother Maria Pierina De Micheli\\", Vultus Christi, Silverstream Priory, December 17, 2007 While there, her attachment to the Holy Face devotion grew stronger. After her return to Milan she was eventually elected as the mother superior of her house and began to spread the devotion. Visions Tomb of Blessed Maria Pierina. On the first Friday in Lent 1936 she reported a vision of Christ in which Jesus appeared to her and said: “I will that My Face, which reflects the intimate pains of My Spirit, the suffering and the love of My Heart, be more honored. He who meditates upon Me, consoles Me”. Further reported visions of Jesus and Mary urged Sister Maria Pierina to make a medal with the Holy Face of Jesus. After some effort, she managed to obtain permission to reproduce the photograph of the Shroud of Turin and authorization from the Curia in Milan to proceed with the medal in 1940. This became known as the Holy Face Medal. On one side the medal bears a replica of the Holy Shroud of Turin and an inscription based on Psalm 66:2: \\"Illumina, Domine, vultum tuum super nos\\", i.e. \\"May, O Lord, the light of Thy countenance shine upon us\\". On the other side of the medal, there is an image of a radiant Sacred Host, the monogram of the Holy Name (\\"IHS\\"), and the inscription \\"Mane nobiscum, Domine\\" i.e. \\"Stay with us, O Lord\\". Approval of the Holy Face medal The first medal of the Holy Face was offered to Pope Pius XII who approved the devotion and the medal. She had also reported that Jesus wanted a special Feast on the day before Ash Wednesday in honor of His Holy Face, to be preceded by a Novena (9 days) of prayers. In 1958, Pope Pius XII declared the Feast of the Holy Face of Jesus as Shrove Tuesday (the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday) for all Roman Catholics. Final years In 1941 she wrote in her diary: \\"I feel a deep longing to live always united to Jesus, to love Him intensely because my death can only be a transport of love with my Spouse, Jesus.\\" Sister Maria Pierina died on 26 July 1945 in Milan.

His interest in older music started at home in 1984 with his older brother Marlando playing guitar and listening to big band jazz on Chuck Schaden's old-time radio show. Robinson's love for ragtime started in 1986, when he was in 7th grade. Trumpeter Orbert Davis visited his school with a jazz group called From Bach to Bebop through Urban Gateways. The group performed a variety of musical works, including Scott Joplin's \\"The Entertainer\\". This piece interested him. Although he had heard it many times from the ice-cream trucks in his neighborhood, he had never considered it a serious piece of music. Robinson taught himself music. By 1987 his mother purchased a piano from a neighbor who was moving. He spent the next three years of his life submerged in the self study of music. In 1988 Robinson took three lessons with Theodore Bargman at the American Conservatory of Music in downtown Chicago.Howard Reich; forward by Ellis L. Marsalis, Jr., Let Freedom Swing: Collected Writings on Jazz, Blues, and Gospel, pg. 265, Northwestern University Press (2010) He also briefly studied sight-reading with a young pianist at a piano retail shop. Robinson taught himself how to compose music in various styles including piano ragtime. In 1989 he began composing the pieces that would constitute his debut album, The Strongman. In 1992 he was introduced to pianist Jon Weber. Weber helped him make a professional demo of his compositions and arranged for his first public performance at The Green Mill in September 1992. The Strongman was followed by Sounds in Silhouette (1994), and Euphonic Sounds (1998), all released on Delmark Records. In 2004 Robinson nearly stopped playing the piano until learning that he had won the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation \\"genius award\\". Besides the award financing his continued playing, it boosted his profile in the jazz community and financed the release of his album Man Out of Time (2006). In January 2010, Robinson released a three-disc compilation called Reflections. Robinson has absolute pitch.

Biography   Apprenticeship in Würzburg  Bernhard Heine was born on August 20, 1800 as the son of a tanner in Schramberg. At the age of ten (according to other references, thirteen) years he was apprenticed to his uncle Johann Georg Heine in Würzburg as an orthopaedic mechanic. Without any enrolment he later attended lectures in medicine at the University of Würzburg. After a number of journeys he took over his own department in his uncle's orthopaedic institute. When Johann Georg moved to the Netherlands in 1829, Bernhard - together with his cousin Joseph Heine - became the head of the Würzburg institution. In 1837 Bernhard Heine married his cousin (Johann Georg's daughter) Anna Heine (*1801).  Inventing the osteotome  In 1830, after long years of research and development, Bernhard Heine presented a medical tool to his colleagues. It was a \\"bone saw\\", which he called osteotome and which revolutionized surgical treatment. His invention was a great success among medical experts all over Europe. Heine travelled to other parts of Germany, France and even Russia to present it to other surgeons. In 1836 already a doctoral thesis on the \\"Osteotome and its application\\" was published in Munich. the osteotome the osteotome and its usage {  style=\\"width:44em; font-size:90%; text-align:left; padding-left:0.5em; padding-right:0.5em;\\" - ! left: the osteotome ! right: its various parts and its usage } Heine declined an offer of the Russian Tsar Nicholas I to take over the position of an orthopaedic senior consultant at the imperial school in Kronstadt and returned to Würzburg. The Würzburg university awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1836 and an honorary professorship in 1838, although he had never acquired any degree.  Research work on bone formation  Bernhard Heine acquired valuable knowledge in the field of bone formation and bone regeneration, which is still valid today. He was able to prove that the periosteum, the tissue covering the bones, is decisive in bone regeneration and therefore has to be spared violation in the operating process. Unfortunately his early death did not allow him to publish his findings in a medical work. Since 1844 he had taught Experimental Physiology at the Würzburg university as an associate professor, but fell ill with tuberculosis and died on July 31, 1846 on a recreation trip to Switzerland in Glockenthal near Thun. It was not until 1926, eighty years after his death that his research findings were published (see external link biography).

History  In 2003, founding member Jewel Love brought together student leaders from the Black/African student organizations in the UC system. As a major in Black Studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara, Jewel felt that the deep disrespect of the culture, religion, and philosophy, of historically African people was a stumbling block to African-American success at the University of California at Santa Barbara campus. Extending this sentiment to every UC school, UC-ABC was founded to preserve the spirit, culture, and aspirations of African people throughout the UC school system. Founding members included Ainye Long and Edwina Williams (University of California, Santa Cruz), Na'Shaun Neal and Catherine Sylvester (University of California, Los Angeles), Raniyah Abdus-Samad and Renita Chaney (University of California, Berkeley), Venita Goodwin, Adia Smith, Isaac Frederick and Naseem Beauchman (University of California, Davis), Tiana Lynch (University of California, Irvine), and Stephanie Akpa (University of California, San Diego). In 2003, much like today, Black African students at each UC campus faced racial discrimination in the form of threats, offensive comments and actions taken by many non-black students. These offenses, coupled with the declining numbers of Black African students at the UC system (as a result of Proposition 209), led the various chairs, presidents, and external representatives to form the University of California African Black Coalition. The first meeting was in the fall of 2003 held at the University of California, Santa Cruz. At the first meeting, the following schools were in attendance: Santa Barbara, San Diego, Santa Cruz, Los Angeles, Davis and Berkeley. Subsequent meetings were held at Berkeley, San Diego, Santa Cruz, and Los Angeles. In the spring of 2004, University of California, Riverside was added and in 2007, University of California, Merced. The first UC ABC action was held the campus of UC San Diego in coordination with the progressive students of color at UCSD during the UCSA Students of Color Conference to protest the hostile educational environment. This was the first coordinated action of the organization. Approximately 50 students from the various UC-ABC schools attended the direct action.  Structure  The Organizing Board of UC ABC consists of President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Conference Coordinator.  Conference history  In 2004 the University of California African Black Coalition held its first annual conference at UC Santa Cruz. The Conference Chair was UCSC ABC rep, Ainye Long, External Vice Chair for UCSC'c African/Black Student Alliance (\\"ABSA\\"). Guest speakers included Professors Trica Rose, George Lipsitz, and David Anthony. The conference was successful by all standards and has continued on since that time. The conferences are tailored to meet the social and political needs of Black/African students in the UC system. In 2005, the conference was held at UC San Diego. The Coalition president was Catherine Sylvester. In 2006, the conference was held at UC Davis. In 2007, the conference was held at Santa Barbara. In 2008, the fifth conference was held at UC Irvine. The Coalition co-presidents were Lonneshia Webb and Christina Williams. The chair of fundraising was Melanie Garber. The site committee co-chairs were Ashley Turner and Alexandria Gurley. In 2009, the sixth conference was held at UC Merced. In 2010, the seventh conference was held at UC Riverside. The conference co-chairs were Stacey Hartnett and Khiana Ferguson. In 2011, the eighth conference was held at UCLA. The conference chair was Adrien Sebro. In 2012, the ninth Conference was held at UC Berkeley. In 2013, the tenth Conference was held at UC San Diego. The conference chair was Grant White. In 2014, the eleventh Conference was held at UC Santa Cruz. Angela Davis and Ambassador Atallah Shabazz attended. In 2015, the twelfth Conference was held at UC Irvine. Elaine Brown and Wade Noble attended. The conference co-chairs were Jazmyne McNesse and Angelique McGrue.
