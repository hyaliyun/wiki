The Army of Soviet Latvia was operationally subordinated to the command of the Northern Front , and on 19 February 1919, became part of the newly formed Western Front. The army headquarters was stationed in Daugavpils. The 15th Army conducted in July 1919 defensive battles against Estonian troops and withdrew under the onslaught of enemy forces from the territory of Latvia, except Latgale. In August 1919 the 15th Army conducted the Pskov operation and liberated Pskov. In September-October 1919, she defended Petrograd against the forces of Nikolai Yudenich, and led in October-November a counter-offensive towards Luga, Volosovo, Gdov and Yamburg, thus participating in the defeat of Yudenich's Northwestern Army. Since July 1919 the left flank of the Army had been fighting defensive battles against the advancing Polish troops in Belorussia. After the final defeat of Yudenich, the 15th Army was able to concentrate all its forces against the Polish Army. In the spring and summer of 1920, the 15th Army was part of the attack group of the Western Front and acted against the First Polish Army. In May 1920, she attacked near Švenčionys, Maladzyechna and Zembin, but was stopped by the enemy's attack in the rear. In July 1920, she conquered Molodechno and Lida. During the Battle of Warsaw (1920) she forced the Niemen and Narew rivers and advanced towards the Wkra River north of Warsaw, but was then forced to retreat to the East. In September-October 1920 she defended the approaches to Minsk. In early October the 15th Army was put into reserve. On 26 December 1920, the administration of the 15th Army was disbanded, and the troops transferred to the 3rd Army. == Commanders  Commanders === * Jukums Vācietis (06.01.1919 — 10.03.1919), * Pēteris Slavens (10.03.1919 — 07.06.1919). * Pēteris Slavens (07.06.1919 — 25.06.1919) * Sergei Kharlamov (25.06.1919 — 31.07.1919) * August Kork (31.07.1919 — 15.10.1919) * Aleksander Kukk (15.10.1919 — 22.10.1919) * August Kork (22.10.1919 — 16.10.1920) * B.L.

The majority of transient gene expressions are done with cultivated animal cells. The technique is also used in plant cells; however, the transfer of nucleic acids into these cells requires different methods than those with animal cells. In both plants and animals, transient expression should result in a time-limited use of transferred nucleic acids, since any long-term expression would be called \\"stable expression\\". Methodology varies depending on the organism to transform. While plants can be transformed with a construct introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens via agroinfiltration or floral dip, most animal cells would require a viral vector. Some fungi, like yeasts or zygomycota, are susceptible to transformation by dedifferentiating their hyphae to protoplasts and adding Cl2Ca 10–50 mM, Tris-HCl 10 mM, polyethylene glycol (40%) and the DNA construct (> 5µg/ml) to a 10^8 protoplast/ml solution. Under this pH conditions, PEG acts as a binder, promoting protoplasts to clump together and trap introduced DNA strands. This process has a relatively high efficiency, despite the fact that eukaryotic cells have abundant exonucleases that degrade exogenous DNA. ==References* * Category:Gene expression ","title":"Transient expression"},{"id":"56869885","text":"Zdeněk Mahler in 2010 Zdeněk Mahler (7 December 1928 – 17 March 2018) was a Czech writer, musicologist, pedagogue and screenwriter. == Family == He was born in Batelov, to the family of ironmonger Karel Mahler (1901–1970) and Marie Mahlerová (1903–1982).

He was brought up in Hildesheim where his father was appointed rabbi. After matriculating from high school in 1862, he studied philosophy and oriental philology at the universities of Göttingen and Breslau, completing his studies at the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau where he received his rabbinical degree. In 1866, he earned a doctorate from the University of Halle. ==Career== From 1867, he taught at the seminary in Hanover until 1871 when, on the recommendation of the Jewish reformer Abraham Geiger (1810–1874), he moved to Rochester where he was elected rabbi of the B'rith Kodesh congregation, taking up his appointment in March 1871. In addition to his religious duties, thanks to his scholarship and his interest in philanthropy, he was soon recognized as one of the city's most eminent citizens. By 1894, under his leadership the B'rith Kodesh congregation had grown to more than 250. Langsberg was also active in support Rochesster's charitable societies, aimed at improving conditions for the poor and needy. Under the United Hebrew Charities of Rochester, these included the Hebrew Benevolent Society, established in 1850, and the Hebrew Ladies' Benevolent Society (1865). He also contributed to social welfare and rights for immigrants, hosting events at the synagogue, including a presentation by the Danish-American social reformer Jacob Riis in 1901. Events were open to the public, in line with Landsberg's efforts to develop collaboration with Christian churches interested in similar objectives. Over his 43 years of service, Landsberg became recognized as one of the best known rabbis in the United States and was above all appreciated by the people of Rochester. Not only was he in the forefront of the country's Jewish progress, he participated actively in several movements centred on improving conditions in the city. Landsberg retired from his position in January 1914. He died in Rochester on December 9, 1927. ==Family== Landsberg married Miriam Isengarten (1847–1912) on February 26, 1871.

Get-together among co-workers or students are very common in Korea. A lot of people in Korea consume the hangover drinks before they attend the get-together so they can get out of the hangover quickly on the next day. == Hangover drink == South Korea's alcohol consumption is among the best in the world, and deaths from liver cancer are the main cause of death for South Koreans. The socioeconomic and health hazards caused by drinking are enormous, and this is on the rise. Therefore, a number of drinks are being developed to relieve hangover. This removes hangovers from alcohol consumption and reduces blood alcohol levels. Until recently, however, no drugs have been developed to relieve alcohol hangovers. Beverages used for hangover are used as a hangover solution, and a number of products are currently being released in Korea. Currently, various drinks including biologic drugs are on the market as hangover remover. These drinks are consumed alone after drinking and are added to high-alcohol drinks before drinking. The ingredients added to a hangover drink suppresses alcohol absorption. It also promotes alcohol metabolism, reducing alcohol concentration in the blood. It is also known to represent the function of protecting liver cells from alcohol and preventing gastrointestinal mucosa damage and protecting the stomach by applying gastrointestinal mucosa. == Market situation == The size of the Korean hangover-release market is steadily growing. According to market research firm Link Aztec, the market size of the hangover solution market as of 2016 has been steadily increasing by 15 percent every year to 135.3 billion won in 2015, 155.7 billion won in 2016 and 174.8 billion won in 2017. The reason for the increase in market size is that the existing consumers in their 30s and 40s are spreading to those in their 20s, with the aim of relieving hangovers after drinking and camouflage protection. Currently, CJ Hutgae's market share is at the forefront with about 44 percent of CJ Hutgae condition, followed by Grammy's dawn 808 with about 32 percent. And Dong-A Pharmaceutical's Morning Power settled for third place with about 14.https://jmagazine.joins.com/economist/view/318798 == Product form == There are a variety of hangover remover that are currently released. It is subdivided into beverage form and jelly, candy, and Hwan. Starting with CJ Cheiljedang's condition (1992), the beverage was released in the order of Dawn 808 (1998), Dong-A Morning Care (2005), ReadyQ (2014), and Jeonggwanjang (369 (2015). RU21 (2007) and God of dining (2013) were released as hangover pills, but they did not surpass the market for hangover drinks. Changes have occurred as CJ conditionhwan (2012) was released in markets for hangover remover, which had been dominated by drinks. Later, changes began in earnest with the release of Samyang’s sangkwaehwan Since then, it has diversified into powdered 우콘군부탁해 (2013), candy-type kisslip (2013), and jelly-type Korean-German ready-q-chew. Among the hangover remover of beverages, jelly, candy, and fantasy shapes, the quickest is the hangover remover in the type of drink. Common sense is that a hangover in the form of a drink will have the fastest effect, said Kim Jin- wook. In the form of a beverage, if the hangover remover is already dissolved, it can be absorbed immediately. However, candies, jelly, and Hwan all have to go through a process of disassembly.http://kormedi.com/1225650/%EC%88%99%EC%B7%A8-%ED%95%B4%EC%86%8C%EC%A0%9C-%EC%A0%9C%EB%8C%80%EB%A1%9C-%EB%A8%B9%EB%8A%94-%EB%B2%95/ == Trend == The recent trend of con sumption of hangover-release in Korea is reflecting a change in consciousness.(2019) It's called \\"Nasimbi.\\" In the past, the older generation in Korea placed importance on the sense of community \\"we,\\" but recently, super-individualism that values \\"I\\"'s own satisfaction is rapidly under way. And that change is reflected in many industries as well as the hangover market. As a concrete example, people have increased interest in healthy eating and \\"health\\" such as drinking alone and home drinking. For his health, more customers are looking for a hangover product even though he drank a little. In addition, the value of consumer spending, which happily opens its purse to slightly more expensive products for health, is expanding. This trend is now further driving growth in the hangover and beverage market.https://www.sedaily.com/NewsVIew/1RULA024NS == See also == Ampelopsin ==References== Category:Drinking culture Category:South Korean drinks ","title":"Hangover drinks in South Korea"},{"id":"56869909","text":"Velocious Technologies (known as VeeR VR) . ==History== Veer VR is the global VR content community founded in 2016.

He showed considerable promise as a two-year-old in 1905 when he won two of his four races including the July Stakes. In the following spring he recorded an upset victory in the 2000 Guineas but was beaten in all of his subsequent races. He was retired from racing at the end of the year and became a successful breeding stallion in France. ==Background== Gorgos was a brown horse bred and owned by Arthur James. The colt was sent into training with Richard Marsh at his Egerton House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Gorgos was one of the best horses sired by Ladas who won the 2000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby in 1894. His dam The Gorgon, was a high class racehorse who won the New Stakes for Arthur James in 1899 and later became a successful broodmare whose other descendants included Nebbiolo. ==Racing career1905: two-year-old season=== Gorgos made little impact on his racecourse debut in June 1905 when he finished unplaced in the Triennial Stakes at Royal Ascot. In the following month, ridden by Herbert Jones he won July Stakes over five and a half furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse at odds of 7/4 from the favoured Alcanzor. A month later he led from start to finish to win the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. On his final start of the year he finished third in the Boscawen Stakes at Newmarket in autumn. ===1906: three-year-old season=== On 2 May Gorgos, with Herbert Jones in the saddle, started a 20/1 outsider in field of twelve for the 98th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course for which the leading contenders appeared to be Gingal (runner-up in the Dewhurst Stakes) Bill of Play, Admiral Crichton, Beppo and Frustrator. The Coventry Stakes winner Black Arrow delayed the start with his \\"obstreperous\\" behaviour but then started quickly and led the field to halfway with Gorgos settled behind the leaders. Approaching the last quarter mile Ramrod and Admiable Crichton disputed the lead but the pair then swerved towards the centre of the track allowing Gorgos and the unnamed \\"Dame Agneta colt\\" (later named Sancy) to join the issue. In a closely contested finish Gorgos prevailed by a head from the Dame Agneta colt, with Ramrod a neck away in third. Two weeks later the colt was moved up in distance for the Newmarket Stakes over ten furlongs and finished third behind Lally and Malua. In the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 30 May Gorgos started the 10/1 fifth favourite but was never in serious contention and finished seventh behind Spearmint. At Goodwood on 2 August Gorgos was stepped up in distance and matched against older horses to contest the Goodwood Cup over two and a half miles and finished third behind Plum Tree. On 12 September the colt ran in the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse but after being left behind in a \\"shockingly bad\\" start he finished unplaced behind Troutbeck. Gorgos was \\"badly knocked about\\" in the race and never ran competitively again. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Gorgos a \\"poor\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. ==Stud record== In 1907, Gorgos was sold to the 11th Duc de Gramont and exported to become a breeding stallion in France. The best of his offspring included Sourbier (Prix du Jockey Club), Gorgorito (Prix Royal Oak), Bridaine (Prix du Cadran) and Listman (Poule d'Essai des Poulains).

The intent behind having so many shades to offer is to differentiate from other makeup companies that do not cater to a broad market. Fenty Beauty was named one of Time magazine's best inventions of 2017. == Background == In June 2014, Rihanna trademarked her surname, Fenty, for use on an array of products, leading to speculation that she would begin working on endeavors other than her music. Fenty Beauty was among these new trademarks. Rihanna launched Fenty Beauty in 2017 when she was 29 years old. Previously she had collaborated with MAC Cosmetics, as well as released 10 fragrances via Parlux Ltd, but Fenty Beauty was her first solo cosmetics brand. She developed the line with luxury conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessey (LVMH), signing a deal in 2016 to produce Fenty Beauty through LVMH's Kendo division. Kendo Holdings, Inc, is an \\"incubator\\" company that manufactures cosmetics as white- label products for sale through cosmetics retailer Sephora, another LVMH subsidiary, as well as other outlets. Women's Wear Daily reported that LVMH may have paid $10 million (USD) for the agreement, which followed on Kendo deals to produce Marc Jacobs Beauty and Kat Von D Beauty lines. Rihanna, who is from Barbados, created Fenty Beauty to provide for the inclusion of all skin tones in cosmetics offerings, including extensive shade offerings for people with deeper skin tones. ==HistoryLaunch=== In the UK, Fenty Beauty was initially exclusive to Harvey Nichols department stores. Fenty Beauty's first products went on sale on September 8, 2017. The launch coincided with New York Fashion Week, where Rihanna also had a runway show for her collaboration with Puma. Promotion was so extensive, The New York Times wrote, \\"one might be forgiven for thinking it's actually Rihanna New York Fashion Week.\\" In the US, the line launched in Sephora stores, on the Sephora website, and on Fenty Beauty's website. In the UK, Fenty Beauty was initially exclusive to Harvey Nichols department stores, until it was announced in May 2019 the line would also become available in the high street chemist Boots UK. Fenty Beauty is available online or in store in over 15 countries. Fenty Beauty arrived in Saudi Arabia, seen as a potentially lucrative market for the brand, with cosmetic sales in the country at an all-time high. ===2017–18=== Fenty Beauty products have drawn international praise for the range of shades offered, in particular for including darker shades among the first 40, then 50 different colors for its Pro Filt'R foundation, addressing a long-criticized gap in cosmetic industry offerings for black women and other women of color. Subsequent launches of new products and new lines have been criticized for the failure to live up to the new standard set by Fenty Beauty, for instance Kim Kardashian West's line KKW Beauty, Tarte's Shape Tape Foundation, and Benefit's Hello Happy foundation. Rihanna in a promotional campaign in 2018 The line's Stunna Lip Paint, a red lipstick launched November 23, 2017 (Thanksgiving, just ahead of Black Friday Sales), also drew broad enthusiasm. Reviewing the product at BuzzFeed News, Leticia Miranda noted the history of controversy around red lipstick, particularly for women of color, saying the context made the choice of color for Stunna \\"assertive, confrontational, unapologetic\\". Since the release of the original red Stunna Lip Paint, Fenty Beauty has also released four more lip paints in baby pink, peach nude, chocolate brown, and black. On March 23, 2018, the line launched a limited- edition highlighter called Dirty Thirty for Rihanna's 30th birthday; it is the line's popular Killawatt Freestyle Highlighter in Trophy Wife shade (metallic gold), packaged with XXX (the Roman numerals for 30) instead of the brand's FB logo. On April 6, 2018, Fenty Beauty released three products in its Beach, Please collection. Body Lava, Fenty Beauty's first body product, is a liquid that can be buffed into any part of the body for illumination and is available in either a peach tone called Who Needs Clothes or a golden one, Brown Sugar. To apply the Body Lava, the Kabuki Brush is available for purchase separately. Meanwhile, the Fairy Bomb Glittering Pom Pom is both applicator and product: the pom pom is packed with rose gold glitter designed to fit all skin tones. The pom pom also has a vanilla-coconut scent. On October 4, 2018, Fenty Beauty launched their winter collection titled ChillOwt, which included a variety of winter-themed and cool-toned products. These included the Killawatt Foil Palette, a highlighter palette with seven metallic shades, two lipstick sets (Snow Daze and Snow Nights), and a number of multi-use products, including sets of crayons for lip and eye (titled FrostHunny, FrostBunny, and FrostMoney) and loose pigmented powder (Avalanche Powders), for eyes, lip and cheek, in seven metallic shades. ===2019–2020=== On January 11, 2019, Fenty Beauty launched Pro Filt’r Instant Retouch Concealer in 50 shades. In addition, Pro Filt’r Foundation add 10 new shades, bringing the total to 50, with the concealer shades number to correspond to the same number foundation. Each shade of Pro Filt’r concealer range is made to correspond with the same or any suitable Pro Filt’r Foundation number. The company also announced a setting powder product, the Pro Filt’r Instant Retouch Setting Powder in eight translucent shades, as well as a number of beauty tools, including Powder Puff Setting Brush 170, Precision Concealer Brush 180, and Lil Precision Makeup Sponge Duo 105.Fenty Beauty's Pro Filt'r Concealer Is Coming Soon in 50 Shades, So Your Skin Can Look Snatched in 2019. Fenty Beauty Cheeks Out Freestyle Cream Blush launched on 17 April, 2020. It retails for $20.00 and contains 0.1 oz.. ==Pricing== The initial products released by Fenty Beauty were widely seen as reasonably priced (especially compared to other prestige brands) and accessible to a broad range of consumers, following Rihanna's approach to her fragrance releases. ==Marketing== Rihanna in a promotional video for Fenty Beauty in 2018 In the brand's first month, Fenty Beauty recorded $72.0 million in earned media value (a measure of marketing success), ahead of other high-profile brands like including Kylie Cosmetics, Benefit, Urban Decay, KKW Beauty and NYX. Also in the brand's first month, Fenty Beauty-related content received 132 million views on YouTube. In February 2018, Fenty Beauty released an ad featuring rapper Saweetie that showed a group of women getting ready to attend the Super Bowl. The spot drew enthusiasm for its send-up of the award-winning 1990s Budweiser ad campaign \\"Whassup\\" (in which a group of men acknowledged one another only by repeating an intoxicatedly slurred \\"What's up?\\" over and over), but the Fenty version also attracted some criticism as the women greeted each other in \\"Whassup\\"-style drawl with the word \\"bitch\\". ===Diversity=== As with the product line, Fenty Beauty also drew international acclaim for diversity in its advertising campaign, which prominently featured numerous black models and other models of color. Faces of the initial Fenty Beauty campaign included Slick Woods, Halima Aden, Leomie Anderson, Indyamarie Jean, Paloma Elsesser, Selena Forrest, Camila Costa, and Duckie Thot. Soon after Rihanna released her line, other brands such as Make Up For Ever and L'Oréal started ad campaigns aimed at women of color. Fenty Beauty has embraced makeup use across gender lines, producing an ad in March 2018 called \\"My Fenty, My Mood\\", in which Instagram star and comedian Kway plays his comic character Titi promoting the brand. Also in March 2018, Daniel Kaluuya, nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his starring role in Get Out, appeared on the Oscar red carpet wearing Fenty Beauty's Pro Filt'R Foundation (specifically, shades 480 and 490). Time magazine described him as looking \\"luminous\\"; in the UK edition of The Huffington Post, Patricia Ekall said his \\"dewy glow brought the ‘no- makeup-makeup’ look to another level.\\" Several outlets noted men's use of makeup was \\"not unusual\\", but said the news nevertheless \\"pleasantly surprised\\" fans. Rihanna has drawn some criticism for failing to cast transgender models in Fenty Beauty campaigns. In response she invoked a desire to avoid tokenism and respect privacy, saying she has > \\"work[ed] with many gifted trans women throughout the years, but I don't go > around doing trans castings! Just like I don't do straight non-trans women > castings! I respect all women, and whether they're trans or not is none of > my business! It's personal and some trans women are more comfortable being > open about it than others so I have to respect that as a woman myself! I > don't think it's fair that a trans woman, or man, be used as a convenient > marketing tool!\\" ==Sales== Within one month of release, Fenty Beauty's sales were valued at $72 million, and sold-out products widely reported, with darker shades of foundation particularly in demand (shoppers noted even testers were often gone from stores.) In the UK, the line became Harvey Nichols's biggest beauty launch ever (passing previous leader MAC Cosmetics): in September the department stores sold one Fenty Beauty foundation every minute and one lipstick every three minutes. The launch also helped raise LVMH's cosmetic and perfume sales for the third quarter of 2017 by 17%. According to Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of LVMH, Fenty Beauty's sales reached almost 500 million euros ($573 million) by the end of 2018. Forbes reported that following 15 months of operation, in 2018, Fenty Beauty accumulated US$570 million in revenue. The entire operation is worth US$17 billion, of which 15% belongs to Rihanna. A spokesperson for the singer disputed this figure. ==In popular media== Fenty Beauty has been referenced in numerous songs, including \\"Taste\\" by Tyga, \\"Make Up\\" by Ariana Grande from her 2019 studio album, Thank U, Next and in the 2018 song \\"Correria (Remix)\\" by Brazilian rapper BK. ==Awards== Fenty Beauty was named to Time magazine's list of the 25 best inventions of 2017, alongside NASA's Martian spacecraft InSight, Apple's iPhone X, Nike's Pro Hijab, and the Tesla Model 3. Time cited Fenty Beauty's 40-shade range of foundations that quickly sold out. Fenty Beauty also won the WWD Beauty Inc. award in 2017 for launch of the year in the prestige sector. ==References * Category:Cosmetics brands Category:LVMH Category:Organizations established in 2017 Category:Rihanna ","title":"Fenty Beauty"},{"id":"56870120","text":"Mohamed Aboussalam (born August 20, 1996) is a Moroccan professional basketball player.

He was a medical student at Edinburgh University, and London's Guy's Hospital and St Thomas's Hospital. Burnes arrived in 1821 at Bombay, with his brother Alexander Burnes. After taking minor posts in the medical service, he was successful in the open competition for the office of surgeon to the residency of Cutch State, quite recently in the hands of the East India Company. The state was led by Deshalji II, a minor, and there was an incursion from Sindh that forced the British brigade to retire to Bhuj. Burnes accompanied, as a volunteer, the field force which in 1825 expelled the Sindians. With a flattering invitation, Burnes then visited Hyderabad in Sindh. He undertook what was a diplomatic mission to the satisfaction of the British. In England on sick leave in 1834, he was made an LL.D. of Glasgow University and a Fellow of the Royal Society, and received the knighthood of the Guelphic Order from William IV. On his return to India in 1837, Burnes was appointed garrison surgeon of Bombay, then secretary of the medical board, superintending surgeon, and finally physician-general. He was also a member of the board of education, and took an interest in the medical training of Indians. Poor health led him to resign in 1849, after twenty-eight years' service. On his return home, Burns occupied himself with the local affairs of Forfarshire, where he was a justice of the peace. He moved to London, England, and died there on 19 September 1862. ==Freemasonry== Burnes became a Freemason in an English Lodge: Benevolent Lodge, No. 480, in 1828, (Bombay, [Mumbai] India). That Lodge no longer exists. When in Scotland in 1834, he was made an honorary member of Lodge St Peter, No. 120, (Montrose). On 30 April 1835 he was made an honorary member of Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No. 2, (Edinburgh).History of the Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No. 2, compiled from the records 1677-1888. By Alan MacKenzie. 1888. P.243. In 1836 he was appointed by the Grand Lodge of Scotland to be the Provincial Grand Master of Western India. His jurisdiction was later extended and he became Grand Master of all Scottish Freemasonry in India. During his term in office two Scottish Masonic Lodges were established. One by the name of Rising Star of Western India, No. 342, (Bombay) and the other, St Andrew-in-the-East, No. 343, (Poona, India). Both were granted Charters by the Grand Lodge of Scotland on 18 November 1844.Gould's History of Freemasonry by Robert Freke Gould. Ed. Rev. Herbert Poole. 3rd edition. 1951.

It was published in book form, as Narrative of a Visit to Scinde, in 1830. He wrote also a Sketch of the History of Cutch (lithographed for private circulation, 1829), and a Sketch of the history of the Knights Templar. ==Legacy== When Burnes left Bombay, medals were founded, to be competed for at the Grant Medical School, Bombay, the Montrose Academy, and the boys' and girls' schools at Byculla. Both Scottish Lodges founded during Burnes' term as Grand Master continue to meet in Mumbai and Pune, India, (2019). ==Family== Burnes married in 1829 Sophia Holmes, daughter of Sir George Holmes, in Bombay; they had nine children.

In the course of the new division, Friedberg now belonged to zone 20 and has since been the valid zone border for tariff zones 31 and 32. In addition, the AVV tariff on the Nuremberg-Augsburg railway line has applied since 1 August 2006 to Otting-Weilheim station in the district of Donau-Ries. ==References * Category:Transport in Augsburg Category:Transport associations in Germany Category:1985 establishments in West Germany Category:Companies based in Augsburg Category:Companies based in Bavaria Category:Transport companies established in 1985 ","title":"Augsburger Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund"},{"id":"56870459","text":"The Love Collection is the first compilation album released by Hong Kong female singer, Jinny Ng.

The offensive was divided into two waves of attacks from 17 to 31 August 1968 and from 11 to 27 September of that same year. ==Background== In late June 1968, COSVN and the commanders of Military Region 5 held a series of conferences to review the results of the May Offensive, also in attendance was Lê Duẩn who had pushed for the original plan for the General Offensive-General Uprising. The majority of the attendees, including Chinese military advisers, regarded the May Offensive as a failure and opposed any renewal of the offensive. Lê Duẩn supported by General Hoàng Văn Thái and General Man then persuaded the attendees to support the launching of a third offensive by mid-August. The Chinese advisers opposed this decision and returned to China, while several of the Vietnamese who had voiced their opposition to the new offensive were fired. The Offensives of May and August were primarily re-directed towards military targets, intending to blunt the perception that military victory was attainable for the US. On 24 July in Hanoi, Lê Duẩn met with senior leaders responsible for military affairs including PAVN chief of staff, General Văn Tiến Dũng to develop the operational plan for the offensive. After considering the recommendations submitted by COSVN and Military Region 5, it was agreed that Tây Ninh Province with its proximity to base areas in Cambodia would be the main area of operations. Saigon would not be targeted because of the severe losses suffered by VC forces there in the Tet and May Offensives and subsequent Allied security operations. The plan called for the 5th and 9th Divisions to draw the U.S. 25th Infantry Division away from its positions between Tây Ninh and Dầu Tiếng allowing VC local force units to attack Tây Ninh. The 7th Division would attack Lộc Ninh in Bình Long Province to divert the U.S. 1st Infantry Division and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 5th Division from reinforcing Tây Ninh. Other PAVN/VC units would launch further diversionary attacks across the region. In the Central Highlands the PAVN 1st Division was to seize the Duc Lap Camp and then move northeast to threaten Buôn Ma Thuột. The PAVN 24th Regiment would cut Highway 14 between Buôn Ma Thuột and Pleiku. The 95C and 101D Regiments would make diversionary attacks on Allied bases across Kon Tum Province, while in the lowland areas VC units would make attacks by fire and sapper attacks on Allied bases. In central I Corps the PAVN 31st and 38th Regiments would attack the 1st Marine Division positions around Da Nang allowing 6 VC local force battalions to penetrate and attack key installations across the city while the PAVN 368B Artillery Regiment would shell Da Nang Air Base. In southern I Corps a reinforced regiment from the PAVN 2nd Division would attack Tam Kỳ and another reinforced regiment from the PAVN 3rd Division would attack Quảng Ngãi. Allied intelligence was able to detect the planning of the offensive, its timing and objectives. On 10 August COMUSMACV General Creighton Abrams reported to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff that the “current deployment of [allied] ground forces is satisfactory,” and he was “confident in our ability” to defeat the offensive. General Abrams ordered increased air strikes on suspected PAVN/VC assembly areas, but specifically ordered his commanders not to be drawn out into the countryside but rather to stay back and defend the population centers. ==The OffensiveBattle of Tây Ninh=== Phase III Offensive, Tay Ninh Province, 17-18 August 1968 On the evening of 17 August a night ambush patrol from Company D, 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, operating between Nui Ba Den and Highway 13 3km east of Tây Ninh, observed a VC unit marching toward the capital. They called in artillery fire and engaged the VC with small arms and the VC retreated to the north and east. At midnight on 18 August a battalion from the 273rd Regiment, 9th Division, attacked Firebase Buell II () which was defended by 2 platoons from Company D, 3rd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment, two platoons from Company C, 4th Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment and 5 M48 tanks from Company A, 2nd Battalion, 34th Armor Regiment. The PAVN hit the tanks with B40 Rocket- propelled grenades to no effect and were unable to penetrate the base perimeter. At dawn the PAVN withdrew leaving 104 dead and 8 wounded. At the same time 9th Division sappers climbed Nui Ba Den to attack the U.S. communications station on its summit. The sappers penetrated the perimeter destroying several buildings and the electric generators that provided power to the base. At dawn the PAVN withdrew leaving 15 dead. U.S. losses were 8 dead and 23 wounded. New generators were flown in and the base became operational later that day. Also during the early morning of 18 August the D14 Local Force Battalion and a company from the 275th Regiment attacked southeast Tây Ninh but were held back from the center by Regional and Popular forces and police. At dawn Companies A and B, 4/23rd Infantry moved from Firebase Rawlins III () to southeast Tây Ninh, and the ARVN Task Force 2-34 was deployed to the southwest. Once these blocking forces were in position the Regional and Popular Forces within the city began pushing the PAVN back to the south and by nightfall the D14 Battalion had withdrawn southeast away from the city. At 09:30 on 18 August, 8km southeast of Tây Ninh the 275th Regiment ambushed Troop A, 3rd Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment on Route 239 in the Cau Khoi Plantation. Company A, 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment, was dispatched south down Route 26 and attacked the VC flank, killing 34. U.S. casualties totaled four dead and 17 wounded. At midday on 18 August Company B 1/5th Infantry engaged a two battalion strong PAVN unit in the Bến Củi Rubber Plantation northeast of Tây Ninh. Company C 1/5th Infantry and its reconnaissance platoon were sent to reinforce Company B and with artillery and air support by 16:00 they had scattered the enemy force who left behind 92 dead, a field radio and three .50-caliber machine guns. Captured documents showed that the force comprised a battalion from the 33rd Regiment and the D24 Anti-Aircraft Battalion. On the morning of 19 August, 1/5th Infantry regained contact with the 33rd Regiment in the Bến Củi Plantation. Companies B and C and the reconnaissance platoon, engaged PAVN who had reoccupied their previous fighting positions. After several M113 armored personnel carriers became bogged down the U.S. advance halted and by dusk the 33rd Regiment withdrew further into the plantation. U.S. losses were 2 killed and 24 wounded. At 18:45 on 19 August, the 33rd Regiment ambushed a column of Company B 1/5th Infantry and Troop A 3/4th Cavalry as they moved along Route 239 through the Bến Củi Plantation towards Dầu Tiếng Base Camp. B-40 and recoilless rifle fire knocked out the two leading vehicles and Company B established a defensive position north of the road while artillery and air strikes were called in. At 20:45 a troop from the 3/44th Cavalry attacked the enemy flank allowing the column to disengage and move east, fighting its way through further ambushes with B-40s knocking out 2 M48s and 2 M113s. U.S. losses were 8 killed and 44 wounded while PAVN losses were estimated to be more than 200. On the early morning of 20 August, a night ambush platoon from Company A, 2/27th Infantry, 2km north of Tây Ninh Combat Base spotted a unit of VC. On engaging the unit with their personal weapons, the return fire indicated that they were facing a VC battalion. Air and artillery support was called in while the platoon fought to prevent the VC from overrunning their position. The VC withdrew at dawn leaving 155 dead, U.S. losses were 5 killed and 6 wounded. On the morning of 20 August, Company B, 4/23rd Infantry, was ambushed by elements of the 275th Regiment on Route 26 through the Cau Khoi Plantation. Company A deployed south down Route 26 from Firebase Rawlins III and the combined force made the VC disengage leaving 28 dead. U.S. losses were 4 dead and 7 wounded. On the morning of 21 August as Company C and the reconnaissance platoon of 1/5th Infantry patrolled the northwest of the Bến Củi Plantation they were engaged by the 33rd Regiment. The PAVN aggressively closed on the U.S. force sending in 2 battalions of infantry and knocking out the 6 lead M113s with B-40 rockets. The unit withdrew killing 182 VC for the loss of 18 U.S. killed and 23 wounded. S. Sgt. Marvin R. Young would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for taking command of his platoon after the commander had been killed and covering its withdrawal. On the afternoon of 21 August Troop A 3/4th Cavalry and Company A 4/23rd Infantry, clashed with VC again in the Cau Khoi Plantation. U.S. losses were 3 killed and 5 wounded. On the night of 21 August the PAVN/VC launched simultaneous attacks on Firebases Buell II and Rawlins III. The 174th Regiment attacked Firebase Buell II which was defended by Companies C and D, 3/22nd Infantry, the attack was repulsed at a cost of 60 PAVN/VC killed and 11 wounded soldiers captured. U.S. losses were 3 killed and 18 wounded. The 3d Battalion, 275th Regiment attacked Firebase Rawlins III which was defended by Companies A and B, 4/23rd Infantry, the attack was repulsed at a cost of 25 PAVN/VC killed and 4 wounded soldiers captured. U.S. losses were 1 killed and 10 wounded. On the morning of 22 August on Route 239 in the Bến Củi Plantation, Company B, 1/5th Infantry, reengaged elements of the 33rd Regiment killing 24 PAVN/VC for the loss of 4 U.S. dead and 16 wounded. On 22 August, 25th Infantry Division commander MG Ellis W. Williamson instructed his 2nd Brigade to move north to Dầu Tiếng and on 23 August the 2nd Brigade established its headquarters there and assumed operational control over 1/5th Infantry. Troop A, 3/4th Cavalry, and the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 27th Infantry, each minus one company were also placed under 2nd Brigade operational control. These reinforcements allowed the 1st Brigade to focus its efforts on the areas immediately surrounding Tây Ninh. The 2nd Brigade commandeer sent a task force comprising Companies A, B and D of the 2/27th Infantry, supported by elements of Troop A, 3/4th Cavalry. to construct a new firebase named Schofield () on Route 239 halfway between the Bến Củi and Cau Khoi Plantations. The firebase became operational that evening, with two 105-mm. howitzer units, Battery A, 1st Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment and Battery C 7th Battalion, 11th Artillery. After midnight on 24 August 2 battalions from the 33rd Regiment attacked Firebase Schofield in a 4 hour long assault. PAVN/VC losses were 103 dead and an unusually large number of weapons were captured including 4 machine guns, 4 60-mm. mortar tubes, 2 recoilless rifles and 11 B-40 launchers. U.S. losses were 9 dead and 41 wounded, 4 M113s and 2 M48s were destroyed. Thanh Duc Plantation ambush, 25 August 1968 On the afternoon of 25 August, an 89 vehicle supply convoy manned by troops from the 6th and 7th Transportation Battalions escorted by military police in gun-jeeps was moving along Highway 22 towards Tây Ninh Combat Base. As the convoy passed by the Thanh Duc Rubber Plantation approximately 10km southeast of Tây Ninh they observed troops in ARVN uniforms in the trees to the east. The troops were actually the PAVN 88th Regiment in stolen uniforms who then opened fire on the convoy hitting it with mortars, B-40 rockets and machine gun fire. The lead vehicles were able to escape the ambush and sped north towards Tây Ninh, but an oil tanker was hit and burst into flames blocking the road for the 58 vehicles behind it. The drivers and MPs dismounted and returned fire from behind their vehicles or along the roadside. A relief force from the 4/23rd Infantry was sent to the ambush site with elements approaching from the north and south. At 14:00 Troop B 3/4th Cavalry, arrived at the southern end of the plantation and half the force was sent into the plantation to attack the PAVN left flank, while the others were sent to secure the convoy. At 14:15 helicopters landed Company C, 3/22nd Infantry, at the northern end of the ambush and they proceeded to attack the PAVN right flank. The counterattacks forced the PAVN deeper into the plantation and those vehicles that could move were sent north to Tây Ninh, while another 20 damaged vehicles awaited recovery. The PAVN withdrew as darkness fell and when U.S. forces swept the plantation the next day they found 103 PAVN dead among the destroyed bunkers, U.S. losses were 21 dead and 22 vehicles destroyed. For his actions during this battle Sgt. William W. Seay would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. After midnight on 27 August, the 275th Regiment attacked Firebase Rawlins III. The attack was easily repulsed by the defending 4/23rd Infantry who killed 58 PAVN and captured 2 wounded prisoners, 3 machine guns and 5 B-40 launchers for the loss of only 8 wounded. On 11 September the offensive against Tây Ninh was renewed when the 271st Regiment fired 200 mortar rounds at Firebase Buell II before launching an attack that was repulsed by the 3/22nd Infantry. PAVN/VC losses were 9 killed, U.S. losses were 17 wounded. Shortly afterwards the D14 Battalion attacked three Regional/Popular Forces posts to the north of Tây Ninh, opening a route for the 271st Regiment into the city. The Province Chief called for assistance and the ARVN 6th Airborne Battalion and an artillery battery were flown into the hamlet of Ven Ven on Highway 22, while the South Vietnamese 2nd and 3rd Marine Battalions and another artillery battery were flown in to set up another firebase 8km further east. On the evening of 11 September the ARVN 3rd Airborne Brigade and the 4th Marine Battalion were landed by helicopter in the northeast suburbs of Tây Ninh to clear the area. When the PAVN/VC withdrew the following morning they left 21 dead. Also on 11 September a battalion from the 275th Regiment attacked the position of Company A, 1/5th Infantry, of the 25th Infantry Division on the west of the Bến Củi Plantation.

On 12 September the PAVN 88th Regiment, attempted a repeat of the 25 August ambush on Highway 22, 3km north of that ambush site. The targeted convoy comprised 19 vehicles from the 48th Transportation Group including 1 M48 and an M113. The initial fire disabled a vehicle in the middle of the convoy and its crew and those of the following 4 vehicles dismounted and engaged the PAVN, while the front section drove north and the rear section pulled back from the ambush site. 25th Infantry Division M113s operating nearby quickly arrived at the ambush site as did helicopter gunships. The PAVN withdrew leaving 18 dead, while U.S. losses were only 1 vehicle destroyed. On 13 September, the 3rd Battalion, 272d Regiment attacked Firebase Buell II.

Over the next four days the U.S forces engaged the 165th Regiment southwest of Lộc Ninh and then a battalion from the 320th Regiment northeast of Lộc Ninh, killing more than 200 PAVN for the loss of 12 U.S. killed. On 25 August the PAVN units began withdrawing into their sanctuaries in Cambodia. On the morning of 11 September renewed the offensive by mortaring Lộc Ninh Special Forces Camp and the 1/2nd Infantry's adjacent base. At dawn 2 companies from 1/2nd Infantry began a sweep east of Lộc Ninh to locate the mortar positions. The infantry companies were engaged by entrenched PAVN 2km east of Lộc Ninh losing 5 killed and 10 wounded before withdrawing. The next morning the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment was flown into Lộc Ninh and 3 companies were sent in separate columns towards Hill 222 (), 6km north of the town. Around midday the columns were engaged by a battalion size PAVN force which they were only able to overcome with air and artillery support and the arrival of Troop E 2/11th ACR killing 121 PAVN and capturing three individual and nine crew- served weapons. Meanwhile Companies C and D, 1/2nd Infantry headed east again, finding the PAVN bunkers deserted before coming upon and even larger occupied bunker complex 5km east of Lộc Ninh which they were unable to capture despite air and artillery support. On 13 September the PAVN attacked Companies C and D to cover the withdrawal of the rest of their unit. After repelling this attack Companies C and D pursued the PAVN further east and at 13:00 they engaged the fresh 4th Battalion, 320th Regiment. Troop E, 2/11th ACR was sent to support the 1/2nd Infantry and the PAVN disengaged.

At 13:00 as the helicopter carrying 1st Infantry Division commander MG Keith L. Ware flew in to observe the assault on Hill 222 it was hit by anti-aircraft fire 5km south of Lộc Ninh and crashed killing all eight on board. The initial assault on Hill 222 was repulsed by intense PAVN fire and 1/28th Infantry was withdrawn to allow for more air and artillery preparation, but a follow-up attack was similarly repulsed and the PAVN launched their own counterattacks before the fighting ended as darkness fell. On the morning of 14 September, Companies B and C, 1/2nd Infantry, marched north to join the attack at Hill 222, but when the assault resumed later that day they found that the PAVN had abandoned the position overnight. ===IV Corps=== On the night of 21–22 August VC units attacked 75 targets across IV Corps (South Vietnam). Of those attacks, 39 were attacks by fire and only 7 of the ground attacks involved more than a single company. At Bến Tre an assault by the 516th and 550th Battalions was repulsed by the ARVN.

In Da Nang a company from the R20 Battalion and a sapper platoon infiltrated Forward Operating Base 4, a compound just south of Marble Mountain Air Facility that contained a Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group headquarters, several Special Forces teams and a MIKE Force company, killing 17 Special Forces soldiers (their largest one-day loss of the war) and wounding another 125 allied soldiers, 32 VC were killed. At 01:00 on 23 August the VC V25 and T89 Battalions tried to capture the Cẩm Lệ Bridge, 2km south of Da Nang Air Base to allow follow-on units to attack the city. A platoon of U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) Company D, 1st Military Police Battalion defended the bridge from their bunkers until they were relieved by the 1st Battalion, 27th Marines and ARVN Rangers. North of the bridge, a company from the VC 402nd Sapper Battalion tried to seize the Hòa Vang District but were held back by Regional Force units who were also reinforced by Marines and Rangers. The 402nd Sappers fell back to the Cẩm Lệ Bridge, where they continued to fight for a further 9 hours, but by late afternoon after air and artillery strikes they abandoned the position leaving 184 dead. South of Da Nang the ARVN 2nd Division and 2 Ranger battalions with Marine air support repulsed probing attacks from the PAVN 31st and 38th Regiments, killing almost 300 PAVN before they withdrew to their bases on Go Noi Island. 1st Marine Division commander MG Carl A.

Also on the night of 23 August the 66th Regiment and the 20th Sapper Battalion gathered near Duc Lap Camp in preparation for their attack on the base while the 320th Regiment established a blocking position on Highway 14 northeast of Duc Lap to intercept allied ground units. In the ensuing Battle of Duc Lap from 24 to 27 August the assault would be repelled for the loss of over 700 PAVN, 114 ARVN and 7 U.S. killed. ==Aftermath== By the end of August the US claimed that the PAVN/VC had lost approximately 8700 killed in the offensive. General Abrams told his subordinates on 24 August that \\"He’s [the PAVN/VC] a prisoner of his own damn strategy, and he can’t find a good way out. He can’t admit it–that’s impossible for him.\\" Abrams correctly predicted that the PAVN/VC would stagger their attacks across the various fronts to keep the offensive going for as long as possible, but that their strategy was hopeless given their declining capabilities. The US claimed that the PAVN/VC lost 16,578 soldiers in August and a further 13,163 in September, while U.S. losses over the same period were over 700 dead and an unknown number of ARVN/Allied troops although not all of these were involved in the Phase III Offensive. MACV regarded the offensive as a \\"dismal failure\\" that had \\"foundered from the outset\\" indicating that the PAVN were approaching exhaustion. ==References== Category:Battles involving Vietnam Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War Category:Military campaigns involving Vietnam Phase III Offensive Category:1968 in Vietnam Category:Conflicts in 1968 Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1968 Category:August 1968 events Category:September 1968 events ","title":"Phase III Offensive"},{"id":"56870511","text":"Barsudhal is a village in Dhar Kalan in Gurdaspur district of Punjab State, India.

The young nobleman first studied in Würzburg, Speyer and the Collegium Germanicum in Rome, was not ordained a priest until 1659 and soon became a canon in Würzburg, Speyer and Mainz. From 1647 to 1669, Walderdorff was Vicar-General of Mainz, from 1650 dean, later also cathedral provost in the Diocese of SpeyerWolfgang A.

He became Imperial Privy Councilor and served as Reich Vice Chancellor for 11 years. Walderdorff acquired in the mid-seventeenth century the Stockheimer Hof on the then Frauenbrüderplatz called Carmelite Square. In 1720 he removed and converted a two-storey angular building with a high hipped roof. In the middle of the facade, which is oriented towards the Karmeliterplatz, a Baroque architectural frame was inserted in the middle with a Madonna figure on a crescent moon. The pedestal shows the family crest of Greiffenclau-Vollrads, from which his mother originates, and Walderdorff's Latin inscription \\"SUB TUUM PRAESIDIUM\\" (Under your protection may this house stand). The Baroque court complex was largely destroyed in 1942 by aerial bombs. Emperor Leopold I appointed him Bishop of Vienna in 1669. Because of his gentleness and charity towards the poor he was very popular. He sought to exalt piety in his diocese and to train native priests. Hydrops caused him in 1674 to appoint the Schottenstift's Johann Schmitzberger as auxiliary bishop, who represented him as bishop. He is buried in St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna. ==Bibliography== * Rudolf Leeb u. a.: Geschichte des Christentums in Österreich. Von der Antike bis zur Gegenwart.

It frequently involves a graded series of behaviours or displays that include threatening gestures (such as vocalizations, spreading of wings or gill covers, lifting and presentation of claws, head bobbing, tail and body beating) and finally, direct attack. Ritualized aggression can sometimes include actual fights. == Examples  Cats === Domestic cats (Felis catus) are very territorial and defend their territories with ritualized body posturing, stalking, staring, spitting, yowling and howling. === Spider monkeys === Spider monkeys (genus Ateles) defend their territory by screams, barks, rattling or dropping branches, and urinating and defecating on intruders below. === Oscar cichlids === Oscar cichlids (Astronotus ocellatus) are able to rapidly alter their colouration, a trait which facilitates ritualised territorial and combat behaviours amongst conspecifics. Individuals of another cichlid species, the blunthead cichlid (Tropheus moorii), defend their feeding territory with a display, quivering the tail and fins to intimidate, or an attack, darting at the intruder and chasing them away. Astatotilapia burtoni cichlids have similar displays of aggressive behaviour if they are territorial, which include threat displays and chasing. === Ring-tailed lemur === Male ring-tailed lemurs have scent glands on their wrists, chests, and in the genital area. During encounters with rival males they may perform ritualized aggression by having a \\"stink fight\\". The males anoint their tails by rubbing the ends of their tails on the inside of their wrists and on their chests. They then arch their tails over their bodies and wave them at their opponent. The male toward which this is directed either responds with a display of his own, physical aggression, or flees. \\"Stink fights\\" can last from 10 minutes to one hour. === Creek chub === The creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) engages in ritualized aggression when others of the species invade its territory. Engaging in parallel swimming, the fish widens its fins and mouth and swims at a caudal fin beat. Intimidating opponent fish throughout these rituals, the forward fish stops and directs blows to the head of the other fish to ensure territory dominance. == See also == * Courtship display and Agonistic behavior and courtship * Ritualized fighting or Ritualized combat ** Ritualised fighting in Meat ants ** Trading blows == References == Category:Ethology ","title":"Ritualized aggression"},{"id":"56870737","text":"Father Thames on the Port of London Authority Building Civic Law on Nottingham Council House Charles Leighfield Jonah Doman FRBS (31 August 1884 – 19 March 1944) was a sculptor from Nottingham. ==Career== Born in 1884, he was the son of George L.

They are perhaps best known for their 1985 song Another Day In The Sun, that attracted local and international underground attention. Led by Tom Kazas, they incorporated many styles during their five year career: psychedelic rock, progressive rock, blues rock, early post rock, atmospheric rock, 1960s and 1980s pop, free improvisation, impressionistic lyrics, Greek folk music styles, experimental composition and repetitive minimalist structures. The band's name was invented by mis-spelling the word 'moths’. ==The early years 1980–1983== The band was formed by high school friends Tom Kazas and David 'Smiley' Byrnes, who lived in the beachside suburb of Maroubra, Sydney, Australia. Absorbing early influence from Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, the pair soon enough embraced the punk-new wave zeitgeist of the late 1970s and early 1980s, with bands like The Jam and The Cure. In 1980, Tom had formed a high school band called Antiscan, that played covers from these bands and some of his early original songs. During 1982-3, Tom and David were part of the 1960s inspired Mod scene of the inner-city of Sydney, that embraced the sound of the 1960s British Blues Invasion with bands like The Yardbirds. However, the pair also took to Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, and early Pink Floyd. It was in the mod scene that Tom and David met harmonica-playing Nick Potts, whose large record collection included rare 1960s psychedelic music that became influential in shaping the future sound of the band. Together with Nick and drummer Andrew Watson, the group played the formative gig in 1984 at The Freakout in the share-house in Darlinghurst Sydney, where future Moffs art director Ben Evison lived. This psychedelic-happening house-party gig was where the band met Alan Hislop, of the garage-psyche band The Suicidal Flowers, who was soon invited to join the band. ==Formation and success 1984–1986== Former road manager of The Scientists, Greg 'Quick' Smyrell saw the band at a 1984 gig and took on the role of manager. Quick enlisted The Scientist's record producer Chris Logan to oversee the band's first recording, that became their 'demo tape'. This cassette tape was successful in not only securing more inner-city gigs for the band, but became sought after by the now increasing audience. In late 1984, Quick handed the demo tape to John Needham of Citadel Records (bands on the label included Died Pretty, Lime Spiders, Screaming Tribesmen, The Stems), who signed the band to the label. Another Day in the Sun, with its flip side Clarodomineaux, was recorded in February 1985 at Paradise Studios Sydney and released in April. The single became a major independent success. It reached no.1 on the Australian Independent Charts and stayed in the top 20 for over four months. Australian music magazine Rock Australia Magazine (RAM) at the time wrote, \\"The Moffs have strung together every solemn rock'n'roll cliché and somehow succeeded in creating the most perfect yearning melancholy spine-tingler since White Rabbit.\\" The song was also embraced by the underground music scenes in the UK and Europe, with Jon Storey of influential UK fanzine Bucketfull of Brains calling it single of the year; \\"this is the best of the flawless series of Citadel singles, and believe me, the competition is fierce.” Tom recalls that the writing of the song Another Day in the Sun was influenced more by early Brian Eno than by 1960s psychedelia. The band began what was to become their consistent touring of Sydney and Melbourne where audiences continued to grow, and where the vibrant community radio scene of Melbourne (3RRR, 3CR, 3PBS) embraced and supported the band. Having moved away from the early bluesy sound, the band started to experiment with longer developmental forms and wide dynamics. The live shows took on a reputation for intensity and atmosphere. Due to emerging stylistic differences, Nick departed the band. He was replaced on organ by Mick Duncan, who was the guitarist for local band No Mans Land. A highlight for the band at the end of 1985 was playing the support spot for John Cale (Velvet Underground) in Sydney and Brisbane. In December 1985 the band entered the studio again with producer Chris Logan to record the Mini-Album. This album had some of the band's best known songs of Tom's, e.g. Look to Find and I Once Knew, but also a lengthy improvisation taking on a more progressive feel, with King Crimson becoming a big influence. This inspired Tom to buy one of the few mellotrons that existed in Australia. The self-titled Mini Album reached no. 1 on the independent charts, despite the mixed reviews. By the end of 1985 both Alan Hislop and Mick Duncan had left the band. The Moffs received new energy when Smiley's younger brother, Andrew Byrnes, who had quickly become quite accomplished on the drums, joined the band in 1986. The new dynamism in the rhythm section of the two brothers, both pushing the expressiveness of their instruments, was to become a feature of all future live performances. Organist Damon Giles, from Sydney band Stupidity, completed the quartet who recorded the next single Flowers/By The Breeze. This single also reached no.1 on the independent charts. The band continued to gig in Sydney and Melbourne, while also touring Adelaide, Brisbane and some regional New South Wales venues. In mid 1986, Damon left the band and was replaced by Brandon Saul, who would later become a promoter of the Falls Music Festival. Brandon departed at the end of 1986 and the band was close to calling it a day. ==Final phase 1987–1989== A critical boost was received when Scott Barnes joined the band in early 1987. The band recorded The Traveller/Quakers Drum, with a new producer and revitalised outlook. The single reached no.1 on the Australian Independent Charts. The band continued to play in Sydney and Melbourne, and performed what was regarded as a legendary gig of dynamics and atmospherics, in the Great Hall at Montsalvat, Melbourne. The band enlisted producer Tony Espie at Studios 301 to record their official debut full length debut album Labyrinth. Released in June 1988, Labyrinth was emblematic of the Moffs sound that incorporated episodic songs and arrangements, dynamic rock performances and minimalist repetitive motifs. Many praised the album, with RAM saying; \\"Along with The Church and Not Drowning Waving, the Moffs have proved with Labyrinth to be the most sophisticated atmosphere conjurors in the country. And if this isn't enough recommendation, all four players are so proficient that live, their complex arrangements and full scope of dynamics fuse with liberal sprinklings of improvisation to create what can only be described as magic.\\" The album reached no.3 in the Australian independent charts. Normal Recordshttp://www.normal-records.com/?a=history&r;=Citadel in Germany gave the album a European release and international attention on the band was again high. However, in spite of the renewed attention and success, a lack of funds and management meant the Moffs were unable to travel to Europe and the UK to promote themselves. The band continued to headline shows in 1989, while also supporting leading Australian bands such as The Triffids, Died Pretty and Not Drowning Waving. However, the strains of being a staunchly independent band, temperamentally and stylistically non-mainstream, again began to take their toll on the group. Tom had released a solo album of ambient music in 1989, and further aesthetic and personal differences were atomizing the band. The Moffs performed two final shows, one at the Paddington RSL in Sydney and a sellout at the Old Greek Theatre in Melbourne. By the end of 1989 the band had ceased. ==Reformations and beyond== The compilation album Psychadelicatessen was released in 1994 and the band reformed for shows in Sydney and Melbourne. In 2004, Another Day in the Sun was included in Tales of the Australian Underground, Singles 1976-1989, Vol. 1 , a compilation by Tim Pittman of record label Feel Presents. This album included the cream of the internationally regarded independent Australian rock music scene. In 2008 Tim produced and released the comprehensive double CD, the Moffs the Collection, that contained all the recorded material of the Moffs, and a multi-page booklet with a detailed history of the band with rare photos. To support this release, the last line-up of the Moffs reunited again and performed shows in Sydney and Melbourne. Another Day In The Sun was included in the 2010 Australian TV series, Spirited. In 2011 the original line-up reunited and performed music of the band's early years for gigs in Sydney and Melbourne. In 2015 Jagwar Ma released a dub inspired cover of Another Day in the Sun. In 2016 the Moffs were mentioned in the book Australian Rock and Pop music 1960-85 by David Nicholls. In 2018, Tom Kazas produced the compilation albums The Young Person's Guide and Trails to bring the band's music to the digital platforms. ==MembersOriginal lineup=== *Tom Kazas - guitars, lead vocals, mellotron, piano, extras (1984-1989) *David Byrnes - bass guitar, backing vocals, extras (1984-1989) *Nick Potts - organ, harmonica (1984-1985) *Alan Hislop - drums (1984-1986) ===in 1986=== *Mick Duncan - organ, piano *Damon Giles - organ *Brandon Saul - organ ===Last lineup=== *Andrew Byrnes - drums, percussion (1986-1989) *Scott Barnes - keyboards, piano (1987-1989) *David Byrnes - bass guitar, backing vocals, extras (1984-1989) *Tom Kazas - guitars, lead vocals, extras (1984-1989) ==DiscographySingles/albums=== *11 to 5 - demo cassette (1984) *Another Day In The Sun b/w Clarodomineaux - 7\\" vinyl single (1985) *The Moffs - self titled mini album - 12\\" vinyl album (1985) *Flowers b/w By The Breeze - 7\\" vinyl single (1986) *Traveller b/w Quakers Drum - 7\\" vinyl single (1987) *Labyrinth - 12\\" vinyl and CD album (1989) ===Complilations=== *Entomology - album 12\\" vinyl (1987) *Psychadelicatessen - album CD (1994) *the Moffs the Collection - double CD album and booklet (2008) *A Young Person's Guide - digital album - bandcamp (2018) *Trails - digital album - bandcamp (2018) ===Recorded covers=== *Tomorrow Never Knows by The Beatles - on the demo cassette: 11 to 5 (1984) *Eight Miles High by The Byrds - Tribute album: Time In Between, Imaginary Records (1989) *What Do You Do by Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band – recorded for Imaginary Records 1987 (released 2008 on the Moffs the Collection) ==Notable gigsSydney=== *The Freak Out, Darlinghurst *Players, Paddington *Strawberry Hills Hotel, Surry Hills *Trade Union Club, Surry Hills *Harold Park Hotel, Glebe *The Channon Hall, Lismore (regional NSW) ===Melbourne=== *The Prince of Wales, St. Kilda *The Tote, Collingwood *The Punters Club, Fitzroy *Montsalvat, Eltham *The Old Greek Theatre, Richmond ==References *The Moffs Bandcamp Category:Australian rock music groups ","title":"The Moffs (band)"},{"id":"56870810","text":"Sheila D. Minor (born ), formerly Sheila Jones (now Sheila Minor Huff), is a former Biological Research Technician whose 35-year career included positions at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior, and the Smithsonian Institution. == Life and career == Minor earned her bachelor's degree in biological sciences and worked for Clyde Jones at the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. When Minor applied for her first job, at the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, the company insisted she had to be a secretary. Knowing the worth of her knowledge, Minor didn't take that position. She spent two years researching the mammals of Poplar Island, and presented this work at the American Society of Mammalogists meeting in 1975. She earned a master's degree in environmental science at George Mason University and worked with K-12 schools on science education. She ran a Department of Interior office in Chicago. Minor served on the Smithsonian Women's Council. She had a 35-year-long career at various federal bureaus including the Environmental Protection Agency, where she was responsible for assessing environmental impact statements for many projects, ranging from hydroelectric dams to noise abatement procedures. At retirement in 2006, Minor was a senior employee in the Department of the Interior. As of 2018, Huff lives in Virginia, where she is an active member of her church and belly dances for a hobby. == International Conference on the Biology of Whales == Minor's story became a matter of public interest in 2018, when a photograph of conference attendees appeared on Twitter. Sheila Minor was the only woman in the conference's group photo, and the only person labelled as 'not identified'. Candace Jean Anderson, an artist and writer from Salt Lake City, Utah, came across the photograph whilst researching a picture book on the Marine Mammal Protection Act. She took to Twitter to find out who the unidentified woman was, and the tweet went viral. Eventually over 11,000 people answered her initial call for help, including the Smithsonian Institution's Deborah Shapiro. Anderson reached out to Minor on Facebook and the two spoke for a few hours. The photograph was taken at the 1971 International Conference on the Biology of Whales. The conference was attended by almost 40 international scientists and conservationists, and co-organised by Matilene Spencer Berryman and Suzanne Montgomery Contos, who were also uncovered in the Twitter conversation. The photograph was taken by G. Carleton Ray, who remembered Minor by name but had assumed she was an assistant administrator. The story of the \\"mystery whale scientist\\" was covered extensively in the media. Minor's story has drawn comparisons between her and the women in Margot Lee Shetterly's Hidden Figures. == Personal life == Minor lives in Virginia and has five grandchildren. == References == Category:Smithsonian (magazine) people Category:1946 births Category:George Mason University alumni Category:Living people Category:People from Virginia ","title":"Sheila Minor"},{"id":"56870821","text":"Attende, Domine is a Catholic Gregorian chant for the season of Lent, referred to in English as the Lent Prose.

G. Schneider of Chicago around 1891 as convertible open and closed cars for use in summer and winter respectively. == Concept == J. G. Schneider of Chicago invented and patented two types of adjustable car, to meet the demand from many railroads for reconstructing their old cars, and also to accommodate those smaller companies who desired open and closed cars but who did not feel justified in maintaining two full equipments of rolling stock.Schneider's Combination Cars. In: Street Railway Review, 1891, p. 401. One was the winter car which could readily be converted to an open car by the removal of the outer panels, which were made in sections and held in place at the bottom with two dowels and locks, which operated with a button at either side of each panel. These panels had rubber casings to prevent rattle and jar and make them perfectly tight. When the box car became an open one by removing the panels, the seats were turned over so as to face outward, while extending lengthwise as in a closed car. This left space for the conductor to pass through for collections. The panels could be quickly removed, and could be painted when not in use in summer, thus reducing the time car must otherwise spend in shop. To rebuild an open car into closed, an aisle was sawed through the cross seats and the panels put on the outside. In summer the seat thus taken out is replaced and panels removed, when the car resumed its original appearance. The running footboard of the open pattern could be either folded up against the side of the car or removed entirely for the season. Also, the upholstered portion of the seat could be removed when the seat is turned for summer car, and the cushion put away. Models of each type of car were exhibited and described at a convention in Pittsburg in 1891. == References == Category:Streetcar designers Category:Streetcars in Illinois Category:Streetcars articles needing expert attention Category:Rolling stock manufacturers of the United States ","title":"Schneider's Combination Cars"},{"id":"56871000","text":"Margaret Christian Grigor (March 2, 1912, Forres, Scotland – December 1, 1981, Steilacoom, Washington, US) was a prolific sculptor and medalist, working in metal, wood, stone, plaster and plasteline. Grigor was elected to the National Sculpture Society in 1963. In 1969 she won the Lindsey Morris Prize for best bas-relief from the National Sculpture Society. She was chosen for important commissions including the Garvan Medal for women chemists, the Alaska and Hawaii Medal for the 71st issue of the Society of Medalists, and the 75th Anniversary Medal of the National Sculpture Society. She also created a medal of Alexander Hamilton for the Hall of Fame for Great Americans in New York City, and an official Bicentennial medal. ==Life== Margaret Christian Grigor was born on March 2, 1912, in Forres, Scotland. Her father was William W. Grigor. Her parents were American and returned with her to the United States when she was a child. Grigor studied at Mount Holyoke College, earning her B.A. in history of art in 1934. She then studied art with Walker Hancock and Albert Laessle at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA). During World War II, Grigor served in the Women's Army Corps. After the war, she and her mother and a distant cousin and fellow WAC, Edna Hudnell, lived together in New York City for ten years. They then moved to Steilacoom, Washington on the coast of Puget Sound for health reasons. ==Career== Grigor was a sculptor in metal, wood and stone and a prolific medalist. Several of her medals have received particular attention. She exhibited at the Annual Exhibition of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Speaking of her work, she once stated, \\"I sculpt so that I can hold my head up high. People don't have to like what I do, but they recognize me as a sculptor. That is what I am.\\" ===Garvan Medal=== In 1937, Grigor created the Garvan Medal for the American Chemical Society. That a woman sculptor was selected to create the medal was particularly fitting, since it is recognizes distinguished women in the field of chemistry. The design features a torch of knowledge on one side, with the recipient's name, and a cauldron, caduceus, and industrial buildings on the observe. The resulting medal is considered one of her best and most original designs. ===Alaska and Hawaii=== Grigor's Medal for Alaska and Hawaii was chosen by the Society of Medalists for its 71st issue, in 1965. For this medal, Grigor chose to celebrate the addition of two new cultures to the United States. One side of the medal shows two Eskimo men ice-fishing and cutting blocks of ice, while the other side shows two Native Hawaiians women working, grinding poi and mending a woven mat. 909 copies were struck. ===75th Anniversary Medal, National Sculpture Society=== Grigor was selected to create the reverse of the 75th Anniversary Medal of the National Sculpture Society (NSS) in 1968. The front was created by Thomas Gaetano LoMedico. The reverse shows sculptor's tools being passed from one hand to another, in front of a rough pylon to be sculpted, with the motto \\"To further the sculptural heritage.\\" The medal was struck by Medallic Art Company (1900–1990) at the Danbury Mint, and distributed by the National Sculpture Society. === United States Bicentennial contest === Grigor competed in a national contest, conducted by the Treasury Department and judged by the National Sculpture Society for the United States Bicentennial. After being selected, Grigor created an official Bicentennial medal for the United States Mint, portraying Paul Reveres ride and the battles at Lexington and Concord. ==Awards and honors== * 1972, Alumnae Association award, Mount Holyoke College * 1969, Lindsey Morris Prize, National Sculpture Society * 1963, elected member, National Sculpture Society * 1939, Stimson Prize * 1937, Cresson Traveling Scholarship, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts ==References== Category:1912 births Category:1981 deaths Category:20th-century American women artists Category:American medallists Category:American women sculptors Category:People from Steilacoom, Washington Category:Sculptors from Washington (state) ","title":"Margaret Christian Grigor"},{"id":"56871033","text":"Launched in 2014, Justice Centre Hong Kong is an independent, non-profit human rights organisation that focuses on the protection of refugees and asylum seekers in Hong KongAnderson, J.; and Li, A. (2017): ‘Fake Refugees’ or ‘Victims of Trafficking’? Vulnerable Migrants in Hong Kong and the Boundaries between Refugee and Human Trafficking Experiences. International Seminar on Mixed Migration in Southeast and East Asia. http://un- act.org/publication/view/fake-refugees-victims-trafficking-vulnerable- migrants-hong-kong-boundaries-refugee-human-trafficking-experiences/. Hong Kong has long been a hub of migration and refuge due to wars in the region and Hong Kong’s historical role as a trading and transit entrepôt. There were estimated to be 14,000 refugees in the territory in 2017, and these refugees are in need of extensive legal assistance as the 0.8 substantiation rate is extremely low compared to rates of 25-62% per cent in other developed jurisdictions. Before early 2014 the organisation was known as the Hong Kong Refugee Advice Centre (HKRAC), which in 2007 had grown out of the Refugee Advice Unit from another local organisation working with refugees, Christian Action. And spun off by human rights lawyers Jennifer Stone and Raquel Amador, who were the first Directors. In 2012 Aleta Miller became Executive Director, helping HKRAC win the Clifford Chance Foundation Access to Justice Award in 2012, and relaunching the organisation as Justice Centre Hong Kong in 2014. From 2015-2020 the Executive Director was Piya Muqit, who was previously head of policy and advocacy at UNICEF UK . The organisation works with civil society partners to champion the rights of persons seeking protection in Hong Kong through research and advocacy work. In addition, it provides legal and psychosocial assistance to asylum seekers, as with the very low acceptance rate of legal aid applications in Hong Kong most asylum seekers are otherwise forced to represent themselves. They also carry out evidence based policy work to try to influence and improve government policies towards their clients. Their 'Coming Clean\\" report in 2016 found more than 80 percent of the territory's 336,600 domestic workers are exploited, with one in six a victim of forced labour. Providing the first quantitative data on trafficking this gave Hong Kong a very low ranking on the Global Slavery Index, and pushing Hong Kong onto the Tier 2 Watch List of the US State Department’s Trafficking in Persons report. == Hong Kong UPR Coalition == Founded in 2017 for the third cycle of the United Nations Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process, the Hong Kong UPR Coalition was facilitated by Justice Centre Hong Kong to represent the collaborative efforts of different civil society groups to advance human rights in Hong Kong . Comprising 45 non-governmental organisations from across the Hong Kong spectrum, it has been directed by the Hong Kong UPR Coalition Steering Committee, which consists of nine members, namely Civil Human Rights Front, Disabilities CV, The Hong Kong Society for Asylum-Seekers and Refugees, Hong Kong Watch, Justice Centre Hong Kong, Les Corner Empowerment Association, PEN Hong Kong, Pink Alliance and Planet Ally. During previous UPR hearings, not one recommendation had been issued on Hong Kong . Through the efforts of the coalition in bringing together many voices in civil society together, in the 2018 hearing there were seven recommendations on Hong Kong, with five other references through questions in advance and statements, raising international attention on the deterioration of rights in Hong Kong. In total 12 countries used the UPR hearing to highlight their concerns with the human rights environment in Hong Kong. In response to the questions raised the China and Hong Kong Government have stated that they were willing to accept all but one of the recommendations , now enabling this and future UPR processes to be used as an advocacy tool that can be used to hold the Hong Kong government to account. == Reference  External links == * Official website Category:Human rights organisations based in Hong Kong Category:Human rights in Hong Kong Category:Organizations established in 2007 Hong Kong Hong Kong ","title":"Justice Centre Hong Kong"},{"id":"56871054","text":"Danuka Prabath (born 19 January 1994) is a Sri Lankan cricketer.

Seven people – five soldiers and two policemen – were killed, and the only survivor of the incident was severely injured. The patrol boat C23 was repaired and it returned to service, later being renamed P23. It was decommissioned in 2010 and it now remains at the AFM base at Hay Wharf as a memorial to those killed in the explosion. ==Background== The patrol boat C23 was originally built as PCF 813, a Mark II Patrol Craft Fast for the United States Navy. It was one of two Swift boats which were donated to Malta, the other being PCF 816. Both boats arrived in Malta's Grand Harbour on 6 February 1971 on board the USS Wood County, and were designated as C-6823 and C-6824 respectively. The official handover ceremony took place on 5 April 1971, and they were designated C23 and C24. They were the first vessels to be operated by the Maritime Troop of the Malta Land Force upon its establishment in November 1970. The Maritime Troop was renamed a number of times, acquiring its present name Maritime Squadron of the Armed Forces of Malta in 1980. ==Explosion== The explosion took place on 7 September 1984, during a routine operation while dumping illegal fireworks about off Qala Point in Gozo. The fireworks had been seized by The Malta Police Force from the limits of Żabbar a day earlier. The exact cause of the explosion is not known, but it is believed to have occurred when a spark caused by the closing of a hatch blew up the fireworks that were on the boat's deck. Five soldiers and two policemen on the boat were killed, leaving only one survivor who managed to beach the boat on the island of Comino and raise the alarm despite being injured. The deceased were aged between 20 and 36. ==Aftermath== P23 laid up at Hay Wharf in 2013, with the Protector-class P51 moored nearby Five of the seven bodies were found after the explosion, three by a helicopter and two by a patrol boat. The bodies retrieved by the helicopter were taken to the Gozo General Hospital. The day after the incident, 8 September (a public holiday, Victory Day), was declared as a day of national mourning. The bodies were brought to Malta on board the patrol boats C28 and C29, and they were given a military funeral which was attended by thousands of people. The flag-draped coffins left St. Luke's Hospital, and the funeral was led by a 48-man guard of honour from the AFM's Task Force. The explosion caused a change in policy, with fireworks no longer being carried on patrol boats but on towed barges. Today, disposal of illegal explosives is no longer carried out by AFM patrol boats. The damaged patrol boat C23 was towed to the Manoel Island Yacht Yard, where it was repaired by having its bow rebuilt. It subsequently reentered service with the Maritime Squadron. It was later renamed P23, and it was decommissioned on 18 April 2010. The boat is now located at the Squadron's base at Hay Wharf in Floriana as a memorial. Its sister ship C24 (later renamed P24) was decommissioned at the same time and it was donated to the Maritime Museum of San Diego in 2011. A monument was built at Hay Wharf shortly after the event, and a new one was unveiled on the occasion of the 25th anniversary in 2009. Another memorial is located at the Maritime Museum of San Diego. The explosion was the worst peacetime tragedy suffered by the Armed Forces and the Police. ==References Category:1984 in Malta Category:Explosions in 1984 Category:September 1984 events in Europe Category:Explosions in Malta Category:Fireworks accidents and incidents Category:Illegal fireworks operations Category:Maritime incidents in 1984 Category:Maritime incidents in Malta Category:Non-combat naval accidents Category:Qala, Malta ","title":"C23 tragedy"},{"id":"56871083","text":"Events in the year 1946 in Taiwan, Republic of China. ==IncumbentsEvents== * 5 May - Nationalist government came back to Nanking. ==Births== * 7 April - Chan Wa-yen, flyweight athlete * 16 June - Ang Ui-jin, linguist ==References== Category:Years of the 20th century in Taiwan ","title":"1946 in Taiwan"},{"id":"56871113","text":"Noah Elliott (born July 12, 1997) is a Paralympic snowboarder who competed for the United States at the 2018 Winter Paralympics and his daughter’s name is Skylar.

New York: St Martins's Press. He assigned the first line of each poem as the song title, Emily Dickinson having not titled any of the pieces. The exception is \\"The Chariot\\", which was Dickinson's original published title. Each song is dedicated to a composer friend. The sequence, with dedicatees, is: # Nature, the Gentlest Mother (David Diamond) #There Came a Wind Like a Bugle (Elliott Carter) #Why Do They Shut Me Out of Heaven? (Ingolf Dahl) #The World Feels Dusty (Alexei Haieff) #Heart, We Will Forget Him! (Marcelle de Manziarly) #Dear March, Come In!

(Lukas Foss) #The Chariot (Arthur Berger) Copland himself acknowledged that many have heard the influence of Charles Ives, Gustav Mahler, and Gabriel Fauré in the songs. In his own memoirs, he made the link between Dickinson's and Mahler's preoccupation with death, however he stated that he recognized no direct musical influence.Copland and Perlis (1989) Nonetheless, writers have frequently cited the fifth song in particular, \\"Heart, We Will Forget Him!\\" as being Copland at his most Mahlerian. This is perhaps even more evident the orchestral setting, which he began in 1958. Completed in 1970, Eight Poems of Emily Dickinson for small orchestra omits 3, 8, 9 and 10 from the original sequence.

Set in modern Manila amid the war on drugs, it tells the story of Irma (Eula Valdez), a hitwoman who trains the young orphan Toto (Timothy Castillo) to become a professional assassin. It premiered at the 2017 Quezon City International Film Festival from October 20–28, before having a Philippine theatrical release on March 13, 2019. The Hollywood Reporter described the film as a \\"slick thriller\\". ==Plot== In modern Manila amid the war on drugs, street orphan Toto (Timothy Castillo) raises money in an effort to bail out his imprisoned brother Kiko, who is terrified that the gang involved in an illegal drug trade he is running might be plotting to kill him. When Toto finds out that, indeed, he and his brother have become targets of assassination by local gangsters as well as corrupt officers, he is rescued by Irma (Eula Valdez), a professional hitwoman who introduces herself as a friend of his dead mother, with whom she spent time as a hawker of counterfeit goods. Irma's assignments are set up by a corrupt police officer named \\"Sarge\\". Although occupied with another assignment, Irma offers Toto refuge and she trains him to become an assassin; Toto, then, comes to see Irma as a surrogate mother. ==Cast== *Eula Valdez as Irma *Timothy Castillo as Toto *Rocky Salumbides as Raul ==Production== Neomanila was the third feature film of writer-director Mikhail Red, the first two being Rekorder (2013) and Birdshot (2016). According to Red, he had the idea for Neomanila after watching an interview conducted by the BBC, which had gone viral, of a married couple who both worked as hitmen at night. He added that his research mainly involved visiting Manila Police District precincts and recording violent events late at night: \\"We would hang around near the police station—Nightcrawler level. We would go to the actual crime scenes, and I recorded a lot on my phone.\\" Principal photography on the film began August 2017 and lasted 11 days, which is a relatively short schedule compared to the two-year period Red spent completing Birdshot. Although Red believes that shooting for two years is optimal for a production schedule, he elected releasing Neomanila immediately that year because he felt that extrajudicial killings (EJK), especially during the Philippine Drug War, were a \\"very relevant\\" subject tackled in the film, and shooting in that period would eliminate its significance. The film was photographed by Birdshot cinematographer Mycko David, whom Red compared favorably to Roger Deakins. Aesthetically, Red shot the film with the Arri Alexa utilizing the cinéma vérité technique, emphasizing mostly hand-held camera movements. He prefers that his films deliver a \\"strong social commentary\\" by using genre, explaining that \\"It's a better way of reaching more people and getting your message across\\". Red insists that Neomanila is devoid of any political statement, and he believes that whether the characters' decisions are \\"moral\\" is best left for audiences to contemplate: > I guess what makes it different from most EJK-themed films—and there's a lot > being done now—is the perspective. It's basically about people caught in the > middle of the drug war, literally, because they're the middlemen. They're > morally ambiguous. I'm always interested in that, where you have very > likable criminals, going up against corrupt cops. It's very gray. You don’t > know: Who’s good? Who’s bad? Is this justified? I wouldn't say it's > political because even the characters themselves, they're unaware, oblivious > to the politics of it. They don't talk about the politics of the whole > situation. They just do it for the money. It's like a lens, looking at the > whole situation, and it keeps throwing questions at the audience. It's up to > you to decide: is this moral?

The review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 100 percent (based on five reviews) and a weighted average of 8 out of 10. Clarence Tsui for The Hollywood Reporter called the film a \\"slick thriller\\", extending praise to Eula Valdez's against-type role and Tim Castillo's \\"nuanced performance\\".

The main house is modern but is listed because it incorporates some features from the original 18th century mansion. Warneford Place dates back to at least the 17th century, and was home to the Warneford family. That family, although often impoverished, had been established in the area since around the 12th century and owned much of its land. The house was often empty and neglected. In 1902, there was an auction of the Warneford Place Estate and its contents. It has been grade II listed (as Warnford Place) since 1979. It was home to Frederick Banbury, 1st Baron Banbury of Southam, who died there in 1936. In 1960, the James Bond author Ian Fleming bought the \\"demolished Warneford Place\\", and built a new house which he named Sevenhampton Place, incorporating some elements of the original building. He did not move in until the new house was completed in 1963 and spent little time there. He died in 1964, aged 56, and is buried in the Sevenhampton churchyard, along with his wife Ann and son Caspar. His widow Ann Fleming lived at Sevenhampton Place until she died there on 12 July 1981. In 1987, the house was bought by the businessman Paddy McNally for £7 million. In 2004, the house was robbed by The Johnson Gang, who stole items to the value of £750,000. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in Wiltshire Category:Grade II listed houses Category:Country houses in Wiltshire ","title":"Warneford Place"},{"id":"56871192","text":"Gurimu Narita (born 1 February 1994) is a Japanese disabled snowboarder.

Key parameters for engine oil viscometrics are the oil's kinematic viscosity, its high temperature-high shear viscosity measured by the tapered bearing simulator, and low temperature properties measured by the cold-cranking simulator and mini-rotary viscometer. This standard is commonly used throughout the world, and standards organizations that do so include API and ILSAC, and ACEA. ==Viscosity grades== SAE viscosity grades include 0W through 25W in increments of 5W, 8 through 20 in increments of 4, and 20 through 60 in increments of 10. The former grades denote a multigrade engine oil's low-temperature properties (W denoting \\"winter\\"), whereas the latter grades denote an engine oil's properties at the operating temperature of an engine. To illustrate, a lawnmower may require SAE 30 monograde engine oil that must meet the SAE 30 requirements. In comparison, a contemporary passenger car engine may require SAE 0W-20 multigrade engine oil that must meet both the SAE 0W and SAE 20 requirements.

A Customer Segment or a group of individuals is formed that allows the company to identify and reach out to customers (current or potential) with similar needs and expectations from the product or service. This movement can be a result of any event or actions led by the company or the customer himself. The first can be a resultant of marketing campaigns, messages and targeting, while the second can occur if there is change in customer preferences, income, or as a response to the marketing campaign that may or may not have touched the target audience. In the fast-moving world today, one of the best ways to understand customer behavior is by analyzing the customer migration pattern. This phenomenon has prevailed within us over a long period of time, along with some steady buyers, there are customer who are always in motion. ==Reason to Study the Patterns== There are several migration patterns, it can a movement from economy class to business and to first class eventually. Also, with an initial purchase of a single product and later turning into a buyer of several different products. Learning and examination of the migration patterns can serve many tasks of the company, like customer loyalty and retention, brand loyalty, revenue and sales maximization and even the analysis of return on investment. These patterns can help evaluating different segments and the way to contact them effectively. With the promotion done to these segments on the basis of their shared characteristics, it is more likely for a product to showcase greater success rate. ==Measuring the Customer Migration== To measure and analyze the migration patterns, a number of approaches can be followed. It can start either by deciding segments and dividing the population in those buckets according to their behavior patterns at the beginning and end of the period to measure the displacement. Example: Loyalists, Under performs, Seasonal, Onetime and two-time buyers and Inactive buyers. Another approach is to form a group of people with shared interests and purchase patterns as one segment, and later analyze their movements and migration after the end of the period. ==References== Category:Customer relationship management ","title":"Customer migration"},{"id":"56871334","text":"John Johnstone (1768–1836) was a British physician and biographer. ==Life== The sixth son of James Johnstone (1730?–1802) MD and his wife Hannah Crane, and brother of Edward Johnstone and James Johnstone (1753–1783), he was born in Kidderminster, where his father was practising.

There, the Weinsberg Forest branches off, while the main chain swings north to the Tischstein and Nebelstein. In all the summit region approximates the shape of an ellipse and forms the northern boundary of the Granite and Gneiss Highland. Its highest mountain is the Viehberg near Sandl which reaches 1,112 metres, but another 16 mountains exceed 1,000 metres in height. Of these, 13 lie on Austrian soil and 3 in Bohemia. The area of the mountains on the Czech side of the border is 162 km². Their highest point is the Kamenec (Steinberg, ) in the Pohorská foothills and in the municipality of Pohorská Ves. The Freiwald is a major part of the natural region of the Freiwald and Weinsberg Forest. The Lower Austrian part of the Freiwald is defined as a rural subregion (Teilraum) according to the conservation concept of the state.http://www.noe.gv.at/noe/Naturschutz/Naturschutzkonzept_Februar_2015.pdf After die Wende, a nature park was established called the Novohradské hory with many natural attractions like the Terčino údolí, Žofínský prales (Sophien-Urwald) and Hojná Voda (Heilbrunn). The region has remained largely unspoilt. As a result of its location on the Iron Curtain, the German Bohemians were forced out of the area after the Second World War and it remained inaccessible to tourists. After the border re-opened the trails were waymarked again and tourist infrastructure built. About three quarters of the region is covered in coniferous and deciduous forest.

She was mentored by John Latham and exhibited alongside The Artist Placement Group. She is best known for her landscape works combining installation, text and imagery. ==Life and Education== Yates studied fine art at Manchester Regional College of Art from 1957 to 1959. She also pursued Degrees in Fine Art at Hornsey College of Art(1968-1971) and The Royal College of Art (1971-1973). She also studied Social Anthropology at University College London (1977/8), and earned her master's degree in Fine Art from Goldsmith's College of Art in 1981. In 1989 Yates received a Master of Arts Degree from the University of Derby in Photographic Studies. Marie Yates' artistic career began in the late 1960s, creating abstract paintings in her studio in Cornwall. Rejecting the ideal American Modernist aesthetic, she chose to begin exploring and developing her own perception of Modernism in a societal context. Experimenting with minimal installations, she still felt limited by her status as a female artist. Throughout the 70's the artist turned to the Conceptual art movement and became known for her incorporation of landscape images and text to her works, for which she received much acclaim. She began teaching fine art and photography in 1971 at a variety of major art colleges in the United Kingdom, including The Royal College of Art, Chelsea College of Arts, and University of the Arts London. She retired from teaching in 1991 and left England to live in Greece that same year, where she has lived since. == Career == Yates started off as an abstract painter in the 1960s, working in her own studio in St. Ives Cornwall. Seeing the inequalities of the art world at the time she went to school and pursued a degree in Fine Art in an attempt to explore the issue. She turned to the conceptual art movement trying to find a new way of being a woman artist; Many institutions placed dominance primarily on males, leaving female artists in secondary positions. During the early 1970s, she focused on the dynamics between text and image through the use of photography, allowing her to accomplish explorations in landscape, images of other women, representation, and sexual politics. From 1978 onward, her works started taking a turn in the themes of ideology, sexual differences, and fantasy with montages and mixed media. Her work emphasizes her views towards art as a social construction rather than an aesthetic. In the late 1990s she began to expand her explorations in media with digital techniques. By the 1990s, Yates' work was being exhibited throughout England, taking a part in many major galleries such as Riverside Studios and The Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA, London). She also participated in a number of exhibitions in the US and Europe, including the New Museum. Her works are in the collections of Tate, Arts Council, and The British Council. == Notable Artworks  The Field Workings (1971-1974)=== A project that was conceived in March of the year 1971 after emerging from Hornsey College, an installation project with slides that a documentation of journeys made in the West Country landscape. It was well received by many and led to Yates receiving small grants, commissions and shows for these works that were soon developed into gallery installations. Starting out from London the initial project lasted three years was made possible by John Latham and his family who would occasionally make their Barn at the Buckfastleigh as a centre. This project consisted of thirteen Field Working Documents, with them being thoroughly planned and researched ahead of time. The research involved heavy studies of the Ordnance Survey Maps, train and bus timetables, and a variety of historical maps. In the process Yates was able to discover remote areas that would have otherwise been likely untouched. This project later influenced other works that involved journeys in different areas of England, Wales, and Scotland. Each of these journeys was accompanied by numerous people. The main intention was to document an event that did not happen as it was-epiphanous. Yates found importance in constructing a story and used literal and visual narration to express non existent events; the sense that one traveled, one arrived, then left, the place remained the same, as if no one had ever been there. In her later years she began to question the hierarchical relation between the viewer and the artist, never including her own image, began to make it so that one becomes aware of looking and being looked. George Brecht’s technique in distanciation inspired Yates to use her work to place the viewer in a sense of reality. The use of a realistic atmosphere helped Yates in emphasizing the importance of representation. As a result, the project was able to present tensions between the construction of meaning and representation. === The Field/Music/Performances (1973)=== An improvised musical piece based on a score by Marie Yates with primitive forms references, sounds and symbols, as well as natural phenomena such as with Rain in The Face along with several other friends and characters. The work took place at The Midland Group Gallery and was part of the Field Workings Exhibit in the Arnolfini Gallery. === Signals (1975-1978) === \\"Signals\\" was constructed for the exhibition Artists Over Land at the Arnolfini Gallery in 1975. This piece marked a significant shift in works of landscape. Curated by Lucy R. Lippard in Chicago and New York, the installation work was formed by three new pieces: A wall, a slide, and a documentation piece. In this piece the spectator held the prime role. While the documentation piece was created beforehand, the wall and slide pieces were made on site. Yates explained that the three parts of the installation and their relationship to one another all stressed the function of time. The part of the artwork that was mounted on the exhibit wall consisted of 28 texts and one color photograph arranged in the perimeter of a rectangle. Yates related this arrangement to that of the four sides of a field. === Image/woman/text (1979) === The creation of this artwork was a response to an invitation by Lucy R. Lippard to the artist to be featured in the international exhibition named ISSUE: Social Strategies by women artists, which exhibited work that dealt with specific social and political issues such as concerns with health, ecology, unemployment, war alienation, schooling and violence against women. \\"Image/woman/text\\" consists of a series of photographs on two panels. One of these was xeroxed and painted over as a means of reducing the information to the observer. The second panel used the same images with high gloss and restoring the information that was obstructed on the left panel. It is also important to know that the images chosen by the artist are also documentary images of women. Yates explained these choices in her art piece as way of addressing that often images of women are \\"notoriously malleable\\", and subject women to merely becoming \\"signs emptied of meaning\\". === The Time and the Energy (1982) === Marie Yates created this photo essay after being invited by photographers Victor Brugin and John Tagg to participate in the first issue of a journal titled Formations, which would be focused on feminist and social cultural theory, history and debate. \\"The Time and the Energy\\" was featured in this issue, titled \\"Formations of Pleasure\\" and released in 1983. The artist stated that this art piece addressed \\"filmic pleasures\\". ==Selected exhibitions== *Resolution is not the point. 2017, Photo50, curated by Hemera Collective, London Art Fair *Some Dimensions of my lunch, 2016, Richard Saltoun Gallery, London *The sun went in, the fire went out, 2016, Chelsea Space, London. *Throwing Stones, 2016, Arnolfini, Bristol *Vigilance: An Exhibition of Artists Books, 2014 Artists Space, New York *Mixed Show, 2014, Royal West of England Academy, Bristol *Hidden in Plain Site, 2013 Plymouth City Museum, Plymouth *TAPS: Paul Burwell, 2010 Matts Gallery, London *A Daughters View, 1991/3, Arts Council Touring *Other Than Itself, 1989/91 *Image in Trouble, 1984, The Pavilion Gallery Leeds *Marie Yates and Yve Lomax, 1984, The Untitled Gallery Sheffield *Beyond the Purloined Image, 1983, Riverside Gallery London *Sense and Sensibility in Feminist Art Practices, 1982, Midland Group Gallery Nottingham *Light Reading - Work by Five Woman, 1980, B2 Gallery London *ISSUE: Social Strategies by Women Artists, 1980, ICA London *Both Sides Now, 1979, Artemisia Gallery, Chicago *Art from the British Left, 1979, Artists Space New York *Time Words and the Camera, 1976, British Council Tour Europe *Artists Over Land1975, Arnolfini Gallery Bristol *An Element of Landscape, 1974, Arts Council Travelling Exhibition *Marie Yates: The Field Workings - Arnolfini Gallery, 1973, Bristol *Marie Yates: Recent Field Workings, 1973, Midland Group Gallery, Nottingham *Marie Yates:Installations, 1971, Brunel University *INNO 70 - Artists Placement Group 1971, Hayward Gallery, London == References == Category:British women artists Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:British expatriates in Greece Category:People from Leigh, Greater Manchester Category:Alumni of the University of Derby Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Alumni of the Royal College of Art Category:British installation artists ","title":"Marie Yates"},{"id":"56871631","text":"Physical map of Austria: north of the Danube is the Gneiss and Granite Highland outlined in green The Gneiss and Granite Plateau (, also called the Granite and Gneiss Highland (Granit- und Gneishochland), is one of the five major landscapes in Austria.

For the entire length of the line cuts averaged about 40,000 cu. yds. per mile ( per km), and for several miles the road was a succession of cuts and fills. The deepest cut was midway of the line and was deep. Owing to the peculiar holding qualities of the clay in which the cuts were made, the slope of the banks was made ¼ to 1, which is quite in contrast to the practice of 1½ to 1 elsewhere. R. N. Towl, of Omaha was in charge of the construction.The Omaha & Southern Interurban Railway. In: The Street Railway Journal. Volume 29, January to June 1907, p. 874. The line was planned to be extended to Plattsmouth, about south of Fort Crook, the initial southern terminus. This fort was a government post, and usually four or five companies were stationed at it. The line was built on private right of way wide. Fills for single track were wide at the top and cuts were wide at the bottom. Oak ties and 70-lb. per yard (35 kg/m) rails were used. == Electric infrastructure == Span trolley construction was employed. The poles, which were of cedar, were spaced apart, and those on one side of the track were high enough to carry high-tension cross-arms. The butts were treated with a tar compound, the bi-product obtained in the manufacture of artificial gas. A lightning arrester was installed every quarter mile. Initially, power was obtained direct from the direct-current power house of the Omaha & Council Bluffs Street Railway Company. As the terminus of the line is from the power house, a booster was employed, which raised the voltage at the power house to 825 Volts. The booster set consisted of two 100-kW Edison bi-polar generators. The winding of the one serving as a motor was unchanged. The voltage of the other has been halved and the amperage doubled by connecting the armature leads so as to give two independent circuits paralleled by the brushes. Plans contemplated a sub-station in South Omaha for the city lines and power for the interurban line to be obtained from this. == Operation == An hourly service was ordinarily maintained by one car, but during the summer season three were scheduled to be operated. The cars used were long, seated forty-four people, and were equipped with four G. E. 67 motors. They were maintained in the shops of the Omaha & Council Bluffs Street Railway. == See also == * Omaha Southern Railway == References == Category:South Omaha, Nebraska Category:Interurban railways in Nebraska Category:Streetcars articles needing expert attention ","title":"Omaha and Southern Interurban Railway"},{"id":"56871758","text":"Lanjera is a village in Dhar Kalan in Gurdaspur district of Punjab State, India.

A disciple of Torcuato Cayón, he was one of the most important Neoclassical architects in Andalusia, designing several of the most prominent buildings in Cádiz. These include the Royal Prison, the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul and the Ayuntamiento (town hall). ==Biography== Torcuato José Benjumeda y Laguada was born in El Puerto de Santa María on 4 January 1757. The son of Miguel Benjumeda and María Laguada (married in the Priory Church, El Puerto de Santa María in 1756). His father was born in Málaga, son of Francisco Benjumea and Ana Francisca de Gálves, and his mother was a native of San Pedayna in Genoa, daughter of Cayetano Laguada and Rosa Bertorela. Baptized on 9 January in the Priory Church, Benjumeda's godfather was the architect Torcuato Cayón. He married Candida Martinez de Pinillos in the church of Iglesia de San Juan Bautista (Chiclana de la Frontera) on 15 August 1789. The couple had five children. The family moved to Cádiz where they lived at 198 Plazuela de la Cruz Verde. Benjumeda was commissioned to design the Cádiz Town Hall. He died in Cadiz on 15 April 1836. ==Career== In 1781, at the age of 24, Benjumeda replaced Torcuato Cayón as Maestro mayor de obras (master of works). In 1789 he was appointed Teniente de Arquitectura de la academia de las Nobles Artes de Cádiz (assuming responsibility for architecture at the Cádiz academy). His studio was at 169 calle Murguía (today Cánovas del Castillo). During the Siege of Cádiz, he was a second lieutenant in the artillery battalion (26 September 1809), promoted to lieutenant in 1821 and to captain on 23 December 1829. In 1973, he became an académico de mérito de San Fernando (honorable academic of San Fernando), president of the Academy of Cádiz and the city's principal architect during the heights of its economic and political splendor. In Cádiz he designed the Puerta de Tuerra, Iglesia del Rosario, Iglesia de San José and Iglesia de San Pablo. He completed the Oratorio de la Santa Cueva, initiated by Torcuato Cayón in 1781. Benjumeda also designed the facade of the town hall, the cemetery, and several private houses. The work best reflecting his Neoclassical style is, however, the Royal Prison (1794). Outside of Cádiz, he built the Iglesia de San Juan Bautista in Chiclana de la Frontera, and the Iglesia de San José in Puerto Real. He participated in the design of the Casa consistorial de San Fernando and designed the Market and the Pier of Puerto Real. He also created the Neoclassical altar in the Priory Church at El Puerto de Santa María. A black spot occurred in the life of Benjumeda in connection with the Plaza de Toros of Cadiz in 1820. As city architect, he was relieved of his post and salary until he was rehabilitated in 1824. In 1833, he requested permission from the City Council for a leave of absence on health grounds, as he recovered from a nervous breakdown. His substitute was his son Francisco de Paula, who had been appointed assistant on 30 March 1829. Torcuato Benjumeda died on 15 April 1836, in considerable debt despite his achievements. He was given a second class funeral and buried in Puertas de Tierra outside the city limits of Cádiz. ==Gallery== File:Ayuntamiento 145.jpgAyuntamiento, Cádiz File:Carcelcadiz2.JPGCárcel Real, Cádiz File:Iglesia Mayor San Fernando.JPGIglesia Mayor de San Pedro y San Pablo, San Fernando File:Torre del Reloj (plaza).jpgPlaza mayor, Chiclana de la Frontera File:Iglesia de la Conversión de San Pablo, Cádiz.JPGIglesia de San Pablo, Cádiz File:Iglesia de San Jose.jpgIglesia de San José, Cádiz File:Mercado central de abastos, Cádiz.jpgCentral Market, Cádiz File:Iglesia del Rosario 265.jpgIglesia del Rosario, Cádiz ==ReferencesBibliography=== * Teodoro Falcón Márquez: Torcuato Benjumeda y la Arquitectura Neoclásica en Cádiz.

The species was first described by Francis Walker in 1860. A widespread Asian species, it is found around Indo-Australian tropics from India, Sri Lanka and Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, New Guinea to Australian Queensland and the Solomon Islands. ==Description== The wingspan of the adult is 3 cm. Its ground colour is fawn with a brown fasciations with complex patterns. A blurry dark blotch is found near the middle of each forewing. The caterpillar has a dull, pale yellow dorsum and fuscous ventral side with pink suffusion. A rusty colour appears towards the posterior end. Setae arise from black dots. Pupation occurs within a silken cell woven between leaves. ==Biology== It is a polyphagous species. The caterpillar has been recorded from several plant species of many families. Host plants include Bombax ceiba, Terminalia, Artemisia vulgaris, Shorea, Aleurites, Phyllanthus, Albizia, Eucalyptus, Lantana camara, Sambucus, Uncaria gambir, Cassia, Indigofera, Leucaena, Allium, Eugenia, Syzygium, Champereia, Grevillea robusta, Anthocephalus, Coffea arabica, Elettaria cardamomum, Camellia sinensis, Gliricidia sepium, Citrus, Schleichera, Theobroma cacao, Taxodium, Gmelina, Vernicia montana and Tectona grandis. Caterpillars feed on the epidermis of tender leaves causing holes on leaves. Mature caterpillars tend to feed leaves with small pieces started from margins and then eat the leaf entirely. They are mostly active during early morning and night. ==Control== It is a minor pest of tea. However, caterpillars can be removed by hand picking or other mechanical methods. Adults are attracted to light and pheromones. If the outbreak is heavy, insecticides such as trichlorfon, chlorfluazuron or tebufenozide can be applied to eradicate immature stages of the caterpillar. Using biological control, China has successfully experimented with viruses like nuclear polyhedrosis virus against larval stages.

It is found in the Niger River, in the same region as congeners Pelvicachromis pulcher and Pelvicachromis taeniatus. It was described by Anton Lamboj in 2013. Prior to its formal description it was relatively common in the aquarium fish hobby, denoted as either a subspecies of Pelvicachromis subocellatus or as an undescribed species similar to P. subocelatus, Pelvicachromis sp. aff. subocellatus. Lamboj concurs that it is more closely related to P. subocellatus than to other Pelvocachromis species and regards it as part of the P. subocellatus group within the genus Pelvicachromis. Lamboj named P. silviae after his wife Silvia, to thank her for supporting his scientific work. Although similar in appearance to P. subocellatus and the more common P. pulcher, it has a deeper body than either species. The main body color is pale or yellowish brown, with a dark horizontal stripe across the middle of its body and a second dark stripe beneath the dorsal fin. The dark stripes can fade under certain circumstances, such as dominance displays and courtship, and at times vertical bands can appear on the body, particularly while caring for fry. Males have more pointed fins and females have a metallic band on their dorsal fin. Males have a red and white margins on the top of the dorsal fin and on the top rear edge of the caudal fin, and the anal fin is red with many blue dots. The female has a red or purple belly, which becomes brighter and edged in iridescent white or blue during courtship. Males can grow to up to long, excluding the caudal fin. It is a cave spawner similar to other Pelvicachromis species. Soft, mildly acidic water is beneficial for breeding, although they can breed in hard, slightly alkaline water. Both parents guard the eggs and fry until they are 5 to 8 weeks old, although the female does so more intensely.

In: The Street Railway Journal. Volume 29, No 12, p. 494. At the race track was a loading yard, which was long by about wide, enclosed in a picket fence high. At one end was a loading shed long and wide, and from which several gates gave entrance to the grounds. The loading yards contained storage tracks for twenty-five cars. All the cars going to the races were put in special service and no fares are collected on them. Instead, the fares were collected as the passengers went through the gates leading into the grounds. At the end of the races about twenty-five cars are waiting in the loading yard and fares are collected as passengers passed through the gates. Four cars were drawn up to the loading platform at a time and were started out at close intervals.

It originally took the name of Kilmannon in 1886 and down through the years had the names of Brownstown, Baldwinstown, Duncormick, Cleariestown, Redmoor and Scar representing the parish, sometimes even against one another. The name St Anne's was first mooted in the parish in 1932 and with a few brief exceptions that name has stayed with the club ever since. Adult success was scarce enough until in 1966, when we won the junior football county title followed by the senior in 1968. This was helped greatly by the amalgamation with Kilmore in underage and all the success that it brought. Our own single parish successes in underage in the eighties and nineties in hurling and football culminated in the great senior double in 2000 and a senior football title in 2001. The present club has changed greatly, for the better, in the last 20 years with the great club development in buildings, pitches and the new hurling facilities which the people of the parish have stood strongly behind with financial and general support. The whole community is now involved and the ladies football and camogie teams have enhanced the club even further. An active parish is a happy parish and long may it remain so. The youth is much more involved now looking after the many underage teams in all grades and as experienced in the very successful Walkathon in Summer 2017 which encompassed mental health also. The schools had always played their part in Gaelic games in the parish and with the amalgamation of the four of them in 1971 it got even better culminating in several Rackard league victories in both codes leading to even more senior titles in football in 2012 and 2014. February 2018 the history of the GAA in the parish, all 133 years of it, aptly named \\"October 2000\\" was launched, in a 516 page book, in the GAA centre. In 2019, St Anne's started playing rounders at underage and entered both boys' and girls' rounders teams in the All-Ireland Feile in Cork. ==Honours== * Wexford Senior Hurling Championship (2): 1924, 2000 * Wexford Senior Football Championship (5): 1968, 2000, 2001, 2012, 2014 * Wexford Senior Ladies Football Championship (1): 2017 * Wexford Intermediate Ladies Football Championship (1) 2012 * Wexford Intermediate Football Championship (1): 1990, 2020 * Wexford Intermediate Hurling Championship (2): 1999, 2017 * Wexford Junior Football Championship (1): 1966 * Wexford Junior Hurling Championship (3): 1924, 1977, 1996 * Wexford Junior Ladies Football Championship (1) 2011 * Wexford Junior B Camogie Championship 2018 * Wexford Junior C Camogie Championship 2010 * Wexford Under-21 Football Championship (1): 1971 * Wexford Under-21 Hurling Championship (1): 2011 * Wexford Minor Football Championship (1): 2008 ==Notable players== * Jack Berry * Darragh Ryan (hurler) * David O’Connor * Fiona Rochford * Marica Cullen * Fiona Bennett * Diarmuid O'Keeffe * Redmond Barry (sportsman) * Diarmuid O'Keeffe * Liam Óg McGovern ==ReferencesOther sources== Category:Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Wexford Category:Hurling clubs in County Wexford Category:Gaelic football clubs in County Wexford ","title":"St. Anne's Rathangan GAA"},{"id":"56872200","text":"Pierre Bourgarit (born 12 September 1994) is a French rugby union player.

This encompasses the attainment of nutrition, water, and shelter. The five broad categories of subsistence patterns are foraging, horticulture, pastoralism, agriculture, and industrial food production. ==Foraging== Foraging is the oldest subsistence pattern, with all human societies relying on it until approximately 10,000 years ago. Foraging societies obtain the majority of their resources directly from the environment without cultivation. Also known as Hunter-gatherers, foragers may subsist through collecting wild plants, hunting, or fishing. Hunter-gatherer communities are frequently small and mobile, with egalitarian social structures. Contrary to the common perception of hunter-gatherer life as precarious and nutrient-deficient, Canadian anthropologist Richard Borshay Lee found that \\"with few conspicuous exceptions, the hunter-gatherer subsistence base is at least routine and reliable and at best surprisingly abundant.\\" ==Horticulture== Horticultural societies typically engage in small-scale gardening with simple tools. These methods allow for higher population densities, but still depend on the availability of plentiful, undeveloped land. A common type of horticulture is slash-and-burn cultivation, wherein regions of wild foliage are cut and burnt, producing nutrient-rich biochar in which to grow crops. Traditional, small- scale slash-and-burn cultivation – such as that practiced by the Guaraní people in South America – can be efficient and sustainable, with the natural environment eventually reclaiming and reintegrating old garden plots. ==Pastoralism== Pastoralism is the herding and breeding of domestic animals. Pastoralism is common in arid geographic regions, or those with inconstant and fluctuating rainfall. In such places, raising herbivores is often a more reliable lifestyle than farming, and the livestock convert wild vegetation that is indigestible to humans into meat and dairy products. Pastoral communities are generally nomadic to accommodate for the needs of their herds as the seasons and the availability of pasture changes. Pastoralism remains fairly popular today, with 21 million pastoralists in Africa and Asia alone. ==Agriculture== Agriculture is the intensive maintenance and cultivation of land for food production. It is distinct from horticulture in its use of more diverse and complex technology to plant, irrigate, plow, fertilize, and harvest from considerably larger tracts of land. Agriculture may also involve raising livestock, with variants ranging from mixed farming to exclusive ranching. Agrarian societies are often larger and more complex than foraging, horticultural, or pastoral ones; the combination of high carrying capacity and stationary farmsteads enables dense populations and the development of cities peopled with nonproducing specialists. ==Industrial Food Production== Industrial food production is a variation of agriculture common among industrial societies. It is characterized by even greater, energy intensive use of modern mechanical, chemical, and biological technologies to maximize production. Only a small fraction of people in industrial societies are farmers, the rest obtain money to buy their food by engaging in the complex business and service economy. A significant part of the energy cost of industrial food production arises from the packaging and shipping of products to the increasingly urban consumer base. The energy costs, pesticide use, and widespread erosion implicit in many forms of industrial food production have led to concerns about its long-term sustainability as a pattern of subsistence. ==References== Category:Anthropology ","title":"Subsistence pattern"},{"id":"56872213","text":"Samuel Brand (born 27 February 1991) is a Manx cyclist, who currently rides for UCI ProTeam .

His family moved from Jessore of present day Bangladesh during the Partition of India. Shamik spent his early childhood in a mixed locality surrounded by slums and befriended slum children. He studied in one of the best schools of Kolkata, South Point High School and as such was exposed to people from varied sections of the society from an early age. Shamik did his undergraduate studies in Physics from Calcutta University. He was involved in politics in his university days. His debut short story Ghola was published in prestigious Bengali Literary Magazine Desh at this time. After graduation, Shamik joined a Private Sector Bank in Kolkata. After a small stint he moved and joined another PSU Bank and was posted in Ahmedabad and then went to Mumbai in the Corporate Strategy and Communication Department of the same Bank. As a Corporate Communication professional he had access to the upper reaches of Mumbai and yet, the trains he traveled on, journeyed through some of the poorest urban areas of India.

Throughout the 1540's he would participate in the Italian Wars fighting at the Battle of Ceresole and Siege of Metz. Although not a Huguenot himself, he became attached to the Huguenot convert Louis, Prince of Condé in his factional disagreements with the Francis, Duke of Guise. The Vidame was imprisoned in the Bastille after being accused of involvement in the Amboise conspiracy of 1560, and died a few days after the death of Francis II secured his release. Fictionalized versions of him appear in several works in various media, the first and most important of which is as a major character in La Princesse de Clèves, an anonymous French novel published in 1678, over a century after his death. ==Life== François de Vendôme was wealthy and well- connected, his properties including the imposing medieval Château de la Ferté Vidame, built by the Vendômes. He also claimed the title \\"prince de Chabannais\\", but was and is usually known as the Vidame de Chartres. He distinguished himself as an infantry commander in the battle of Ceresole in Piedmont on 11 April 1544, during the Italian War of 1542–46,de Pétigny, 330; Formel-Levavasseur, 54–56 a French victory over the Habsburgs, which their commander Francis, Count of Enghien, a cousin of François de Vendôme, failed to follow up by taking Milan. He was keen on maintaining contemporary standards of honour. According to the Florentine artist Bartolommeo Bandinelli (1493 – c. 1560) in his memoirs, the Vidame fought a duel with a Florentine noble, having said that the Florentine nobility had degraded their status by taking excessive interest in the manual arts of painting and sculpture.Blunt, Anthony, Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450–1600, 1940, OUP, , online extract Another story, told by Brantôme, has a Spanish nobleman travelling to France to challenge the Vidame to a duel, having heard he was the most \\"parfait chevalier\\" in Europe. The duel took place in Italy, where the Vidame arrived with a hundred gentlemen, all wearing the same magnificent clothes, including a gold chain looped three times round their necks.de Pétigny, 329 In 1549 he was sent to England as one of the hostages given by the French in connection with the Treaty of Boulogne with Edward VI of England. Another of the hostages was the young Claude, Duke of Aumale (1526–1573) of the House of Guise, who with his brothers Francis, Duke of Guise (1519–1563) and Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine (1524–1574), was to lead the Catholic party in France over the following decades. Aumale and Vendôme became friendly, and at this stage of his career he was a supporter of the Guises. According to Brantôme's account, he dazzled the English court with a banquet he hosted, where a sea-voyage was theatrically presented, including a rain storm of sweets (candies) falling from above. This was a fashionable effect in continental courts, first recorded at the wedding of Cosimo I de' Medici in Florence in 1539, and mentioned in 1549 for the festivities as Mary of Hungary welcomed the future Philip II of Spain to the Netherlands at Binche Palace.Strong, Roy, Feast: A History of Grand Eating, 195-197, 2002, Jonathan Cape, ; the Binche \\"sugar collation\\" is illustrated in this drawing On 8 September 1550 he was given a passport to travel to Scotland. At this time, Scotland was a different country ruled by Regent Arran who hosted a banquet on his arrival in Edinburgh. Mary of Guise sister of his new allies was the mother of Mary Queen of Scots. He travelled with thirty servants and Laurence Hussey acting as his harbinger to prepare his lodgings.John Gough Nichols, Literary Remains of Edward VI, vol. 2 (London, 1857), p. 290 and footnote. He went as far as Inverness, where on a hunting trip with \\"the savage inhabitants of the area\\" (des sauvages habitants du pays), he joined them in eating the still \\"palpitating\\" flesh of their prey.Formel-Levavasseur, 54–55; de Pétigny, 329 His old commander, the Count of Enghien, had died in 1546, and by Vendôme's next major action, the siege of Metz by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1552–53, he was commanded by Francis, Duke of Guise, later to become Vendôme's implacable enemy. Vendôme again distinguished himself, and in 1557 he replaced a dead cousin as commander or \\"colonel-general\\" of the bandes Piedmontese, or French infantry of Piedmont,de Pétigny, 330 a force who in 1545 had conducted the Massacre of Mérindol.Knecht, R. J., Francis I, 405, google books The next year he was appointed the governor of Calais, which the French had finally regained after centuries of English rule. After a period he resigned his offices, and retired from court. According to Brantôme he had refused a marriage with Louise, the daughter of Louis de Brézé and Diane de Poitiers, because of the taint of bastardy in the family, then taken very seriously;see Le Roy Ladurie, 95–107, for the attitude of a later Vidame de Chartres, the memoirist Saint-Simon towards bastardy. Louis de Brézé was the grandson of King Charles VII of France by his natural daughter with his mistress Agnès Sorel. In addition Diane de Poitiers, now widowed, was the mistress of Henry II of France. In so doing, he infuriated Diane de Poitiers and alienated her allies, the Guises. He had also annoyed the queen by rejecting a bride she had chosen for him from her ladies.de Pétigny, 330–331 He had made a further powerful enemy in the Maréchal Brissac (1505/06—1563), when Brissac was opposed to the Guises. When Diane de Poitiers reconciled them, the Vidame was not included in the new alliance.de Pétigny, 331 Henry II died at the age of 40 in 1559, and was succeeded by his son, the 15 year-old Francis II of France, who was already married to Mary, Queen of Scots. His uncles-in-law the Guise brothers had enormous power, dominating the king's mother, Queen Catherine de' Medici. François de Vendôme had previously been allowed to have some sort of courtly romantic relationship with the queen, probably not amounting to an actual sexual relationship, but was now cast off, as Catherine needed to work with the Guises.de Pétigny, 331–332 The Vidame was now alienated from the dominant figures at court, and allied himself with Louis, Prince of Condé as the leader of the opposition to the Guises, which mainly came from the Huguenots.de Pétigny, 332–334 He is said to have unwisely signed a letter placing himself at the service of Condé for anything that did not harm the king and his family. This fell into the hands of the Guises, and he was arrested, like Condé, after the abortive Huguenot Amboise conspiracy of March 1560, in which he does not seem to have taken part. François de Vendôme was thrown into the Bastille and harshly treated, so that his health declined. It looked like everything had changed on 15 December, when the king died, to be succeeded by his brother, the 11 year-old Charles IX of France. The Guises lost most of their power, and this time the king's mother became regent, releasing Condé and others of his supporters. But this came too late for the Vidame, who died soon after – whether before or just after his release has been the subject of discussion, as the evidence is contradictory.de Pétigny, 334–340; Castelnau, 97–98 When Vendôme died without issue the title passed to Jean de Ferrières (1520–1586),de Pétigny, 340 a leading Huguenot politician and military commander in the French Wars of Religion, who was forced to spend periods in exile in England. ==Later literary depictions== François de Vendôme, always referred to as the Vidame de Chartres, is a major character in La Princesse de Clèves, an anonymous French novel published in March 1678, over a century after his death, which mixes fictionalized historical characters and purely fictional ones.\\"Personnages – La princesse de Clèves\\" It is regarded by many as the beginning of the modern tradition of the psychological novel, and as a great classic of French literature. Its author is generally held to be Madame de La Fayette.Woshinsky, 9 The action takes place between October 1558 and November 1559 at the court of Henry II of France, and the account of the Vidame largely agrees with that of Brantôme. The Vidame, portrayed as a dashing figure at court, is the uncle of the fictional heroine, who becomes \\"princesse de Clèves\\" on her marriage.Woshinsky, 67–69 One of a number of stories which interrupt the main plot is that of the Vidame, concerning a letter which drops from his clothes when he is playing tennis. A bystander thinks it was dropped by his opponent, the Duke of Nemours, and gives it to him. The letter would reveal that, contrary to his assurances to Queen Catherine, the Vidame has continued with at least one other mistress. In the end the heroine and Nemours get together to write a second letter, to pass off to the queen. But this does not convince her, and she turns against the Vidame. The Vidame was further depicted, in similar terms, in Catherine De Medici by Honoré de Balzac, as \\"the first and only amour\\" of the widowed queen.Catherine De Medici, end of the Introduction ==NotesReferences== *Castelnau, Memoirs, (Mémoires de Messire Michel de Castelnau: Seigneur de Mauvissière at de Concressaut, Baron de Jonville, Comte de Beaumont Le Roger ..., ed.

He began working with comics in 1994 with the fanzine Grandes Enigmas da Humanidade, which had a circulation of 5,000 copies. Diniz's first professional works were in 1997 and 1998, when he participated in two projects of Taquara Editorial: Tiririca em Quadrinhos and O Estranho Mundo de Zé do Caixão, respectively comics adaptations for the clown Tiririca and the movie character Coffin Joe, created by the filmmaker José Mojica Marins. In 1999, Diniz released his first independent comic: Subversivos, about the armed struggle against the Brazilian military dictatorship. In 2000, Diniz created the publishing house Nona Arte, initially destined to publish his own works, but that later began to publish books of other independent Brazilian artists. The first graphic novels released by Nona Arte were Fawcett (inspired in Percy Fawcett, pencils by Flavio Colin) and Subversivos - Companheiro Germano (pencils by Laudo Ferreira Jr.). Both books had scripts by Diniz. In 2001, Fawcett won Troféu HQ Mix and Prêmio Angelo Agostini, respectively in the categories \\"best national graphic novel\\" and \\"best new release\\". Nona Arte provided its comics in digital format through PDF files free of charge, even those that were sold printed. Between 2000 and 2005, when the publisher was closed, there were over 80,000 downloads of various comics. The publishing house won the Troféu HQ Mix, the most important Brazilian comic book award, in the category \\"best comics' website\\" from 2002 to 2006 and in the category \\"publisher of the year\\" in 2003, dividing the award with Panini Brasil. Between 2002 and 2004, Diniz and the artist Antonio Eder published the fanzine Informal, which featured short comics by several independent artists. In 2003, the fanzine won the Troféu HQ Mix in the category \\"best fanzine\\". Other prizes won by Diniz were: Troféu HQ Mix for best writer in 2004, 2010 and 2012; Troféu HQ Mix for international highlight (that awards Brazilian artists who had his works published internationally) in 2013, 2014 and 2015; Prêmio Angelo Agostini for best writer in 2001; and Jayme Cortez Trophy (that awards great contributions to Brazilian comics) in 2004. One of André's most prominent works is the graphic novel Morro da Favela, which tells the story of Brazilian photographer Maurício Hora, who was born and raised in Morro da Providência the first favela of Rio de Janeiro. This graphic novel won the 2012 Troféu HQ Mix as \\"best national special edition\\" and was also published in Portugal, the United Kingdom (as \\"Picture a Favela\\") and France (with the name Photo de la Favela). In 2017 and 2018, André published, respectively, the graphic novel Olimpo Tropical (with Laudo Ferreira Jr.) and a comic adaptation for The Idiot, from Fyodor Dostoevsky, both published in Brazil and Portugal. == Bibliography == * Subversivos (independent, 1999) * Subversivos - Companheiro Germano (pencils by Laudo Ferreira Jr., inks by Omar Viñole, Nona Arte, 2000) * Fawcett (pencils by Flavio Colin, Nona Arte, 2000) * Subversivos - A Farsa (pencils by Marcos Paz, Nona Arte, 2001) * 31 de Fevereiro (Nona Arte, 2001) * A Classe Média Agradece (Nona Arte, 2003) * Chalaça, o Amigo do Rei (pencils by Antonio Eder, Conrad Editora, 2005) * Ponha-se na Rua (pencils by Tiburcio, Franco Editora, 2006) * Chico Rei (Franco Editora, 2006) * Collections História do Brasil em Quadrinhos, História Geral em Quadrinhos and Filosofia em Quadrinhos (12 volumes) (2008) * 7 Vidas (pencils by Antonio Eder, Conrad Editora, 2009) * Ato 5 (pencils by José Aguiar, independent, 2009) * O Quilombo Orum Aiê (Galera Record, 2010) * MSP +50 – Mauricio de Sousa por Mais 50 Artistas (many artists, Panini Brasil, 2010) * Morro da Favela (Leya Brasil/Barba Negra, 2011) * A Cachoeira de Paulo Afonso (Pallas, 2011) * O Negrinho do Pastoreio (Ygarapé, 2012) * Z de Zelito (Desiderata, 2013) * Homem de Neanderthal (Desiderata, 2013) * Duas Luas (pencils by Pablo Mayer, Giz Editora, 2013) * Que Deus Te Abandone (pencils by Tainan Rocha, SESI-SP Editora, 2015) * Quando a Noite Fecha os Olhos (pencils by Mario Cau, independent, 2015) * Mako (Marsupial Editora/Jupati Books, 2016) * Olimpo Tropical (pencils by Laudo Ferreira Jr., Marsupial Editora/Jupati Books, 2017) * Matei Meu Pai e Foi Estranho (Marsupial Editora/Jupati Books, 2017) * O Idiota (Companhia das Letras, 2018) == References == Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian comics artists ","title":"André Diniz"},{"id":"56872332","text":"Naomi Salaman (born 25 March 1963) is a British conceptual artist, writer and curator. Her practice uses photography and is informed both by feminism and post-structuralism. She attended Chelsea College of Arts, and completed a research/practice PhD at Goldsmiths in 2008. She currently teaches in Fine Art at University of Brighton. Salaman has written, made work on and/or curated exhibitions related to a wide range of topics including: the art school; pornography and censorship; image technologies; and social justice. She has taught studio art and art theory courses in art and photography schools nationally, and has taught fine art at University of Brighton since 1996. == Exhibitions == Salaman curated the exhibition What She Wants: Women Artists Look at Men in 1994, which presented a collection of female artists exploring the gendered gaze by taking male nude photography. The work has been regarded as a good example of how the gendered gaze can support a change in power relations. Barbara Bickel found that the exhibition was one of few examples where women artists used male bodies in their practices to expose sexual desire and pleasure. This touring photographic exhibition has been regarded as a crucial exhibition on \\"how women looked at men\\". Salaman's work, Changed Press Marks of the Private Cases (2001), was exhibited alongside ten artists in the Potential: Ongoing Archive, curated by Anna Harding in the John Hansard Gallery of the University of Southampton. Salaman used microfilm to record archivist cards related to private cases in the British Library. The library believed some materials were not suitable for public access and therefore kept them away in private cases. The photographed cards traced how archivists gradually removed the ban from some books.

The negligent rider was both a colleague and a friend. The accident occurred on the way to work. As the rider's insurance policy excluded pillion passengers, Coward's widow was obliged to claim damages from the MIB. The MIB would have liability only where insurance for the pillion was compulsory; and at the time insurance was compulsory only if pillions were carried \\"for hire or reward\\". Coward had paid the friend a small weekly contribution for the daily trip, and the widow argued that this amounted to a contract for hire or reward. The MIB countered that carriage for hire or reward required to create legal relations, and that on these facts (an agreement between friends), there was no such intention. ==Decision== The Court of Appeal held there was no contract of hire or reward as it was a social and domestic agreement without intention to create legal relations, and that the widow was not entitled to compensation. ==Subsequent decisions== In Connell v Motor Insurers Bureau Connell v Motor Insurers Bureau [1969] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 1 Lord Denning, MR, sitting in the Court of Appeal declared that he was \\"not happy with the decision in Coward\\", adding that \\"when a man gives another a lift in return for money there is a contract, albeit informal\\". Denning refused to follow Coward and declared that a car driver who gave friends a lift in return for cash or other valuable consideration was indeed acting \\"for hire or reward\\". Strictly speaking, Denning was in breach of the rule that the Court of Appeal is bound by its own earlier decisions; but in Albert v Motor Insurers Bureau Albert v Motor Insurers Bureau [1971] 3 WLR 291 the House of Lords in 1971 approved the Connell judgment in preference to that in Coward.

The game was released on November 12, 2019. It is the sequel to Unity of Command. ==Gameplay== Unity of Command II is a tactical turn-based wargame which balances between historical accuracy and abstract game design. ===Headquarters=== The game introduces the concept of headquarters, which are used to collect the remnants of player units known as \\"stragglers\\". As units get damaged during combat, they dissolve into stragglers, which continue to automatically travel to the player's HQ. Once there, they become part of the player's \\"Force Pool\\", which they can use to reinforce their existing units. The functionality of headquarters was expanded to include repairing or constructing bridges on the map. The function is intended to give structure to the systemic complexity of WWII, but without overwhelming the player with countless systems.https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/01/01/how-unity-of- command-2-balances-game-design-with-military-history/ ==Development== The game was in development since late 2014, but was formally announced in 2019.

Notable gameplay mechanics that were added include fog of war, unit headquarters, supply hubs, airborne ops or the ability to go beyond enemy lines and sabotage their infrastructure. ==Reception== Unity of Command II received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to review aggregator Metacritic. Rob Zacny, in a review on Vice, noted how the game departed in so many ways from the original, but remained a \\"simple joy to play\\", calling it a \\"wargame that invites a lot of delightful perfectionist revisiting for a long time to come\\". Wargamer praised its visuals, maintaining they are \\"some of the best eye candy to come out of a wargaming company this year\\" and stating that each mission feels satisfactory due to its intimidating design, ultimately calling it a marked improvement over the original Unity of Command. Luke Plunkett of Kotaku called it the best wargame he played in years, but stated his disappointment in turn limiters, and limited control of some units. Rock, Paper, Shotgun was similarly delighted by the game and its novelties, concluding that \\"Wargames this canny, attractive, friendly and historically literate come along extremely rarely\\". PC Gamer noted in its review that new additions such as specialists and HQ upgrades contribute considerably to the campaign's flexibility, stating that there are also moments of historical divergence in the game. Gamespot espoused criticism towards both the icons in the game, maintaining they are poorly explained, and the limited tutorial which force the player to consult outside manuals and sources, nevertheless still praising the game as \\"one of the finest strategy games in recent times.\\" ==References *Official website *Steam store page Category:2019 video games Category:Turn- based strategy video games Category:Video games developed in Croatia Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:World War II video games ","title":"Unity of Command II"},{"id":"56872445","text":"Microphysogobio rapidus is a species of cyprinid fish endemic to South Korea. ==References== Category:Cyprinid fish of Asia Category:Fish described in 1999 Category:Microphysogobio ","title":"Microphysogobio rapidus"},{"id":"56872459","text":"Capo Ferro Lighthouse () is an active lighthouse located on the same name promontory which marks the southern entrance to the Strait of Bonifacio and to the Maddalena archipelago, in the municipality of Arzachena, in the north east of Sardinia, Italy, on the Tyrrhenian Sea. ==Description== The lighthouse, built in 1858, was activated by the Regia Marina only in 1861 and consists of a masonry white cylindrical tower, high, with balcony and lantern rising from a 2-storey white keeper's house.

He was one of the commanders of the Chushi Gangdruk guerrillas, and fled to India in April 1959 shortly after the arrival there of the 14th Dalai Lama. ==Birthplace== Shangri Lhagyal was born in Tongpa Bangzo village, Zogan county, Chamdo prefecture in eastern Tibet in 1921. This village is known for its natural hot-springs and varieties of fruit trees. Tsawabomei has six scattered villages with five monasteries and nunneries. Each village is separated by twenty to thirty minutes walking distance. It also has a holy mountain, Kulagyaltsen, where the local people make religious offerings to their native deity. ==Commander of Chushi Gangdrug in Gongkar== Juchen Thupten Namgyal, ex-Prime Minister of The Tibetan Government in exile in Dharamsala, India, mentioned that Chamdowa Shangri Lhagyal was one of the commanders of Chushi Gangdrug in Gongkar Dzong. He narrated: \\"At Gongkar Dzong, Chamdowa Shangri Lhagyal and Derge Chudobu Wangchuk Tsering were the two Chushi Gangdrug commanders ... Makchi (commander) Shangri Lhagyal convened a meeting at Gongkar with his soldiers and new arrivals from Norbulingka. ... They shared their battle stories, and he shared the precarious situation in Norbulingka and the safe escape of His Holiness Dalai Lama from Lhasa. ... They discussed about future plans ... Makchi Shangri Lhagyal to remain in Gongkar ...\\". ==Victory in the Battle of Dra== \\"On 9 November 1958, Chamdowa Shangri Lhagyal led a successful attack on the Chinese troops in Drashi Dra. At mid-night when Ratuk Ngawang and his troops were camping at Drashi Phu, a messenger returned and briefed them about the situation in the surrounding areas. As they proceeded ahead in the night, they reached Drashi Dra, about 40 miles from Gongkar, in the morning. Here they met up with the forces led by Chamdowa Shangri Lhagyal.\\" ==The 14th Dalai Lama's escape from Tibet into exile in 1959== The 14th Dalai Lama safely escaped from Tibet into exile in India in 1959. On 17 March 1959, he and his entourage started the escape journey from Lhasa in Tibet, and reached the Indian border on 31 March 1959. During the entire escape, Chushi Gangdrug Tenshung Danglang Mak escorted him to safety in India. At the Indian border, the Chushi Gangdrug Tenshung Danglang Mak and the Tibetan Army soldiers stood in formation for a farewell salute and sought the Dalai Lama’s blessing. At that moment, it was difficult for him to say goodbye to the Chushi Gangdrug Tenshung Danglang Mak and Tibetan Army soldiers who had escorted the Dalai Lama and his entourage all the way from Lhasa safely to Indian border. At Bomdila, he was greeted by Mr. Menon and interpreter Sonam Topgyal carrying a telegram message from the Prime Minister Nehru: \\"My colleagues and I welcome you and send greetings on your safe arrival in India. We shall be happy to afford the necessary facilities to you, your family and entourage to reside in India. The people of India, who hold you in great veneration, will no doubt accord their traditional respect to your personage. Kind regards to you. Nehru.\\" ==Assists the escape of Rinchen Dolma Taring== Rinchen Dolma Taring (popularly known as Taring Amala) was one of the most prominent educators in the exile Tibetan community in India, and the founder of \\"The Tibetan Homes Foundation, SOS Tibetan Children Village\\" in Mussoorie, India. She wrote her autobiography in 1986: Daughter of Tibet: The Autobiography of Rinchen Dolma Taring. In Rinchen Dolma Taring's autobiography, she narrated how Shangri Lhagyal helped her safe escape to India: \\"Shangri Lhagyal was a nice, gentle man of about thirty-seven. He asked me to sit and congratulated me on my escape, but he was sorry to have told me that Taring Dzasa was not with His Holiness’s party: he had seen the party off, so he knew. He added \\"I will gladly give you a letter—from where do you intend to enter India?\\" I replied, \\"Bhutan,\\" and he assured me there were no Chinese on the way but asked, \\"Will the Bhutanese let you pass through?\\" At once Rabge said, \\"Yes, they will, because their Prime Minister’s wife is Tsarong’s daughter and their Queen is Taring Dzasa’s cousin.\\" ==Chushi Gangdrug surrender to Indian government== After the escape of the Dalai Lama, the idea of any further battle with the Chinese Communist troops was abandoned. Andrug Jindak persuaded Kunga Samten Dewatshang in Tawang to surrender his weapons to the Indian authorities. Shangri Lhagyal and other Chushi Gangdrug fighters handed over their weapons to the Indian officials at Tezpur, India. They offered a horse and a Khata (Tibetan scarf) to the Indian guards and completed the formalities, and crossed the border where they were greeted by a representative of the Tibetan Government Tsedrung Jampa Wangdu. On 29 April 1959, they handed over their rifles, ammunition, and all other weapons to the Deputy Commissioner of Tezpur district, and permitted to take their gold, silver, and other valuables. ==Forthcoming biography== Three researchersTashi Dhondhup, Dorjee Damdul, and Tashi Gelekhave conducted extensive research about the life of Shangri Lhagyal, and his major role in Chushi Gangdrug Tenshung Danglang Mak in 1959. Along with Shangri Lhagyal’s life story, the researchers will narrate the history of Tibet from 1947 to 1959 in an upcoming book to be published in 2019. The researchers are guided by a Tibet scholar, Professor Carole McGranahan, as an editor. McGranahan is a historical and anthropological expert on Chushi Gagndrug Tenshung Danglang Mak. == References == Category:1921 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Tibet freedom activists Category:Tibetan refugees Category:20th- century Tibetan people Category:1959 Tibetan uprising ","title":"Shangri Lhagyal"},{"id":"56872576","text":"Microphysogobio vietnamica is a species of cyprinid fish endemic to northern Vietnam. ==References== Category:Microphysogobio Category:Fish described in 1978 ","title":"Microphysogobio vietnamica"},{"id":"56872581","text":"Feminist Internet is an art activist collective devoted to making the internet a more feminist space. Feminist Internet was a project that began out of University of the Arts London in September 2017. It began as a two-week studio project where 16 people came together to imagine how they could build a more feminist internet. The collective is made up of spatial designers, graphic designers, activists, artists, poets, writers, journalists, video makers, performers, art directors, photographers, and researchers. They campaign for eradicating online violence against women, trans people, LGBTQ+ people, disabled people and other minorities and promote gender equality, equal rights & justice for all. Feminist Internet is non-profit collective supported by UAL Careers and Employability, the Teaching and Learning Exchange and UAL Futures, bringing UAL students, staff and industry together across disciplines to invent better futures. == Work and events == The Feminist Internet organises a range of events including seminars, panel discussions, reading groups, performances and other interventions to spread the word about gender equality and the internet. Previous events have included a seminar series at University of the Arts London on topics such as feminisms and the future of work, technology and representation, technological feminisms and biocapital and the female body. They have also hosted a 'Digital Clinic' at London arts venue Somerset House in December 2017 and a 'Geekender' in March 2018 at The Photographers' Gallery in London. The Feminist Internet have collaborated with organisations such as Glitch!UK and Amnesty International and people like Charlie Craggs. == Manifesto == The Feminist Internet's work is defined by their eight-point manifesto. * The Feminist Internet ERASES feminism. They believe that if they are successful, they will have erased the need for feminism by creating a world where nobody is oppressed, silenced, exposed or confined based on sex, gender, race or disability and making the internet a space that causes no harm, and where all people are equal. * The Feminist Internet INTEGRATES the physical and digital. The Feminist Internet believes that both the online and offline make up the everyday experiences of those with access to the internet. They use the online to affect change offline, and the offline to affect change online. * The Feminist Internet COOPERATES not competes. The Feminist Internet is against the competitive individualism of today’s world. They believes in collectively building an internet where information and opportunities can be accessed by all that is not driven by a profit motive, but by a belief in the power of solidarity. * The Feminist Internet ERADICATES violence. The Feminist Internet enables the systematic dismantling of all forms of online violence including rape culture, hate speech, and trolling. It abolishes unlawful rape porn sites/pornography and any other material contributing to rape culture. * The Feminist Internet REDEFINES value. The Feminist Internet redefines value by exploring alternatives to consumer culture. They question the relentless commodification of bodies, and recognise value as something that should be defined by more than capitalist profit motives. * The Feminist Internet CONFRONTS uncomfortable truths. The Feminist Internet looks itself in the mirror and is aware of its own privileges and powers. It acknowledges the negative experiences of marginalised groups, and supports their online movements towards greater equality. It does not swamp its users with distractions from the needs and concerns of their global peers. * The Feminist Internet RE-CODES gender. The Feminist Internet challenges preconceptions of gender to bring a variety of experiences to the surface. It does not guide or police experiences according to perceived gender and allows all experiences to be broadcast, erasing the limiting myth of the universal ‘type’ of person. * The Feminist Internet EDUCATES. The Feminist Internet believes that education is the key to eradicating ignorance and prejudice. Through listening to and learning from its multitude of voices and their stories, it asserts that there is no one universal experience or learning style. It enables access to all information, but particularly promotes education around sexual health and identity politics. == References == Category:Feminist collectives Category:British artist groups and collectives Category:University of the Arts London Category:Organizations established in 2017 Category:2017 establishments in England Category:Feminist organisations in the United Kingdom ","title":"Feminist Internet (collective)"},{"id":"56872595","text":"Colonel Adam Ostrowski, aged 98 Adam Mieczysław Ostrowski (15 February 1919 in Borysław;Lista Krzystka – 9 March 2018 in London)https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/25/adam-ostrowski-obituary was a Polish RAF pilot who fought in World War II and was active in Polish organisations. ==Biography== As a military pilot, Ostrowski flew in the 317 \\"Wileński\\" RAF Fighter Squadron, where he served as a Lieutenant.

Her firefighter husband Brad recommends an online support community, where Molly finds temporary improvement after meeting Beth, another new mother who is raising her infant son Robert alone. Beth helps Molly out at her home but also works to drive a wedge between Molly and her old friends. One afternoon Beth drugs Molly at lunch and allows Molly to pass out, leaving her daughter Ava in the car. Her husband finds them and becomes distrustful of his wife after learning that she hid her diagnosis of postpartum depression from him. Molly's friend Susan catches Beth lying about where she previously worked and begins investigating her. Susan contacts Dr. Bob Everett, an obstetrician whom Beth had blackmailed for months by claiming to be pregnant with his child, though Bob insists that Beth is actually infertile. Susan discovers that Beth faked her pregnancy and her baby Robert was stolen from parents Susan considered neglectful. Susan races to Molly's house where Beth has drugged Molly with oxycodone and confronts her but Beth injects drugs into Susan and kills her. Beth concocts a fantasy in which Robert and Ava are her missing twins that have been returned to her and takes them from the home. Molly awakes to find them missing and rushes to Beth's apartment in a panic, only to find it empty of her belongings. She calls her husband Brad, who insists that Beth took the babies on a picnic and ridicules her panicked behavior. Molly returns home and finds Susan's body in her closet. She uses Susan's cellphone to call a woman who was in a fake mother group with Beth and obtains the address of Beth's mother. She races to that address, where Beth's mother discovers her and attempts to inject drugs into her. Molly fights her off and takes the needle then confronts Beth, who pulls a steak knife on her.

In conversation with Jack Latham in 2017, Rogers remarked that her curatorial decisions were often considered controversial. She recounts: \\"The British ambassador in Poland would say to me ‘We can't have Martin Parr, that's not the image of Britain we want, with all the rubbish on the ground, and people looking unhappy’. I would always argue back, saying, ‘We're not here to promote a tourist's image of Britain, we're here to promote photography'.

She oversaw the Gallery’s move from Great Newport Street to Ramillies Street and a major redevelopment of the new premises. The refurbished building reopened in 2012. Rogers’ approach to the medium of photography embraces its many dimensions and expanded forms. As she outlines: “...the gallery should showcase the full spectrum of the medium, from its evolution as a tool for “drawing with light”, through its documentary and experimental modes, to exploring the possibilities for how we understand photography in the age of the networked image”. ==Awards== *2018: Award for Outstanding Service to Photography (and Honorary Fellowship), Royal Photographic Society, Bath == References == Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Australian photographers Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Photography curators Category:Australian curators ","title":"Brett Rogers (curator)"},{"id":"56872649","text":"Ghorpadwadi is a village in Rahuri Taluka in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra State, India.

Hausam, May 8, 1922, The Los Angeles Times Winifred May Horman Hausam (June 7, 1883California, Death Index, 1940-1997 – October 1, 1967) was an American vocational executive who founded and managed vocational service bureaus for women in the Los Angeles area. Active in a wide variety of business, educational and women's clubs, she headed the Western Personnel Institute in Pasadena for over 30 years. She also helped to establish programs for women during the Depression, providing jobs for skilled women. ==Early life and education== Born in the mid-1880s in Chicago, Illinois, Winifred May Horman Hausam was the daughter of George W. Hausam and Emma M. Horman. After schooling in Chicago, she attended the University of California, Los Angeles and Columbia University in New York City. ==Career== Hausam began her career in California around 1912. Initially a teacher, she assumed various responsibilities in institutes dealing with pioneering vocational services for women. In 1919, she established and headed the Pasadena Vocational Bureau. On the basis of the success of the services in Pasadena, a couple of years later the Bureau of Vocational Services in Los Angeles was established, again with Hausam at the Helm. She had already become vice-chair of the National Committee of Bureaus of Occupation and director of vocational services at the California Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs. While in Pasadena, she published Outdoor occupations for women in California (1922). By 1934, Hausam reported the Pasadena Vocational Bureau had helped hundreds of women to find work. In 1936, as head of the employment bureau, she announced that Pasadena was in the forefront of placing women in private industry, specifying that 846 women had been placed in December 1935 while there had generally been a decline elsewhere. In 1931, together with her associate Helen Fisk, she established the Western Personnel Service, later the Western Personnel Institute. She explained the progress achieved and priorities for the future in Guidance of Adults: Outside of Full-time School Situations, published in 1934. Winifred May Hausam continued to head the Western Personnel Institute until her retirement in 1961. She died in Pasadena on October 1, 1967, and is buried in Mountain View Cemetery, Altadena, Los Angeles County. ==Legacy== Established in 1973 by the School of Educational Studies at the Claremont Graduate University, the Winifred Hausam–Helen Fisk Award for Distinction in Higher Education honors outstanding service and academic achievement in higher education. It is presented to a doctoral student who has demonstrated exceptional ability in academic studies, scholarly writing, internship and service to students. The award celebrates the memory of Winifred Hausam and Helen Graves Fisk (1895-1986), both of whom pioneered vocational opportunities for women and contributed to developing professional services for college students. ==References== Category:People from Chicago Category:1883 births Category:1967 deaths Category:20th-century American educators Category:American chief executives Category:American women chief executives Category:Educators from Illinois ","title":"Winifred M.

Section 110 SPVs were created in 1997 to allow IFSC law firms administer securitisation business; in 2012 these firms would use the SPVs to assist U.S. distressed debt funds shelter over €40 billion of Irish investments (€80 billion in loan balances) from Irish tax. An Irish Section 110 special purpose vehicle (SPV) or section 110 company, is an Irish tax resident company, which qualifies under Section 110 of the Irish Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA) for a special tax regime that enables the SPV to attain \\"tax neutrality\\": i.e. the SPV pays no Irish taxes, VAT, or duties. Section 110 was created in 1997 to help International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) legal and accounting firms compete for the administration of global securitisation deals, and by 2017 was the largest structured finance vehicle in EU securitisation. Section 110 SPVs have made the IFSC the third largest global Shadow Banking OFC. While they pay no Irish tax, they contribute €100 million annually to the Irish economy in fees paid to IFSC legal and accounting firms. In June 2016, it was discovered that US distressed debt funds used Section 110 SPVs, structured by IFSC service firms, to avoid Irish taxes on €80 billion of Irish domestic investments. The cost to the Irish exchequer has been material. Despite the scale of the avoidance, Irish Revenue attempted no investigation or prosecution. The Irish Government's response to the scandal in 2016–2017 was unusual, closing some loopholes but leaving others open, including a five-year capital gains tax (CGT) exemption to aid alternative restructuring. The affair is a source of dispute. The abuses were discovered because Section 110 SPVs file public accounts with the Irish CRO. In 2018, the Central Bank of Ireland upgraded the L–QIAIF, to give the same tax-free structure on Irish assets held via debt as the Section 110 SPV, but without having to file public accounts with the Irish CRO. Michael Noonan moved to partially close some of the abuses of Section 110 SPVs by U.S. distressed debt funds in the Irish domestic economy in the 2016 Finance Act, but controversially decided against full closure, or any investigation or Irish Revenue Commissioners sanction. Academic research in 2016–2018, showed IFSC Section 110 SPVs are largely unregulated, operating like brass plate companies with low supervision from the Revenue or the Central Bank of Ireland. It showed Section 110 SPVs were used by sanctioned/prohibited Russian banks. A June 2017 study published in Nature listed Ireland as one of the global Conduit OFCs which use SPVs to route funds to tax havens. In March 2018, the Financial Stability Forum showed SPVs had made Ireland the 3rd largest Shadow Banking OFC. In June 2018, tax academics showed Ireland was the world's largest tax haven. ==Creation== Minister Charlie McCreevy's landmark 1997 Tax and Consolidation Act created Section 110 SPVs and laid the foundations for Ireland's leading corporate BEPS tools. While Ireland had created securitisation SPVs from 1991 onwards for their emerging International Financial Services Centre (IFSC), Section 110 of the 1997 Taxes and Consolidation Act (TCA) introduced more advanced SPVs to enable the IFSC complete in the global securitisation market. The new Section 110 SPV was fully tax neutral (also known as tax transparent), which meant that with appropriate financial structuring, no Irish taxes (including Irish income taxes, capital gains taxes, withholding taxes or even Irish VAT and Irish stamp duty) would apply inside the new Irish Section 110 SPV. Full tax neutrality was available as standard in the offshore financial centres who already had zero domestic taxes (i.e. Bermuda, the Cayman). As tax havens however, their reputation, and a restricted network of global tax treaties, made then less acceptable to the banks who originate securitisation SPVs. Onshore competitors, like Luxembourg and the Netherlands, used a civil law legal system, also less favored by securitisation originators Irish companies had access to the EU's network of tax treaties in a preferred common law legal system. However, offering Irish companies as vehicles for tax neutral securitisations bought risks to the tax base of the Irish economy as Irish domestic assets and businesses could be repackaged into Section 110 \\"qualifying assets\\". Explicit solutions (i.e. the SPV could not hold Irish assets) were ruled out as the Section 110 SPV could be challenged as a non- ordinary Irish company, losing tax treaty access. Instead, controls were introduced, that while less explicit, would collectively ensure Section 110 SPVs were confined to global securitisation: While IFSC law firms lobbied for the removal of i. & iii. (above), and exemptions from improvements in Irish company law, these controls seemed to work. There is no record of any entity (Irish or foreign) using Section 110 SPVs to avoid Irish tax on Irish domestic investments or businesses until circa 2012 (). Note, Irish banks use Section 110 SPVs to raise capital to finance their Irish mortgage books in the global capital markets (they all have IFSC offices). However, as the source Irish borrower pays loan interest to the Irish bank, who then incurs Irish taxes inside their Irish-taxed corporate bank structure, there is no loss of Irish taxes to the Irish exchequer. In contrast, if Irish borrowers paid loan interest into a Section 110 SPV, no Irish taxes are ever paid, causing a permanent loss to the exchequer. Irish anti-avoidance rules (iii. above), would kick-in and apply Irish withholding taxes of 20% in such situations, but the Irish Revenue would controversially set these anti-avoidance rules aside in 2016 (). ==FeaturesQualifying company=== For Irish Section 110 SPVs to be accepted under EU tax treaties (and be OECD-whitelisted), they must to be ordinary Irish resident companies, in Irish and EU Company Law. In this regard, more advanced and/or aggressive Irish tax-neutral vehicles, which are fully tax-free and can be operated in greater secrecy from public views, such as the Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF), or LQIAIFs and QIFs, were not deemed suitable for the global securitisation transaction marketplace. As an ordinary Irish company, a Section 110 SPV usually takes one of 3 main forms: * private limited company (LTD); * public limited company (PLC); and * designated activity company (DAC) (essentially a private limited company (LTD), but who can also use listed debt (but not equity) securities). A \\"qualifying company\\" under Section 110 of the 1997 TCA means a company which: ===Qualifying assets=== The list of \\"qualifying assets\\" which can be held inside an Irish Section 110 SPV is large (it has been extended with subsequent Irish Finance Acts). It goes well beyond the original classic securitisation categories and currently includes: ===Structural elements=== There are three key elements relevant to structuring Irish Section 110 SPVs (as discussed in attached references): These structuring elements are also discussed in more detail in the briefing notes issues by the Revenue Commissioners on Section 110 SPVs. Orphan structure In common with most securitisation vehicles, Irish Section 110 SPVs use an orphan structure in which the equity is held by an unconnected third party who has no effective rights or controls on the SPV. Irish registered charitable trusts were a common choice (some Irish law firms went so far as to create their own in- house registered charities). However, a public scandal in 2016 regarding use of Irish Section 110 SPVs in domestic Irish tax avoidance (see ) led to a ruling by the Irish Charity Regulator prohibiting Irish registered charities from owning equity in Section 110 SPVs. Orphaning is a potentially strong tax avoidance tool as it allows equity to be restructured into tax-free debt (see ), and the Revenue Commissioners reserve the right to challenge cases created for tax avoidance, although they have never done so in practice. Participation notes The TCA 1997 legislation includes a headline tax rate of 25% on non-trading income so that the SPV is regarded as an Irish taxable entity. Thus, the Section 110 SPV is not presented overtly as a tax- free vehicle (i.e. unlike an Irish QIAIF), which would attract adverse attention from other tax authorities (under tax treaty rules), or regulators (e.g. EU or OECD). To get to a zero-tax position, the TCA 1997 allows \\"Profit Participation Notes\\" (PPNs). These are artificial internal loans to the SPV, whose rate of interest can be sufficiently variable to absorb all income/gains generated in the SPV. As an Irish trading company, the SPV can charge loan interest as an expense (deductible against Irish tax), rather than a deemed profit distribution (not deductible against Irish tax). PPNs are often domiciled in a tax haven (a dutch sandwich may be needed to avoid Irish withholding tax transferring the PPN interest payments to the tax haven). PPNs are often sought to be classed as \\"Eurobonds\\" in the Irish tax legislation which gives them additional tax robustness, and also allows the PPN to be integrated with the Irish QIAIF regime, also tax-free, and held in a more stable corporate tax haven such as Luxembourg. Where the PPNs fail to achieve \\"Eurobond\\" classification, the PPNs can be owned by an Irish QIAIF, who will then issue qualifying \\"Eurobonds\\" from a sink ofc jurisdiction. While the various Irish Finance Acts strengthened the rules on PPNs (the 2016 Finance Act mentions a \\"market rate\\" of interest and that structures should be created on an \\"arms length\\" bases), the effective rules, and the list of exemptions and exempted parties, allow considerable freedom in structuring PPNs to sweep up all income generated by the \\"qualifying assets\\" in the SPV (via PPN interest payments). Irish professional services firms, who lead the drafting of Irish tax legislation, can provide the corporate finance services needed to produce evidence satisfying the \\"market rate\\" and \\"arms length\\" tests. As Ireland has no thin capitalisation rules, the Section 110 SPV can be 100% financed by PPN debt, making the SPV a fully tax-free vehicle (i.e. no equity leakage). Tax residence To qualify as an Irish resident company the Section 110 SPV needs to meet minimum tests from the Irish Revenue to demonstrate that the SPV is (a) incorporated in Ireland and (b) \\"managed and controlled\\" from Ireland. The orphaning process will ensure the relevant trust that \\"owns\\" the SPV equity is Irish domiciled, thus satisfying the incorporation test. The \\"managed and controlled\\" test is vaguer (based on UK case law) but typically results in the SPV requiring two Irish resident directors, a registered Irish office, an Irish-based administrator, and that the key Board meetings are held in Ireland. ===Approval process=== There is no process for approving the creation of a Section 110 SPV. Luxembourg Leaks showed pre-approving vehicles, risks challenges under EU State aid rules, resulting in sanctions and fines. The entire economic benefit of the SPV sector to Ireland (of which Section 110 is a subset) is only circa €100m in annual fees paid to Irish professional services firms (SPVs pay no Irish taxes). Irish Revenue Commissioners reserve the right to challenge existing Irish Section 110 SPVs under the general Irish anti-avoidance legislation. However, as since the creation of Section 110 SPVs in 1997, no case has ever been brought by the Irish Revenue against an Irish Section 110 SPV. Up until 2017, no audit even has ever been undertaken by Irish Revenue into the activities of an Irish Section 110 SPV. The Section 110 SPV is therefore set up and a notice sent to the Irish Revenue declaring the intention of the Directors to file under Section 110 of the 1997 TCA. Before 2010, there was no obligation the Irish Revenue to acknowledge this notice was received, however, this has recently been formalised to an 8–week notice period. The IDSA is lobbying for a 24–hour \\"online\\" approval system (as per the QIAIFs). ==Evolution== Irish Debt Securities Association (IDSA) launch in 2013 with Minister Richard Bruton, IDSA CEO Gary Palmer, and IDSA Chairman Turlough Galvin of Matheson’s Tax Practice. By 2017, the Irish Section 110 SPV was the most popular securitisation SPV in the EU. In addition, the Irish Section 110 SPV expanded its adoption and use far beyond the original securitisation market to make the IFSC the 3rd largest Shadow Banking OFC in the world. While SPVs pay no Irish tax, the generate circa €100m annually for the Irish economy in fees paid to law firms. IFSC law firms successfully lobbied in the 2003 and 2005 Finance Acts for the withholding tax rules to be relaxed for Section 110 SPVs (and especially for Eurobond financing). They argued Irish Revenue could still challenge any Section 110 SPV deemed unfit (ii. ), and that the withholding tax rules put the IFSC at a disadvantage versus Luxembourg. Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny and PwC (Ireland) Managing Partner Feargal O'Rourke Successive Irish Finance Acts (2003, 2008, 2011 and 2016) extended the list of \\"qualifying assets\\" beyond the classic categories that make up the bulk of the global securitisation market. According to IDSA (Irish Debt Securities Association, the Section 110 SPV lobby group created by IFSC tax-law firm, Matheson in 2013), the only asset which Irish Section 110 SPVs cannot invest in is direct Irish or non-Irish property (Ireland has REITs for this). Section 110 SPV legislation has been refined around the treatment of PPNs so they are acceptable to the widest tax treaty network. The focus has been around tightening the language around \\"arm's length\\" or \\"market tested\\" rates of PPN interest. However the rules remain sufficiently broad, and the exclusions sufficiently general, to materially limit the effect of these changes. A particular aim is enabling the PPN's to be classed as \\"Eurobonds\\" so they can be legally domiciled in Luxembourg, which has become a key \\"backdoor\\" out of the Irish corporate tax regime into a full Sink OFC. To protect the PPNs from the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which target instruments like PPNs, the Irish Government allows Section 110 SPVs to file accounts under old Irish GAAP (GAAP 2004). In addition the 2010 Transfer Pricing rules do not apply to Section 110 SPVs. Irish professional services have developed ways to link Irish Section 110 SPVs with Irish QIAIFs (or QIFs) to create an Orphaned Super–QIAIF. This vehicle combines the secrecy of the Irish QIAIF structures (unlike SPVs, QIAIFs don't file Irish public accounts), with the tax neutrality and global acceptability of the Irish Section 110 SPV. Using a QIAIF to \\"own\\" the Section 110 PPNs, which can be \\"back-to-backed\\" with newly issued \\"eurobonds\\" from the QIAIF, is an established \\"backdoor\\" out of the Irish tax system to Luxembourg, the main Sink OFC for Ireland. Abuses of Section 110 SPVs in the Irish domestic market (see below), led Finance Minister Michael Noonan to make changes in light of \\".. use of aggressive tax practices by some Section 110 companies to avoid paying tax...\\" The new rules are complex but prohibit Section 110 SPVs from holding direct Irish property and tighten the Irish Revenue notification process to 8 weeks. () The abuses highlighted that the Central Bank of Ireland provides little effective regulation on Section 110 SPVs, however, they were only uncovered because the Section 110 SPV must file public accounts with the Irish CRO. In late 2016 the Central Bank of Ireland began a consultation process to upgrade the little- used L–QIAIF regime. In February 2018, the Central Bank of Ireland changed its AIF \\"Rulebook\\" to allow L–QIAIFs hold the same assets that Section 110 SPVs could own. However, the upgraded L–QIAIFs offered two specific improvements over the Section 110 SPV: Three months after the Irish Central Bank updated its AIF \\"Rulebook\\", the Irish Revenue Commissioners issued new guidance in May 2018 on Section 110 SPV taxation which would further reduce their attractiveness as a mechanism to avoid Irish taxes on Irish assets. In June 2018, the Central Bank of Ireland reported that €55 billion of U.S.-owned distressed Irish assets, equivalent to 25% of Irish GNI*, moved out of Section 110 SPVs and into L-QIAIFs. The L–QIAIF, and the ICAV wrapper, is expected to take over as the main structure for avoiding Irish tax on Irish assets in a confidential manner. ==Abuses== Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) regulates Section 110 SPVs. When Irish public scandals concerning the Section 110 SPV emerged in 2016–2017, the CBI upgraded the little-used L–QIAIF, to give the same benefits as Section 110 SPVs, but with full confidentiality and tax secrecy. The abuses below were uncovered because Section 110 SPVs have to file public accounts with the Irish CRO. The Central Bank of Ireland has addressed this aspect of Section 110 SPVs by upgrading the little used L–QIAIF regime in February 2018 to give the same tax-free structure to hold Irish assets via debt instruments, but in a confidential structure (discussed further in Ireland as a tax haven). ===Vulture fund tax avoidance=== Stephen Donnelly TD. Estimated US distressed funds would avoid €20 billion in Irish taxes from 2016–2026 on circa €40 billion of Irish investments made from 2012–2016 (which represented circa €80 billion in headline Irish loan balances). From the 1997 TCA to the Irish crisis in 2009, there is no known case of a Section 110 SPV being used to avoid Irish domestic taxes on Irish assets or businesses. They were confined to global finance as was intended. Per earlier (), while Irish banks used Section 110 SPVs to raise global capital for Irish loan books, they never used Section 110 SPVs to avoid Irish taxes on their Irish activities (the Irish borrower paid interest to the Irish bank, and not into a Section 110 SPV). The Irish financial media noted in 2016 that US distressed debt funds (known by the pejorative term–vulture funds) were filing Irish company CRO accounts with large profits on their Irish investments (made from 2012 onwards), but no Irish tax payments. They could also see that the equity of these companies was \\"owned\\" by Irish-registered charities (children's charities in cases), some of which were operated by IFSC-based law firms. The CRO filings showed these vulture funds were using orphaned Section 110 SPVs, structured by IFSC–based law firms (e.g. Matheson, A&L; Goodbody and Dillon Eustace and Mayson Hayes Curran), who use Section 110 SPVs in securitisation work, to export untaxed income and capital gains earned on domestic Irish assets to offshore locations (via the PPN interest payments), such as the Cayman Islands. Funds using the Section 110 SPVs included the largest names in distressed investing, including: Mezzanine capital lenders were also using Section 110 SPVs to avoid taxes but in addition, by restructuring the equity of their clients into Section 110 \\"qualifying loans\\", they helped their Irish borrowers reduce Irish domestic corporation tax. The State's Irish Strategic Investment Fund was a co-investor in these firms (e.g. BlueBay Capital, Cardinal Capital). It emerged that the regulator of Section 110 SPVs, the Central Bank of Ireland, was paying rent to a US vulture fund landlord, that had structured their investment to avoid all Irish taxes, and stamp duty, on the rent. The Irish media uncovered that the National Asset Management Agency, presented to distressed debt funds in London on how to use Section 110 SPVs (and QIAIFs) to avoid Irish taxes on their Irish investments. Public statements, Guideline Bulletins, and FOI Data, from the Irish Revenue, implied that Irish Revenue (a) knew these funds were using Section 110 SPVs in the domestic Irish market, and (b) that Irish Revenue were prepared to issue rulings to amend their own anti-avoidance rules (esp. withholding tax rules and CG50 land certificates) to facilitate the tax avoidance. Stephen Donnelly TD, called for a Dáil investigation and produced calculations based on the €80 billion of published loan balances sold by the National Asset Management Agency (or \\"NAMA\\") to the US funds for circa €40 billion. Donnelly estimated that the loss of Irish taxes over the next decade from these assets being taken out of the Irish tax system (i.e. base erosion and profit shifting effects), could reach €20 billion (or €2 billion per annum). The Irish Times calculated the total economic contribution of Section 110 SPVs since their creation, would be vastly exceeded by these tax losses. The affair escalated into a major public scandal during 2016, and was covered as such in the international media, and in several Irish RTÉ Prime Time Investigates programs. The Irish Government claimed that the U.S. funds had discovered unknown but legitimate loopholes, which they moved to close in the 2016 Finance Act. The Government budgeted €50 million in total additional taxes from the closure of these loopholes, however NAMA, a small investor in Section 110 SPVs, disclosed an immediate €158 million tax charge due to the Act. The slowness of the Government's response in closing these \\"perceived\\" loopholes, and the extensive list of exemptions (including a 5-year CGT exemption), and excluded parties to the Act, remains a source of dispute. Irish Revenue attempted no prosecution for the acknowledged tax-avoidance. Funds could leave Section 110 SPVs in place and continue to earn tax-free gains, as long as they did not foreclose. If they foreclosed, they had a period in which to sell the assets, and hence the 5–year CGT exemption. They could also transfer their Section 110 assets into a more confidential QIAIF (and later, an LQIAIF), also using the 5–year CGT exemption to avoid incurring taxes while restructuring. The limited response of the Irish Government led some Irish commentators to wonder if the vulture funds had their support (i.e. there was no loophole just a \\"blind eye\\"). In June 2018, the Central Bank of Ireland reported that €55 billion in Irish assets, owned by U.S. distressed debt funds, equivalent to 25% of Irish GNI*, moved out of Section 110 SPVs. This figure exceeded Stephen Donnelly's 2016 estimate of €40 billion in Irish distressed asset values hiding in Section 110 SPVs (representing €80 billion in loan balances). The Central Bank of Ireland had begun a process to upgrade the tax-free L–QIAIF regime in November 2016 (just after Minister Noonan closed the \\"perceived\\" Section 110 loopholes). In February 2018, the Central Bank relaunched the historically little-used L-QIAIF, with the same tax-free features as the Section 110 SPV, but with the distinction that L-QIAIFs do not have to file public CRO accounts. The L–QIAIF is now the main vehicle for U.S. distressed debt funds shielding against Irish tax on their Irish assets. In March 2019, the UN Special Rapporter on housing, Leilani Farha, formally wrote to the Irish Government on behalf of the UN, regarding its concerns regarding \\"preferential tax laws\\" for foreign investment funds on Irish assets which were compromising the human rights of tenants in Ireland. In April 2019, Irish technology entrepreneur Paddy Cosgrave launched a Facebook campaign to highlight abuses of Section 110 SPVs, as well as QIAIFs and L-QIAIFs, stating: \\"The L-QIAIF runs the risk of being a weapon of mass destruction\\". ===Unregulated shadow banking=== Uncovering OFC Networks. Section 110 SPVs have helped make Ireland the fifth largest global conduit OFC, and one of the largest EU–28 corporate tax havens. Research by Trinity College Dublin Professor Jim Stewart and Cillian Doyle show Section 110 SPVs are effectively unregulated and attract little oversight by the Irish Revenue or Central Bank. Even post the 2016 Finance Act (), the data asked for could not be used to assess the provenance of an Irish Section 110 SPV, or its source of funds. Their research in particular noted the following: Further research by Stewart and Doyle shows Russian firms funneled €100bn into Irish Section 110 SPVs since 2007. Some of these Russian firms appeared unsuitable from a number of perspectives (i.e. criminal or sanctioned activities). Many SPVs resembled a brass plate type set up - a situation the Irish Government has stated that it is adverse to. Of particular note in this research was: Stewart and Doyle's academic papers on Irish Section 110 SPVs highlight the combination of an anonymous (via orphaning), and tax-free (via the Profit Participation Notes), OECD–whitelisted wrapper, in an effectively unregulated environment, has coincided with Ireland's position as the world's 4th largest Shadow Banking OFC. Doyle identified certain Russian banks that were using these vehicles to create fictitious assets and hide losses on their balance sheet. Through an examination of one recently collapsed bank, MDM, the techniques used to create this scheme and the effects on the bank's balance sheet were explored. The ex. Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland said the risks of Section 110 SPV abuse are not appreciated by the Irish Government. The IMF noted the same brass plate type regulation of Irish Section 110 SPVs. This was picked up by Oxfam who has listed Ireland as a top corporate tax haven. It has coincided with G20 economy, Brazil, blacklisting Ireland as a tax haven. A 2017 seminal academic paper published in Nature on global offshore financial centres (OFCs) (\\"Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers: Conduits and Sinks in the Global Corporate Ownership Network\\") lists Ireland as one of five key global Conduit OFCs (with the Netherlands, UK, Singapore and Switzerland). The five Conduit- OFCs are the links to 24 Sink OFCs, which comprise the key offshore centres (i.e. the Cayman Islands). The Conduit-OFCs are the hubs which provide the regulatory reputation and the legal and taxation wappers (i.e. Section 110 SPVs) for money to get into, and out of, the Sink OFCs. ==See also== *Economy of the Republic of Ireland *Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland *International Financial Services Centre *Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF) *Conduit and Sink OFCs *Matheson (law firm) *Ireland as a tax haven ==External links== * Irish Debt Securities Association, the lobby group set up by the Dubin tax-law firms that create Section 110 SPVs * Irish Revenue Qualifying companies (Section 110 Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997) * Irish Central Bank Special Purpose Vehicles * Professor James Charles Stewart Adjunct Professor, School Office - Business, Trinity College Dublin, leading academic research into Section 110 SPVs ==References== Category:Offshore finance Category:Legal entities Category:Types of business entity Category:Tax avoidance Category:Money laundering Category:Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Category:Economy of the Republic of Ireland Category:Corporate tax avoidance Category:Offshore companies Category:Offshore law firms Category:Offshore magic circle ","title":"Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)"},{"id":"56873015","text":"The Mohammed Bin Rashid Library is a large library in the Al Jaddaf locality of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. ==Overview== The design of the library is inspired by the shape of a Turkish lectern. The main features of this library will be a conference centre, exhibition spaces, a children's library, a bookshop on the ground floor, reading halls, service areas, a business library, and training halls. The basement of the library will be able to accommodate around a thousand cars. The project is under construction at a cost of AED1 billion. 300,000 to 400,000 volumes will be available in the library's open-access section. The library will have book handling and information systems. The library has been designed by consortium of 'asp' Architekten Stuttgart, Obermeyer Planen+Beraten Munich and ACG Architecture Consulting Group. The structural design of the library and its foundation system was awarded from ACG to S. A. MIRO, INC. (www.samiro.com) for their experience in designing complicated structures similar to the library. The project's main contractor is ASGC, a Dubai-based leading construction group. The library was due to open in 2018 but is still under construction in 2019. The library is on the Dubai Creek and the nearest Dubai Metro station is Dubai Creek metro station. ==History== Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum announced the conception of the library in February 2016, the \\"Year of Reading\\" in Dubai. Designed in the shape of an open book on a lectern, the seven-story library will cover 650,000 square feet of property and is expected to facilitate 9 million visitors annually. The Mohammed Bin Rashid Library will house over 4.5 million printed, digital, and audio books. The AED1 billion contract for the construction for the Mohammed Bin Rashid Library is the largest cultural project in Dubai. Construction began on September 2016, to be completed by mid-2018. As of December 2017, the construction of the library was 22% completed. In 2018 it was 72% complete. ==Services== The library will encompass eight specialized collections, including an information centre, a media centre, an Arabic library, an international library, a public library, a business library, a youth library, a children’s library, a family library, and a reading corner. Furthermore, the library will include a center for conservation and preservation of books, manuscripts, and documents as well as a special library for the Al Maktoum Collection. The library will host over 100 cultural and intellectual events every year along with a permanent art gallery. The inclusion of a Civilization museum and an Arab Heritage Museum will allow people to embrace their Arab identity through heritage preservation initiatives. There will be a 500-seat theater for lectures and seminars for launching intellectual and cultural events regionally and globally. The MBR Library will have modern technology to serve scientific research and dissemination of knowledge. Hussein Nasser Lootah, Director-General of Dubai Municipality, has stated that the MBR Library will be a \\"world accredited reference in Arabic language and a destination for specialists, scientists, writers, poets, intellectuals, talented minds, and students.

She belonged to the most successful burghers in Stockholm in the 1520s. The name 'Anna Taskomakare' means \\"Anna the Bagmaker\\". She belongs to the very first women merchants in Sweden of whom there are any significant amount of information. The name of Anna's parents are unknown, but she was the sister of Simon Skräddare (\\"Simon the Tailor\\") and with him the heir of their parents, and born into the wealthy Stockholm burgher class: it is noted that her brother sold a stone house which had previously belonged to their parents in 1513. On an unknown date, Anna married a burgher craftsman of bags, who is named as \\"Bag Maker\\" but whose first name cannot be clearly established. It is clearly stated that both Anna's husband and brother was executed in the Stockholm Bloodbath of 1520. As a widow, Anna became more visible in the official documents. As was not uncommon, she is stated to have been active in the profession of her spouse before his death, though it was first as a widow when she is formally recognized as a bag maker, taking over the workshop and permission to manufacture and sell bags and purses from her late spouse. Aside from this, she also shared the inheritance from her wealthy brother with his widow Margit Priwalk, which gave her the capital to a parallel career as an estate owner. She bought, renovated and enlarged houses in Stockholm and rented them out. Further, she traded in iron from Arboga and copper from Kopparberg. She is described as successful and wealthy. In 1528, the king confiscated one of her shipments of copper and iron. As compensation, he gave her a stone house which had belonged to the religious organisation of Saint Catherine's Guild prior to the Swedish Reformation. This is the last documentation where she is mentioned, and the year of her death is unknown. == References == * Bjarne Larsson, Gabriela; , hämtad 2018-03-08.

They deliver a gentle folk music that inexorably swells into a powerful wave. They spent two years in the high desert mountain town of Taos, New Mexico making music and friends. After an 18-month album release tour spanning the United States and Canada, they established a new home base in Asheville and released their album, Champion. Their approach to music feels at once old-timey and totally modern. They exhibit an enviable versatility on several instruments—Collins on tenor banjo, tenor ukulele, and guitar, and Jordan on cello and guitar—and they blend their voices to create harmonies that wrap listeners in sound. ==Biography== Tina & Her Pony was formed in 2009 in Asheville after the chance meeting of Collins and Jordan. Collins had grown up on the periphery of the Appalachians and Jordan was raised in Florida by her Guatemalan mother. They released their first full-length album in March 2012, which was mixed and mastered in Oakland, California, with Myles Boisen (The Tiger Lillies, Kronos Quartet) and features the trumpeter Chris Grady (also featured on Tom Waits’ Mule Variations). They also released a six-track EP titled Walkin’ in My Sleep at the same time. After completing an eighteen-month album release tour that took the band through the entire USA and Canada, they moved to Asheville to work on Champion, released in fall 2017. Champion was recorded at Echo Mountain Recording Studio and features musicians from Rising Appalachia, The Honeycutters, Holy Ghost Tent Revival and Cicada Rhythm. ===Musical style and influence=== Both classically trained musicians, Collins and Jordan are known for their tight, sweet, smooth vocal harmonies and simple, exposed, crafted instrumentation on cello, tenor ukulele and guitar. They could draw easy and favorable comparisons to The Indigo Girls. Like their forebears, Tina & Her Pony's harmonies are deep in the pocket. The songs themselves carry a gentle wisdom that invigorates the listener. The music draws inspiration from both Appalachia and the high desert, in addition to \\"bluegrass and old-time melodies that have been sung by generations of women before\\". Tina and Her Pony is contributing a unique sound to the American folk tradition. With warm smiles and honest simplicity, they offer original songs that echo familiar melodies, infused with radical, queer lyrics and uncommon instrumentation. ==Discography== #Walkin' in My Sleep (2012) ## \\"The Ghost Tree\\" (2:40) ## \\"Sweet Love\\" (2:35) ## \\"Burning Mother Mary\\" (3:12) ## \\"Walkin' in My Sleep\\" (2:09) ## \\"Back Home\\" (3:44) ## \\"Rough and Rocky\\" (4:50) #Tina and Her Pony (2012) ## \\"Sweet Love\\" (2:43) ## \\"Far Away\\" (2:37) ## \\"Little Bird\\" (3:10) ## \\"Rain and Snow\\" (5:00) ## \\"Ana Bai\\" (3:42) ## \\"Never Had You\\" (2:42) ## \\"I'm So Lonesome\\" (4:22) ## \\"Winter in the West\\" (1:56) ## \\"Burning Mother Mary\\" (3:11) ## \\"Crash and Burn\\" (0:17) ## \\"Medicine\\" (3:08) ## \\"Snow Covered Mountains\\" (3:10) #Champion (2017) ## \\"Back in Your Life\\" (4:21) ## \\"I'm the Same\\" (5:53) ## \\"I Can Love You Better\\" (1:47) ## \\"Folly\\" (3:19) ## \\"Good Man\\" (2:15) ## \\"Come Here\\" (5:06) ## \\"Long Iron Chain\\" (3:10) ## \\"Champion\\" (5:07) ## \\"The BBQ\\" (4:01) ## \\"Bat\\" (2:57) ## \\"Lion Teeth\\" (5:48) ## \\"The Wind\\" (2:41) ==References *Tina & Her Pony Category:American musical duos Category:Musical groups from North Carolina Category:Musical groups established in 2009 Category:American folk musical groups Category:Queer culture ","title":"Tina &amp; Her Pony"},{"id":"56873161","text":"The 36th International Film Festival of India was held from November 24 to December 4, 2005 in Goa.

In 1835, he married Jean Wedderburn, daughter of James Wedderburn and Isabella Clerk, and they had at least eight sons and five daughters, including: John (born 1843); James (1845–1892); Peter (born 1847); Andrew Cathcart (1851–1887); Colin George (1853–1888); Hugh (born 1855); Adam Gillies (1858–1891); Arthur Octavius (1862–1889); Isabella; Rebecca Marion (died 1914); Jean; Helen Agnes; and Mary. Blackburn started his career in the military as a cornet in the 2nd Regiment of Life Guards in 1830, before retiring as a lieutenant in 1837. He then became a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for Stirlingshire. In 1846, he became chairman of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway. ==Political career== A Liberal-Conservative, Blackburn was elected MP for Stirlingshire at a by-election in 1855, caused by the death of William Forbes. In 1859, he was appointed a junior Lord Commissioner of the Treasury, although with little enthusiasm. In correspondence between the-then Chancellor of the Exchequer Benjamin Disraeli and Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby, sent in August 1858, Smith- Stanley said: \\"Blackburn would be a respectable appointment, but there is no particular reason for him.\\" He held the seat until 1865 when he was defeated by the Liberal John Erskine. While being recognised as \\"shrewd, energetic and practical\\" in his role, his defeat was credited to impolite actions regarding the commercial treaty, the county franchise, and game laws. ==References * Category:UK MPs 1852–1857 Category:UK MPs 1857–1859 Category:UK MPs 1859–1865 Category:1811 births Category:1870 deaths Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Stirlingshire Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Stirling constituencies Category:Scottish Tory MPs (pre-1912) ","title":"Peter Blackburn (MP)"},{"id":"56873233","text":"Lithuanian Plants Genes Bank () is plant gene resource guardian and sustainable use organization governed by Lithuania's Ministry of Environment.

The Avangard is one of the six new Russian strategic weapons unveiled by Russian President Vladimir Putin on 1 March 2018. ==History== Launch of the UR-100UTTKh ICBM, carrying the Avangard HGV, Dombarovsky Air Base, 26 December 2018 According to Vladimir Putin, the US withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002 forced Russia to start developing hypersonic weapons: \\"We had to create these [hypersonic] weapons in response to the US deployment of a strategic missile defense system, which in the future would be capable of virtually neutralizing, zeroing out all our nuclear potential\\". In 2007, when asked about U.S. plans to deploy ballistic missile defenses in Europe, Putin mentioned that Russia was developing “strategic weapons systems of a completely different type that will fly at hypersonic speed and will be able to change trajectory both in terms of altitude and direction\\". The Avangard (then called Yu-71 and Yu-74) was reportedly flight tested between February 2015 and June 2016 on board UR-100UTTKh ICBMs launched from Dombarovsky Air Base, Orenburg Oblast, when it reached a speed of and successfully hit targets at the Kura Missile Test Range, Kamchatka Krai. In October 2016, another flight test was carried out using a R-36M2 heavy ICBM launched from Dombarovsky Air Base, successfully hitting a target at the Kura Missile Test Range. This was reportedly the first fully successful test of the glide vehicle. On 1 March 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin in his presidential address to the Federal Assembly in Moscow announced that testing of the weapon is now complete and that it has entered serial production. This was further confirmed by the commander of Russian Strategic Missile Forces, Colonel General . The latest flight test occurred on 26 December 2018. Avangard carried by a UR-100UTTKh ICBM launched from Dombarovsky Air Base successfully hit a target at the Kura Missile Test Range. The Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Yury Borisov stated a day later that the glider flew at 27 times the speed of sound, \\"invulnerable to interception\\". According to Russian Defense Ministry's press service/TASS, the Avangard missile system with the hypersonic glide-vehicle was demonstrated to the US inspection group in accordance with the New START treaty procedures on November 24–26, 2019. On 27 December 2019, the first missile regiment armed with the Avangard HGV officially entered combat duty. On 19 September 2020, Herbert Efremov, an Advisor for Science at the NPO Mashinostroyenia, was awarded Order of St. Andrew for his contributions to the Avangard development. ==Design== HGV's differ from traditional ballistic missiles by their ability to maneuver and operate at lower altitudes. The combination of maneuverability and high speed poses significant challenges for conventional missile defense. With the advantage again swinging toward attack, the defense industry is concerned that weapons of this type will reignite the kind of arms race that dominated the cold war era. According to open-source analysis by Jane's, Avangard is a pure glide vehicle without an independent propulsion system. When approaching a target, the glider is capable of sharp high speed horizontal and vertical evasive maneuvers in flight, which Russian officials claim makes it \\"invulnerable to any missile defence system\\".https://www.janes.com/article/85511/russia-announces-successful- flight-test-of-avangard-hypersonic-glide-vehicle Arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis of the Institute of International Studies expressed scepticism towards Avangard's ability to evade missile defences, stating that \\"gliding results in slower speeds than traditional re-entry\\". The blast yield of a nuclear warhead carried by the Avangard is reportedly more than 2 megatons TNT. ==Operators== ; : The Strategic Missile Forces are the only operator of the Avangard HGV.

Likely born in the late 1430s,Given that her mother Saw Min Phyu was born only in 1415 per (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 54), and that her first husband Mingyi Swa was born 1435, Myat Lay may have been born in the late 1430s. the princess was a granddaughter of the famous crown prince Minye Kyawswa of Ava, and a great granddaughter of King Minkhaung I of Ava from her mother's side, and a descendant of King Kyawswa of Pagan from both sides. She had two full siblings: Gov. Minye Kyawswa I of Kalay and Myat Hpone Pyo; and three half-siblings.Per (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 84, 90), Shwe Khet had two children by his first wife Saw Myo Ke; and per (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 53), he had a daughter with Min Hla Htut. Though the royal chronicles do not state her place of birth, Myat Lay was raised in Prome where her father was governor between 1442 and 1446,Hmannan Vol. 2 3003: 84, 86 and in Tharrawaddy, the southernmost district of Prome to which her father was reassigned, from 1446 onwards until her marriage.Hmannan Vol. 2 3003: 88 She returned to Prome, perhaps in the 1450s, when she was married to Viceroy Mingyi Swa, the second son of then King Narapati I of Ava. She became the vicereine of Prome, and had 11 children with Swa. Myat Lay became the chief queen consort in 1482. That year, Viceroy Swa died, and his younger brother Gov. Thado Minsaw of Tharrawaddy seized the viceroyalty of Prome, and declared Prome's independence from Ava. In the process, he also raised his sister-in-law Myat Lay as his chief queen. Thado Minsaw's rebellion was successful; Prome became an independent state with territories that included Tharrawaddy in the south and Myede in the north.Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 93–97 It was the last mention of Myat Lay in the chronicles. Thado Minsaw lived until 1526 but it is unclear if Myat Lay survived him until then. ==Family== Myat Lay and her first husband Swa had 11 children (four sons and seven daughters).

Kyle graduated from St Andrews University where he was a protégé of William Carmichael McIntosh. In 1903 he was appointed as Biological Secretary to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), based in Copenhagen. He was an expert on flatfish, especially plaice, and worked with Walter Garstang at Plymouth. Later he collaborated extensively with Ernst Ehrenbaum of the Museum of Natural History in Hamburg. He made important contributions to fisheries science and produced definitive works which were among the first scientific studies to address the issue of overfishing. It is known that in the late 1920s and early 1930s he became alienated from his wife and children, referring to himself in letters as an outcast. He was, however, reconciled to at least one of his sisters later in life. His later life is almost unknown except that he died in 1951 in Scotland. He was an accomplished linguist who translated the works of many Danish and German fisheries scientists and ichthyologists into English. His magnum opus was a book on the fisheries of Great Britain and Ireland which was published in German. An earlier book, \\"The biology of fishes\\", was published in English, but it was dedicated to Ehrenbaum. Kyle appeared to find living in Germany more conducive to his work and he was often assumed to have been a German rather than a Scot. Abstract. Kyle was one of the founders of the study of the bioeconomics of fishing and his argument that fish stocks were outside the scope of normal economics because economics are not subject to \\"natural law\\" was pioneering and remains generally accepted. ==Publications== A selection of some of the published works by Kyle is set out below: *On the Presence of Nasal Secretory Sacs and a Nasopharyngeal communication in Teleostei with an especial reference to Cynoglossus semilaevis Gthr.

It is a campaign-based dungeon crawl game with a branching narrative campaign with ninety-five unique playable scenarios, seventeen playable classes, and more than 1,500 cards in a box which weighs almost 10 kg (22 pounds). == Gameplay == It is a fantasy- themed, campaign-based tactical skirmish game, in which players try to triumph in combat-based scenarios which scale in difficulty depending on the number of players. The game is cooperative and campaign driven, with 1 to 4 players working their way through a branching story consisting of almost 100 scenarios. The campaign develops in a legacy format, with stickers that are placed on the board and cards and sealed envelopes that are opened when certain criteria are met. While it has drawn comparisons to role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons and other dungeon-crawl board games, Gloomhaven uses game mechanics similar to modern eurogames. Characters and monsters move about on hex tiles representing dungeons and cellars. Players simultaneously choose two cards to play each turn, each of which has a top and a bottom half, and choose the top half of one card and the bottom of the other to allow their characters to take actions such as moving, healing and attacking monsters. Randomization, usually provided by dice, is handled by a deck of cards. == Release and reception == Gloomhaven has received extremely positive reviews, culminating in it reaching the spot as the top rated board game on leading website BoardGameGeek in 2017 and keeping that spot for much of 2018 and 2019. It also won six Golden Geek awards from the site, including for the best overall game of 2017. The game was originally sold via a 2015 Kickstarter campaign which raised $386,104 from 4,904 backers. After strong early reviews, a second Kickstarter campaign was launched on April 4th, 2017, and delivered in November 2017 which raised about $4 million from over 40,000 backers. The game was released shortly thereafter to retail for a suggested price of $140. The game has received extremely positive reviews. Gaming website Geek & Sundry described Gloomhaven as \\"a masterful design\\" and suggested \\"it belongs in a museum\\".

He studied at Nottingham School of Art from 1890 to 1900 and then at the Royal College of Art in London. After leaving London he went to the Belfast College of Art as professor of sculpture and lecturer in anatomy. He began teaching at the Nottingham School of Art around 1919 and in 1922 was made principal, in succession to Joseph Harrison, a position he held until 1939. It was during this tenure that he created some of his most famous sculpture for the new Nottingham Council House, with a work called Justice, and the two lions flanking the main entrance steps. He also created War Memorials for the Law Society, and Messrs. Thomas Forman and Sons, the bronze tablet on the Nottingham Castle sundial in memory of the fallen of the 17th Battalion Sherwood Foresters, the Bonington bronze tablet at Arnold, the Lancashire Memorial of Messrs. J.B. Lewis and Company, the bust of Samuel Morley in Nottingham Arboretum, and the figure on St Luke’s House. In London he completed the sculptural decoration on Selfridges building on Oxford Street. He was a fierce critic of the modernist style of sculpture, and railed against works produced by Jacob Epstein. In a lecture at the Nottingham Society of Artists in 1928 he said > I feel apologetic for mentioning these abnormalities and would not have done > so were it not for the wide publicity accorded to them. To me, it is an > affront to the intelligence to suggest that you should admire works so > destitute of beauty and so fearful in character. Can things of this > description live as the masterpieces of the ancients have done? He maintained his studio in Beeston. He was appointed an associate member of the Royal Society of British Sculptors in 1923 and in 1938 was elected a Fellow. On retirement from Nottingham in 1939 he moved to Newnham on Severn in Gloucestershire. The outbreak of the Second World War restricted access to materials for sculpture. He became a member of the British Bryological Society, and prepared hundreds of illustrations for A Histology of British Mosses. He died on 8 May 1955. He is commemorated in the naming of a public house, The Joseph Else, at 11-12 South Parade, Nottingham. ==Works== *Portrait bust, displayed at the Royal Academy of Arts 1910 *Bust of William Kiddier, displayed at the Royal Academy of Arts 1915 *Model of a War Memorial proposed for Ryde, Isle of Wight 1919 *Bust of Thomas Barrett, displayed at Nottingham Castle Museum 1921 *War Memorial, Nottingham Incorporated Law Society 1921 *Sculpture of A Mask, displayed at the Royal Academy of Arts 1925 *Sculpture of Sacrificium, displayed at the Royal Academy of Arts 1926 *Sculpture of Gladius Sertumque, displayed at the Royal Academy of Arts 1927 *Bust of Samuel Morley, Nottingham Arboretum 1928 *Memorial bronze to Richard Parkes Bonington, Arnold, Nottingham 1929 *Left Lion, Nottingham Council House 1929 *Right Lion, Nottingham Council House 1929 *Frieze on The Old Industries of Nottingham, Nottingham Council House 1929 *Commerce on Nottingham Council House 1929 *Sculpture of Youth, displayed at the Royal Academy of Arts 1932 *Sculpture of The Sun Worshipper (L'Adortrice de Soleil), displayed at the Royal Academy of Arts 1932 *Sculpture of St Luke, St Luke’s House, Friar Lane, Nottingham 1933 *Panel of The Ride of the Valkyries, displayed at the Royal Academy of Arts 1933 ==References== Category:1874 births Category:1955 deaths Category:Alumni of Nottingham School of Art Category:Alumni of the Royal College of Art Category:Artists from Nottingham Category:British architectural sculptors Category:British male sculptors Category:Fellows of the Royal British Society of Sculptors Category:Members of the British Bryological Society ","title":"Joseph Else"},{"id":"56873505","text":"The 1950-51 Yorkshire Football League was the 25th season in the history of the Yorkshire Football League. ==Division One== The division featured 4 new teams: * Beighton Miners Welfare, promoted from Division Two * Dinnington Athletic, promoted from Division Two * Retford Town, promoted from Division Two * Scarborough reserves, promoted from Division Two ===Map=League table=Division Two== The division featured 3 new teams: * Bradford United, joined from ?? * Chesterfield 'A', relegated from Division One * Thorne Colliery, relegated from Division One ===Map=League table=League CupThird Round=Semi-finals=Final=References== Category:1950–51 in English football leagues Category:Yorkshire Football League ","title":"1950–51 Yorkshire Football League"},{"id":"56873512","text":"Lightning Strikes Twice may refer to: * Lightning Strikes Twice (album), 1989 album by Molly Hatchet * Lightning Strikes Twice (1934 film), 1934 American film directed by Ben Holmes * Lightning Strikes Twice (1951 film), a 1951 film drama ","title":"Lightning Strikes Twice"},{"id":"56873532","text":"Xuxa no Mundo da Imaginação () was a Brazilian children's television series hosted by Xuxa Meneghel at Globo TV, shown Monday through Friday between October 28, 2002 and December 31, 2004. ==Concept== Xuxa's goal was to re- dedicate the children, because since the tragic end of Xuxa Park, it was linked with Planeta Xuxa, a program that was shown on Sundays and dedicated to young people. After his long-term partnership with his businesswoman Marlene Matos, Xuxa ended up with the Planet and dedicated himself to the Mundo da Imaginação. the program was a children's program presented by Xuxa Meneghel, directed by Mário Meirelles, Pedro Vasconcelos and Peter Bretas, general direction of Mario Meirelles, text by Tonio Carvalho, Péricles Barros, Cláudio Lobato, Luciana Sandroni, Mariana Mesquita, Guto Lins and Alessandra Poggi, director of production of Alexandre Ishikawa, produced by Núcleo Roberto Talma. Developed after three years of research, Xuxa no Mundo da Imaginação was geared towards a public from zero to ten years and was conceived with the help of educators and specialized professionals. Educationally, the children's program chose not to display cartoons, having pictures and musical numbers produced in an almost artisanal way, with time and language different from the children's programs presented by Xuxa until then. The scenarios of these pictures and musical numbers sought to convey the idea of the world idealized by children: castles, candy house, colorful flowers, mountains and clouds. There were present symbols of children's stories, with the intention that the child felt transported to the world of imagination. - The program, about 40 minutes long, was divided into four blocks and had 32 frames displayed alternately throughout the week. Through computer graphics capabilities, Xuxa appeared seated on a Terrestrial Globe, with the blue background filled with white clouds, and featured 14 pictures that blended entertainment and didactic elements. ==Format == The longest of the paintings was Cantinho das Histórias, up to ten minutes long, in which Xuxa told children stories with the help of puppets and / or invited actors. The framework Cantigas was one of the highlights of the program. In it, well-known singers made re-readings of classics from our songbook. Other pictures of Xuxa in the world of imagination were Encyclopedia, in which Xuxa showed and explained to children the meaning of terms, words and objects, and Gym, in which a dancer taught choreography. In addition to those already mentioned, other featured figures in the program were Presentacion, in which Xuxa parodies songs with the help of a dog, and Witch Keka, where the character Keka, lived by Xuxa, looked for ill-educated children to transform in witches. * Mixing pictures, music videos, storytelling for children in a fun and didactic way, the children also rescued wheel songs and playful and traditional games, such as hopscotch, apple run and bag run. Xuxa in the world of imagination had a small cast and few children on the stage. The program also counted on the participation of children from all over Brazil, who sent videos, letters, photos and drawings, exhibited by the program. * On December 25, 2002, a Xuxa Christmas special was presented in the world of the imagination. Along with Father Marcelo Rossi, Xuxa spoke about the birthday of the Child Jesus, read letters written by children to God and narrated the birth of Jesus, which was interpreted by children Debby Lagranha, Brunno Abrahão, Tata, Renan and Andrey. The program was attended by the Intrepid Children's Troupe, from the ballet dancers Dalal Achcar, who presented an adaptation of Tchaikovski's Nutcracker, and singer Vinny. Because of the special program, Xuxa in the world of imagination was longer, and Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (2001) and TV Globinho (2000) were not shown on that day. ===Cartoons=== * Bear in the Big Blue House * Sitting Ducks * Spider-Man: The New Animated Series * Rolie Polie Olie * SpongeBob SquarePants * The Angry Beavers * Rocko's Modern Life * CatDog * Cubix ==Reformulations== In April 2003, the program began a new phase under the direction of Pedro Vasconcelos, Marcelo Zambelli and Mário Meirelles, with the latter's general direction, and with text by Tonio Carvalho, Claudio Lobato and Adriana Chevalier. Among the novelties was the radical Imagination, presented by the actor Cláudio Heinrich, who showed sports such as skating, free flight, diving and mountaineering, as well as interviews with famous athletes. The goal was to reach boys between four and eight years of age who, according to a survey, did not identify much with the program and the presenter. Another novelty of the children was the Jornal Mundo da Imaginação, an educational newscast that had as anchors the Xuxinha and Gutinho dolls. The big change was due to the entry of cartoons, which until then were not displayed in the program. In June 2003, Mário Meirelles left the general direction of Xuxa in the World of Imagination. Pedro Vasconcelos, Teresa Lampréia and later Blad Meneghel, brother of Xuxa, took command of the attraction. The program continued to be produced by Núcleo Roberto Talma. In August 2004, the child suffered new changes and adopted a new face, with the circus as its theme. Clowns, jugglers and magicians were the new characters who animated the children and starred in the pictures, music clips and games next to Xuxa. The scenery was also reworked and the big attraction was a hat- shaped ball pool. In addition, the grandstand where the parents of the children were accommodated was transferred to the stage, getting closer to the children and the hostess Even with the reformulations, Xuxa no Mundo da Imaginação failed to reach good ratings and left the programming grid of Rede Globo in December 2004. The following year, Xuxa returned to programming with a new program, TV Xuxa. ==Reception== The program debuted at an average of 15 points. During the first year, however, it was losing audience, being in second place, behind Bom Dia & Companhia, at the time hosted by Jackeline Petkovic, that reached to reach 17 points against 10 of Globo TV. In 2003 the program had already lost more than half of the audience, having an average of only 6 points. At this time also faced the RecordTV, that surpassed the infantile in several days, leaving the Xuxa no Mundo da Imaginação in third place. In 2004 - even with the reformulations and a decrease of the audience of Bom Dia & Companhia by the exit of Jackeline - the program could not react, registering the average of only 5 points. ==References * Category:Rede Globo original programming Category:Brazilian children's television series Category:Brazilian television shows featuring puppetry Category:Portuguese-language television shows Category:2002 Brazilian television series debuts Category:2004 Brazilian television series endings Category:2000s Brazilian television series Category:Brazilian music television series Category:Brazilian television series Category:Xuxa ","title":"Xuxa no Mundo da Imaginação"},{"id":"56873541","text":"The eleventh and final season of the American comedy series Will & Grace premiered on October 24, 2019 and consisted of 18 episodes.

S. Pacat and drawn by Johanna the Mad; both of them are co-creators. The comic book focuses on Nicholas Cox, the illegitimate son of U.S. fencing Olympic champion Robert Coste, who aspires to become a fencing champion like his father. Despite being talented, he's roughly trained due to the hard conditions he grew up in. While at a competition, he's quickly beaten by the fencing prodigy Seiji Katayama and Nicholas vows to beat him. Managing to get into the elite boys school Kings Row on scholarship, Nicholas quickly finds out that Seiji is his roommate. The comic book was first announced by Boom! Studios on August 2017 to be published under their Boom! Box imprint in November. Pacat was inspired to create Fence due to her love for the sport, which she practiced in high school, and her interest in sports manga like Haikyu!!. The series has received a positive response from fans and critics; this positive response resulted in Boom! Studios promoting Fence from a limited series to an ongoing one. In August 2018, Boom! Studios announced that the series would change its format to original graphic novels. The last issue of the ongoing series was released in November 2018. The first original graphic novel, subtitled Rivals, will be released June 30, 2020. ==PlotProductionDevelopment=== Fence was first announced by Boom! Studios on August 17, 2017, to be released under their Boom! Box imprint. It was announced that the comic would be written by C. S. Pacat, writer of the Captive Prince trilogy, and drawn by Johanna the Mad. Regarding the collaboration between the two, Pacat stated that she had been a fan of Johanna for years, ever since she saw Johanna's fan art of Mulan. Similarly, one of the elements that draw Johanna to the project was the chance to work with Pacat, and also because she's interested in LGBTQ- related stories. The first issue was given a November release date. One of the variant covers for issue one was drawn by Shanen Pae, the artist of Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator. On January 4, 2018, it was announced that Boom! Studios had upgraded Fence from a limited series to an ongoing series. Boom! Studios editor, Dafna Pleban, cited the positive response from \\"retailers, fans and press\\" as the main reason for upgrading Fence to an ongoing series. ===Writing=== Regarding her inspiration for Fence, Pacat revealed that she fenced épée in high school and fell in love with the sport; she particularly liked its psychological aspect, as fencers are required to make \\"split-second decisions with everything on the line\\". Another source of inspiration was her six-year stay in Japan. While there, she became interested in sports manga, including Haikyu!! and Hikaru no Go. Pacat worked with an épée coach to choreograph the fight scenes to develop the fencing characterization of each character and ensure they all have different strengths and weaknesses that can change with the narrative. Regarding the portrayal of same-sex relationships within the story, Pacat stated that including queer characters and love stories within her stories is highly important to her. Additionally, she stated that she prefers to write \\"joyously and unabashedly queer\\" stories rather than sad ones. She also noted that quite often, sports anime, manga and comics are very \\"het masculine\\" and often exclude queer characters. ==ReceptionCritical response=== { class=\\" infobox\\" style=\\"float: right; width:24.2em; font-size: 80%; text-align: center; margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; padding:0;\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" ! colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"font-size:120%;\\"  Aggregate scores - ! colspan=\\"4\\" d1dbdf;font-size:120%;\\"  Comic Book Roundup - !

Their careers, collectively and individually, encompass theater, music, film, broadcast media and performance art. They are best known as pioneers of experimental Off-Off- Broadway theater in New York City, San Francisco and Europe from the mid-1960s through the early 1980s. == Early life and Florida == Following his Army Air Corps service in World War II, George Edgerly Harris Jr. of Margaretville, New York married Ann Marie McCanless of Bronxville, New York, on June 21, 1948. They settled in Bronxville, the Westchester County suburb where Ann had been raised. Their first six children were born there: George E. Harris III, Walter Michael Harris, Ann Marie Harris, Frederic Joseph Harris, Jayne Anne Harris and John Joseph Harris. Of these six, Ann Marie died at three months and John Joseph shortly after birth. In 1958 the Harrises relocated to Clearwater, Florida, where their two youngest, Eloise Alice Harris and Mary Lucile Harris, were born. In 1959-1960 George and Ann became interested in theater and began acting with the local Francis Wilson Playhouse. Soon all six children were performing in the Playhouse's Junior Workshop. In 1961 Ann and her son George III converted the family's garage into a theater and founded The El Dorado Players, an acting company named for the street they lived on, composed of the Harris children and their neighborhood friends. The Players’ first two offerings, Bluebeard and The Sheep and the Cheapskate, were short musicals written by Ann Harris during her college years. Subsequent shows were adapted from a Burton-Taylor film (Cleopatra, the Nile Queen) and from a Broadway musical record album (Camelot). The Players made a film, The Unsinkable Titanic, inspired by Walter Lord's 1955 book A Night To Remember, and the 1958 film of the same name. George III wrote the screenplay and directed, and Ann played \\"The Unsinkable Molly Brown.\\" Their efforts were rewarded with a sold- out premiere screening and a positive review in The Clearwater Sun newspaper. Encouraged by their successes, the family sensed an opportunity and decided to move to New York City to seek careers in theater. == Off-Off-Broadway == George Sr. moved to New York City in the summer of 1962 as an advance scout for his family. He soon met Ellen Stewart, founder of La MaMa Experimental Theater Club (ETC), a pioneering producer of experimental theater. By December he was acting and directing for La MaMa, which led to work at the two other flagship theaters of the underground, the Caffe Cino and Judson Poets Theater. The following year George felt sure-footed enough to send for Ann and their six children. Stewart found them an apartment and recommended them to her fellow producers. All eight Harrises were enthusiastically embraced by the playwrights, directors and producers of Off-Off-Broadway. Dubbed “The Lunts of off-off-Broadway” by Cino playwright Robert Patrick, the Harrises found work constantly and quickly established themselves as resourceful performers who could act, sing, dance, write and direct. Jayne Anne (aka Jane) made her New York debut as Christopher Robin in the 1964 Judson Poets Theater musical Sing Ho! For A Bear. George Sr. played multiple roles in the July 1965 premiere of Lanford Wilson's This Is The Rill Speaking at the Caffe Cino, directed by the playwright. In September 1965 Walter Michael made his New York debut at La MaMa ETC as Kenny in the premiere of Wilson's The Sandcastle, directed by Marshall W. Mason, followed by Young Albert in Paul Foster's The Madonna In The Orchard with Harvey Keitel, and in 1966 as Tobias in Tom Eyen's Miss Nefertiti Regrets, playing drums and singing opposite nineteen year-old Bette Midler. Also in 1966 George Sr. and Ann acted in the 1966 premiere of Lanford Wilson's The Rimers of Eldritch at La MaMa, directed by the playwright. Later that year Stewart invited George III, then fourteen, to re-establish his El Dorado Players in residence at La MaMa ETC as her “Young Playwrights Series.” The reconstituted Players reprised their Florida successes, Bluebeard and The Sheep and the Cheapskate, followed by two new original musicals featuring songs by Ann. The first, MacBee, was adapted from Shakespeare's Macbeth. There Is Method In Their Madness followed, based on the Harris children's experiences with acting school. As in Florida, the press took notice. At year's end Walter Michael wrote and performed the music for Tom Eyen's Give My Regards to Off-Off-Broadway to celebrate La MaMa's re-opening following a period of closure by the city. In 1967 George III acted in Jeff Weiss’ play A Funny Walk Home at the Caffe Cino. When the Cino closed in 1968 following Joe Cino's suicide, playwright Robert Patrick took up residence at the Old Reliable Theater Tavern on East Fourth Street. He invited Walter Michael there to supervise the music for his Easter play, Joyce Dynel. == Professional success == By the mid 1960s family members were cast in Broadway and off- Broadway shows including The Porcelain Year (George III, 1965, with Barbara bel Geddes, Kim Darby and Martin Balsam), Gorilla Queen (Georges Sr. and III, 1966), Hair (Walter, 1968, with Diane Keaton and Melba Moore), The Great White Hope (George Sr., 1968, with James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander) and Invitation To A Beheading (Eloise, 1969, with John Heffernan). They signed with agents, joined the various unions for actors and entertainers, and by 1970 were full-fledged professionals. Movie roles include Ann as Doris Acker in The Honeymoon Killers (1970) and George, Sr. as Patrolman Mooney in Superman (1978). Mary Lou as \\"College Student\\" was chased by a Muppet named Animal in the 1984 Jim Henson film The Muppets Take Manhattan. Between professional acting and “day jobs,” family members remained active “downtown” with La MaMa ETC, Theater for the Lost Continent and Theater for the New City. == Hibiscus == In late 1967 George III followed the youth counterculture movement to San Francisco. On the way he joined the October 21, 1967 anti-war march on the Pentagon and became the subject of Flower Power, photojournalist Bernie Boston's historic photograph of that event. 'In San Francisco he moved into beat poet Irving Rosenthal's Kaliflower commune, changed his name to Hibiscus and founded The Cockettes and Angels of Light theater troupes. In 1972 he returned to New York City with his partner and collaborator Angel Jack Coe, reunited with his family and recruited them for a new Angels of Light company there. In the mid-70s the New York Angels of Light, under Hibiscus’ leadership, became artists-in-residence at Theater for the New City in downtown Manhattan. They toured Europe twice, sponsored by National Artist of the Netherlands Ritsaert ten Cate, founder of Amsterdam's Mickery Theater and DasArts. The Angels earned recognition at the international Festival Mondial du Théâtre in Nancy, France. Notices in the European press were generally positive and most ran with photos, including one with then-campaigning presidential candidate François Mitterrand. In the late 70s the Angels disbanded and the Harris family regrouped in New York City to present an off- Broadway revue called Sky High. In 1980 George III (Hibiscus) formed a musical art-rock club act with his sisters and his brother Fred called “Hibiscus and the Screaming Violets” while simultaneously writing, producing and starring in a new musical, Tinsel Town Tirade, featuring Andy Warhol star Holly Woodlawn. On May 6, 1982, Hibiscus died from complications of AIDS, early in the epidemic. His legacy and influence in theater and gay liberation are well documented. == The Harris Sisters == Following the Off-Off-Broadway years and performing with Hibiscus’ Angels of Light in New York City and Europe, the three Harris sisters formed a rock band, The Harris Sisters and Trouble in New York City. They played the downtown club scene including CBGB's, Great Gildersleeves and The Bitter End before teaming up with their brothers George (Hibiscus) and Fred to form the glitter-rock group \\"Hibiscus and the Screaming Violets.” Following Hibiscus’ unexpected death in 1982 the sisters rallied and formed The Harris Sisters harmony trio and became prolific cabaret performers in New York City. The Harris Sisters also performed on the talk show Geraldo, in service of the homeless through VETCO (Vietnam Veterans Ensemble Theater Company). In the 1980s the Harris sisters created a successful business, Coat Check Inc., to provide high-end event services (coat checking, waiter staff) to clients including The Metropolitan Costume Ball and Victoria's Secret. Their employees were actors and entertainers who needed flexible shifts to accommodate their unpredictable audition and performance schedules. In the late 1980s the sisters teamed up with Broadway composer Richard Adler (The Pajama Game, Damn Yankees) to record an album titled The Harris Sisters Sing Richard Adler. In 1992, the sisters performed in Hibiscus, a musical about their late brother George, presented by Ellen Stewart at La MaMa ETC. The following year the Harris sisters co-wrote, produced and performed in the “backstage” musical Cheek to Cheek which also premiered at La MaMa ETC. == Memoirs == The Harris family published two memoirs documenting their lives and careers: Caravan to Oz – a family reinvents itself off-off- Broadway (2014), is a memoir of the family's artistic and personal journey as a family; and Flower Power Man, a biography of the late George Harris III/ Hibiscus.

The Dunbar School is located on the south side of Vado in the Lower Rio Grande Valley between the river and Interstate 25, roughly fifteen miles south of Las Cruces. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. When the school formally opened on February 10, 1926, it taught elementary and high school students. Later, students travelled to Las Cruces for high school at the segregated Booker T. Washington School, which was built on Solano Street in 1934. When the Supreme Court handed down the Brown v. Board decision in 1954, it was with the proviso that states desegregate their schools “with all deliberate speed.” In the South, most schools were not desegregated until 1970. Compliance with the Brown ruling came much faster in New Mexico. The last class at Dunbar Elementary School graduated in 1957 before they integrated the Gadsden District. ==References== Category:Schools in Doña Ana County, New Mexico Category:Educational institutions established in 1926 Category:1926 establishments in New Mexico Category:Elementary schools in New Mexico ","title":"Paul Laurence Dunbar Elementary School"},{"id":"56873665","text":"Walter Benet was the Archdeacon of Wilts from his collation on 7 March 1610 until his death on 30 July 1614.Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1541–1857: Volume 6, Salisbury Diocese p18 From Somerset, he was educated at New College, Oxford.Alumni Oxonienses 1500–1714.

She represented province of West Java at the Miss Indonesia 2018 pageant, where she won the title and crowned by the Miss Indonesia 2017 titleholder, Achintya Holte Nilsen from West Nusa Tenggara, in the finale held on 22 February 2018. She earned the right to represent Indonesia at the Miss World 2018 pageant in China. Previously, Alya was a top 40 finalist of GADIS Sampul 2012 and The Face of Femina 2014. == Early life and education == Alya was born in Jakarta on January 21, 1996, daughter of Ina Nuraini and Rudyandi Praditya, and is currently domiciled in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. She is of Javanese and Sundanese descent. Alya went to SD Islam Dwi Matra (Islamic private elementary school), SMP Bakti Mulya 400 (private middle school) and SMA Negeri 55 Jakarta (public high school). Alya have said many times that her passion is art. Although she often participated in various academic competitions with her schoolmates, English is the subject she mostly received awards for. In middle school, she began to learn and love fashion as well as performance arts, typically dancing and singing. Due to the nature of Alya, who likes to stay busy, eventually she entered the world of modeling. To pursue a higher education, Alya moved from Jakarta to Bandung. Alya has a bachelor degree from Parahyangan Catholic University (UNPAR) Bandung, majoring in International Relations, Faculty of Social and Political Sciences with summa cum laude. During her time in college, Alya was active in the major's student body/organization and was chosen as a lecturing assistant. She assisted Prof. V.

In that competition, her team won the Social Venture Challenge. It was then that Alya and her teammates were rewarded with Resolution Fellowship by the Resolution Project. Since 2011, Alya has been a coach or motivator at Adam Khoo Learning Technologies Group (AKLTG), an institution from Singapore that provides learning skills and life motivation for teenagers and children. Her job, being a coach at I'm Gifted Camp hosted by the Adam Khoo Organization, acknowledged to provide plenty of space for her to learn many new things about teaching as well as public speaking.

Beyond undergoing activities as a coach/motivator at Adam Khoo and as a freelance fashion model, Alya also likes to fill her spare time with painting, a hobby that she has possessed since her childhood. Alya has even produced a lot of works, which she began to participate in the exhibitions during her time when she lived in Bandung. == Social activities == Outside her academic and modeling activities, Alya is also active in various social activities and charities. Below are small examples of her participation. In 2016, she was acting as a volunteer of Chay Ya Nepal with other independent volunteers from Indonesia, where she participated in a school building program in Yamunadanda Village, Sindhupalchok District, Nepal that collapsed after the earthquake that strikes the area in 2015.

The next day, around 300 rebel fighters and their family members were evacuated from al-Qadam to rebel territory in Idlib province. After the evacuation, government troops took control of 70 percent of the neighborhood, while the remaining 30 was under IS control. During the fighting, government air-strikes were conducted against ISIL in Al-Hajar al-Aswad and al-Qadam. While the clashes were taking place in Qadam, rebel groups attempted to break through ISIL lines in Yarmouk but were repelled. On 14 March, ISIL launched an assault against Syrian Army positions in al-Qadam, managing to advance slightly. The attack was renewed the following day but without any advances and by 16 March, the ISIL offensive had stalled. During the fighting in al- Qadam, government forces suffered heavy losses with 40 soldiers being killed and at least one tank knocked out. Overnight on 19 March, ISIL forces launched a surprise attack on government positions in al-Qadam and by the following day ISIL gained ground, pushing back the military. According to the pro-opposition activist group the SOHR, ISIL took full control of al-Qadam, with 36 soldiers being killed and dozens of others wounded, captured or missing. In contrast, military sources initially reported control of al-Qadam was divided and that ISIL failed to capture the central and western neighborhoods of the district. However, later they confirmed ISIL had taken control of 90 percent of the district following a chaotic Army withdrawal due to poor coordination between different military branches and that the Army was in control of one western neighborhood. Five of the missing soldiers were eventually rescued after becoming trapped behind ISIL lines, while others were reported to be isolated in ISIL territory. Still, later, it was stated no more living soldiers remained behind ISIL lines. At this time, veteran units of the 4th Armoured Division were sent as reinforcements to al-Qadam to try and retake the lost areas. Later that day, following heavy artillery strikes against ISIL positions, a two-day ceasefire was announced. On 21 March, it was reported that the military's death toll from ISIL's attack had rose to 62, after 26 bodies of the previously missing were retrieved. On the same day, ISIL executed a captured commander from the Palestinian People’s Party, Nidal Darwish, in the al-Qadam neighborhood. ==Aftermath== On 19 April, the SAA and allied Palestinian militias launched an offensive to dislodge ISIL from the pocket. During the night of 19 May, an agreement was put in place in southern Damascus between the Syrian Army and ISIL after the militants agreed to surrender their last positions in the Yarmouk Camp and Hajar Al-Aswad. The next day, buses started entering the ISIL pocket to transport their fighters to the desert region in eastern Syria. Later on 21 May, the military officially announced that they had completely regained control of the area, ending the existence of anti-government forces around the capital Damascus. ==See also== *Battle of Yarmouk Camp (2015) *Eastern Qalamoun offensive (September–October 2016) *List of wars and battles involving ISIL ==References== Category:Conflicts in 2018 Category:Battles of the Syrian Civil War Category:Damascus in the Syrian Civil War Category:Damascus Governorate in the Syrian Civil War Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving Tahrir al-Sham Category:January 2018 events in Syria Category:February 2018 events in Syria ","title":"Southern Damascus offensive (March 2018)"},{"id":"56873796","text":"The 1999–2000 Arizona Wildcats men's basketball team represented the University of Arizona in the 1999–2000 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

As such, CBS is a performance accounting system that interprets performance through a sustainability lens, according to which impacts are sustainable if and only if, when generalized to a broader population, they have the effect of contributing to the maintenance of vital capital resources in the world at levels required to ensure human well-being. Impacts that have the opposite effect are unsustainable, as are the activities that produce them. The reference to context in CBS pertains to social, economic and environmental circumstances that give rise to organization-specific standards of performance – sustainability standards of performance. Such circumstances most importantly include: (1) the actual social, economic and environmental circumstances organizations find themselves in, (2) the kinds of impacts organizations may, in turn, be having on social, economic or environmental resources (capitals) people rely on for their well- being, (3) the demand for, supply and sufficiency of such resources by/for organizations themselves and others, (4) the identity of other parties to whom related duties or obligations of performance are owed for moral, legal or regulatory reasons (i.e., stakeholders and the duties owed to them), and (5) the identity of yet additional parties, if any, with whom such duties or obligations may be shared. Out of this comes the specification of organization-specific standards of performance. Because CBS involves the measurement, management and reporting of performance in context-based ways, references to its workings are sometimes made using derivative terms, like Context-Based Measurement, Context-Based Management, Context-Based Reporting, Context-Based Targets, Context-Based Metrics (or Measurement Models), Context- Based Carbon Metrics, Context-Based Water Metrics, etc. All of that falls within the scope of CBS. ==Thresholds and allocations== Organization-specific standards of performance can also be thought of as fair, just and proportionate shares of burdens organizations have to help maintain vital resources in the world at levels required to ensure human well-being. In the vocabulary of CBS, this is very often explained in terms of a distinction between thresholds and allocations. A threshold is a measure of the magnitude or size of a resource (e.g., the volume of available renewable water in a watershed, or a livable wage level for employee compensation). An allocation, in turn, is a fair, just and proportionate share of the effort it may take to maintain a threshold and which is assignable to an individual organization. Such assignments will either be shared or exclusive. An organization's obligation to not exceed its fair share of available renewable water in a watershed, for example, would be a shared obligation; its obligation to pay its employees a livable wage and nothing less would be an exclusive one, borne only by itself. In some cases, organization-specific standards of performance may also be science-based; in other cases, they may be purely moral or ethics- based. A science-based standard, for example, might consist of targets for the rate at which greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced over time in order to reverse climate change; an ethics-based standard, by contrast, might call for gender equality in organizations, or that the use of child labor be prohibited. In other cases, standards of performance might be purely legal or regulatory. In all cases, standards are expressed in terms of organization- specific shares (allocations) of shared or exclusive duties to maintain vital resources at levels (thresholds) required to ensure human and/or non-human well-being. Allocations thereby define organization-specific standards of performance. Importantly, all of this stands in stark contrast to most of what passes for mainstream practice in accounting today, which tends to be expressed in more incrementalist terms. Performance according to such incrementalism is all about how performance in one period might compare to another, but only in terms of more of this or less of that. If profits go up, performance is positive. If energy efficiency goes down, performance is negative. At no time, however, do such measures express the sustainability of impacts - only their incremental or relative movements from one period of time to another. ==Multicapitalism== CBS is also capital-based in the sense that it is an accounting implementation or consequence of what many are now referring to as multicapitalism. Multicapitalism is a relatively new economic doctrine according to which the performance of an organization, economy or any other type of human social system, can be seen as a function of what its impacts are on the sufficiency of multiple vital capitals, and not just in terms of economic outcomes. From this perspective, modern-day capitalism can be seen as the practice of monocapitalism: the pursuit of development or growth in only one type of capital (economic), very often at the expense of all others (e.g., natural, human, social, constructed and intellectual). Under the multicapitalistic view of things, an organization's performance is entirely positive if and only if its impacts on all vital capitals (i.e., ones that have been determined to be material to itself, its operations and its stakeholders) are sustainable. And once again, to be sustainable an organization's impacts on vital capitals must be in full compliance with whatever organization-specific standards of performance have been defined for itself. Anything less than sustainable performance in any material area of impact should, in principle, cause overall performance to worsen under the doctrine of multicapitalism and CBS, or what can also be referred to as multiple capital, multicapital, or multi-capital accounting. Making materiality determinations is therefore key in CBS, although not only for the sake of shareholders, but for other stakeholders as well. Multicapitalism has its roots in economic theory going back to at least the early twentieth century. In 1906, for example, the economist Irving Fisher wrote: \\"A stock of wealth existing at an instant of time is called capital. A flow of services through a period of time is called income.\\" By the middle of the same century, another prominent economist, Kenneth Boulding, had taken Fisher's definitions to the next level by applying the concept not only to economic capital per se, but to other capitals as well. In one of his publications, Boulding identified several other non-economic capitals that must be maintained in order to ensure human well-being, including human capital, cultural capital, intellectual capital, and geological capital, the last of which arguably corresponds to what today is referred to as natural capital. By the end of the century, a growing chorus of scholars and practitioners in the field of sustainability were actively advocating for adoption of the capital-based interpretation of the subject, including Donella (Dana) Meadows, who in 1998 wrote: \\"The Balaton working group agreed unanimously that the idea of capital - all forms of capital - is central to information systems for sustainable development … They allow the stock-flow analysis that can make indicators dynamic. And they begin to suggest a conceptual framework to keep track of the linkages among many forms of capital and to derive indicators that could help people and nations build up the several kinds of wealth that are necessary for a people- enriching, nature-preserving system.\\" In the sustainability/capital literature todayhttp://www.sustainableorganizations.org/Capital-Theory-References.pdf \\\\- still heavily influenced by not only historical, but modern-day economists as well - capital is now commonly defined as a stock of anything that yields a flow of valuable goods or services important for human well-being. The consensus on multiple capitals, too, has largely settled on a framework of six primary types (i.e., natural, human, social, constructed, economic and intellectual), including several permutations or derivatives thereof. The idea behind every one of them, though, is the same: that human well-being is utterly dependent upon the continued existence of vital capitals. To diminish the sufficiency of any one of them is, in a word, unsustainable. Central to the importance and application of multicapitalism to organizations and human social systems writ large is the further idea that capitals have carrying capacities that can be measured and quantified, and for which the responsibilities to maintain them can be apportioned to individual actors (e.g., to organizations) in fair, just and proportionate ways. The carrying capacity of a stock of capital is the level of demand for its goods or services it can support. Indeed, as resources that humans and other species rely on for their well-being, capitals do have their limits. In some cases, the limits are beyond our control (e.g., most natural or ecological capitals). In other cases, the limits are within our control because the capitals involved are human-made. These are the anthropogenic capitals, or what some refer to as the anthro capitals (i.e., human, social, constructed, economic and intellectual capitals). When taken together, the combination of multicapitalism, multiple capital accounting and the concept of the carrying capacities of capitals results in a newly informed approach to management that interprets performance in terms of impacts on all capitals. Management, that is, is capital impact management; and performance accounting is all about measuring and reporting the effects of organizations' activities on the sufficiency of such capitals relative to standards for what they (the impacts) would have to be in order to be sustainable. CBS, in turn, provides the underlying measurement and reporting system that managers in twenty-first- century enterprises can use to successfully navigate these new waters. ==Context-Based Metrics== One of the hallmarks of Context-Based Sustainability is its use of Context-Based Metrics (CBMs). Unlike other metrics used to measure, manage and report the sustainability performance of organizations (e.g., absolute and relative/intensity metrics), some CBMs, but not all, take the form of quotients that have two parts to them: 1) denominators that express organization-specific norms for what their impacts on vital capitals must be in order to be sustainable (i.e., equivalent to \\"allocations\\" as explained above), and 2) numerators that express their actual impacts on the same capitals. Thus, the sustainability performance (S) of an organization is equal to its actual impacts (A) on capitals divided by its normative impacts (N) on the same capitals: S=A/N. When the numeric values expressed in such quotient-based CBMs are computed, the resulting scores will either be less than 1.0, greater than 1.0, or equal to 1.0. Such scores are then interpreted as follows: 1) for impacts on natural capitals, any score of less than or equal to 1.0 signifies sustainable performance; scores of greater than 1.0 signify the opposite; 2) for impacts on all other types of capital, the logic reverses: scores of greater than or equal to 1.0 signify sustainable performance; scores of less than 1.0 signify the opposite. These scoring conventions reflect the difference between capitals that are anthropogenic or human made (human, social, constructed, economic and intellectual) and those that are not (natural). In order to be sustainable, impacts on anthropogenic capitals must be regenerative, so that nothing less than minimum levels of sufficiency (i.e., in the carrying capacities of the capitals) are maintained. Impacts on natural capitals, by contrast, must be constrained, so as not to exceed the limits of what nature can renewably provide. For impacts on natural capital, then, humans must live within their means; for impacts on all other capitals, they must continually recreate the means to live. Such is the thinking behind Context-Based Metrics and CBS. ==Evolution of CBS== The development of CBS was preceded by the Sustainability Context principle, a sustainability accounting concept first put forward in 2002 by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in its Guidance for corporate sustainability reporting. And whereas the Sustainability Context principle is just that, a principle, CBS is a methodology that makes it possible to put the principle into practice. The CBS methodology was originally developed by Mark W. McElroy of the Center for Sustainable Organizations, a non-profit public charity in the U.S., as part of his doctoral dissertation at the University of Groningen in 2008. He and Jo van Engelen then more broadly promoted the concept in their 2012 book, Corporate Sustainability Management. Also part of McElroy's doctoral dissertation in 2008 was a narrow application of CBS known as the Social Footprint Method (SFM). Like the Ecological Footprint Method (EFM), the SFM was intended to make it possible to assess the sustainability performance of a human social system. But unlike the EFM, the SFM focused on social, not ecological, sustainability performance. McElroy would later go on to develop an environmental application of CBS as well. While initially confined to social and environmental performance, CBS was subsequently extended in 2013 by McElroy and a colleague of his, Martin P. Thomas, formerly of Unilever, to include treatment of financial performance as well. This resulted in the world's first fully operationalized (and context-based) Triple Bottom Line performance accounting method: The MultiCapital Scorecard (i.e., an integrated measurement and reporting system). A book by the same title was then published by Thomas and McElroy in 2016. Both CBS and the MultiCapital Scorecard are open-source methods that any organization can use for end-user applications on a royalty- or license-free basis. ==Uptake== Notwithstanding the fact that the leading international standard for corporate sustainability reporting, the Global Reporting Initiative, has since 2002 been calling for the practice of what is referred to here as Context-Based Sustainability, the uptake and adoption of CBS is only now reaching an inflection point. This can be seen on at least three fronts: (1) Third-Party, Independent and Peer-Reviewed Assessments and Adoptions, (2) B Corporation Community Endorsements, and (3) Organizational Adoptions. ===Third-party, independent and peer-reviewed assessments and adoptions=== * In late 2015, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) published a report entitled, Raising the Bar - Advancing Environmental Disclosure in Sustainability Reporting, in which the authors wrote: \\"The context principle was introduced as early as 2002 when it was embedded in the second generation of the GRI reporting framework. However, partially due to lack of available guidance on how to apply context to the reporting, it has largely been absent in corporate reporting. In an effort to fill this context gap, several organizations have taken important steps to put scientific context back into sustainability reporting. At the core of the context-based reporting movement is the Center for Sustainable Organizations (CSO). CSO developed Context-Based Sustainability (CBS), a framework for implementing Sustainability Context through the use of thresholds and allocations.\\" And in the same report, UNEP added \\"All companies should apply a context-based approach to sustainability reporting, allocating their fair share impacts on common capital resources within the thresholds of their carrying capacities.\\" * Also in late 2015, the Harvard Business Review published an article entitled, \\"A Better Scorecard for Your Company's Sustainability Efforts,\\" in which the authors wrote: \\"The terms 'context- based' and 'Sustainability Context' are accepted terminology for measurement and reporting that compare corporate impacts to social, economic, and environmental thresholds.\\" * In 2012, an international association of academics, corporate managers, consultants, analysts and standards-makers conceptually committed to CBS and interested in tracking its continued evolution was formed: the Sustainability Context Group (SCG). SCG now has over 150 members. * In 2017, Former Director of the Centre for Social and Environmental Accounting Research (CSEAR) at the University of St. Andrews, Professor Rob Gray, published a book review of The MultiCapital Scorecard book in the Social and Environmental Accountability Journal, in which he wrote: \\"Mark McElroy and Martin Thomas have been working away at trying to develop an applicable and coherent approach to accounting for sustainability for at least 10 years. Mark's approach to a 'social footprint' (McElroy and van Engelen, 2012) was a genuinely innovative approach to a largely intractable problem, and from there, their 'Sustainability in Context' work has kept on growing: especially through the sharing of ideas and experiences in a wide-ranging Yahoo! Group - the 'SustyContextGroup' which many of you might know. This is no flash in the pan, therefore, and for the consistent effort, boyish enthusiasm and sheer determination alone, it commends itself to our attention.\\" * Another formal adoption of CBS takes the form of a project launched in 2010 by Dr. Stephanie Bertels, known as the Embedding Project, hosted at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada. Working with twenty corporate and non-profit partners, Bertels and her colleagues at the Embedding Project have been applying CBS principles for several years now on an international basis. Of particular additional interest is a publication put out by the Embedding Project in 2017 entitled, The Road to Context - Contextualising Your Strategy and Goals. * Of additional interest to practitioners of CBS is a program being led by Ralph Thurm and Bill Baue of the Netherlands and U.S., respectively, known as Reporting 3.0. Reporting 3.0 is a project originally launched by BSD Consulting in Europe, and which is now taking place under the auspices of a German non-profit known as OnCommons. Its purpose, among others, is to more fully standardize the practice of CBS in business by publishing related guidance in the form of what it refers to as \\"Blueprints\\" for Data, Reporting, Accounting and New Business Models in commerce. * In late-2019, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Center for Sustainable Organizations, SustainAccounting and Social Accountability International (SAI), according to which SAI agreed to create and administer the world’s first Triple Bottom Line (TBL) accounting certification (Certified TBL) credential for organizations. SAI is otherwise known for its SA8000 certification program, which has been addressing workers’ rights in organizations for more than twenty years. The Certified TBL program is expected to launch in 2021. ===B Corporation community endorsements=== * In 2017, the CBS-based MultiCapital Scorecard was formally endorsed by B Lab, creators of Certified B Corporations and the Benefit Corporation form of incorporation, as an approved Third-Party Standard for measuring and reporting the performance of Benefit Corporations. * In September, 2015, California attorney John Montgomery, President-Elect of the Benefit Company Bar Association in the U.S. published an online book review of The MultiCapital Scorecard, in which he wrote: \\"The MultiCapital Scorecard has particular relevance to benefit corporations, which are required by law to create public benefit by providing a material positive impact on society and the environment, or in Delaware's case, by operating in a responsible and sustainable manner. Social and environmental impact assessment tools, such as B Lab's Certified B Corporation assessment, provide a measure of social and environmental impact but are not context-based and leave businesses accounting for their performance with traditional fiscal accounting and nothing more.\\" * In early 2018, Frederick (Rick) Alexander, head of Legal Policy at B Lab, published a book entitled, Benefit Corporation Law and Governance - Pursuing Profit with Purpose, in which he acknowledged the important distinction between monocapitalism and multicapitalism, while also citing the MultiCapital Scorecard as a notable implementation of the latter. ===Organizational adoptions=== Many organizations have embraced and implemented CBS and its context-based metrics to one degree or another, including the following: * Ben & Jerry's Homemade, Inc. was an early adopter of CBS and the Social Footprint Method and was also the first company to pilot the MultiCapital Scorecard. * Biogen, Inc. was an early adopter of CBS and continues to use it as indicated in its annual Global Impact Report (2016, p. 46): \\"Our practice of setting science-based targets, when possible, is part of our broader commitment to Context-Based Sustainability, a rapidly evolving, cutting-edge approach to managing sustainability performance that takes resource needs and limits in the world explicitly into account.\\" * Cabot Creamery Cooperative (Agri-Mark, Inc.) was also an early adopter of CBS and has been its most aggressive and pioneering user. It has also embraced the MultiCapital Scorecard, which it has arguably taken further than any other company, particularly by the extent to which it has developed and applied context-based financial metrics, not just social and environmental ones. * Lockheed Martin has long been using a Context-Based Carbon Metric, including in its annual Science of Citizenship report (2016, p. 41): \\"Our latest 2015 results outperform a science-based threshold to stabilize atmospheric carbon emissions. Using the Center for Sustainable Organizations' Context-Based Carbon Metric methodology, we produce less than our calculated threshold of emissions based on our contribution to gross domestic product (GDP).\\" * Other users of CBS include Griffith Foods and Ernst & Young, both of whom have used a Triple Bottom Line implementation of CBS known as the MultiCapital Scorecard (MCS). Whereas Griffith Foods has used the MCS to assess its own operations, Ernst & Young has used it to assess the sustainability performance of whole countries (i.e., as an index of national well-being and as an alternative to GDP). ==References * Cabot Creamery Cooperative * Center for Sustainable Organizations * MultiCapital Scorecard * Reporting 3.0 * Sustainability Context Group Category:Sustainability metrics and indices ","title":"Context-Based Sustainability"},{"id":"56873972","text":"Black Lightning is an American superhero television series developed by Salim Akil, airing on The CW. It is based on the DC Comics character of the same name, created by Tony Isabella. It stars Cress Williams as the titular character alongside China Anne McClain, Nafessa Williams, Christine Adams, Marvin Jones III, Damon Gupton, James Remar, and Jordan Calloway. Initially set in an unnamed alternative Earth separate from the other Arrowverse media, the show was later merged with Earth-1 (the setting of Arrow, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, and Batwoman) and Earth-38 (the setting of Supergirl) into Earth-Prime during Crisis on Infinite Earths. The series sees the retired Black Lightning (Cress Williams), who as Jefferson Pierce is a high school principal and loving father, return to the hero life after his daughters are kidnapped by the 100 Gang, which is later revealed to be led by Tobias Whale (Marvin Jones III), who apparently killed Jefferson's father years before the onset. Jefferson's elder daughter Anissa (who is an avid social activist for African-American human rights) later discovers she has inherited her father's metahuman genes, although she is initially unaware that he is Black Lightning and begins investigating her grandfather's articles concerning a group of young metahumans who disappeared years ago. She later discovers her father is Black Lightning and joins him using her powers as a vigilante. Jefferson's ex- wife Lynn Stewart (Christine Adams), is the main inspiration of Jefferson's initial retirement as she feared him dying on the streets, but she begrudgingly realizes she cannot stop him after discovering Anissa's abilities. ==Main charactersJefferson Pierce / Black Lightning=== Cress Williams Jefferson \\"Jeff\\" Pierce (portrayed by Cress Williams as an adult, Kaden Washington Smith as a child) is the main protagonist of the series. At the beginning of season one, Jefferson has retired crime-fighting as Black Lightning due to the urges of his ex-wife Lynn and the safety of his two daughters and is the benevolent school principal of Garfield High who is loved by his students and his daughters. His foster father, Peter Gambi, urges him to return to the streets and use his metahuman abilities to give hope to the inhabitants of Freeland, their city, which is under duress by the 100 Street Gang. Jefferson adamantly refuses to return and resists using his powers even against a group of racists police officers who pull him and his daughters over unjustified suspicions, but after his daughter Jennifer is captured by the 100 (and later his other daughter Anissa), he uses his metahuman abilities (which allow him to generate and control electricity offensively) to fight off the gangsters holding them captive as Black Lightning, adorning a new suit built for him by Gambi (although, he initially only does this as a once-off for his daughters). Initially, Jefferson only returns to being Black Lightning to save his daughters and promises his ex-wife Lynn that it was a never to be repeated occasion and Black Lightning is gone and the two begin to explore reuniting, with Jefferson believing he can do more as Jefferson than Black Lightning could ever do as the community believes in his ability to get things done as a school principal and elder. As the series progresses, it revealed that Jefferson's ability to stand up for the community is so effective that he has come to be affectionately known as \\"Black Jesus\\" as revealed by his former student LaWanda White.Black Lightning Episode 2 Members of Freeland's community complain to Jefferson about the looming threat of the 100 taking young girls, including LaWanda's own daughter and having them forcibly work for them, but Jefferson continues to resist Black Lightning and promises to help find another way. He speaks to Latavius (who insists to be called \\"Lala\\"), one of Jeff's former students and a high-ranking member of the 100 gang, and asks him to back off to no avail, forcing LaWanda to confront Lala only for him to shoot and instantly kill her. Unbeknown to Latavius, she has recorded the event and it is found by the police, who use this as evidence to imprison Latavius. LaWanda's death forms the catalyst to convince Jeff that he is not doing better as Jefferson Pierce but must fully return and act as Black Lightning, much to Lynn's chagrin. As Black Lightning once more, Jeff attacks and hands Lala over to the police, who apprehend him, although is soon murdered by Tobias Whale, the secret true leader of the 100 gang. Jeff continues to act as Black Lightning during the night and principal and parent during the day, dealing with the stress of Jennifer's adolescence and Anissa's incessant cry for action against the 100. Gambi helps him by watching through a camera in his glasses and a com and has surveillance watching most parts of the city. It is later revealed that Jefferson's father was a journalist who was killed by Tobias after he wrote an article about him. Jefferson retired shortly after a confrontation with Tobias that left the gangster believing he'd killed Black Lightning, making a name for himself on the streets for the past decade. Upon discovering he is alive, Tobias attempts to have Black Lightning killed while citizens of Freeland pay tribute to his return, but the bullet instead hits Jennifer's boyfriend Khalil, severing his spinal cord and crippling the track star. After discovering Tobias's resurgence, Jefferson attempts to kill him to avenge his father, but is convinced he's better by Lynn, who reminds him he is a hero and not a murderer shortly before she is attacked by some 100 gangsters for biological research into the drug Greenlight (a high addictive drug which the 100 had begun selling to the youth that seems to temporarily give them enhanced strength while under its frenzy). The gangsters are chased off by Anissa, who is revealed to have inherited her father's metahuman genes, has powers and has started to act as a vigilante as well. Upon arrival, Black Lightning fights a masked Anissa, believing her to be the one attacking a gagged and tied-up Lynn. After a heated confrontation, Jefferson knocks Anissa out only to realize who she is. Lynn laments that she is also a metahuman and that she has followed in Jeff's footsteps but the two are forced to accept her need to fight for good just like Black Lightning and Lynn has Gambi make her suit. Jefferson though is displeased with Lynn's apparent hypocrisy and briefly voices his outrage on the matter.Black Lightning Episode 7 In Season 3, Agent Odell gives Jefferson a special watch. When this watch is charged to a specific point, Jefferson gains a new costume through nano-technology. This enabled Odell to win Black Lightning into assisting against the Markovian invaders. After returning to Garfield High, he learns from Principal Mike Lowry that the A.S.A. had him reassign Jefferson to the occupation of guidance counselor. Due to the A.S.A.'s oppression, Black Lightning starts to work alongside the rebels. In part three of Crisis on Infinite Earths, he is recruited by the Flash and his team in an effort to stop an anti-matter wave from annihilating the entire multiverse after he was teleported away while his world was erased. In the final part, Jefferson is restored when his Earth is merged with Earth-1 and Earth-38 to form Earth- Prime. He later become the founding members of a \\"league of heroes\\" alongside Barry and several other heroes. Black Lightning returns to Freeland and continues assisting the resistance. When Lynn is taken to Markovia, Jefferson has a parley with Major Sara Grey when it comes to a plan for a rescue mission. Jefferson agrees to help the A.S.A. rescue Lynn under the condition that the metahumans that assist them are off limits afterwards. When it came to the raid on a Markovian facility, Jefferson came up with an idea to have Thunder strike Erica Moran until she has absorbed enough kinetic energy to break down the strong door. Despite being hit by a laser gun wielded by Gravedigger, Black Lightning catches up to the group and shocks Gravedigger into submission. Then he and Lynn retreat to Freeland. When the Markovians attack Freeland, Black Lightning assists in defeating the ones that were attacking the Perdi. Lynn later informs Jefferson that his DNA and Gravedigger's DNA are a match meaning that they are both related. When Gravedigger defeats Lightning, Black Lightning begins to fight him. After Black Lightning tries to reason with him while mentioning that they are related, Gravedigger uses a microwave move to cause some burns to Black Lightning. When some Markovian soldiers make off with Lightning, Black Lightning makes a tactical retreat. He receives help from Brandon to rescue Lightning. After Henderson dies in his arms after shooting the soldiers that were planning to attack him, Black Lightning fights Gravedigger in the Pit. With help from Lynn using an anti-boost serum on Gravedigger, Black Lightning defeats him and gets everybody out of the Pit before it self-destructs. Following Odell being wounded by Khalil, Black Lightning is accompanied by Lynn, Thunder, and Lightning where they present the briefcase to a congressional committee that exposes the A.S.A.'s experiments as well as Markovia's own experiments. * Williams also portrays Jefferson of Earth-1, who became the Secretary of Education. He secretly helped Reverend Holt with the metahuman underground railroad before he was killed by the A.S.A. This version ceased to exist when Earth-Prime was formed. * Williams also portrays Jefferson of Earth-2, who was killed by Jinn alongside the rest of his family when they tried to intervene after she ended the Markovian threat. This version ceased to exist when a new Earth-2 was formed. ===Jennifer Pierce / Lightning=== China Anne McClain Jennifer \\"Jen\\" Pierce (portrayed by China Anne McClain as an teenager, Fallyn Brown as a child) is Jefferson Pierce's younger daughter and a metahuman, like her father and sister. She is based on the DC Comics character of the same name. Jennifer is portrayed a carefree, rebellious teenager who is prone to challenging the \\"good girl\\" appearance imposed on her by her respected father, who is the principal of her high school Garfield High, as well her sister Anissa, who is teacher at the same school. Initially, Jennifer is very careless and even at times reckless with her own life such in the series premiere when getting drunk in a well-known 100 club and almost being forced to work for them. Jennifer is subsequently rescued by her father, who is unbeknownst to her, the crime-fighting vigilante known as Black Lightning. After being kidnapped by the 100 with her sister Anissa, she is rescued by Black Lightning and begins drinking and smoking to mask her fear. Jefferson has extensively taught Jennifer and Anissa martial arts and she is a very skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having once even efficiently severed a girl's wrist. She and her sister Anissa share a very close relationship, although Jennifer often does not support Anissa's more confrontational approach to doing the right thing, though. Jennifer begins to show maturity after her long-time friend Khalil (who is Garfield High's track star) asks her to be his girlfriend and becomes a stable influence on her life. Jennifer deeply cares for Khalil and after they agree to lose their virginity together, she is responsible enough to inform her parents she will be having sex, although Khalil is shot and crippled before this can happen while marching against the 100's gang violence with Jennifer, ending his ambitions of becoming an Olympic star and transcending the limitations usually imposed on teenagers of color (an example he makes is getting a girl pregnant, getting in jail or becoming a junkie). This puts a strain on their relationship and Khalil lashes out at Jennifer, on an occasion even supporting a girl cyberbullying her. After confronting him on the matter, Khalil reveals he blames her for his new status due to her encouraging him to join him on the march that got him shot, seemingly ending their relationship. Jennifer is currently unaware that she has also inherited her father's metahuman genes and that, like her sister, may one day gain her own abilities, a fact that is presently being kept from her by her sister, mother and father. After she quits running track, Jennifer becomes an unpaid intern for her mother. Later, an encounter with her friend Kiesha startles Jennifer into awakening her own latent metahuman abilities, which become known to her after Kiesha almost falls off a ladder. Her abilities manifest as a very hot red lightning that comes from her hands and burns her smartphone. She keeps this a secret from Kiesha and later consciously attempts to recreate the earlier conditions and confirms she has abilities, further destroying her phone. Terrified, Jennifer immediately tells her sister and shows her the deconstructed smartphone. The next morning, Anissa confesses the truth about her and their father being metahumans and that she is the crime fighting Thunder. As Jennifer initially does not believe her, Anissa uses her super strength to lift Jennifer's bed in a demonstration. Terrified, Jennifer flies and confronts their father, who begrudgingly admits Anissa is telling the truth. This makes Jennifer react angrily as she thinks they have all betrayed her trust as they have lied to her whole life. Later she laments to her mother that she will no longer have a happy and normal life and get to experience such things as prom, marriage and having children due to her new state as a \\"freak\\". She also confronts the fact that Lynn herself (who admits she is human and not Vixen or Supergirl as Jennifer suggested) ended her marriage to Jefferson because he was the metahuman Black Lightning. Jennifer and Anissa later reconcile and she shows her older sister her online presence and following far exceeds even Black Lightning's. Jefferson later talks to Jennifer and the two watch a movie together after Jennifer reveals they have not done so in some time. Jefferson also later assures her that the only life she will live is the one she wishes to live and does not have to become a superheroine like her sister or himself. This helps Jennifer although she still admits difficulty to accepting or even exploring her new abilities. When Anissa tries to push her to find out what her ability is and take up the mantle of becoming a hero, Jennifer's abilities manifest again and react violently due to the hurtful things Anissa said, having denounced Jennifer as a \\"disappointment\\". Her powers char a nearby couch and Anissa theorizes that her seemingly electric powers resemble their father's. Anissa has her sent to their mother's lab to take an MRI scan to insure Jennifer is okay. This leads to the discovery that Jennifer's cells are constantly producing \\"pure energy\\" in contrast to Jefferson's, whose electric powers are absorbed and conducted from an exterior source like a battery's while Jennifer's body acts as a powerful interior generator for a stronger kind of \\"lightning\\". After the A.S.A. discovers Black Lightning's secret identity, Jennifer and her family are forced to go into hiding. In Season 2, Jennifer starts to get control of her abilities. She manages to perfect them when she finally confronts Tobias Whale for what he did to Khalil and takes up the name of Lightning. Though Lightning chooses not to kill Tobias, she helps her father defeat him. In Season 3, Jennifer works to gain control of her powers at the time when her parents are in A.S.A. custody. Odell used her to destroy a Markovian facility that was cleared out by Black Lightning and the A.S.A. commandos that he rescued after Odell claimed to her that the Markovians killed Nichelle. She soon starts to do secret missions for Odell as she is also advised to pick a side when it becomes a three-way struggle between Freeland, the A.S.A., and the Markovians. After being exposed to the anti-matter in the sky in a lead-up to Crisis on Infinite Earths, Jennifer met her two counterparts in a void and learned the flaws of having too little power and too much power. As Gambi worked to stabilize Jennifer, her body turned into a light as the anti-matter wave erases her Earth. Following the Crisis, Jennifer pulls herself together and declares that she is done with Odell. When the A.S.A. arrive to rescue Odell, Jennifer is shocked to see Painkiller alive and knocks him out. Jennifer helps to form a firewall to trap the Painkiller program. When Khalil regains control of his body and learns what the A.S.A. did to it, Jennifer is told that they can't be together. Jennifer later assists in the plans to rescue her mother from the Markovians. She found her mother who had turned the tide on Yuri Mosin and helped to evacuate her. Jennifer later helped Brandon get the information about Brandon's mother from Dr. Jace. When Gravedigger arrives in Freeland, Lightning takes out the Markovian soldiers with him before Gravedigger throws her into the perimeter enough for it to come down. Black Lightning rescues Lightning and resuscitates her as Gravedigger catches up to them. After being dragged off by Markovian soldiers, Lightning is kept their prisoner as she tries to reason with Gravedigger. She is rescued by Black Lightning and Brandon. When in the Pit, Lightning and Brandon do a combo attack on Gravedigger who knocks them down. Following the conflict in Freeland, Lightning accompanied Black Lightning, Lynn, and Thunder to a congressional committee where they present the briefcase that exposes the A.S.A.'s experiments as well as Markovia's own experiments. * McClain also portrays Gen of Earth-1, who sided against the A.S.A. and became their prisoner after removing all metahuman abilities in Freeland via the water supply. This version ceased to exist when Earth-Prime was formed. * McClain also portrays Jinn of Earth-2, who sided with the A.S.A. and ended the Markovian threat before becoming a power-obsessed killer willing to kill her own family. This version ceased to exist when a new Earth-2 was formed. ===Anissa Pierce / Thunder=== Nafessa Williams Anissa Pierce (portrayed by Nafessa Williams) is the older daughter of Jefferson Pierce and Lynn Stewart and a metahuman like her father and younger sister Jennifer. She is a medical student who works as a part-time teacher at Garfield High. Anissa is an outspoken young woman who is described as \\"Harriet Tubman\\" by her sister Jennifer due to her avid support of the Black Lives Matter movement and Black Rights in general. At the start of the series, she is bailed out of jail by her sister and father due to her joining a protest against the 100 that turns violent. After provoking and publicly attacking Will (a member of the 100 and Lala's nephew) in defense of Jennifer after he got Jennifer into trouble with the gang, Anissa and her sister are kidnapped by Will and small group of gangsters during the class she was teaching. Fortunately, Black Lightning resurfaces and rescues them. Later that night, Anissa begins to undergo a panic attack that awakens her latent metahuman abilities, which (unbeknownst to her) she inherited from her father, breaking her bathroom sink in half. Anissa does not immediately realize that she is a metahuman and continues to briefly go on with life, believing it to have been an \\"accident\\". Anissa, who is openly lesbian, breaks up with her girlfriend Chenoa due to losing interest in her and begins to investigate her new abilities after her powers awaken again during a store robbery she is able to stop using them. She determines that she has enhanced strength and density when taking deep breaths that she can activate and deactivate at will by controlling her breathing. This makes her virtually invincible so long as she can continue to control her inhalation. In addition, she has an accelerated healing factor that mends injuries of her body far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human. Anissa begins to look into her family history while also making a friend and possible new love interest in bartender Grace Choi while also doing vigilante work. Anissa learns that her grandfather was a journalist who investigated a group of young metahumans who disappeared years ago. Anissa eventually finds his research and decides to share it with her mother, Lynn Stewart, a neuroscientist, although she does not immediately tell her why she is researching their history. Lynn is attacked by members of the 100 shortly after, who tie her up and tape her mouth shut in her office forcing Anissa to use her powers to help her mother. While she successfully scares them away, Black Lightning shows up, wrongly believing a masked Anissa to be the culprit of a still tied-up Lynn's kidnapping. The two metahumans confront one another, and after Black Lightning inevitably wins and injures Anissa, Lynn reveals the truth and laments that both her children are metahumans. In Season 3, Anissa takes on the alias of Blackbird when liberating young metahumans from the A.S.A. buses as Gambi secretly assists her. She later reunited with Grace and accepts her metahuman abilities. Anissa is erased during the Crisis on Infinite Earths when a wave of anti-matter destroys the entire universe. She is restored when her Earth is merged with Earth-1 and Earth-38 to form Earth- Prime. Blackbird continues helping the resistance as Black Lightning allows her to make the calls. When Lynn is taken to Markovia, Anissa plans to take part in the rescue mission where she is persuaded by Grace to let her assist in it. When it comes to the raid on the Markovian facility, Thunder had to strike Erica Moran until she had absorbed enough kinetic energy enough to knock down a strong door. When the Markovians attacked South Freeland, Thunder and Grace assisted Black Lightning in fighting them. Anissa and Grace later invite everybody to their engagement party to get that out of the way before the Markovians begin their invasion on Freeland. When in the Pit, Thunder and Grace confront Gravedigger who controls Grace into attacking Thunder. She was forced to use her abilities to knock her out. Following the attack on Freeland, Lynn tells Thunder that Grace is in a coma where she is unsure when she'll come out of it as Lynn plans to make sure that Grace receives full care. Thunder accompanied Black Lightning, Lynn, and Lightning to a congressional committee where they present the briefcase that exposes the A.S.A.'s experiments as well as Markovia's own experiments. Describing her character as a positive role model, Williams said \\"I'm just really grateful to tell the story for young lesbians – and black lesbians in particular ... My hope is that when you watch Anissa, a young lesbian is inspired to walk boldly as who she is and to love herself and to love herself exactly how she looks.\\" * Williams also portrays her Earth-1 counterpart, who witnessed her father being executed by the A.S.A. for his involvement with the metahuman underground railroad. This version ceased to exist when Earth-Prime was formed. * Williams also portrays her Earth-2 counterpart, who is killed by Jinn alongside her family when they tried to intervene. This version ceased to exist when a new Earth-2 was formed. ===Lynn Stewart=== Christine Adams Lynn Stewart (portrayed by Christine Adams) is a highly learned doctor and neurologist as well as the ex-wife of Jefferson and the mother of Jennifer and Anissa Pierce. Several years before the onset of the series, Lynn divorced and convinced Jefferson to retire as Black Lightning to protect their two daughters as his vigilante work often brought him home battered and wounded; on occasion even bleeding in front of Jennifer. Years later, Lynn and Jefferson begin to get close again, giving Jeff hope of reconciliation before their daughters are kidnapped and he is forced to use his powers for the first time in years to save them, although he promises Lynn that it would be a one- time deal. After the death of his former student LaWanda White, Jeff decides to return to being Black Lightning, much to Lynn's frustration as this pushes back their relationship, which had finally started to heal. Lynn attempts to convince Peter Gambi (Jeff's enabler and surrogate father) to tell him to stop, to no avail. Lynn begins to realize Anissa is acting strange and inquires into this unsuccessfully, although she assures her that she will support her no matter what. Despite not wanting to get involved with Black Lightning, Lynn is instrumental in convincing Jefferson to not kill Tobias Whale, leader of the 100 and the man who killed his father. Lynn later begins to investigate the effects of a new drug called \\"Green Light\\" and its effects on the brain, which are similar to what appears to happen to Jefferson when he uses his powers. She is also given a box by Anissa containing Jefferson's father's genetic research on the metagene due to the disappearance of a group of teenagers years prior to his eventual death. Anissa dismisses her curiosity as her simply doing an assignment on their family history. Shortly thereafter, Lynn is attacked by 100 gangsters. Fortunately, Anissa shows up dressed in disguise and uses her abilities to disarm and scare off the attackers. Before she can help a shocked Lynn, Black Lightning arrives and wrongfully believes a masked Anissa to be Lynn's attacker. The two metahumans get into a heated confrontation with Jefferson emerging as the victor, although he soon regrets this as he realizes who she is. Lynn and Jefferson lament that Anissa has gained powers and has followed in Black Lightning's dangerous footsteps. Lynn analyses Anissa's wounds and realizes she has very fast healing abilities like her father. In Season 3, Lynn starts working for the A.S.A. as she works to find a way to stabilize the metahuman gene. While using a filtered version of Green Light, Lynn was able to come up with the vaccines which also involved some DNA samples taken from Tobias Whale. Whale starts to play with her mind where he wanted the info on the metahumans the A.S.A. had. She gives them to him, but leaves out the information on Wendy Hernandez and Erica Moran. She is erased during the Crisis on Infinite Earths when a wave of antimatter destroys the entire universe. Lynn is restored when her Earth is merged with Earth-1 and Earth-38 to form Earth-Prime. Both Jennifer and Jefferson find that she has become addicted to the modified Green Light. After receiving help from Sergeant Gardner Grayle into sneaking Tobias Whale out of the Pit, both of them were tasered by a Markovian operative who contacts Colonel Mosin to send Instant over. Lynn and Tobias are taken to Markovia where she is reunited with Jace. This led to a cat fight which Yuri Mosin broke up. He reveals to Lynn the knowledge of what Lynn has done to stabilize the metahuman gene from his double agent Nurse Michael Allen and leaves her a Green Light to help her out. As Jace works to gain Lynn's trust, she does tell Jace that she needs some medicine to deal with the Green Light withdrawal. Then she meets Gravedigger when he was given orders to take over the operation from Mosin. Lynn does a trick to get Gravedigger to give him his DNA sample which enabled her to make a 20-minute Green Light with a copy of his mind-control. While it worked on Mosin, it couldn't work on Gravedigger when he caught up to the group. As Lynn started to surrender to Gravedigger, Black Lightning arrived and shocked Gravedigger into submission. Then Black Lightning and Lynn got on the helicopter and retreated back to Freeland. Lynn continued to go through withdrawal symptoms as she has Jennifer fry the Green Light she hid in the bathroom. She was present when Gambi used the briefcase's information to explain the history of Gravedigger and the United States' collaboration with Markovia on a metahuman project. Lynn states that she left the meta-boost formula in Markovia. After working in the lab, Lynn informs Jefferson that his DNA and Gravedigger's DNA are a match meaning that they are related. As she works on the anti-boost serum to use on Gravedigger, Lynn is confronted by Commander Carson Williams who is on a mission to eliminate classified information where he mentions that he already did away with Dr. Jace. Briefly copying Erica's powers, Lynn kills Commander Williams in self-defense. With the anti-boost serum made, she uses them on Gravedigger enabling Black Lightning to defeat him as he then evacuates everyone from the Pit which has been set to self-destruct. After examining Grace, Lynn states to Anissa that she is in a coma where she is unsure when she'll come out of it while advising she gets full care. Lynn later accompanied Black Lightning, Thunder, and Lightning to a congressional committee where they present the briefcase that exposes the A.S.A.'s experiments as well as Markovia's own experiments. * Adams also portrays her Earth-1 counterpart, who visits Gen in The Pit after Jefferson was killed by the A.S.A. This version ceased to exist when Earth- Prime was formed. * Adams also portrays her Earth-2 counterpart, who is killed by Jinn alongside the rest of her family when they tried to intervene. This version ceased to exist when a new Earth-2 was formed. ===Tobias Whale=== Marvin \\"Krondon\\" Jones III Tobias Whale (portrayed by Marvin \\"Krondon\\" Jones III) is a crime lord who leads the 100 Gang and the main antagonist of the series. Tobias is an African-American albino who is portrayed as cruel and seemingly loathes his \\"Black\\" heritage as he casually but very often expresses that he prefers the company of \\"White people\\" and refers to \\"Black\\" individuals distastefully as \\"negroes\\". This expressed usually by his left and right-hand man and woman Joey Toledo and Syonide who are always with him. Though this is contradicted by his apparent great love for his sister, Tori, who is a Black African-American (that is, without albinism). Tobias is first shown scolding Latavius, one of his main subordinates, on the apparent return of Black Lightning (whom he believed was deceased after his disappearance years earlier), asking if he believes in the \\"Resurrection\\". Tobias built his \\"street cred\\" around his apparent murdering Black Lightning and was gifted the 100 gang by a group of unseen, powerful underworld gangsters for it. They assign a woman named Lady Eve to watch over their investment in him and he reports to her. After Latavius is incarcerated for the death of LaWanda White (a civilian of Freeland who wanted her daughter back from the 100), Tobias, Toledo and Syonide infiltrate the jail with their connections at the police station and murder Lala as he is a liability. Tobias next attempts to assassinate Black Lightning after he appears before a mob of marchers against the 100. The bullet he fires misses and instead hits Jefferson's daughter's boyfriend, Khalil, whose spine is severed, but no one sees Tobias except Peter Gambi, who curiously erases the footage and keeps it from Jefferson. Tobias meets with Lady Eve, who expresses aversion with the uproar the 100 is receiving for paralyzing a potential \\"Olympic star\\", a fact Tobias mostly shrugs off. It is revealed that Tobias killed Jefferson Pierce's father years before the onset of the series when Jeff was a kid, but has maintained the same youthful appearance apparently due to an unnamed serum that sustains his youth and seemingly inhumane strength. Upon discovering that Tobias is in Freeland, Jefferson attempts to assassinate Tobias in return, but is convinced otherwise and Tobias escapes. Tobias next begins to release a drug called Greenlight that seems to temporarily enhance the user's strength while in a blind rage-filled frenzy but is highly unstable. Tobias's sister arrives in Freeland and suggests they turn the people of the city against Black Lightning. Together they decide to finally deal with their father, who was abusive towards them as children. Tobias breaks his back, mercilessly \\"letting him die\\" alone with no help. Later, Tobias and Syonide convince Khalil that they have a way to make him walk again. Sometime after this, Tobias and his sister are subsequently attacked by Black Lightning while attending a club. After Lady Eve and Peter Gambi murder Toledo, Tobias and Tori plot to kill Evelyn in revenge. Tobias's people are badly overpowered and he is injured while a stray bullet hits and kills Tori. His henchmen guide him out of the building. Using his contact with ASA operative Martin Proctor, Tobias Whale turns Khalil Payne into Painkiller. In the season finale, Tobias uses Lala as a bomb mule as he, Syonide, and Painkiller raid an A.S.A. building. Proctor escaped, but they got the briefcase he had. In Season 2, Tobias Whale goes to visit the crypt of Tori to pay his respects where he is arrested by Deputy Chief Henderson and his fellow police officers for the murder of Alvin Pierce. Tobias is released from police custody when District Attorney Montez does not think that Jefferson's eyewitness testimony will stick. During \\"The Book of Rebellion\\" arc, Tobias Whale sends Painkiller to kill Reverend Jeremiah Holt, who wouldn't relocate his clinic as suggested by Councilman Kwame Parker. When Tobias got tired of waiting and Painkiller failed to get Reverend Holt to leave town, he placed a bounty on Painkiller, which gets fulfilled by Giselle Cutter and ends with Tobias ripping out his spinal implant and leaving him for dead. During these episodes, Tobias also gets a young prodigy named Todd Green on his side. The episode \\"The Book of Secrets: Chapter One: Prodigal Son\\" revealed that he was an old friend of Helga Jace, who made his anti-aging serum. After Todd orchestrates Jace's jailbreak in secret, she takes Tobias to where the remaining pod children are held, as he makes plans for them. In the season 2 finale, Tobias unleashes the Masters of Disaster on Freeland while also having the 100 cause riots. When Lightning confronts Tobias Whale after Cutter leaves him, she nearly kills him for what he did to Painkiller until Black Lightning shows up and talks her out of it. Lightning helps her father defeat Tobias who is then remanded to an off the books meta-human prison called the \\"Pit.\\" In Season 3, Tobias is looking older without his serum and his hair has grown in. Issa Williams uses his truth-extracting abilities on Tobias where he reveals that Proctor worked for Odell and that Odell works for the President of the United States. Odell later tries to get the location of the briefcase out of him to no avail even when he used ultraviolet lights on him. Tobias later has a hallucination of Black Lightning taunting him. When working on stabilizing the meta-gene, Lynn works on Tobias where she uses the same serum on him that restores his body. Tobias voices his knowledge that Black Lightning and Jefferson Pierce are one person and vows to deal with him when he gets out. Lynn then extracts a bone marrow sample from Tobias joking that she forgot the anesthetic. When Tobias is snuck out of the Pit and knocked out by Lynn, a Markovian operative tasered Lynn and Gardner Grayle while arranging for Instant to take Lynn and Tobias to Markovia. Once there, Yuri Mosin's double agent Nurse Michael Allen continued to extract the bone marrow from Tobias to further the Markovian's plans to stabilize the metahumans on their side. When Tobias is rescued by Black Lightning, he voices to Black Lightning that he knows his identity. This causes Black Lightning to knock him out. It was mentioned that Tobias got away as Mosin reports to Gravedigger that his men can't find him. Tobias makes his way to Nurse Michael Allen's house where he has killed his dad and spared his mom. He wants Nurse Allen to take him to where the metahumans in Markovia's custody are. Tobias later watches the news about Markovia's prime minister refusing to give restitution for Markovia's attack on Freeland as he plans to make his own return to Freeland. ===Billy Henderson=== Inspector William \\"Billy\\" Henderson (portrayed by Damon Gupton) is a police detective and Jefferson's best friend who is oblivious to his alter ego as Black Lightning and hunts him due to believing he is an outlaw and vigilante. After exposing the dirty Deputy Chief Zeke Cayman, he is appointed to replace him. In Season 2, Henderson eventually learns that Jefferson is Black Lightning, fracturing their relationship. He later informed Jefferson that Detective Summers was killed and to use Black Lightning to track down one of the people who is known for setting fires to cars. Also, Henderson learned that Jefferson was replaced as principal in light of the 100's attack on Garfield High. Once that was done, Henderson is informed by Black Lightning that the person was hired by Tobias Whale. This leads Henderson and his police officers to track down Tobias Whale at his sister's crypt where Henderson led in his arrest. Then Henderson informed Jefferson that they finally caught Tobias Whale and wanted him to be the first to know about it. While he does place Helga Jace in his custody after Lynn Stewart subdues her, he finds Jace not in her cell due to the bounty hunter Instant having taken her to the Markovians while having killed some police officers in the process. After Tobias Whale is defeated, Henderson is seen driving through the streets as Black Lightning and Thunder put an end to the 100-established riots. In Season 3, Henderson is now the chief of police and is intimidated by Commander Carson Williams to do a press conference about the A.S.A.'s enforced curfew or else he will make things miserable for his family. Henderson had no choice but to agree to the terms. Unbeknownst to the A.S.A., Henderson started a secret resistance movement against the A.S.A. with the help of Blackbird.

Major Grey has Dr. Blair place a kill Lynn contingency in Erica's chip in the event that Lynn can't be saved. Though that chip was secretly deactivated by TC when he got close to Erica. He revealed that information to Jefferon Pierce and Gardner Grayle. When it came to the raid on the Markovian facility, Thunder had to strike Erica until she had enough kinetic energy to knock down a strong door. After the mission was done, it was mentioned by Odell to Jefferson that Erica has been returned to her family. Prior to attending Anissa and Grace's engagement party, Erica does managed to kiss TC before the Markovians can begin their invasion of Freeland. During the Markovian invasion on Freeland, Erica assists Grayle in the evacuation of the suspected metahumans. When they and the rebels tried to fight Gravedigger, he mind-controls them to sleep. * Dr. Matthew Blair (portrayed by Brandon Hirsch) – A young scientist who assists Lynn in her work with the metahumans in A.S.A. custody. After Lynn flees, Dr. Blair is left to work on the vaccine where he has only been able to reach 60%. Major Grey later has Dr. Blair place a kill Lynn contingency in Erica's chip in the event that Lynn can't be saved. Dr. Blair was later abducted by Lala and tortured by Devonte on where Tobias Whale is which he has no knowledge of. * T.C. / Baron (portrayed by Christopher Ammanuel) – A pod metahuman with technopathic abilities. Due to him hearing a lot of current technology speaking after being freed, Baron took residence at an old radio station where he met Peter Gambi and assisted him and Thunder in getting Jamillah's message to outside of Freeland. Baron later found himself at Gambi's tailor shop where he found Gambi's secret room and his connections with Black Lightning, Thunder, and Lightning. When Baron goes onto Gambi's computers to find information on who tried to have Gambi killed, he has a brief collapse as the image on the monitor shows a picture of Lady Eve. He later meets Jefferson and translates Painkiller's technology. With help from Gambi and Jennifer, TC created a firewall to trap the Painkiller programming enabling Khalil to regain control of his body. Upon getting suspicious of what has been placed on Erica, TC deactivated the chip that contained the programmed contingency plan which he later revealed to Black Lightning and Gardner Grayle. After checking to see if Painkiller is still behind the firewall, TC was approached by Brandon to look up information on his father only for Khalil to suffer a glitch that briefly freed Painkiller. Following the incident, TC helps Gambi open the briefcase that Lady Eve gave him after she got it from Lala. Prior to the Markovians' invasion of Freeland, TC manages to get a kiss from Erica. During the Markovian invasion, he helped Gambi coordinate Black Lightning in rescuing Lightning and warning them that the Pit was set to self-destruct. * Gravedigger / Tyson Sykes (portrayed by Wayne Brady) – A World War II soldier who became a subject to a metahuman project collaboration between the United States and Markovia in exchange for not being court martialed for beating up some soldiers that used racist remarks on him. Tyson was the only survivor of this project. While he possesses super-strength, super-speed, and mind- control, Gravedigger maintained his age due to the same serum that Helga Jace used on Tobias Whale. He used his talents when fighting Nazi soldiers. Afrer the war, Gravedigger sided with Markovia, assisted in a coup d'état, and became on of the Markovian's few stable metahumans who plans to make an independent metahuman nation in Markovia. Gravedigger even considered Martin Luther King Jr. a coward and claimed that the rich white people helped to get Barack Obama elected. Years later, Gravedigger was sent by his superiors to take over the operation from Mosin where he used his mind-control to get Lynn Stewart to work on the metahuman stabilization faster. In one instance, Lynn had to ask for his DNA sample which she secretly used for her 20-minute Green Light. When Black Lightning and his allies raided the Markovian facility to rescue Lynn, Tobias, and Jace, Gravedigger overpowered Khalil and used his laser gun to knock out Black Lightning. Then he used his mental abilities to stop the group from evacuating. Lynn started to surrender to Gravedigger due to him being immune to other mind-control attacks only for Black Lightning to catch up to them and shock Gravedigger into submission. A Markovian scientist later injected Gravedigger with the meta-boost formula that Lynn left behind. When Mosin comes in stating that his men can't find Tobias, Gravedigger states to Mosin that Markovia thanks him for his services and uses his upgraded powers to kill Mosin. After researching those who rescued Lynn, Gravedigger leads the invasion on Freeland. Lynn found that Jefferson's DNA and Gravedigger's DNA are a match meaning that they are related. Lightning takes out the ones who were with Gravedigger before fighting Gravedigger. He resists the electrical attacks and throws Lightning against the perimeter enough to take it down. Black Lightning resuscitates Lightning just as Gravedigger catches up to them. Black Lightning begins to fight him. He did use a microwave ability on Black Lightning before he made a tactical retreat when the Markovian soldiers made off with Lightning. Lightning even tried to reason with him. During Gravedigger's raid on the Pit, he mind-controlled those on the outside to sleep, mind-controlled Grace into attacking Thunder, and knocked down Lightning and Brandon. Gravedigger fought Black Lightning again. After being hit by the anti-boost serum shot by Lynn, Black Lightning defeated Gravedigger and even had him evacuated from the Pit before it can self- destruct. Using a cloaking technology, Gravedigger watched Black Lightning's meeting with a congressional committee that exposed the A.S.A.'s experiments as well as Markovia's own experiments. Upon leaving the building, Gravedigger sheds his disguise and walks off. ==Guest starsIntroduced in season one=== * Varetta Henderson (portrayed by Karen Ceesay) – The wife of Inspector Henderson and the mother of Kiesha Henderson. * Will (portrayed by Dabier Snell) – A member of the 100 and cousin of Lala who kidnaps Anissa and Jennifer.

Formed in 1938, it was responsible for protecting Manchester and later the Isle of Wight during World War II. It was reformed postwar under a new title, and continued until 1955. ==Origin== With the expansion of Britain's Anti-Aircraft (AA) defences in the late 1930s, new formations were created to command the growing number of Royal Artillery (RA) and Royal Engineers (RE) AA gun and searchlight (S/L) units. 44th AA Brigade was raised on 29 September 1938 at Manchester. It formed part of 4th AA Division, which was responsible for defending North West England.

In February 1939 the TA's AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June, as international tensions grew in the run-up to World War II, a partial mobilisation of AA Command was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun and searchlight positions.

By midnight the brigade was disposed as follows: Kearsley Power Station: a vital point to be defended HAA guns * 65th AA Rgt ** 181 Bty – 2 x 3-inch ** 183 Bty – 4 x static 3.7-inch ** 196 Bty – 2 x 3-inch * 81st AA Rgt ** 253 Bty – 2 x 3-inch ** 254 Bty – 4 x 3-inch LAA guns * 80th LAA Bty – 1 x Bofors 40 mm gun and 12 x Lewis guns at Kearsley Power Station * 81st HAA Rgt – 15 x Lewis guns at Metropolitan-Vickers * 71st S/L Rgt – 8 x Lewis guns at the Clayton Aniline Company S/Ls * 71st S/L Rgt – 4 x lights In the next 24 hours more HAA gun sites were reported ready for action, around 60 S/Ls were deployed and the number of Lewis guns at VPs was increased, with 39th S/L Bttn guarding the Manchester Ship Canal, Salford docks and Barton Power Station. In addition, the women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) companies were taking over their duties with the regiments. On 1 November the brigade was reorganised, with 39th and 71st S/L Rgts transferring to the command of 53rd Light AA Bde covering the Mersey area, followed shortly afterwards by 62nd S/L Rgt. Simultaneously, 21st (69, 136 & 143 Btys at Liverpool)21 LAA Rgt at RA 39–45. and its newly formed offshoot 41st (133, 134 & 135 Btys)41 LAA Rgt at RA 39–45.Farndale, Annex M. LAA Rgts transferred from 53rd LAA Bde and took over command of the LAA batteries manning VPs in 44 AA Bde's area, (42, 82 and 129 Btys), while 80th LAA Bty ceased to be an independent unit and came under 21st LAA Rgt. The commander of 44th AA Bde was named AA Defence Commander (AADC) for the Manchester Gun Zone. New VPs taken over by the brigade included ICI's Lostock Gralam works and Crewe Junction (136 LAA Bty), Baxter's respirator factory at Leyland (133 LAA Bty), Royal Ordnance Factory, Chorley, (133 & 135 LAA Btys), Carlisle Junction (134 LAA Bty) and de Havilland's Lostock works (181 AA Bty, later 253 AA Bty). Despite a number of alerts, there were no enemy air raids in the brigade's area for some time. In November, the brigade received 4.5-inch HAA guns to re-equip three of its four-gun HAA sites, and 436 S/L Bty relieved 134 LAA Bty so that it could be sent to train on the Vickers MkVIII 'pom-pom' gun. In June 1940 the AA regiments were redesignated 'HAA' to distinguish them from the growing number of LAA units, while in August all the RE AA battalions and infantry battalions converted to S/L duties became Searchlight Regiments of the RA.Litchfield. ==Battle of Britain and Blitz== 4 AA Divisional sign Most of the air raids in 4 AA Division's area during the Battle of Britain were in the West Midlands or over the Mersey. A few bombs fell on Manchester and Crewe on 27/28 August, and across East Lancashire the following night. Night raids increased during the autumn as the Battle of Britain was followed by the Blitz. 65th (Manchester Regiment) HAA Rgt moved to the Orkney & Shetland Defence Force (OSDEF) in the first week of October 1940, being replaced by 70th (3rd West Lancashire) HAA Rgt from 33 (Western) AA Bde.Routledge, Table LXV, pp. 396–7.70 HAA Rgt at RA 39–45. Some examples of Gun-laying Mk I radar began to arrive for the HAA batteries, Bofors 40 mm guns appeared in increasing numbers for the LAA regiments, and the AA divisions formed units equipped with Z Battery rocket projectiles.Pile's despatch.Routledge, pp. 388-9. In November 1940 the expansion of AA Command led to the creation of new AA Divisions. 44 AA Brigade remained in 4 AA Division and was responsible for Manchester and the surrounding area, including the shipyards of Barrow-in-Furness, but Brigadier Rickards was promoted to command the new 12 AA Division from 15 November. He was succeeded in command of 44 AA Bde by Lt-Col Erroll Tremlett, a former first-class cricketer who had distinguished himself commanding 54th (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) LAA Rgt at the Dunkirk evacuation, where his guns had defended the Mole and protected the embarkation of many of the troops.Tremlett at Generals of World War IIFarndale, p. 64.Tremlett at Cricinfo.Wisden 1984, pp. 1209–10. ===Manchester Blitz=== Firefighters putting out a blaze at a bomb site in Manchester city centre The cities of NW England were heavily bombed during the winter of 1940–41 (the Liverpool Blitz and Manchester Blitz). On the night of 21/22 November the Manchester guns engaged raiders on their way to and from Liverpool, and on the following two nights it was Manchester's turn to be hit. Raids on Manchester peaked at Christmas.Collier, Chapter XVII.Collier, Appendix XXX. The Royal Artillery's historian considered that during these attacks on British cities 'the actions fought [by the AA batteries] were as violent, dangerous and prolonged as any in the field'. 'On an HAA 4.5-inch position of 44th AA Brigade in Manchester, the power rammer on one gun failed. One Gunner loaded 127 of the [] rounds himself in eleven hours of action, despite injuries to his fingers'.Routledge, p. 395. ===Order of Battle 1940–41=== During the winter of 1940–41, the composition of 44 AA Bde was as follows:Farndale, Annex D, p. 258.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/79 Static 3.7-inch gun preserved at Nothe Fort * 70th (3rd West Lancashire) HAA Rgt ** 211, 212, 216 HAA Btys – at Manchester ** 309 HAA Bty – joined by January, left by August 1941 ** 245 HAA Bty – attached from 78th HAA Rgt November 1940 * 98th HAA Rgt – joined by January 1941Litchfield, p. 86. ** 300, 301, 320 HAA Btys – Manchester suburbs ** 399 HAA Bty – joined by May 1941 * 106th HAA Rgt – new regiment formed August 1940;Farndale, Annex M. to 11 AA Division by January 1941 ** 331 HAA Bty – at Barrow ** 332 HAA Bty – at Crewe * 115th HAA Rgt – new regiment formed November 1940, joined by January 1941 ** 361 HAA Bty – at Blackpool ** 365 HAA Bty – joined by May 1941 ** 367 HAA Bty – at Barrow * 21st LAA Rgt ** 69 LAA Bty – VPs at Preston ** 80 LAA Bty – VPs at Leyland ** 136 LAA Bty – VPs at Barrow * 41st LAA Rgt – to 7 AA Division 1 March 1941 ** 133 LAA Bty – VPs at Carlisle ** 134 LAA Bty – VPs at Maryport ** 143 LAA Bty – VPs at Gretna Green * 54th (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) LAA Rgt – returned from Dunkirk; left AA Command 10 March 1941 and joined the Support Group of 9th Armoured DivisionLitchfield, p. 281.54 LAA Rgt at RA 39–45.Joslen, pp. 23, 220. ** 160 LAA Bty – VPs at Woodford ** 161 LAA Bty – VPs at Ringway, de Havilland works Lostock, Irlam Locks ** 162 LAA Bty – VPs at Winnington, ICI Lostock, Rolls- Royce Crewe * 63rd LAA Rgt – new unit formed October 1940;63 LAA Rgt at RA 39–45. to 11 AA Division by May 1941 ** 189, 190 LAA Btys – at Preston * 65th LAA Rgt – new unit formed November 1940; joined by January 194165 LAA Rgt at RA 39–45. ** 194 LAA By – VP at English Electric Company, Preston ** 195 LAA Bty – VPs at Heysham ** 196 LAA Bty – VPs at Blackpool * 76th LAA Rgt – new unit formed February 1941;76 LAA Rgt at RA 39–45. joined by May 1941 ** 226, 227, 228 LAA Btys * 4th AA 'Z' Regt – formed September 1940 ** 108 'Z' Bty – at Barrow ** 122 'Z' Bty – at Accrington ** 135 'Z' Bty – at Manchester ==Mid- War== The Blitz is generally held to have ended on 16 May 1941. By now the HAA sites had the advantage of GL Mk I* radar with an elevation finding (E/F or 'Effie') attachment to supplement searchlights.Routledge, pp. 98–9, 393.Collier, Chapter 19.Collier, Appendix XXXI. At this stage of the war, experienced units were being posted away to train for service overseas. This led to a continual turnover of units, which accelerated with the preparations for the invasion of North Africa (Operation Torch) in late 1942 and the need to transfer units to counter the Luftwaffe's Baedeker Blitz and hit-and-run attacks on the South Coast. However, newly formed units continued to join AA Command, the HAA and support units increasingly becoming 'Mixed' units, indicating that women of the ATS were fully integrated into them. Members of the Home Guard (HG) also provided manpower, particularly for 'Z' Batteries.Routledge, pp. 398–404.Collier, Chapter XX. Brigadier Tremlett was promoted to command 10 AA Division from 14 February 1942, and was succeeded at 44 AA Bde by Brig R.E.

When in September 1943 AA Command was required to release manpower to 21st Army Group forming for the planned invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord), the group began to lose units by transfer and disbandment.Routledge, p. 409.44 AA Bde War Diary, 1943, TNA file WO 166/11218.

Here it came under the command of 6 AA Group, which had responsibility for covering the 'Overlord' embarkation ports around the Solent and Portsmouth. The brigade established its HQ at 'Broadlands', Staplers Road, Newport, and took over command of 82nd (Essex) HAA Rgt and 151st LAA Rgt from 47 AA Bde and was soon reinforced. Additional LAA guns (mainly Bofors, with a few Oerlikon 20 mm cannon) were sited singly at Yarmouth, Shanklin, Sandown and Ventnor.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, TNA file WO 212/85. Brigadier Vere Krohn, MC, TD, a former head of AA Command's technical branch, arrived from 43 AA Bde to take command on 2 May, and began redeploying the HAA sites and additional radar-controlled searchlights to tackle aircraft attempting to lay mines in the Solent. There were sporadic attacks, with 619/185, 182/136 and 438/136 HAA Btys submitting claims for 'kills' on 15, 16 and 23 May, but the Luftwaffe failed to disrupt the 'Overlord' preparations.Routledge, p. 392. Crew of a twin Browning LAA gun keep watch for divers, 19 June 19544. A week after D-Day the long-awaited attacks on London by V-1 flying bombs ('Divers') began. AA Command had prepared Operation Diver to counter these weapons, and AA guns were moved from all over the UK to strengthen 2 AA Group's 'Diver Belt' in South East England. 6 AA Group also deployed additional HAA batteries in the Solent–Portsmouth defences. The first V-1 appeared over the Isle of Wight on 26 June, and 44 AA Bde redeployed its LAA guns in an anti-Diver role, including twin Browning .50 Machine Guns from S/L sites in the west of the island. However, the V-1 launch sites in Normandy were quickly overrun, and few missiles were seen in the Solent–Portsmouth area. As 21st Army Group overran the main launch sites in the Pas-de-Calais, the Luftwaffe shifted its focus to air-launching V-1s over the North Sea during the autumn, and AA Command redeployed units from the South Coast to Eastern England in response.Routledge, pp. 410–8. 44 AA Brigade 'blacked out' its searchlights on 12 November apart from those required as homing beacons for friendly aircraft, and the crews were sent to provide construction parties for the gun sites in the new 'Diver Strip'. In early December it handed over its remaining commitments to 67 AA Bde, and Brigade HQ was disbanded on 31 December 1944. ===Order of Battle 1944=== Bofors guns on anti-Diver duty, South Coast, 1944 During this period the composition of the brigade was as follows:Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/85. * 12th HAA Rgt – base and port defence unit from 21st Army Group June 1944Order of Battle of the Forces in the United Kingdom, Part 2: 21 Army Group, 24 July 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/238. ** 4, 18, 360 HAA Btys * 82nd (Essex) HAA Rgt – to 3 AA Group May 1944 ** 156, 228 (Edinburgh), 256 HAA Btys ** 193 HAA Bty – returned to 44 AA Bde area 28 June 1944 * 136th HAA Rgt – from 1 AA Group May; to 2 AA Group Diver Belt 17 June 1944 ** 182, 409, 432, 468 HAA Btys * 177th HAA Rgt – from 67 AA Bde May; disbanded June 1944 ** 182, 409, 432, 468 HAA Btys * 619 (M) HAA Bty – from 185th (M) HAA Rgt; to 5 AA Group 7 October 1944 * 526 (M) HAA Bty – from 154th (M) HAA Rgt 6 October 1944 * 151st LAA Rgt – to 1 AA Group 19–24 October 1944 ** 449, 472, 478 LAA Btys * 52 LAA Bty – from 85th LAA Rgt summer; to 2 AA Group 2 September 1944 * 277 LAA Bty – from 83rd LAA Rgt 24 October 1944 * 53rd (Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) S/L Rgt – from 2 AA Group May 1944 ** 408, 409, 410 S/L Btys * 303 AA Gun Operations Room (AAGOR) * 506 AA Ground Control Interception (AAGCI) station * 44 AA Bde Signal Section By October 1944, the brigade's HQ establishment was 8 officers, 7 male other ranks and 22 members of the ATS, together with a small number of attached drivers, cooks and mess orderlies (male and female). In addition, the brigade had a Mixed Signal Office Section of 5 male other ranks and 19 ATS, which was formally part of the Group signal unit.AA Command Organisation Table, October–November 1944, TNA file WO 212/148. The brigade was disbanded on 11 December 1944. ==Postwar== When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, 44 AA Bde reformed at Salford, Greater Manchester as 70th AA Brigade (TA) (taking the number of a disbanded wartime formation from 4 AA Division) and forming part of 4 AA Group at Warrington.

June 1990), was a notorious alleged American Mafia figure, owner of the Gold Coast Restaurant and Lounge in Hollywood, Florida. ==Biography== His father was Russian and his mother Polish. Before moving to Miami in the mid-1940s, Joseph Sonken was involved in a prostitution ring in Chicago. Allegations imply that Joseph Sonken was close to Al Capone and fled to Florida to flee police busts in Chicago.Matthew Pearl, How One Famed Hollywood Restaurant Became the National Center for the Mob, Miaminewtimes.com, 30 January 2018 In Miami, Joseph Sonken opened the Mother Kelly's nightclub and became a public figure. The nightclub went out of business in 1948, and Joseph Sonken moved to Hollywood Florida to open the Gold Coast Restaurant and Lounge. According to police reports, the Gold Coast was heavily used as a meeting point for Mafia members. Joseph Sonken denied those allegations in front of a Kefauver committee in 1968. Among the famous guests were Mafia members John Gotti, Joseph Todaro Sr., and Edward SciandraMike Billington, Joseph Sonken, Owned Suspected Mafia Hangout, Sun- sentinel.com, 3 June 1990. Public stars such as Frank Sinatra and Cary Grant were also known as regular customers, and the restaurant is mentioned in the FBI's JFK assassination files and in Elmore Leonard's novel Gold Coast. Joseph Sonken was arrested in 1972 for illegal gambling, but those charges were dropped a month later. In 1975, he was indicted for tax evasion and acquitted by a jury trial. In 1978, The Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) tried to trick Joseph Sonken by selling him cheap groceries undercover, and later raid the Gold Coast Restaurant and Lounge claiming it is stocked with stolen groceries bought at cut-rate prices. The case was dismissed. In May 1994, Gus Boulis bought the Gold Coast Restaurant and Lounge and flipped it into a Miami Subs Grill.Deborah Ramirez, Legendary Restaurant Shuts, Sun- sentinel.com, 5 May 1994 Joseph Sonken died in June 1990 at the age of 83 in Plantation, Florida. ==References== Category:1910 births Category:1990 deaths Category:American restaurateurs ","title":"Joseph Sonken"},{"id":"56874089","text":"Haukur Jóhannsson (born 17 January 1953) is an Icelandic alpine skier.

He started with amateur theater, which was a kind of escape for him. He became known in 1970 by publishing drawings in the Catalan press, while he began studying theatrical direction and set design at the Theatre Institute of Barcelona. He enjoyed an intense and productive professional career there and, at the same time, was a professor of performing arts between 1973 and 2003. Guillén i Zambrano has collaborated with several theater groups in the construction of masks for street shows, as with the Viva Picasso show in 1981. He also collaborated with the theater group Els Comediants for more than twenty years, and created sets for shows like El Llibre de les Bèsties and La Cenerentola, the latter of which premiered in 2011 in Canada and was performed in 2015 by the Lyric Opera of Chicago. In the field of Catalan stage design, he began working in the 1960s and became one of the more famous set designers, with contemporary authors such as Fabià Puigserver i Plana, Ramon B. Ivars Amigo, Andreu Rabal Serrat and Josep Messeguer Vendrell. In the field of graphic illustration, Guillén i Zambrano has been published in a wide variety of magazines and newspapers such as Triunfo, La Calle, Tele-Exprés, El Món, La Vanguardia, Avui, El Periódico de Catalunya and Muchas Gracias. In Catalonia, he has been a pioneer in the field of digital design. Between 1985 and 1987, he created material for TV3, and later TVE. He has also been featured in several exhibitions, such as Spanish Transition, organized by the National Library of Spain, as well as the Suite Nonell in 2013. In 2016, Guillén was one of the signers of a statement entitled \\"In favor of greater social involvement in the promotion of arts and culture: commitment to cultural patronage\\", promoted by the Ateneu Barcelonés and the CoNCA (National Council of Arts and Culture). In 2013 he accepted the proposal of the National Library of Spain to give them his file. In 2017, Guillén donated part of his collection, which contains original sets and costumes for shows such as The Magic Flute, El llibre de les bèsties, and La Cenerentola, to the Biblioteca de Catalunya; he also contributed satirical drawings for the press (Tele- Expres, Muchas gracias, Diario de Barcelona...), posters, photographs, and handbills of different works. == Awards and acknowledgements == * Premi Ciutat de Barcelona (1983 and 1985) in the communication media category. * Gold Medal of Clothing at the \\"9a Quadriennal de Arquitectura y Escenografía\\" of Praga (1999) * National Culture Award of CoNCA (2016). == Publications == * 1971: El viatge prodigiós de Ferran Pinyol.

She developed an efficient and low cost method of measuring a medical dose of radiation. == Early life and education == Jafari was born in Daykundi, Afghanistan in 1977. Jafari and her family were forced to leave Afghanistan when war broke out, and at the age of six she spent six months travelling as a refugee to Iran. When she turned 14, her father told her she must marry her cousin. However, she managed to convince her parents and the cousin to cancel the marriage. This meant she could continue her education. Jafari completed her BSc in radiation technologiesSeveral references state that Jafari studied \\"radiology\\", but this is not correct. Radiology is a different discipline. Jafari is not a radiologist. at Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in 2000. After moving back to Afghanistan in 2003, Jafari taught in the Kabul Medical University. and completed a master's degree in radiation physics there while working. In 2010 she moved to the University of Surrey to study a master's in medical physics. In 2014 she appeared on Manoto, a Persian television network, discussing her career and education. In 2015 she became the first Afghan woman to earn a PhD in Medical Physics. She was awarded the Schlumberger Foundation Faculty for the Future award for her second year of studies. == Research and career == Jafari developed a string of tiny calibrated silica beads that can be used to measure radiation inside a patient's body. She demonstrated that the amount of radiation each bead receives can be measured using a simple thermoluminescence reader. The glass beads cost significantly less than contemporary Dosimeters and also address the dosimetric challenges of modern radiotherapy techniques. They ran proof-of-concept experiments at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth. She was inspired to create the beads because of the lack of cancer treatment in Afghanistan, where her father died prematurely of cancer. In 2016 Jafari became one of 15 women entrepreneurs to win a £50,000 Innovate UK Infocus Award. She is the founder and CTO of TRUEinvivo. A patent for her technology was granted in 2019. Jafari is part of the UK Sirius programme for graduate entrepreneurs. In 2018 Jafari featured in the SPIE Women in Optics planner. == Personal life == Jafari met her husband Ibrahim in 1998 and they have three children. She discovered she was pregnant with her third child a few days after learning that she herself had cancer.

She fled to Austria with her mother during World War II; her father and his family died at the Dachau concentration camp. She went on to study humanities at Hunter College in New York City. There she met a Spanish refugee Julio Andujar, whom she married in 1949 and whose last name she still maintains. Andujar moved to Brazil in 1956 to stay with her mother, Germaine Guye Haas. A project on the Karajá people in central Brazil led her to a career in photojournalism. Her work has appeared in various magazines, including Life, Look, Fortune, Aperture, Realidade and Claudia. She has documented the culture of the Yanomami over the years, including a book Yanomami: The House, The Forest, The Invisible published in 1998. The Yanomami had had little contact with the outside world. When a highway project through their territory led to a disastrous outbreak of measles, she suspended her photographic work to help bring medical aid to the Yanomami. During the 1980s, an influx of illegal gold miners into this region led to more health problems, including an outbreak of malaria and mercury poisoning. Twenty per cent of the Yanomami population died as a result. Andujar played an important role in establishing the Commission for the Creation of the Yanomami Park which led to the Brazilian government establishing a 96,000 km2 protected area for use by the Yanomami. Her work was supported by Guggenheim Fellowships in 1971 and 1977. Andujar's photographs are included in the collections of various museums including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the Eastman House in Rochester, New York. A gallery of the Inhotim museum in Brumadinho was built to display her work. Andujar received a Cultural Freedom Prize in 2000 for her work in portraying and aiding the Yanomani people. In 2008, she was named to the Brazilian Ordem do Mérito Cultural. In 2018, she received a Goethe Medal for her groundbreaking work with the Yanomami. == References  External links == *Claudia Andujar at Museum of Modern Art. * Gerhard Bissell, Andujar, Claudia, in: Allgemeines Künstlerlexikon (Artists of the World), Suppl.

Taylor's books include Ginseng, the Divine Root (Algonquin) and Soul of a People: The WPA Writers’ Project Uncovers Depression America (Wiley), which the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ranked among the Best Books of 2009. Taylor has written articles for the Washington Post, Smithsonian magazine, Science, Microbe, National Geographic, and Washingtonian. He has written scripts for National Geographic Channel, PBS, Discovery and Smithsonian Channels. ==Biography== Taylor's first book, Ginseng, the Divine Root, was published by Algonquin Books in June 2006. The Boston Globe called it \\"fantastic\\" and \\"one of those rare works that remind us what an endlessly surprising place the world is by revealing the drama concentrated in the past and present of one plant.\\" Library Journal dubbed it \\"a fascinating tour\\" from \\"a master storyteller,\\" and Publishers Weekly called it \\"an intelligent, wide- ranging account.\\" Taylor's second nonfiction book, Soul of a People: The WPA Writers’ Project Uncovers Depression America, published by Wiley & Sons in February 2009, was named an Amazon Book of the Month and a finalist in the Library of Virginia Literary Awards. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called the book \\"the place to start learning about that remarkable era\\" and ranked the book among the Best Books of 2009. According to the Southern Cultures reviewer, \\"The result of Taylor's curiosity is an accessible, straightforward glimpse into some of the most important American writers of the 1930s and 1940s. In the process of recounting their adventures, Taylor demonstrates how these writers shaped the way Americans tell their histories.\\" NPR featured the book on All Things Considered, and anthology editors Frank W. Thackeray and John E. Findling called Soul of a People “an entertaining and informative look at the U.S. writers who participated in this Depression era government project. Revealing about both the writers and the condition of the United States at that time.” Publishers Weekly called Taylor's 2012 collaboration with Mark Collins Jenkins, an illustrated National Geographic book about the War of 1812, \\"an engaging series of narratives filled with fascinating historical flotsam\\" and said the authors \\"seldom engage in cheerleading, offering instead a captivating story.\\" Taylor's 2018 book, Cork Wars: Intrigue and Industry in World War II, published by Johns Hopkins University Press, as Grady Harp wrote in the San Francisco Review of Books, \\"reads like a thriller … particularly timely as we step lightly though portents of possible similar corruption and conspiracy. Brilliant writing!” Historian Douglas Brinkley called Cork Wars \\"a marvelous history,\\" adding, \\"Taylor gives a vivid slice of life from that time that speaks to ours. A landmark achievement.\\" In the Washington Independent Review of Books Cathy Alter wrote, \\"As he demonstrated with his previous book, Ginseng, the Divine Root, Taylor has a knack for taking unsung heroes and elevating them to star status.\\" Alter called Soul of a People \\"a humane and seminal accounting of our country, not unlike Studs Terkel's Working.\\" Taylor writes articles for Smithsonian magazine and teaches in the Science Writing certificate program at Johns Hopkins University. ===Documentaries and television=== In the 1990s, Taylor began writing for television and documentary films. After writing for television series including Great Castles of Europe and the F.B.I. Files, he ventured into long- form documentary, serving as a creative consultant with Spark Media for the 2002 PBS documentary, Partners of the Heart, about racism and a pioneering partnership in medicine. Taylor was the lead writer and co-producer on the documentary film based on his book, Soul of a People: Writing America’s Story, which was broadcast on Smithsonian Channel in October 2009. Directed by Andrea Kalin and produced by Spark Media, the film garnered a Writer’s Guild of America nomination for best documentary (non-current affairs), and received a Cine Best of DC award. The view of the WPA experience of writers and artists during the Depression in Soul of a People provided a springboard for writers at the start of the 2020 COVID-19 shutdown to consider potential large-scale responses to the economic crisis. David Kipen in the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"a moving documentary,\\" and quoted Taylor on the contrasts with the present: “We could try different models like start-ups with an eye for what might come out of this crisis. … But it would likely have more private and philanthropic partners.” Taylor suggested the new version might create in newer mediums, like podcasts. Ryan Prior, writing for CNN Arts, noted the writers profiled in Soul of a People -- Richard Wright, Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison and Saul Bellow -- and the impact of the Federal Writers' Project on their later careers and on American culture. Prior noted the reaction given by Nelson Algren: \\"Had it not been for the Project, the suicide rate would have been much higher. It gave new life to people who had thought their lives were over.\\" In the Chicago Tribune, Chris Borrelli pointed out that President Franklin Roosevelt had established the WPA with an executive order, and that by the late 1930s about 75,000 Chicagoans were working for the federal agency. He quotes Taylor on how that provided a talent incubator that catalyzed Chicago as a cultural driver even after the Depression ended. “Because of temperament perhaps, because unemployment had hit Chicago hard, because of the range of talent, and because those just out of college who needed jobs were thrown alongside veteran artists out of work, Chicago enormously benefited,” Taylor said, those innovations fueled American culture for decades. ===Short fiction=== Taylor's short story collection, Success: Stories, received the 2008 Washington Writers Publishing House Award for Fiction. StorySouth wrote that the book's \\"fourteen superbly-crafted tales . . . explore the most vital crises of existence, when human emotions—desire and isolation, suspicion and jealousy—boil over, leaving in their wake exquisite failure and a conflict that blooms in complexity every time the reader revisits it.\\" Publishers Weekly wrote that Taylor's stories \\"uncover gentle irony in the commonly held notion of a successful life.\\" In Washington City Paper, Mark Athitakis wrote that Taylor’s skills included \\"tight, convincing dialogue, and an eye for apt metaphors within the places his characters inhabit.\\" Taylor's stories have appeared in literary journals including Gargoyle, Potomac Review, Jabberwock, Barrelhouse, and Rio Grande Review, and in the anthologies Stress City and Eclectica's Best Fiction. ==Personal life== Taylor was born in 1961 and grew up in Alexandria, VA. His father, William Taylor, was an army engineer felled by polio in his twenties in the early 1950s. He returned to work for the government after years of physical therapy. During David's early childhood, William Taylor worked at NASA on projects to track Soviet space plans, survey the moon's surface, and helped to design the lunar rover.Taylor, David A.

CHUM Chart.. CHUM Chart. ==History== The \\"Mid-Knights\\" band was formed and named in 1959 by saxophonist and poet James Leo Donoghue. His close friend from De La Salle “Oaklands” College, Toronto, George Semkiw, guitarist, joined him, followed by Jim Gwilliams on drums, and guitarist John McCanliss. Richard Hubbard later joined the band as vocalist. The band was popular and successful from the start, playing at dance halls in Toronto and surrounding towns. In 1961 Donoghue submitted a tape of the Mid-Knights playing ‘Summertime’ to jazz pianist Oscar Petersen’s ASCM (Advanced School of Contemporary Music) and won a partial scholarship. He quit Grade 13 at TCI (Thistletown Collegiate Institute) to attend the ASCM. At this time the \\"Mid-Knights\\" band was playing on weekends only as most of the musicians were still in high school. After a brief time at Petersen’s school, due to a lack of finances, Donoghue had to leave his band and the ASCM and join a Canadian band working full-time in Michigan. Under the stewardship of Semkiw the “Mid-Knights” band went on to ever increasing success, ultimately branding itself “Richie Knight and the Mid-Knights”, undergoing changes in musicians over the years. Donoghue’s poetry appears in Anvil Blood, York University, Edited by Irving Layton; also in the 1979 anthology Childhood and Youth in Canadian Literature, published by The Macmillan Company of Canada, Edited by M. G. Hesse, a resource book used in Canadian high schools during the 1980s. By late 1961 the \\"Mid-Knights\\" had added saxophonist Mike Brough, bassist Doug Chappell and drummer Barry Stein, comprising the lineup who would be featured on \\"Charlena\\".\\"Oh Charlena: 50 years and still going strong\\". Whitby This Week, July 15, 2013. The song was a cover of a 1961 single by the Los Angeles R&B; group The Sevilles, although the Mid-Knights' recording was significantly more successful. They were the first Canadian band to have a #1 hit on the Canadian charts. The band recorded the followup single \\"The Joke\\" in late 1963, following which Lloyd left the band and was replaced by Ray Reeves. The band released a number of further singles between 1963 and 1966, although none were as successful as \\"Charlena\\". Brough and Hubbard left the band in 1966, and were replaced by Richard Bell on keyboards and Richard Newell on vocals.\\"Bluesman made his mark\\". The Globe and Mail, June 16, 2003. They changed their name at this time to The Mid-Knights. Bell stayed with the band for only a short time before leaving to join Ronnie Hawkins's band. The band then added Dave Stilwell and Rick Cairns on trumpet, Jerry Shymansky on sax, Mark Smith on trombone and Bill Pinkerton on drums, recording one further single, \\"Soul Man\\", before Newell left in 1968 to join Hawkins's band. He was replaced by vocalists Frank Querci and Karen Titko; this final lineup recorded several songs, but none were released as singles before the band broke up.

On April 14, 1994 the wreck of the Niagara was added to the National Register of Historic Places. ==History== The Niagara (Official number 18714) was one of the large class of \\"outside\\" tugboats that were built for timber rafting on the Great Lakes. They were designed for the lumber industry which at the time was very large. She was built by the Detroit Dry Dock Company in 1872 as hull number #9. She was long, her beam was wide and she had a depth of . The vessel measured 276.87 gross tons and 183.05 net tons. The Niagara is significant because of her work in the Great Lakes lumber industry. In 1889 the Niagara was rebuilt and had a new engine and machinery installed. Her new engine was a 56-horsepower fore and aft compound steam engine that had bores of 24 inches and 44 inches by 36 inch stroke. The new engine was built by the Frontier Engine Works Company of Detroit, Michigan. Her new Scotch marine boiler -wide and -high, and it was built by Thomas McGregor of Detroit, Michigan. ==Final voyage== On the day of June 4, 1904 the Niagara was sailing from Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan to Duluth, Minnesota to tow some construction equipment owned by Hugo & Tims from Duluth, Minnesota To Lake Huron. She was sailing in heavy weather when she ran aground on Knife Island. The crew of the Niagara claimed that the reason for their grounding was that their compass failed because it started detecting magnetic anomalies on the shoreline. Her captain ordered her engine to be reversed, but the strong winds and heavy seas drove her onto the rocks. Huge waves began to pound the Niagara; she began to break apart quickly. Distress calls that were being sent by the Niagara were heard in a village at the mouth of Knife River. The village's telegraph operator telegraphed the town of Two Harbors, Minnesota to request assistance. The steel tug Edna G was sent to rescue her crew. She quickly arrived to assist the Niagara's crew. The Edna G rescued the eleven crewmen and two passengers that were aboard. The only person who sustained an injury was Mrs. A. Merritt who cut her hand on a piece of broken glass while she was escaping her cabin. On June 16, 1904 the Duluth Evening News reported that the Niagara was quickly stripped of her boiler, engine, machinery, and iron and steel work, then the pieces were placed the machinery in the Whitney Brother's dock in Duluth, Minnesota. ==Wreck of the Niagara== The wreck of the Niagara lies in four pieces on a rocky slope off Knife Island. The four sections of her hull include: her stem, her starboard side and keel, her port side and a detached section of her starboard side rail. There is no trace of her stern which means that either it was recovered during a salvage attempt, or it lies quite far away from the rest of the wreckage. There is also a small section of her deck is still attached to her port side. The Niagara is also a rare vessel because she is one of only two known rafting tugs in the Minnesota portion of Lake Superior, the other one being the Bob Anderson which was built in 1862. ==References== Category:1872 ships Category:Tugboats on the Great Lakes Category:Maritime incidents in 1904 Category:Shipwrecks of Lake Superior Category:Ships built in Detroit Category:Steamships of the United States Category:Shipwrecks on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lake County, Minnesota Category:Shipwrecks of the Minnesota coast ","title":"Niagara (tug)"},{"id":"56875196","text":"UGC 6093 is a barred spiral galaxy located approximately 500 million light years (or about 153 megaparsecs) away from Earth in the constellation of Leo.

She is known for her groundbreaking research on the atomic scale geometry and electronic structure of metal-oxide surfaces. == Early life and education == Ulrike Diebold was born on 12 December 1961 in Kapfenberg, Austria. She spent much of her high school years reading, skiing, and agonizing over what to major in at the university. She ultimately settled on engineering physics, an area with good job prospects that was also general enough to accommodate a variety of future directions. After completing her diploma in engineering physics (TU Vienna, 1986), she became increasingly enthusiastic about experimental physics while working on her Master's thesis, and ultimately completed a Doctor of Technology (Dr. techn.) in this area with Prof. Peter Varga (TU Vienna, 1990). == Career == Diebold's first appointment after graduation was as a post-doctoral research associate in the group of Theodore E. Madey in the Department of Physics at Rutgers University (1990-1993). It was there that she was first introduced to oxide surfaces, an area that she would later come to refer to as \\"the love of her scientific life\\". Her first faculty appointment followed, at Tulane University, New Orleans, USA, where she was an Assistant Professor (1993-1999), Associate Professor (1999-2001), and Professor of Physics (2001-2009), and also an Adjunct Professor of Chemistry (1993-2009). During this time period, she also completed her habilitation in Experimental Physics (TU Vienna, 1998), held the Yahoo! Founder Chair in Science and Engineering (2006-2009), and was the Associate Department Chair (2002-2009). In 2005, Diebold and her group were forced to temporarily evacuate from New Orleans, which experienced massive flooding and power outages from the impact of Hurricane Katrina. They were hosted by the group of Theodore E. Madey at Rutgers University during this challenging period. In 2010 she moved to the Institute of Applied Physics at TU Wien where she is currently a Professor of Surface Science and Deputy Department Head, and retains the title of Research Professor at Tulane University. == Research == Ulrike Diebold is well known for her influential work in the fields of surface science, materials and physical chemistry, and condensed matter physics. In particular, she has contributed greatly to the understanding of atomic-scale surface structure and electronic surface structure of metal oxides. For her work, she mainly employs Ultra-high vacuum technology and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. == Awards and honors == In 2013, Diebold was the sole recipient of Austria's highest research award across all disciplines, the Wittgenstein Award.

Appendix 5 They developed the theory of homogeneous axisymmetric turbulence based on Howard P. Robertson's work on isotropic turbulence using an invariant principle.Robertson, H. P. (1940, April). The invariant theory of isotropic turbulence. In Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (Vol. 36, No. 2, pp. 209–223). Cambridge University Press. This equation is an extension of Kármán–Howarth equation from isotropic to axisymmetric turbulence. ==Mathematical description== The theory is based on the principle that the statistical properties are invariant for rotations about a particular direction \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda} (say), and reflections in planes containing \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda} and perpendicular to \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda}. This type of axisymmetry is sometimes referred to as strong axisymmetry or axisymmetry in the strong sense, opposed to weak axisymmetry, where reflections in planes perpendicular to \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda} or planes containing \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda} are not allowed.Lindborg, E. (1995). Kinematics of homogeneous axisymmetric tubulence. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 302, 179-201. Let the two-point correlation for homogeneous turbulence be :R_{ij}(\\\\mathbf{r},t) = \\\\overline{u_i(\\\\mathbf{x},t)u_j(\\\\mathbf{x}+\\\\mathbf{r},t)}. A single scalar describes this correlation tensor in isotropic turbulence, whereas, it turns out for axisymmetric turbulence, two scalar functions are enough to uniquely specify the correlation tensor. In fact, Batchelor was unable to express the correlation tensor in terms of two scalar functions, but ended up with four scalar functions, nevertheless, Chandrasekhar showed that it could be expressed with only two scalar functions by expressing the solenoidal axisymmetric tensor as the curl of a general axisymmetric skew tensor (reflectionally non-invariant tensor). Let \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda} be the unit vector which defines the axis of symmetry of the flow, then we have two scalar variables, \\\\mathbf{r}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}=r^2 and \\\\mathbf{r}\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda}=r\\\\mu. Since \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda}=1, it is clear that \\\\mu represents the cosine of the angle between \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda} and \\\\mathbf{r}. Let Q_1(r,\\\\mu,t) and Q_2(r,\\\\mu,t) be the two scalar functions that describes the correlation function, then the most general axisymmetric tensor which is solenoidal (incompressible) is given by, :R_{ij} = Ar_ir_j + B\\\\delta_{ij} + C\\\\lambda_i\\\\lambda_j + D \\\\left (\\\\lambda_i r_j + r_i \\\\lambda_j \\\\right ) where : \\\\begin{align} A &= \\\\left (D_r-D_{\\\\mu\\\\mu} \\\\right )Q_1+ D_r Q_2, \\\\\\\\\\\\ B &= \\\\left [- \\\\left (r^2D_r+r\\\\mu D_\\\\mu+2 \\\\right )+r^2 \\\\left (1-\\\\mu^2 \\\\right )D_{\\\\mu\\\\mu}-r\\\\mu D_\\\\mu \\\\right ]Q_1 - \\\\left [r^2 \\\\left (1-\\\\mu^2 \\\\right )D_r+1 \\\\right ]Q_2, \\\\\\\\\\\\ C &= -r^2 D_{\\\\mu\\\\mu}Q_1 + \\\\left (r^2 D_r+1 \\\\right )Q_2, \\\\\\\\\\\\ D &= \\\\left (r\\\\mu D_\\\\mu +1 \\\\right )D_\\\\mu Q_1 - r\\\\mu D_r Q_2. \\\\end{align} The differential operators appearing in the above expressions are defined as :\\\\begin{align} D_r &= \\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial r} - \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{r^2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial \\\\mu}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ D_\\\\mu &= \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial \\\\mu}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ D_{\\\\mu\\\\mu} &= D_\\\\mu D_\\\\mu = \\\\frac{1}{r^2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 }{\\\\partial \\\\mu^2}. \\\\end{align} Then the evolution equations (equivalent form of Kármán–Howarth equation) for the two scalar functions are given by :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial Q_1}{\\\\partial t} &= 2 u\\\\Delta Q_1 + S_1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\partial Q_2}{\\\\partial t} &= 2 u \\\\left (\\\\Delta Q_2 + 2 D_{\\\\mu\\\\mu} Q_1 \\\\right ) + S_2 \\\\end{align} where u is the kinematic viscosity and :\\\\Delta = \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial r^2} + \\\\frac{4}{r}\\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial r} + \\\\frac{1-\\\\mu^2}{r^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 }{\\\\partial \\\\mu^2} - \\\\frac{4\\\\mu}{r^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial \\\\mu}. The scalar functions S_1(r,\\\\mu,t) and S_2(r,\\\\mu,t) are related to triply correlated tensor S_{ij}, exactly the same way Q_1(r,\\\\mu,t) and Q_2(r,\\\\mu,t) are related to the two point correlated tensor R_{ij}. The triply correlated tensor is : S_{ij} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r_k} \\\\left( \\\\overline{u_i(\\\\mathbf{x},t) u_k(\\\\mathbf{x},t)u_j(\\\\mathbf{x}+\\\\mathbf{r},t)}-\\\\overline{u_i(\\\\mathbf{x},t) u_k(\\\\mathbf{x}+\\\\mathbf{r},t)u_j(\\\\mathbf{x}+\\\\mathbf{r},t)}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\overline{\\\\partial p(\\\\mathbf{x},t) u_j(\\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\mathbf{r},t)}}{\\\\partial r_i} - \\\\frac{\\\\overline{\\\\partial p(\\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\mathbf{r},t) u_i(\\\\mathbf{x},t)}}{\\\\partial r_j} \\\\right). Here \\\\rho is the density of the fluid. ==Properties== * The trace of the correlation tensor reduces to ::R_{ii} =r^2 \\\\left (1-\\\\mu^2 \\\\right ) \\\\left (D_{\\\\mu\\\\mu}Q_1-D_rQ_2 \\\\right )-2Q_2-2 \\\\left (r^2D_r+2r\\\\mu D_\\\\mu +3 \\\\right )Q_1. * The homogeneity condition R_{ij}(-\\\\mathbf{r})=R_{ji}(\\\\mathbf{r}) implies that both Q_1 and Q_2 are even functions of r and r\\\\mu. ==Decay of the turbulence== During decay, if we neglect the triple correlation scalars, then the equations reduce to axially symmetric five-dimensional heat equations, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial Q_1}{\\\\partial t} &= 2 u\\\\Delta Q_1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\partial Q_2}{\\\\partial t} &= 2 u \\\\left ( \\\\Delta Q_2 + 2 D_{\\\\mu\\\\mu} Q_1 \\\\right ) \\\\end{align} Solutions to these five-dimensional heat equation was solved by Chandrasekhar.

He was previously the defensive line coach of the Denver Broncos from 2012 to 2014. ==Playing career== Rodgers attended Indiana University Bloomington, where he played quarterback for the Indiana Hoosiers football team from 1996 to 1998. In 1999, he transferred to Missouri State. ==Coaching careerDenver Broncos=== After spending 2009–2011 as an assistant coach, Rodgers was promoted to defensive line coach following former coach Wayne Nunnely's retirement after three years with the Broncos. In 2012, the Broncos went 13–3 and won the AFC West for the second year in a row. They would go on to lose in the Divisional round to the Baltimore Ravens 38–35. Under Rodgers' coaching, defensive end Elvis Dumervil made the Pro Bowl. During the 2013 offseason, the Broncos drafted defensive lineman Sylvester Williams & Quanterus Smith in the 1st (28th pick) and 5th (146th pick) rounds of the 2013 NFL Draft. In 2013 the Broncos went 13–3 again and won the AFC West for the third consecutive year. They would go on to Super Bowl XLVIII and lost to the Seattle Seahawks 43–8. Prior to the 2014 season, the Broncos signed defensive end DeMarcus Ware. That year, the Broncos went 12–4 and won the AFC West for the fourth time. They would go on to lose in the Divisional Round against the Indianapolis Colts 24–13. Ware would make the Pro Bowl under Rodgers' tutelage. After this season, head coach John Fox was fired and his staff was laid off. ===Chicago Bears=== On January 25, 2015, the Chicago Bears named Rodgers the defensive line coach, reuniting with Fox who had been named their head coach. In his first season with the Bears, they went 6–10 and missed the playoffs, though nose tackle Eddie Goldman made the 2015 All-Rookie team. During the 2016 offseason, the Bears drafted defensive end Jonathan Bullard in the third round (72nd pick) of the 2016 NFL Draft and added Roy Robertson-Harris as an undrafted free agent. They also re-signed Mitch Unrein and added Akiem Hicks, but let Jarvis Jenkins go to the New York Jets. During the 2016 season, the Bears went 3–13, the franchise's worst record since the NFL expanded to 16 games. During the 2017 season, the Bears went 5–11, missed the playoffs, and Fox was fired. After Matt Nagy was named the new head coach of the Bears, he elected to keep defensive coordinator Vic Fangio and his staff. In the 2018 NFL Draft, the Bears drafted defensive lineman Bilal Nichols and Kylie Fitts in the 5th (145th pick) and 6th (181st pick) respectively. In 2018, the Bears went 12–4, the first winning season since 2012 and playoff appearance since 2010. Under Rodgers, defensive end Akiem Hicks made the 2019 Pro Bowl, the first defensive end from the Bears to do so since Julius Peppers in 2012. Rodgers received the John Teerlinck Award as the best defensive line coach in the NFL; the 2018 Bears line helped the defense lead the league in categories like rushing yards allowed per game (80) and points allowed per game (17.7). During the 2019 offseason, Fangio left the Bears to become the head coach of the Denver Broncos and he was replaced by former Indianapolis head coach Chuck Pagano. Robertson-Harris was also re-signed. ==Personal life== His brother Jeff is also an NFL coach; the two worked together on the Bears with Jeff as special teams coordinator until 2017.

In the digital advertising age, it refers to a new targeting tool for digital marketing, first initiated by Facebook, which helps to reach potential customers online who are likely to share similar interests and behaviors with existing customers. Since Facebook debuted this feature in 2013, additional advertising platforms have followed suit, including Google Ads, Outbrain, Taboola, LinkedIn Ads and others. == Considerations == Lookalike audiences anatomize existing customers and their user profiles to find the commonalities between the existing audience. This helps to find highly-qualified customers who previously would have been difficult to identify and reach. This expands the potential audience in different countries and applies to new differentiated audience segments; This approach saves time and lowers advertising costs for the acquisition of a new audience. In order to be effective, a lookalike audience seed needs to be homogeneous. This is commonly achieved using a consistent behavioral pattern. The homogeneity of the lookalike seed has a greater influence on the audience's effectiveness than the size of this sample group. In Facebook, the minimal lookalike seed size is 100 users from the same country. Facebook generally recommends creating a seed from an audience of 1,000 to 50,000 users. Lookalike audiences might have limited effects on small companies or startups because of the small sample size of their existing audience, which would inevitably lead to insufficient data drawn from the current audience and interference from outliers. Namely, there would be no high bounce rate with these companies' websites. == Examples of seeds == Marketers use many data sources to create lookalike seeds. Some examples of eCommerce lookalike seeds include: * CRM-based – A seed based on an email or phone number list of customers who have had a past interaction with the business. This can be further segmented, for example customers with the highest lifetime value or past purchases of a specific product. * Conversion- based – A seed based on users that have performed an action such as a Purchase or Lead form submission on the website. * Engagement-based – A seed based on users segmented by their engagement, such as pages viewed, time spent on the site, video views, etc. ==Methodology== Facebook, as an example, takes three steps to build a lookalike audience: * Choose the audience seed to build a lookalike audience from. This can range from page fans, visitors to the website, and customer lists etc. Generally the base audience should be composed of a minimum of 500 people. Larger pools will increase the accuracy of the lookalike audience. * Choose the specific location (country or region) to find a similar audience in. *Customize the audience size. Facebook offers a range of percentiles from 1% to 10%, indicating the size of the combined population of the locations selected. Larger audiences provide a wider reach, but a smaller lookalike audience is more targeted, which means ads are seen by fewer people, but they are likely to be better aligned to the features of the audience's seed. ==Debate== One study has shown that the tool of lookalike audiences, to some degrees, does well in generally advertising results. It is also listed as an important trend of pay-per-click (PPC) by Delhi School of Internet Marketing. However, debates over such a third party behavioral targeting being used for digital marketing hasn't stopped either, because using the data of customers is against online privacy settings. In 2019, limitations were put in place by Facebook to stop discriminatory targeting of audiences according to zip code, income levels and demographics (age and gender). ==References== Category:Digital marketing ","title":"Lookalike audience"},{"id":"56875409","text":"Cheena Marie Lo is a poet working in Oakland, California, and a graduate of Mills College.

He and was influenced by the compassion and wisdoms bequeathed to him by his great- grandmother, whom he knew personally and who survived the end of slavery. He earned a bachelor's degree, studying journalism, from University of Louisiana in Monroe. After graduating Jackson moved to Flint, Michigan in and began working on a newspaper there. == Career == Jackson moved to New York in 1990 with hopes of becoming an actor. He became frustrated with the roles available to him and began playwriting to create the roles he was looking for. The first time he incorporated gay characters into his writing was in his plays, unpacking the characters as part of communities and relatable rather than a stereotypical trope. His plays were performed and read at Nuyorican Poets Cafe, La Mama, Barnes and Noble and Theatre for the New City. Jackson has written for New York Magazine, Paper Magazine, The London Observer, Nylon Magazine and various publications about art and contemporary culture. He gleans inspiration from everyday things. He began writing novels in order to \\"cut out the middle man\\" and have direct impact and trust with his audience. Inspired by Jackson's great-grandmother's rural Southern experience, he wrote his first novel in 1997, at age 29, The View From Here (1997), which was set in 1950s Mississippi. It was compared to Alice Walker's The Color Purple and translated to French and a best seller in South Africa. Walking Through Mirrors (1998), Jackson's second novel, is about a Black photographer returning to his home in Louisiana from New York. Jackson wrote his The Queen of Harlem, before the Harlem's redevelopment about a man who reclaims his Black identity. It was on the artist Kehinde Wiley's ten favorite books in 2016. == Awards == Jackson's first novel was completed with a fellowship from Art Matters Foundation and it won the American Library Association Black Caucus' First Fiction Award. He won a fellowship from the Millay Colony of the Arts. == Personal life == When Jackson moved to New York he was a model for ACT UP. Jackson has spent extensive time traveling the world. He has visited over forty-eight states and twenty-five countries, inspired by the idea that his brown skin might blend in better in other countries than in America, with its racially tumultuous past. He lived in Beijing for four years and Tunisia. Jackson often writes essays for the monographs of his dear friend, artist Kehinde Wiley. He is a frequent collaborator and supporter of artists. == Bibliography == ;Monographs *Jackson, Brian Keith. The Queen of Harlem. New York : Harlem Moon, 2003. *Jackson, Brian Keith.

Two variants of the class have been ordered, totaling twelve ships. ==Equinox 740== Algoma Equinox, the lead ship of the Equinox class, moored in Toronto The Equinox 740 is named after their length, the maximum that clears the dimensions of the locks in the Welland Canal and Saint Lawrence River. Algoma Central began designing the Equinox class in the early 2010s in conjunction with Finnish engineering group Deltamarin. The ships were developed from Deltamarin's B.Delta design, albeit heavily modified according to Algoma Central's requirements. Elements such as a more modern main engine and a newer hull design gave an estimated 45% increase in energy efficiency compared to Algoma Central's then-current fleet, and the first exhaust scrubber system installed on a Great Lakes freighter was installed to allow the ships to burn fuel oil while meeting sulfur dioxide emissions regulations. The ships measure long, with a beam of and a draft of . They have a deadweight tonnage of 38,540 and a gross tonnage of 23,895. They have a cargo capacity of in five holds. Shipboard power and propulsion systems are built by Wärtsilä, which supplied a five cylinder RT-flex50 main engine with an output of about for propulsion and three 6L20 engines, with output of about each, driving generators for electrical power. Algoma Central ordered six of the ships, two gearless vessels that require shore facilities to discharge cargo and four self- unloaders, from the Chinese Nantong Mingde shipyard at a cost of CA$300 million. Two further gearless ships were ordered by the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB), with a plan for Algoma Central to operate them. The lead ship of the class, , was delivered in late 2013 and entered service at the beginning of the 2014 shipping season. She was followed later in the year by Algoma Harvester, the second of Algoma Central's gearless ships, and the first Canadian Wheat Board vessel, eventually named G3 Marquis and owned by CWB successor G3, but Nantong Mingde went bankrupt in the middle of the order. When the shipyard shut down, the second CWB ship, CWB Strongfield, was nearly completed and the first of Algoma Central's self-unloaders was under construction. CWB Strongfield was purchased at auction in January 2017 by Algoma Central and renamed Algoma Strongfield before undergoing final fitting out at the Jiangsu Yangzijiang Group shipyard. After several months of work, she was released from the shipyard in April and entered service in June. The incomplete hulk of the self-unloading ship was also purchased at auction by Algoma Central and transferred to Jiangsu Yangzijiang for completion. Named Algoma Conveyor, she was delivered from the shipyard in February 2019 to begin service following her arrival on the Great Lakes in April. Following Nantong Mingde's bankruptcy, Algoma Central ordered two Equinox 740 self-unloaders from Jiangsu Yangzijiang. The first of the ships, Algoma Niagara, was delivered in September 2017 and entered service several months later after her voyage from China. The second, Algoma Sault, arrived in Canada early in the 2018 shipping season. In January 2015, Algoma Central ordered three Equinox 740 self-unloaders from Croatian shipbuilder Uljanik, scheduled for delivery in 2018, though the schedule later slipped to late 2018 and early 2019. They are equipped with unloading booms mounted at the bow of the ship, in contrast to the conventional location at the aft end of the cargo holds, which gives operators added flexibility in unloading cargo. The majority of the ship's power systems are identical to the Chinese-built ships, though the main engine, while still an RT-flex50 model, is built by Winterthur Gas & Diesel. In October 2018, Algoma Central canceled the orders at Uljanik, citing severe delays in their construction as the shipyard faced major financial difficulties. ==Equinox 650== Algoma Central ordered two Equinox 650 self- unloaders, named for their length, from Uljanik in April 2015. They are identical in most other characteristics to Equinox 740 vessels, particularly the Croatian-built ones with which they share the unloading boom-forward design, although the shorter length gives them a lower cargo capacity, with a deadweight tonnage of 24,900. The first ship in the class, named Algoma Innovator, was delivered in December 2017, though she was not scheduled to depart the shipyard until February 2018 in order to avoid the most severe weather in the North Atlantic on her delivery voyage. She was to be followed later in the year by sister ship Algoma Endurance, though in light of Uljanik's financial situation and delays in construction the order for Algoma Endurance was cancelled in September 2018. The hull of Algoma Endurance remained incomplete at Uljanik's 3. Maj shipyard until September 2019, when construction resumed under the auspices of an independent 3. Maj after Uljanik was liquidated. The ship, renamed Algoma Intrepid, was delivered in September 2020. ==References== Category:Ship classes Category:Algoma Central Marine Category:2010s ships + ","title":"Equinox-class freighter"},{"id":"56875781","text":"Victor Eduardovich Matizen (; born February 19, 1949, Leningrad, USSR) is a Soviet and Russian film criticКраткий курс паратеории советского кино, president of the Russian Guild of Film Critics (2003-2011)Сайт Гильдии киноведов и кинокритиков России , chairman of the Council of Film Award White Elephant, curator of the site of the Guild kinopressa.ru.

It generally corresponds to the present-day Malabar Coast of Kerala. == Extent == According to the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (53:17:15-27), Limyrike began at Naura and Tyndis; Ptolemy (7.1.8) mentions only Tyndis as its starting point. The region probably ended at Kanyakumari; it thus roughly corresponds to the present-day Malabar Coast. ==History== Pliny the elder mentioned that this region was prone by piratesBostock, John (1855). \\"26 (Voyages to India)\\".

Assuming possible phonetic connection between the words \\"Damir-\\" and \\"Tamil\\" (the language of Limyrikê), some modern scholars have wrongly used the term \\"Damirice\\" (or \\"Damirica\\") to describe Limyrikê. Wilfred Harvey Schoff's 1912 translation of the Periplus wrongly uses the term \\"Damirica\\" instead of \\"Limyrikê\\", because of which the error has been reproduced by several scholars relying on this faulty translation. Actually, the \\"Damirice\\" of Tabula Peutingeriana is over a thousand miles from Limyrikê. == References  Bibliography === * Category:Periplus of the Erythraean Sea Category:Historical Indian regions Category:Malabar Coast Category:Tamilakam ","title":"Limyrike"},{"id":"56875883","text":"is a song recorded by Japanese singer-songwriter Noriyuki Makihara.

The hotel, located in the Ermita district of Manila, was filled with foreign tourists at the time of the fire who were mostly able to evacuate through the hotel's fire exits. The fire, burning on the lower floors of the hotel, sent smoke upward and trapped some employees and guests as it spread throughout the complex. ==Fire== The fire began in the morning hours when many of the guests were awake, enabling evacuation efforts.Fire rescue operations worked to save several dozen guests from the rooftop of the hotel as smoke chased guests upward. Over 300 guests were evacuated from the hotel safely, and firefighters were dually challenged by heavy winds and huge quantities of smoke as they attempted to extinguish the blaze. 19 people were believed trapped on the fifth floor by fire officials, who worked for hours determining a safe way to free them. Employees could be seen fleeing from the building covering their mouths with handkerchiefs to block out the thick smoke as fire burned around the second and lower floors. The fire caused at least 6 fatalities and sent 23 people to the hospital as it raged for over 9 hours. The fire was burning intensely throughout the 2nd and lower floors, creating a challenge for Philippine fire experts to initially identify the origin of the inferno. Firefighters reported that several floors of the hotel were \\"totally damaged\\" but the investigation was still incomplete at that time. It was reported that the fire rekindled past 11 am, on 20 March but was soon re- extinguished. ==Aftermath== Officials initially stated that 4 people were killed by smoke inhalation. The death toll decreased to three as Manila Doctors Hospital reported one of those believed dead from smoke inhalation was revived in critical condition, but increased to 6 as more victims were found or died. At least 3 fatalities occurred when casino employees, including security, were trapped by smoke in the casino's treasury room, with the final count in the building ending at 5. The hotel's casino operator, the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp., stated that 3 of their employees had died and two closed-circuit television operators were missing. Director of Manila Disaster Risk and Reduction Management Johnny Yu later gave a figure of 5 fatalities to the press. The director announced the fire's sixth fatality on March 21, an employee of the hotel's casino who had been in critical condition since the fire.

With local jails flooded, Camp Greyhound was established to \\"get the criminals off the streets\\" (Burl Cain, Warden of Camp Greyhound) prior to reconstruction. ==Operation == The construction of Camp Greyhound by the Louisiana Department of CorrectionsBrandon L. Garrett & Tania Tetlow, Criminal Justice Collapse: The Constitution After Hurricane Katrina, 56 Duke Law Journal 127-178 (2006) was one of the top priorities in the rebuilding of New Orleans.Marina Sideris, Amnesty Working Group: Amnesty for Prisoners of Katrina. Report of the Critical Resistance, 2007, pages 8-12 Sixteen cages of chain-link fencing and topped with razor wire were erected at the bus stop under the canopies to house up to 700 people. Work was done by prisoners from the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola under the direction of Burl Cain. Most suspects had been arrested for looting, others for curfew violation, vehicle theft, intoxication, or resisting arrest. By September 8, nine inmates had been incarcerated for attempted murder. An outdoor cage could hold about 45 people. There was no furniture and inmates had to sleep on the asphalt ground of the bus station without mattresses and had to use an open portable toilet. Food consisted of military issued meals. The facility was fully lit at night with electric power being generated by an Amtrak engine running 24 hours. Inmates were guarded by officers from the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. At least five mercenary companies were enlisted to round up \\"prisoners\\" and keep the jail running. On the Outside, the camp was protected by the National Guard. The jail had a processing center where inmates were photographed and fingerprinted. The single public defender was not able to offer individual advice; the only option was to plead guilty and agree to community service, or to be sent to a permanent facility and wait a minimum of 21 days for further processing. In the latter case inmates were bussed to permanent facilities. Apparently the first inmates were placed into the facility on Monday, September 5, 2005. Clad in prison-orange they were not allowed to notify relatives or lawyers, - no phone calls were permitted. A report by the Washington Times from September 9, 2005 indicated that over 220 people suspected of looting were at Camp Greyhound at that time. Camp Greyhound operated for about six weeks or two months. == Denial of constitutional rights == The collapse of the judicial system after the hurricane affected people who were held at Camp Greyhound. About 1,200 people, mostly African-Americans, passed through the jail and regular judicial proceedings were not followed violating habeas corpus rights. By the end of its operation, exaggerated reports of unrest, looting, and violence started to be revised and retracted. Indeed, a small number of NOPD officers were reported to have participated in the looting. A number of reports emerged indicating innocent people being incarcerated for a prolonged time; first at Camp Greyhound and then transferred to outside prisons. James Terry was arrested for \\"looting\\" his own apartment. He spent time at Camp Greyhound then at a permanent jail without ever having had access to a lawyer, being charged with a crime, or having a court hearing before his eventual release seven months later. Pedro Parra –Sanchez went through Camp Greyhound on October 13, 2005 and disappeared in the penal system for 13 months. Abdulrahman Zeitoun's Kafkaesque case was documented in the eponymous book by David Eggers. He was released after one month, while his companions were held five, six, and eight months more, - all without due process. Another inmate, Ashton O'Dwyer, an attorney, claimed that he was pepper-sprayed and shot with beanbag rounds while in custody. He was never charged with a crime and his lawsuit regarding his incarceration was unsuccessful. In contrast, a jury later awarded $650,000 to two tourists who had been caught in the system. In 2009, Dan Berger argued that journalistic routines and uncritical reporting by the media \\"legitimated punishment as disaster policy\\" and \\"suggested militarized policing and imprisonment as fundamental to restore order\\". In 2011, James Fox from the New Statesman opined that Camp Greyhound was \\"known for organized brutality, a little-known, near-exact facsimile of Guantanamo Bay\\". == References == New Orleans Category:2005 in Louisiana Hurricane Category:Parish jails in Louisiana ","title":"Camp Greyhound"},{"id":"56876742","text":"The 1969 World Table Tennis Championships – Women's Doubles was the 29th edition of the women's doubles championship.

Born in Manchester, Gorman worked in a factory from an early age. He became involved in the socialist movement when he was eighteen, and two years later joined both the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE). For some time, he also held membership of the Independent Labour Party. Early in the 1900s, Gorman moved to Salford, where he was rapidly elected as assistant secretary of his branch of the ASE. He was also elected as a delegate to the union's conferences in 1907, 1912, 1915 and 1917. But he was most prominent in the union as a member of its Final Appeal Court, which considered the cases of members who had broken union rules. In order to prepare for the position, he studied the history of the union and its forerunners, and obtained copies of union rules of which its general office was unaware. In 1917, Gorman began working full-time for the union as its Manchester Local Delegate, and the following year became its Organising District Delegate. From 1911 until 1925, he also served as a delegate to the Manchester and Salford Trades Council. Gorman was elected to Salford City Council for St Thomas' ward in 1918, serving for three years. He was then elected in a 1923 by-election in Weaste ward, and became known for his campaign for the city to form a civic choir, but lost the seat in 1925. Gorman stood in Salford South at the 1918 United Kingdom general election, taking a distant second place, with 19.0% of the vote. He represented the Labour Party, but was sponsored by the British Socialist Party, successor of the SDF, and ran a very left-wing campaign. At the 1922 United Kingdom general election, he again stood for the Labour Party, but this time in Plymouth Drake, where he replaced Prospective Parliamentary Candidate William Henry Watkins, who had fallen out with the local party. Gorman was sponsored by the Amalgamated Engineering Union, successor of the ASE, and took 31.4% of the vote. By 1932, Gorman was resident in Higher Crumpsall in Manchester, and was elected to Manchester City Council that year. He was selected as the Labour Party candidate for Northwich in 1937, but although an election was expected in 1939 or 1940, it was not held due to World War II, and Gorman never contested the seat. He retired from his trade union posts in 1939, and became a Labour Supply Officer for the council during the war. Suffering from poor health, he retired from the council in 1947, and died three years later. ==References== Category:1874 births Category:1950 deaths Category:Councillors in Manchester Category:Councillors in Greater Manchester Category:Trade unionists from Manchester Category:Labour Party (UK) councillors Category:Labour Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:Politicians from Manchester Category:Social Democratic Federation members Category:British Socialist Party members ","title":"James Gorman (politician)"},{"id":"56876878","text":"The Jens Nielsen House, at 192 W. 200 South in Ephraim, Utah, is a pair-house built around 1870.

It has one or two linear leaves at its base and up to seven yellow flowers with brown markings. Only about fifty plants survive in grassy forest near Kempsey. ==Description== Diuris disposita is a tuberous, perennial herb with usually only one linear leaf long and wide. Between two and seven yellow flowers with brown markings, wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal projects forward and is egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear to sword-shaped, green and brownish, long, about wide, turned downwards and parallel to, or crossed over each other. The petals are more or less erect, spread apart from each other with an elliptic to egg- shaped blade long and wide on a green stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped, wide and the side lobes are linear to oblong, long and about wide. There are two ridge-like calli about long near the base of the mid-line of the base of the labellum. Flowering occurs in September and October. ==Taxonomy and naming== Diuris disposita was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected near north-west of Kempsey and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (disposita) is a Latin word meaning \\"distributed\\" or \\"arranged\\", referring to the widely spaced flowers on the flowering stem. ==Distribution and habitat== The Macleay River doubletail grows in grassy open forest near the Macleay River north-west of Kempsey. ==Conservation== Diuris disposita is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the New South Wales Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. The main threats to the species are illegal collecting, habitat destruction and inappropriate fire regimes. Fewer than fifty plants are known, none in a conservation reserve. ==References== disposita Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Plants described in 1991 ","title":"Diuris disposita"},{"id":"56877042","text":"In fluid dynamics, Prandtl–Batchelor theorem states that if in a two- dimensional laminar flow at high Reynolds number closed streamlines occur, then the vorticity in the closed streamline region must be a constant. The theorem is named after Ludwig Prandtl and George Batchelor. Prandtl in his celebrated 1904 paper stated this theorem in arguments,Prandtl, L. (1904). Über Flussigkeitsbewegung bei sehr kleiner Reibung. Verhandl. III, Internat. Math.-Kong., Heidelberg, Teubner, Leipzig, 1904, 484–491. George Batchelor unaware of this work proved the theorem in 1956.Batchelor, G. K. (1956). On steady laminar flow with closed streamlines at large Reynolds number. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 1(2), 177–190.Davidson, P. A. (2016). Introduction to magnetohydrodynamics (Vol. 55). Cambridge university press. Interestingly, the problem was also studied in the same year by Richard Feynman and Paco LagerstromFeynman, R. P., & Lagerstrom, P. A. (1956). Remarks on high Reynolds number flows in finite domains. In Proc. IX International Congress on Applied Mechanics (Vol. 3, pp. 342-343). and by W.W. Wood in 1957Wood, W. W. (1957). Boundary layers whose streamlines are closed. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 2(1), 77-87.. ==Mathematical proof== At high Reynolds numbers, Euler equations reduce to solving a problem for stream function, : abla^2\\\\psi = - \\\\omega(\\\\psi), \\\\quad \\\\psi=\\\\psi_o \\\\text{ on } \\\\partial D. As it stands, the problem is ill-posed since the vorticity distribution \\\\omega(\\\\psi) can have infinite number of possibilities, all of which satisfies the equation and the boundary condition. This is not true if the streamlines are not closed, in which case, every streamline can be traced back to infinity, where \\\\omega(\\\\psi) is known. The problem is only when closed streamlines occur inside the flow at high Reynolds number, where \\\\omega(\\\\psi) is not uniquely defined. The theorem exactly addresses this issue. The vorticity equation in two-dimension reduces to :\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot abla\\\\mathbf{\\\\omega} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{Re}} abla^2\\\\omega. where even though the Reynolds number is very large, we keep the viscous term for now. Let us integrate this equation over some surface S enclosed by a closed contour C in the region where we have closed streamlines. The convective term gives zero contour since C is taken to be one of those closed streamlines. Then, we have :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{Re}}\\\\int_C abla\\\\omega \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{n}\\\\ ds = 0 where \\\\mathbf{n} is the unit normal to C with small element ds. This expression is true for finite but large Reynolds number since we did not neglect the viscous term before. In the above expression, \\\\omega eq \\\\omega(\\\\psi) since this is not the inviscid limit. But for large \\\\mathrm{Re} but finite, we can write \\\\omega=\\\\omega(\\\\psi) + \\\\rm{small\\\\ corrections}, and this small corrections become smaller and smaller as we increase the Reynolds number. Neglecting these corrections, : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{Re}}\\\\int_C abla\\\\omega \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{n}\\\\ ds = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{Re}}\\\\int_C \\\\frac{d\\\\omega}{d\\\\psi} abla\\\\psi \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{n}\\\\ ds = 0. But d\\\\omega/d\\\\psi is constant for any streamlines, and that can be pulled out of the integral, :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{Re}}\\\\frac{d\\\\omega}{d\\\\psi}\\\\int_C abla\\\\psi \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{n}\\\\ ds = 0. We also known the circulation in these closed streamline is non-zero, i.e., :\\\\Gamma = -\\\\int_C abla\\\\psi \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{n} ds. Therefore, we have :\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma}{\\\\mathrm{Re}}\\\\frac{d\\\\omega}{d\\\\psi} = 0. The only way this can satisfied for finite \\\\mathrm{Re} is if and if only :\\\\frac{d\\\\omega}{d\\\\psi} = 0, i.e., vorticity is not changing across these closed streamlines, thus proving the theorem. Of course, the theorem is not valid inside the boundary layer regime. This theorem cannot be derived from the Euler equationsLagerstrom, P. A. (1975).

Issue 9, Apr 2003 ===Postwar to present=== In 1946, a metals testing laboratory was installed. In 1965, the ENP became the State Technical High School (Lycée technique d'état, LTE), with classes ranging from technical qualifications to preparatory classes for the grandes écoles. The school responded to the needs of local industry, but also to the evolution of society, and in 1968 welcomed its first female students. The school was completely refurbished by the Regional Council between 1992 and 2000, and in 2013 the Regional Council had the building's woodwork renovated. Since 2010, in partnership with the Regional Council, the Direction régionale des affaires culturelles, and the art gallery Le Creux de l'Enfer, the school has hosted artists-in-residence. The artists benefit from the facilities and technical skills of the school and the students gain first-hand experience of the conception and production of artwork. Since around the turn of the millennium, the school has also hosted an art exhibition.Isabelle Barnérias. La Gazette. 1 Dec 2011 There is also a teacher-led culture and design workshop and a cinema club which participates in national and regional projects and competitions. ==Location and architecture== Overlooking the town of Thiers, between the mountainous terrain of the Livradois (fr) and the Limagne plain, the high school is hard to miss, with its white colour and 1930s style. The school contributes to the industrial landscape in which it lies, and it, like the town, is open to new perspectives on the marriage of industry, art and craftsmanship. The school is located on rue Jean-Zay (which gives it its name), near the corridor linking Thiers to Vichy. At the time of its construction it was relatively far from the town centre, but since the 1960s many residences have been constructed in the area. It is a few minutes on foot from the Lycée Montdory, specialising in academic subjects more than technical ones, and the Collège Audembron, the town's middle school. The lycée professionel, Lycée Germaine-Tillon, is located further away in the lower part of the town, and complements Jean Zay's expertise in vocational and industrial skills. ==Ranking== In 2017, the high school was ranked 8th out of 21 in Puy- de-Dôme for teaching quality, and 663rd in the country. The ranking was based on three criteria: baccalauréat pass rate, proportion of students in the penultimate year who obtained their baccalauréat having spent the last two years at the school, and valeur ajoutée (\\"value added\\", based on the social backgrounds, ages, and brevet results of the students). == Bibliography == * Publications of Le cercle d'études de la 2e guerre mondiale Thiers et sa région chaired by Réné Dumont : Le bulletin du cercle, issues 5, 9, 16, 18 and 23. * Thiers three volumes by Georges Therre et Jacques Ytournel, collected in « Mémoire en Images », ed.

They differed primarily in their engines. ==Design and development== Members of the Lublin Airport Club (Lubelski Klub Lotnitczy in Polish, hence LKL) began to design a pair of parasol wing, two-seat aircraft for the Club's use in 1931. They differed chiefly in their engines and the lengths and the cowlings associated with them, though there were also undercarriage design variations. The LKL IV had a aircooled, four-cylinder upright inline engine and was first flown in the autumn of 1932. The LKL V was powered by a Warner Scarab seven-cylinder radial engine and flew a few weeks later. The wooden wing was rectangular in plan out to rounded tips and was in two parts, each built around twin spars and fabric covered. They were braced by pairs of parallel faired struts from the lower fuselage longerons to the spars and the central join was held above the fuselage on a cabane of steel transverse inverted V-struts. Because the Cirrus was an upright engine, its enclosing cowling raised the nose ahead of the cockpit, though the underside sloped upwards. A long exhaust on the port side exited low on the fuselage under the wing. The radial Scarab of the LKL V allowed a lower nose; its cylinders were enclosed by a Townend ring-type housing. Because of the more compact radial, the LKL V was shorter than the LKL IV and was also had a slightly lower () empty weight. Its greater power allowed an increase of () in the loaded weight. Fuel tanks were in the fuselage. Behind the engines the fuselages were rectangular in section, built around welded steel tube structures and largely fabric-covered. There were two tandem open cockpits with dual controls under the wing, which had a rounded cut-out in its trailing edge. Their tail surfaces were fabric-covered wooden framed structures. The tailplanes were mounted on top of the slender rear fuselage and strut-braced from below and their fins were small, with a cropped triangular profile and carrying full, rounded balanced rudders. Both had divided-type, fixed, conventional landing gear with half-axles and with radius rods from the lower fuselage longerons. There were differences in the forward, shock absorbing legs; the LKL IV had oleo struts from the upper longerons and the LKL V had faired, compressed rubber legs from the bases of the forward wing struts. In 1934 the LKL IV's undercarriage was shortened, though without changing the geometry. ==Operational history== Both aircraft were used by the LKL for several years and flown in local competitions. Both took part in the second International Aviation meeting held in Warsaw in May 1933 where Zygmunt Martiniak flew the LKL IV into second place and in the Fifth National Lightplane Contest that September, where the LKL V, flown by Kolaxzkowski, came ninth. The LKL V continued to fly until autumn 1936. ==Variants== ;LKL IV: Cirrus III engine ;LKL V: Warner Scarab engine ==Specifications (LKL IV) References== Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:1930s Polish civil utility aircraft ","title":"LKL IV"},{"id":"56877181","text":"Lin Meiqun (born 1948 in Indonesia) also known as Lin Mei Chun is a former international table tennis player from China. ==Table tennis career== She won three silver medals in the World Table Tennis Championships.

There was a need however for a work covering all the monasteries of the Congregation.Monasticon Gallicanum, 1870, vol 1 (text only); preface (Google Books) Dom Michel Germain, a monk at the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés and a friend of Jean Mabillon, undertook the task. From 1675 he wrote individual historical texts about, and commissioned the accompanying plates of, all the Maurist monasteries, but although by the time of his death in 1694 the plates had been engraved and most of the texts written, the work did not proceed to publication. The texts remained in manuscript, in the form of booklets and loose leaves. Over time they became disordered and some were lost; those surviving eventually found their way to the Bibliothèque nationale de France.BNF Archives et manuscrits: Latin 11818-11821 Matériaux du Monasticon gallicanum de Dom Germain As for the engravings, which Dom Germain commissioned from several different unknown engravers, a small number of prints were made at the time, which circulated loose, and the copper plates were then dispersed without trace. A very few sets were assembled and bound by different individuals from 1694 through the 18th century; these however included various additional prints foreign to the set. ==Publication 1870-71== Achille Peigné-Delacourt, an antiquary and collector of mediaeval documents, realised the importance of Germain's illustrations, since so many of the original buildings had been lost in the interval. In 1860 he published reproductions of the engravings relating to the monasteries in the province of Reims, with the promise to publish the complete set of the engravings after taking care to remove the other illustrations that had been added to them by the various amateur collectors who had preserved them. The task of verifying which engravings were genuinely among those commissioned by Germain was undertaken by Louis Courajod, archivist and palaeographer attached to the Department of Prints and Photographs of the Bibliothèque Nationale (then the Bibliothèque Impériale) for the complete edition of the illustrations of the Monasticon Gallicanum published in 1870-71, which successfully reproduced the prints at half-size without losing sharpness of detail.

The software was designed specifically to foster academic discussions within the classroom.http://www.schoolnet.org.za/conference/sessions/nh/WB_Research.pdf An online learning extension named Decisions, Decisions Online was also created. ==Gameplay== Each game puts the players (recommended to be a classroom) into a scenario based on actual facts and encourages them to come up with solutions. An example is in the title Decisions, Decisions: Prejudice, in which the players take the role of the mayor of a tourist town, in which a newspaper has editorialised against a business trading racial memorabilia. Students discuss the problem in teams, then enter their strategies into the computer, which advances the story, leading to 300 alternate paths. Members of the team receive booklets from the perspective of an adviser to the decision maker, for instance in Decisions, Decisions: The Environment, they could be a campaign manager, and environmentalist, a scientist, and an economist; players then debate this conflicting information to reach a justifiable compromise.

The town of Bodø was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 January 1938, a part of the neighboring municipality of Bodin (population: 559) was transferred into the town of Bodø. On 1 January 1959, another part of Bodin (population: 1,303) was transferred into the town Bodø, expanding its size considerably. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1968, the town of Bodø (population: 14,252) was merged with the municipality of Bodin (population: 13,323) and this created the much larger Bodø Municipality. ===Toponymy=== The town is named after the old Bodøgård farm (), since the town was built on its ground.

Despite its location just north of the Arctic Circle, Bodø features a Subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc), with chilly (but not cold) winters and cool summers. Snow cover during winter varies and is often sparse in the city center, but only slightly inland the snow cover is much more reliable.

It would have been vital in the build-up of NATO air and land forces to defend Norway, and thus the entire northern flank of NATO, in a war with the Warsaw Pact. It could also have been used as a forward base for American bombers to strike targets in the Soviet Union. Now Bodin Leir is an camp to house military personnel for The Norwegian Joint Headquarters and Bodø Main Air Station. Bodø has a street named General Fleischer's Gate in honour of Carl Gustav Fleischer. Bodø received international attention during the U-2 Crisis in May 1960, when it became known that the American U-2 pilot Gary Powers had been shot down over the Soviet Union on his way from Pakistan to Bodø. ==Culture== Norwegian Aviation Museum Bodø's local newspaper is the Avisa Nordland. The Norwegian Aviation Museum and Salten Museum are located in Bodø. Salten Museum has four exhibitions: The Lofoten Fisheries, a Sami exhibit, a Viking treasure, and an exhibition about Bodø's history from 1816 to 2000. The Bodø Cathedral was built in 1956, representing post-war architecture, whereas the Bodin Church just outside the city centre dates from the 13th century, representing a typical medieval stone church. Other churches in the town include Hunstad Church and Rønvik Church. The new cultural centre \\"Stormen\\" (the storm) was opened in 2014. It contains a library, a concert hall and theater. The building is designed by Daniel Rosbottom and David Howarth. Bodø is host to the cultural festivals Nordland Musikkfestuke and Parkenfestivalen every summer, as well as the free and volunteer based Bodø Hardcore Festival in early winter. Fram Kino was the first cinema in Norway. It was started in the year 1908. ==Sports== Bodø's main professional team is the football club Bodø/Glimt, playing in Eliteserien, the top division of football in Norway. In addition to Bodø/Glimt, Bodø has had several teams at national top level, including Grand Bodø (women's football), Junkeren (women's handball) and Bodø HK (men's handball). The most well-known sporting arena in Bodø is Aspmyra Stadion, which in addition to being the home of Bodø/Glimt has hosted one international match. Also, the multi-purpose indoor Bodø Spektrum, contains full-size football and handball courts, as well as several swimming and bathing facilities. The town is also home of Bodø Barbarians, a leading rugby league team. ==See also== *List of towns and cities in Norway ==References== Category:Bodø Category:Cities and towns in Norway Category:Populated places in Nordland Category:Port cities and towns in Norway Category:Populated places of Arctic Norway Category:1816 establishments in Norway ","title":"Bodø (town)"},{"id":"56877454","text":"Wie Lijie () also known as Wei Li-Chieh is a former international table tennis player from China. ==Table tennis career== She won a silver medal at the 1977 World Table Tennis Championships in the women's doubles with Zhu Xiangyun. ==See also== * List of table tennis players * List of World Table Tennis Championships medalists ==References== Category:Living people Category:Chinese female table tennis players Category:Table tennis players from Beijing Category:World Table Tennis Championships medalists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Wei Lijie (table tennis)"},{"id":"56877473","text":"Francis Reynolds may refer to: * Francis Reynolds (law professor) (born 1932), professor of law at the University of Oxford * Francis Reynolds (priest) (died 1852), Archdeacon of Bombay * Francis Esmond Reynolds (1882–1967), British pathologist and medical author ","title":"Francis Reynolds"},{"id":"56877515","text":"Personk is a 1978 video game, and the debut work of Tom Snyder, who would later release many educational series under Tom Snyder Productions. ==Development== Snyder is an educator and video game developer.

It houses more than 20,000 pairs of salt and pepper shakers from all over the world. There is also a sister museum in El Castell de Guadalest, Alicante, Spain, which displays another 20,000 pairs. The museum was founded in 2002 by Andrea Ludden, a Belgian archaeologist. Her stated goal was to show the creativity of all the artists that have crafted an everyday item into a myriad of shapes and materials. ==History== Andrea started collecting pepper mills in 1984 and soon, salt and pepper shakers became the focus of her collection. In 2002, the museum opened in Cosby, Tennessee before moving to Winery Square, in Gatlinburg, Tennessee in 2005. According to Food Network's Unwrapped TV program, over 20,000 people have visited the museum in 2005. In May 2010, Andrea opened a sister museum \\"Museo de Saleros y Pimenteros\\" in El Castell de Guadalest, Alicante, Spain. ==Organization and purpose== The galleries consist of many display cases which exhibit the shakers in categories: Christmas, Plastic, Americana, Amish, Wood, Vegetables, Transportation, Chefs, Foods, Drinks, Chickens, Cows, Cats and Dogs, Wild Animals, Marine, Characters, Souvenirs, Asian, Glass, Metals and Delft. The shakers are also organized by material and color, and if a particular set comes in more than one color, these are included to show all the possibilities. There is a section dedicated to Morton Salt Company, which explains how shakers came to be, thanks to Morton's invention that helps salt not clump together. Before shakers, salt was stored in salt cellars, which are also displayed in the collection. The museum also includes more than 1500 Pepper Mills. The museums have both an entertainment and educational purpose. As Andrea Ludden said: \\"All my effort is to show the 20s, the 40s, the 60s, etc, how civilization can change, you see it through the salt and pepper shakers\\". The museum is often visited by art students as well as home schoolers. The museum is also a dog-friendly establishment. The museum is often consulted to settle the question of How many holes for Salt or Pepper? ==In the media== The two museums are often in the media. The fact that such a mundane item can be both utilitarian and decorative has inspired many artists to create beautiful, unusual, comical, and yet practical shakers. What surprises visitors and reviewers alike, is that once the amazing variety is revealed, they can never be taken for granted again. * The museum was featured in 2006 in the Food Network's Unwrapped with Marc Summers, Episode 1402. * Rob Wilds interviewed Andrea for the TV program Tennessee Crossroads. * The museums are often featured in various top 10 strangest or unusual museums lists, such as Travel and Leisure, CNN Travel, Saturday Evening Post, El Mundo, Vanity Fair, etc. * On July 18, 2009 the museum was mentioned in a skit on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon (NBC). * For the opening of the museum in Spain, Andrea was interviewed on the Valencian TV station Canal Nou. * In 2012, the museum appeared in the Smithsonian Magazine online. * Also in 2012, the museum was featured in the book \\"Harriet Beamer Takes the Bus\\", by Joyce MagninHarriet Beamer Takes the Bus, Joyce Magnin, Zondervan, 2012, , 9780310333562.

The nerve lesions in these people show dissemination in space with an otherwise normal neurological examination and without historical accounts of typical MS symptoms. MRI findings that are consistent with multiple sclerosis have been observed in healthy people who underwent MRI scanning, and 50% go on to develop symptomatic MS, sometimes with a primary progressive course. This condition was first characterized in 2009. ==Diagnosis== The criteria for an RIS diagnosis are as follows: #The presence of incidental MRI findings in the CNS white matter: ##Ovoid and well-circumscribed homogeneous foci, with or without involvement of the corpus callosum ##T2 hyperintensities larger than 3 mm in diameter, which fulfill at least 3 of the 4 Barkhof MRI criteria for DIS ##The CNS abnormalities are not consistent with a vascular condition #No historical accounts of clinical symptoms consistent with neurological dysfunction. #MRI anomalies do not account for apparent impairment in social, occupational, or generalized areas of functioning. #MRI anomalies are not due to substance abuse, such as recreational drug use, toxic exposure, or a prior known medical condition. #Exclusion of a differential diagnosis of leukoaraiosis, or extensive white matter pathology excluding the corpus callosum. #MRI anomalies of the CNS are not accounted for by another disease. ===Discovery=== RIS is discovered when an MRI scan is performed for other reasons. The most common symptom that led to the incidental discovery of RIS is headache. Other common reasons are trauma, psychiatric disorders, and endocrinological disorders. ==Management== Currently, routine clinical follow- up and MRI neuroimaging surveillance is the standard by which patients are observed. While treatment of MS disease modifying therapies have been given to some individuals with RIS, the majority opt for active surveillance and the appearance of clinical symptoms before commencing treatment, as treatment is considered controversial. ==Prognosis== In a 5 year study, clinical events, which refers to the first symptoms of exacerbations, clinical attacks, flare ups, or severe symptoms, indicative of MS, appeared in 34% of individuals. Of those who developed symptoms, 9.6% fulfilled criteria for primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). ==Epidemiology== Due to the incidental nature of RIS, exact figures on prevalence is unknown, though it has been suggested that RIS is the most common type of asymptomatic MS. The prevalence may be higher in relatives of patients with MS. One study, at a university hospital that is located in a high region of MS disease incidence, put the disease prevalence at approximately 1 in 2000. An earlier study in 1961 of 15,644 autopsies found 12 cases (0.08%) of unexpected MS findings without a previous history of MS symptoms.Georgi W. Multiple sclerosis. Anatomopathological findings of multiple sclerosis in diseases not clinically diagnosed. Schweiz Med Wochenschr 1961; 91: 605–607. (German) The mean age of first indication of RIS from 451 patients is 37.2 years. == RIS in children == Though rare, some children that have had MRI scans for reasons unrelated to MS have shown signs of RIS. The most common reason for an initial MRI in these children was a headache. The first occurrence of a clinical event characteristic of MS in nearly half of the children examined was 2 years, though in a majority of cases, 'radiologic evolution', i.e. the increase in the number of size of lesions as detected in subsequent MRI, developed after one year. The presence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF and spinal cord lesions were associated with an increased risk of a first clinical event characteristic of MS. It was found that children with RIS had a substantial risk of subsequent clinical symptoms and/or radiologic evolution. ==Research directions== Current studies have been noted as being short in study duration; longer prospective studies, tracking the development of potential disease progression over a longer period of time are warranted. This will ensure the current criteria in RIS is satisfactory and whether consideration should be given to treating individuals with RIS on current MS medication. ==Etymology== The acronym RIS was coined in 2009 by Okuda and colleagues. Siva and colleagues suggested an alternate name, radiologically uncovered asymptomatic possible inflammatory-demyelinating disease (RAPIDD). ==References== Category:Neurological disorders Category:Multiple sclerosis Category:Syndromes affecting the nervous system Category:Rare syndromes ","title":"Radiologically isolated syndrome"},{"id":"56877660","text":"The Search Series is a five-game series of educational video games by Tom Snyder Productions and published by McGraw-Hill Education in 1980. It runs on either Apple II or Radio Shack Models I and III. ==Development== In the late 1970s, Snyder had bought a Radio Shack computer and began designing educational simulations on it. He hired a consultant for $500 a day to observe whether his creations had value. The consultant saw something special and won Snyder a contract McGraw-Hill, who bought all five packages immediately, forming The Search Series. Snyder went on the road in 1981 to promote the series. ===Educational goals=== The series exemplified Snyder's philosophy of keeping learning in the foreground of the gaming experience and encouraging players (recommended within the classroom) to work together in teams. The content was specifically designed to connect with curricula. An example of the aplot is Geography Search, which simulates Christopher Columbus's discovery of the New World. Teams make navigational decisions based on information that is provided by and managed from the software. ==Gameplay== Players are given scenarios, then (ideally) divide up into teams to choose the next move their defending their position. They input their decisions into the simulation which then triggers the next stage. ==Titles== * Geography Search * Geology Search * Energy Search * Community Search * Archaeology Search == Reception == Educational Values and Cognitive Instruction felt Geography Search was an excellent example of a computer-based situated learning environment based on a microworld. InfoWorld was impressed with the software, and deemed them a great way to explore simulations. In a piece for CNN, Henry F. Olds believed that the series had great power to stimulate students' thinking and problem- solving. Diagnostic Monitoring of Skill and Knowledge Acquisition felt that Geography Search was the \\"most ingenious\\" computer-based system for teaching history. The book Building Intelligent Interactive Tutors felt that as an open-ended learning environment (OLE), the software did not interact directly with the player and help them to manage the environment.

The novel's African-American protagonist, David Champlain, was born into the poverty and Jim Crow justice of Depression- era New Orleans. His father was lynched by a white mob and he was raised by his grandparents. David himself is brilliant and lucky and is graduated from a Midwestern college, then Harvard Law School, then Oxford. David and a white woman, Sara Kent, fall in love, but David fears for their future as a mixed- race couple in America. David chooses to practice international law and serve abroad as a diplomat. But the death – perhaps murder – of his grandfather brings David back to New Orleans, where he is plunged into the turmoil of the Civil Rights Movement and takes a leadership role. Tragedy ensues. Fairbairn's experience managing the national and international tours of jazz clarinetist George Lewis provided the background and impetus for writing this, her first novel. The book title comes from the biblical story of David and Goliath; chapter 17 verse 40 of the First Book of Samuel says: \\"Then he [David] took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine [Goliath].\\" Five Smooth Stones, of epic length (more than 900 pages), was a Literary Guild selection in 1967.

In 2015 he was honored as the Paralympic Austrian Sports Personality of the Year (). == Biography == Born in Helfenberg, Upper Austria in 1987, Mayrhofer had been snowboarding since childhood. He worked as an electrician until an accident in February 2008, when he guiltless touched a 6000-volt power line, causing serious injury on his right upper leg, left forearm and right hand. On his right hand the thumb and parts of the middle finger needs to be amputated. After several unsuccessful attempts to reconstruct the function of his left hand Mayrhofer decides to amputate his left hand. His surgeon Dr. Oskar Aszmann from the University of Vienna worked close together with the prosthesis technology company Ottobock. So Mayrhofer became the first patient in the world to undergo elective amputation. His left hand was amputated around below the elbow in July 2010. After this, he was fitted with a groundbreaking prosthesis, known as a \\"Michelangelo Hand\\", The elective amputation allows Mayrhofer to control the prosthesis in the same way as non-amputees do: EMG electrodes in the prosthesis detect muscle signals within the lower arm which can be used for prosthesis control. He can open bottles, tie shoelaces and brush his teeth within a short period of time. After the amputation, he worked closely with Ottobock's R&D; department giving feedback to the engineers; in 2013 he joined the company as a product specialist in upper limb prosthesis. == Paralympic sport == Visiting a prosthetics trade show in 2012, Mayrhofer saw a stall run by the Austrian Paralympic Committee, which led to him deciding to pursue para-snowboarding. At the 2015 World Para Snowboard World Championships at La Molina, Spain, Mayrhofer won the gold medal in the Banked Slalom and came fifth in snowboard cross. In the 2018 Winter Paralympics, he competed in both snowboarding events, coming fifth in snowboard cross on 12 March but then winning the silver medal in Banked Slalom four days later. At the 2019 World Para Snowboard World Championships at Pyhä, Finland, Mayrhofer won the silver medal in the Banked Slalom. === Competition history === { class=\\"sortable \\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Date ! scope=\\"col\\"  Location ! scope=\\"col\\"  Competition ! scope=\\"col\\"  Placing ! scope=\\"col\\"  Discipline ! scope=\\"col\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Best time ! scope=\\"col\\" class=unsortable Ref -

In his senior season with the Bulldogs in 2012–13, Laganière was a focal part of the offense, placing third amongst Yale in contributing with 15 goals and 29 points in 37 games, to help the Bulldogs advance to the Frozen Four and capture the college's first NCAA Division 1 Championship title. On April 17, 2013, as a coveted free agent, Laganière agreed to a one-year, entry-level contract with the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League. In his first professional season after attending the Ducks 2013 training camp he was assigned to American Hockey League primary affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals for the duration of the 2013–14 campaign. He established himself as a regular for Norfolk appearing in 72 games for 10 goals and 18 points. On July 18, 2014, he agreed to a one-year, two-way extension to remain with the Ducks. In his second season assigned to the Norfolk Admirals in 2014–15, Laganière increased his offensive output with 14 goals and 21 points in 73 games. As an restricted free agent from the Ducks, Laganière was not signed to another NHL contract by the Ducks, however remained in the organization by agreeing to an AHL contract with inaugural affiliate, the San Diego Gulls on July 8, 2015. After concluding his first season with San Diego in 2015–16 and having again increased his contribution within the team, Laganière agreed to return for his fourth season within the Ducks organization in signing a one-year extension with the Gulls on September 8, 2016. During the 2016–17 season, Laganière made his 200th appearance in the AHL, and established a career high of 21 goals and 16 assists for 37 points in 64 games. As a free agent in the off-season, Laganière ended his association with the Ducks in opting to pursue a career abroad by signing a one-year contract with Finnish club, Ässät Pori of the Liiga on August 28, 2017. In the 2017–18 season, Laganière made a quick transition to the Finnish game, leading the club with 17 goals and placing second with 35 points in 57 games. Having progressed through the Wild Card round, he was unable to help Ässät progress past the qualifying round in a 4-1 series defeat to Oulun Kärpät, contributing with 4 points in 7 games. Laganière left Finland after one season, opting to continue his European career in Germany, securing a one-year deal with the Straubing Tigers of the DEL on June 6, 2018. ==Career statistics== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

On 18 January 2018, it left the island of Nonouti carrying 88 passengers. Bound for Betio, the ferry was planned to make the voyage in two days. According to survivors the overloaded ferry broke in half and sank. The ferry was reported missing on the 19th. On 26 January, Kiribati notified authorities in Fiji and New Zealand who, along with multiple fishing vessels, searched the areas surrounding the ferry's planned path. Australia and the US joined in the aerial search in the days that followed. Two days later, a Royal New Zealand Air Force Orion patrol plane spotted a wooden dinghy containing seven passengers of the Butiraoi who were then rescued by a nearby fishing vessel. The aerial search was called off on 1 February, with some fishing vessels continuing the search. No further passengers were found. ==Investigation== The ship's owner, Kirennang Tokiteba, in an interview with Michael Morrah, blamed the captain for running the ship aground a few days prior to the sinking, damaging the ship's propeller shaft. A survey done to assess the damage to the ship had found several problems with the ship, and stated that the ship was not to carry passengers. Tokiteba told Morrah that the captain defied those orders, boarding 88 people, including 5 crew members, despite the fact that during normal operations, the ship's maximum capacity was 69 passengers. The ship was also carrying of coconuts, well in excess of cargo limits. The Kiribati maritime director was placed in charge of completing the official report, initially expected for late February to early March. However, on 14 March 2018, the Kiribati government asked for help from New Zealand, who sent over three investigators from the New Zealand Transport Accident Investigation Commission. ==Obstruction of foreign journalists== Following the sinking, the Kiribati government was criticiszed for purposefully obstructing foreign journalists who came to report on the incident. A team from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation was told by the Kiribati government they were not welcome and Newshub journalist Michael Morrah had his passport confiscated upon his arrival in the country. Morrah's team, after recording interviews with survivors, was interrogated by immigration officials and forced to delete the footage of the interview. ==See also== *2009 Kiribati ferry accident A similar accident taking place nine years previously, that involved an I-Kiribati ferry. ==References== Category:Maritime incidents in 2018 Category:2018 in Kiribati Category:Censorship in Oceania Category:Maritime incidents in Kiribati Category:January 2018 events in Oceania ","title":"MV Butiraoi"},{"id":"56877866","text":"Haunted USA is an American paranormal television series that premiered on October 8, 2017 in the United States on the Travel Channel.

As of 2018, at 86, Daines is also likely the last surviving federal judge appointed during that administration, and continues practicing law more than 60 years after his service as commissioner. == Background == Following Alaska being granted statehood in 1958, Daines resigned to pursue private practice. He would later serve as a district attorney in Cache County, Utah, and as a professor of water law and ethics at Utah State University. == Professional career  Early career (1955–1967) === A year after Daines' appointment to deputy commissioner in 1955, he was appointed as the commissioner, and served in that capacity until 1958 when Alaska was granted statehood. Daines resigned in 1958 to start a private law practice, and ran unsuccessfully as a Republican candidate for one of the eleven new State House of Representative seats for Anchorage, coming in third among Republican candidates. All eleven Anchorage seats in the first State House of Representatives were won by Democrats in a statewide landslide. Following the passing of his father in 1959, Daines returned to Logan, Utah, to take over his father's law practice. He ran successfully for district attorney for Utah's First Judicial District in a primary contest against the incumbent Republican. He was uncontested in the general election and took office in January, 1961. He served in that capacity until 1967, when in the middle of his second, uncontested four-year term as district attorney, he resigned to join the faculty at USU as a tenured professor of business law. === Academic career (1967–2006) === In 1969, as associate professor at USU, he began service in USAID's War on Hunger program as a water law and institutions specialist and also became USU's first professor of water law. Much of that service was in the Andean Region where he organized and directed the Andean Water Law Seminar of 1974, principally authored \\"Water Legislation in The Andean Pact Countries\\" 1974, consulted in drafting the 1974 Ecuador Water Code, designed and directed a survey of over 100 water-user organizations in four Andean countries, and served on the commission for the development of an international river between Ecuador and Peru. His work in the War on Hunger program also included serving as a member of the organizing committee of the first Global Water Law Systems conference in Valencia, Spain in 1975. He co- authored and co-presented \\"Water Law and Administration in The United States of America\\" for the conference. In the early 1980s he authored and directed the production of an irrigation training audio/video series at USU. == Bibliography == Daines, David Rainey; Gonzalo, Falconi (1974).

His father was born in the same town in 1802, and his mother was born in Glocester, Rhode Island in 1803. In 1833 his parents moved from Warren to Bristol, Rhode Island, where Nathan received his education in the district school. At the age of seventeen he was apprenticed to the sail-making business with T. & B. T. Cranston, and two years later, on the retirement of both members of that firm, he, with George E. Cranston, took over the business. In 1850 he engaged as an engraver with Smith, Dewey & Eddy of Warren, in the manufacture of jewelry.Officers of the Volunteer Army and Navy who served in the Civil War, published by L.R. Hamersly & Co., 1893, 419 pgs. ===Civil War service=== In 1861 he was a brigadier-general in the Rhode Island Militia, and soon after the attack on Fort Sumter, he offered his services to Governor William Sprague of Rhode Island, to serve in any position given to him for the preservation of the Union. He soon after organized a company of volunteers in Bristol, which, with members from Warren, were called the Bristol County Company. As captain of this company, which became Company G, Second Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry, he was mustered into the United States service on June 6, 1861 for three years. He fought in the first Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861; the regiment was later assigned to the Army of the Potomac, participating in its many engagements. On July 24, 1862, he was promoted to be the major (third in command) of the 2nd Rhode Island and, on December 12, 1862, was promoted to lieutenant-colonel (second in command). In December 1863, by permission from the War Department, he appeared before General Casey's Board of Examination in Washington, and passed an examination for lieutenant-colonel with a rating of \\"first class\\". On December 31 he was assigned as the lieutenant colonel of the 22nd United States Colored Infantry and ordered to Yorktown, Virginia. Afterwards his new regiment became a part of the Army of the James. In February 1864 he was presented by the citizens of Warren a sword, belt, sash, and other accouterments. At the Battle of Petersburg, Virginia on June 15, 1864, he was severely wounded and taken to Chesapeake Hospital in Hampton, Virginia. In October 1864, on the recommendation of his brigade and division commanders, he was promoted to the rank of colonel, and assigned to the command of the 37th United States Colored Infantry. He assumed command on November 10, 1864. Being detached from the Army of the James, he joined the expedition of Major General Benjamin F. Butler against Fort Fisher, North Carolina, also participating in the second expedition under Major General Alfred H. Terry, and fought in the capture of the fort. He fought in all subsequent engagements of the Army of the James in North Carolina until the surrender of General Joseph Johnston's army to General William T. Sherman, at Raleigh, North Carolina in late April 1865. In May 1865, Goff was assigned to the command of the post of Wilmington, North Carolina, and remained on duty in that state, the troops of his command occupying the forts on the coasts of North and South Carolina, being in temporary command of the District of Wilmington and Department of North Carolina. In June 1865, by recommendation of Major-General Charles J. Paine and Brigadier-General John W. Ames, his division and brigade commanders, he was promoted by the President to be brigadier-general of volunteers by brevet, \\"for long and faithful services and gallant conduct in the field\\". He was assigned on November 3, 1866, as president of a general court-martial at Raleigh, North Carolina, and, though his regiment was mustered out in February 1867, he was retained in the service as president of general court-martial till June 13, 1867, when he was honorably discharged, being among the last volunteer officers mustered out of service. ===Post war=== Upon returning to Rhode Island, he returned to his former occupation in Providence. He later became a Companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and was assigned insignia number 3148. His talents, character, and public services caused him to be greatly respected by his fellow citizens. On August 10, 1870, he was appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant as deputy collector of customs for the port of Providence, a position which he held for more than twenty years. Politically, he was a Whig and a Republican. In his religious practice he was a Baptist. He died in Warren on April 17, 1903 and is buried with his two wives on the South Burial Ground in that town. Nathan Goff at FindAGrave.com ==Family== General Goff married his first wife, Sarah S. Surgens (b. 1827) of Warren, in November, 1849. By her he had three children - Ella S., Walter I., and Mabel D. Sarah died on October 13, 1888. He later married Helen M. Surgens (b. 1840), of Boston, Massachusetts.

Though the trade of contraband was lucrative throughout Europe, it was especially so in France and contributed to national tensions. While tobacco was commonly smuggled, common items such as salt and calico were carried across provincial borders to avoid high taxes. The smuggling trade was very profitable, and it allowed families to increase their income while subverting corrupt tax farmers. The prevalence of smuggling and the economic motivations surrounding the trade helped lead France towards revolution. ==Economic factors== Several economic factors contributed to the prevalence of smuggling in the second half of the eighteenth century. Of the twenty-six million people in France, twenty-one million worked within the agricultural sector.Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2007. 31-32. However, most peasants who owned land held less than twenty acres, enough to support a single family. France strongly relied on its agricultural sector, and this over dependence left the population susceptible to droughts and other natural disasters. Urban peasants faced similar problems, as most of Paris’s population served as manual workers. The census of 1791 revealed that there were 118,784 paupers, unskilled laborers, and beggars in Paris, about a quarter of the population.Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution 29-30. Therefore, most of the urban and rural populations were limited to lower-class occupations. There was also economic disparity between the sexes, as a male servant might earn 90 livres a year while a woman earned only 35-50 livres.Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution 31. Peasants dedicated half of their household income to food, leaving little money for other expenses. ==Foreign trade== Despite this wealth inequality, French foreign trade was widely successful until the beginning of the revolution, as the sugar trade in the West Indies brought great wealth to France’s elite. The monarchy capitalized on this wealth by imposing trade monopolies with its Caribbean colonies. However, the Eden Treaty with England of May 1787 hindered the French manufacturing sector, as the agreement lowered internal tariffs on English goods.Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution 34. This trade agreement outraged French merchants because they couldn’t compete with British prices. Such trade agreements contributed to poverty within France and encouraged illicit economic activity. Smuggling within France was an extremely lucrative business due to high demand for expensive products, specifically tobacco, salt, and calico. Smugglers devised means of subverting the authorities. For example, female smugglers would often stuff salt into their dresses. Smugglers also trained dogs to carry salt, though no records exist on their prevalence or incarceration rates.Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution. 64. In addition, many smuggling bands formed; French authorities were aware of at least 38 large smuggling bands in the second half of the eighteenth century.Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2013. 19. As indirect taxes were uniform throughout France, certain provinces charged vastly more for some items. For example, 49 kilos of salt cost 31 sous in Brittany but 591 sous in Anjoy.Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution. 39. Crossing the Loire River, which separated the two territories, became a common means of transporting contraband. Salt smuggling was particularly problematic for the authorities, as smugglers abused the gabelle, or salt tax. Many provinces mandated that every citizen buy at least seven pounds of salt per year.McCarthy, Justin Huntly. The French Revolution, Volume 1. Nabu Press, 2010. 368. This salt could only be used for cooking, so many would have been required to buy more. As a result, many relied on purchasing contraband salt to escape these heavy fines. Calico was also a popular contraband item, as the French prized genuine Indian calico. Although calico’s prohibition ended in 1759, calico’s taxation remained high enough to justify smuggling.Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. 19. France’s public monopoly and internal tax system also upset foreigners. Irish lawmaker Edmund Burke stated that the system was “unwisely, with being ill-contrived, [and] oppressive.”Hampsher-Monk, Iain. The Impact of the French Revolution: Texts from Britain in the 1790s. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2005. 99-100. Burke’s views show an international disapproval of France’s practices and an awareness that smuggling would be the taxes’ unintended consequence. ==Authorities== Smuggling posed a significant problem for authorities. French law considered smuggling a direct offense against the King; smugglers avoided paying indirect taxes which composed 47% of the government’s income, so it was as if they were stealing from the monarch.Neely, Sylvia. A Concise History of the French Revolution. Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2008. 9. Smugglers also undermined the ferme générale, or the “Five Great Farms.”Neely, Sylvia. A Concise History of the French Revolution. 9. This was a tax farming institution which collected and profited off indirect taxes. Therefore, the law dealt harshly with offenders to discourage further smuggling. Punishments for smuggling varied across France’s provinces but always worsened with repeat offenses.Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution 234. Offenders were always fined and often served additional time depending on the region. In Provence, smuggling bands of five and larger received fines of 500 livres and served nine years in galleys for a first offense.Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution 234. The law was especially harsh on nobles who dealt in contraband; commonly, those elites who were caught were stripped of their titles and their houses were raised.Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution 234. The severe punishment of the contraband industry shaped France’s prison infrastructure. From 1685 to 1791, over 100,000 men went to the galleys for illegal trade.Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. 19-20. The government needed to build more prisons to meet demands, and this influx of prisoners would lead the French government to create the modern French prison. ==Increased regulations== French authorities also reacted by imposing increased regulations on the business practices and movements of peasants. Officers viewed travelers with suspicion and demanded that merchants show their paperwork to prove the legitimacy of their wares. The government also increased the Farm police to 20,000 guards which became the largest paramilitary force of the time in Europe.Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. 19-20. They patrolled the Loire River and prohibited fishing at night. Officers would also physically search any suspects. For example, they would squeeze women where salt could be hidden, often the padding within their dresses.Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution 39. Due to the heightened repression on underground trade, smugglers often played integral roles in inciting armed rebellions against taxation officers. From 1660-1789, tax rebellion was the primary form of revolt within France.Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. 20-21. Notably, these rebellions were larger than the bread riots which propelled the beginning of the French Revolution. The most prominent of these revolts occurred from July 11 to 14 in 1789, when smugglers and common workers destroyed forty customs gates.Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. 28. Occurring before the Storming of the Bastille, this was one of the first demonstrations of popular support for the French Revolution. ==Public support== Smugglers garnered large public support, and influential revolutionary figures and liberals defended these rebellions. Mirabeau, a noble and leader of the Revolution, argued that the true antagonist wasn’t the smuggling trade but the Farm; he called these men “vampires” who control a system which “bleeds the people at the throat.”Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. 25. These smuggler’s rebellions also influenced physiocrats, liberal economic supporters for fair trade; they advocated for a completely altered fiscal system which replaced taxes on goods with other taxes.Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. 25. Others such as the President of the Paris “cour des aides” Malesherbes asserted in 1775 that this crime didn’t warrant such severe punishment.Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. 27. He argued that the King could resolve this form of despotism by calling the Estates General, an institution last seen in 1614. Louis XVI would form the Estates General four years later. ==References== Category:French history timelines Category:18th century in France Category:Legal history of the Ancien Régime Category:Social history of France Category:Smuggling Category:Crime in France ","title":"Smuggling in pre-revolutionary France"},{"id":"56878292","text":"Yang Fangzhi (; born 9 April 1997) is a Chinese footballer who currently plays for China League Two side Zhejiang Yiteng. ==Club career== Yang Fangzhi was loaned to China League One side Dalian Transcendence from Dalian Yifang in June 2017.

This company amalgamated with others, to form the successful Adelaide City and Port Railway Company, of which Darwent was in October 1851 appointed secretary. The first train ran on the line in 1856; the first Government-owned railway in the British Empire. Darwent joined the gold rush to Victoria and, after meeting with some success, returned to embark on business as a shipping and stock agent with an office in Grenfell Street, as well as a wheat and flour merchant, managing for a while to corner the trade in those commodities between Adelaide and Britain and to the Americas. He was a founder of the South Australian coastal steamer trade between Port Adelaide, Wallaroo, Port Lincoln and Port Augusta, with ships Coorong, Aldinga, Omeo and Gothenburg on his books. Darwent married Eliza Atchison (c. 1829 – 12 March 1885) in 1852; their children included Frederick Arnold (1854), James Thornhill (1858), Frank Atchison (1859), Lucy Harriet (1861), Charles Beauchamp (1863). His nephew, metallurgist Joseph Darwent, jun. (1847 – 10 August 1926), born in Sheffield, married Winifred Teresa Kelly (c. 1850 – 7 January 1941) on 16 May 1869. He was a draughtsman on the telegraph line for Darwent & Dalwood., The line about prospecting with John Selby Westcott is incorrect; he went farming at Coonawarra. He found gold south of Port Darwin in 1871, but priority was disputed. He later had a property near Coonawarra, lived in Penola, where he was a member of the District Council for 35 years and Chairman for 25. William Trevett Dalwood (c. 1834 – 22 August 1909) arrived with his parents Caleb (c. 1810 – 25 September 1851) and Hannah Dalwood, née Trevett ( – 27 August 1878), a newborn brother Theophilus (died 1847) and sisters Sarah Ann (later Lethaby), Elizabeth Jane (later Baum? Bunney?), Achsah Mary Dalwood (married Ralph Drummond), in September 1840 aboard Lysander. Youngest son Thomas Caleb (died 1909) was a prolific portrait painter. Caleb was licensee of Park Gate Hotel, Goodwood; Hannah ran it for four years after his death. His first employment was with a pair of oxen carting water, Adelaide not yet having the luxury of reticulated water. His business expanded to carting stone, for which there was a huge appetite, for the construction of buildings and for laying roads. He expanded his operations to quarrying and thence to mining. He was soon a director of half-a-dozen mining companies, Dalwood married Emma Frearson on 6 September 1855. Her father was also a contractor, and in 1860 Dalwood's assistant. Their children included Frederic William, William, Augustus George, George Trevett Palmerston, Britannia Frances, Silva, Georgia Blanche, Olive Lavinia, Eva Beatrice and Constance Louise Gertrude; they had a home on Melbourne Street, North Adelaide. ==The contract== On 20 August 1870 SS Omeo left McLaren wharf, Port Adelaide with passengers W. A. Paqualin (supervisor), Joseph Darwent, jun., Stephen King, Charles Tym (another of Darwent's nephews), William Dalwood, and Government officers William McMinn (Overseer of Works), R. C. Burton (his assistant), J. L. Stapleton, and A. Hawley, and 75 laborers engaged by Darwent & Dalwood in steerage. Dalwood was present only as an observer, and was a passenger on the return voyage. Omeo also carried 80 draught horses, a dozen head of cattle (whether beef cattle or working bullocks was not mentioned), and provisions for the journey. In the hold were over 1,000 bundles (50) of galvanised iron telegraph wire, 3,000 insulators and other hardware. Omeo arrived safely on 9 September, berthed at Port Darwin and was promptly unloaded. A telegraph pole was ceremoniously erected by a daughter of Capt. Bloomfield Douglas, the Government Resident. A month later, all was good news and optimism: of line had been erected, and work was progressing at per week, expecting completion in eight or nine months. Another 50 tons of wire and 3,528 insulators were despatched in February, with only the last 50 tons of wire to be shipped. In June it was anticipated the northern section would be completed ahead of time, and they could continue southward and do some of the central section. It therefore came as a shock to people in Adelaide to learn that Overseer of Works (northern section) McMinn had taken the extreme action of cancelling Darwent & Dalwood's contract as from 3 May, and had sent all their workers back to Adelaide, on the basis of their falling so far behind that there was no prospect of completion by 1 January 1872. :They had in six months, despite the Territory's notorious wet season, erected poles to a distance of and strung wire for . With the imminent dry season progress would have been many times greater. Against that however was the compounding problem of logistics over increasing distances, for which Darwent & Dalwood were probably insufficiently prepared without bringing in additional men and animals. The sacking of the workers by McMinn was on the basis of an insurrection, denied by the men. :The Government, having determined to complete the line on time at any cost, despatched two teams, one to work south from the termination of Darwent & Dalwood's work, and the other north from the central section's termination. It was intended by Charles Todd to have a third team working simultaneously south from the Roper River, but that idea was scotched on the grounds of safety. Livestock despatched consisted of 500 bullocks and 168 horses, with wagons, harness and supplies to match. Things did not eventuate entirely as planned. Insufficient water was to be found for the bullocks and hundreds either perished of thirst or were too weak to work. In November 1871 the schooner Gulnare, which had been working as a supply vessel, struck a reef near Melville Island and had to be towed back to Darwin and abandoned. With the retirement of John Hart and reorganisation of the ministry, Charles Todd was empowered to establish a supply base on the Roper River, but it was not until May 1872 that the river had subsided sufficiently to be of any use. :The British Australian Telegraph Company completed the laying of the undersea cable from Singapore on 18 November 1871, and the Overland Telegraph Line was not completed until August 1872, but was substantially in use from May 1872 by the expedient of carrying messages by horse or camel across the uncompleted section. In May 1875 William Dalwood brought his case for compensation before the Chief Justice and a special jury, arguing that his company had been sacked without just cause; that they could have completed the work by the deadline. His claim was denied on the grounds that he was precluded by the terms of the contract from disputing the judgment and determinations of the Overseer of Works. He was awarded £10,000 on the value of work done. (Cost to the government for their work was around £100,000 and took 18 months.) == References == Category:Telegraph companies ","title":"Darwent &amp; Dalwood"},{"id":"56878439","text":"25th Street station may refer to: * 25th Street Station (Baltimore), a proposed development in Baltimore, Maryland, US * 25th Street station (Charlotte), a light rail station in Charlotte, North Carolina, US * South 25th Street station, a light rail station in Tacoma, Washington, US * 25th Street (BMT Fifth Avenue Line), a station on the demolished BMT Fifth Avenue Line * 25th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line), a local station on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line * West 25th–Ohio City station, a Rapid Transit station in Cleveland, Ohio, US ","title":"25th Street station"},{"id":"56878449","text":"The Caleb Baldwin House, at 195 S. 400 East in Beaver, Utah, is a historic hall and parlor plan house built around 1885.

This area was a stop for cargo ships traveling from the Chao Phraya's mouth to Ayutthaya. In the Rattanakosin period Tha Din Daeng was considered a prime location for commerce and industry. The area along the Chao Phraya, from Tha Din Daeng to the estuary, was home to many factories and businesses, such as rice mills, sawmills, warehouses, and docks. The traders in the area were mostly Chinese and Malays. King Mongkut (Rama IV) later encouraged European settlements.

When asked who was taking her there, Fraley said it was another friend and declined to further identify that person. She has not been seen since; her cellphone was found a few days later but provided no useful information as to her whereabouts. Investigators initially believed she had met with foul play, and began focusing on Ricky Simonds Sr., her fiancé's father, who lived in the same apartment complex, as a person of interest. He had driven Fraley to the hospital on one of her previous visits that day, and had a criminal record that included prison time for manslaughter after he had strangled a girlfriend in the 1980s. However, the investigation ended two months later when Simonds was found dead, apparently of heat stroke, in the trunk of a former girlfriend's car. In 2015, a prison inmate confessed that he had killed Fraley, but he was incarcerated at the time Fraley disappeared. The investigation continues, and in 2012 the case was the subject of an episode of the Investigation Discovery channel's Disappeared. ==Background== A native of Gaston County, Fraley had struggled with anxiety and bipolar disorder throughout her early life. By the late 2000s, Fraley had responded well to prescription medications for those conditions and was attending Gaston College on a part-time basis. According to her family, she was planning on a career as a substance-abuse counselor. In 2006 she had begun dating Ricky Simonds Jr. Her family said she was very much in love with him, and eventually the two became engaged. However, Simonds had a criminal history, and after several earlier arrests for petty crimes, in early 2007 he was sentenced to 15 months in state prison for theft. Fraley continued to visit and interact with him while he was incarcerated. ==Disappearance== On April 7, 2008, Fraley came down with a stomach flu. It was severe enough that she twice sought treatment at a local hospital that day. As she had no driver's license, she relied on a social services worker, and friends and family to take her to and from the hospital. After returning from the first trip, one of Fraley's friends visited her and picked up her dog, which Fraley had been sitting for her, then went out to drop off Fraley's prescription at a local drugstore. She went back later; Ricky Simonds Sr., her incarcerated fiancé's father, who lived in the same apartment complex and did maintenance work there, drove her there and another neighbor drove her back. Fraley decided around 12 a.m. that she had something more serious and needed to go back to the hospital, and called her mother to let her know. At 1:30 a.m. April 8, she called a friend in Albemarle; during the call she mentioned that she was going back to the hospital. The call was cut short when Fraley apparently saw her ride, whom she referred to as \\"he\\", arrive. Fraley never checked into the hospital the third time. Since that phone call, there has been no evidence of her presence anywhere. ==Investigation== After Fraley missed an important appointment the next day, her family went to her apartment on Lowell-Bethesda Road to see if she was all right. They did not find her there. The door was locked; inside they found her wallet, purse, keys, and identification, but not her cell phone. Nothing else was missing. There were no signs of a struggle, so they concluded she had left willingly, wherever she had gone. Unable to locate her, they called police and reported her missing. Gaston County police launched a major investigation, putting all its investigators on the case, with three of them devoted to it full-time, and requesting assistance from both the state's Bureau of Investigation and the FBI. \\"I have never seen a missing person case worked this thoroughly\\", said Christie Rhoney, the chief detective. Two days after Fraley's disappearance, utility workers discovered her phone at an intersection roughly a mile (1.6 km) from her apartment. By the time the phone was turned over to the police, too many people had handled it for any usable evidence, such as fingerprints, to be gained from the exterior. Searching through its call records, police found that several calls had been made at 4:30 a.m. However, they turned out to be from the list of calls Fraley had dialed earlier and were not connected to the disappearance. A call had been made to the phone at 5 a.m., but it could not be determined who it was from. ===Ricky Simonds Sr.=== Ricky Simonds Jr., Fraley's fiancé, was still imprisoned at the time of her disappearance, so investigators ruled him out as a suspect. They quickly refocused on his father, Ricky Simonds Sr. He, too, had a criminal record, including six years in prison for manslaughter in the 1980s after strangling a girlfriend to death. Simonds Sr. lived in the same complex as Fraley, just two doors away, and did maintenance work there. He had driven her to the hospital the second time on the day she disappeared, making him one of the last people to see her that day. Reportedly he was obsessed with Fraley. He refused to take a lie detector test. Two months to the day after Fraley disappeared, however, the investigation into Simonds ended with his death. On June 7, Kim Sprenger, a former girlfriend who had recently obtained a protective order against him, noticed a foul odor in her car. It persisted, and the next day she opened the trunk. Inside, Sprenger found Simonds' body. Police investigating found he had a set of her car keys; a week earlier Sprenger's purse had been stolen from the car. The cause of death was ruled to be accidental heat stroke; during the previous days, high temperatures in the area had exceeded . Police theorized that Simonds had used the keys to let himself into the trunk with the intent of ambushing Sprenger at some point, letting himself out with the working emergency latch. When heat exhaustion set in, however, it was possible that he had panicked and forgotten to use it, remaining in the trunk to die. After completing their investigation into Simonds' death, detectives told the media that he had been considered a person of interest in Fraley's disappearance, which remained an open case. Members of both the Fraley and Simonds families believed Ricky Sr. had taken useful information about what happened to Fraley to his grave. Her mother, Kim, who had supplemented the official investigation with efforts of her own, recalled crying when she learned of his death. Ricky Sr., she claimed, \\"was hiding something and we couldn't never get that out of him\\". Ricky Simonds Jr., by then released from prison, also said he believed his father, whom he described as being more of a friend, was aware of what had happened to Fraley, but generally found the unusual chain of circumstances overwhelming. \\"[F]irst my fiancé goes missing, then my dad climbs in a trunk and dies? Does that make sense to anybody?\\" he asked a local TV station. ===2015 possible confession=== In 2015, Jerry Case, a man then serving federal prison time for kidnapping, made a possible confession regarding Fraley's disappearance; he had been incarcerated at that time. When he confessed, Case was on trial for a 1985 murder in Gaston County which he had confessed to in a 2012 letter to the Gaston Gazette. In 2015 he wrote another letter to the Gazette, confessing to killing Fraley and another local woman who had been shot and killed in her house, which was then set on fire later that year. \\"I guess you could say this is confessions number two and three\\", he wrote. Prosecutors immediately dismissed Case's confession as unlikely regarding Fraley, since he was incarcerated at the time she disappeared (although he was released a few weeks later) and he only provided details of the case that had already been made public. They also discounted his marginally probable confession regarding the later murder of the other local woman, though he had been free at the time the later homicide occurred. ==See also== *List of Disappeared episodes *List of people who disappeared ==References * Category:Missing person cases in North Carolina Category:2000s missing person cases Category:April 2008 events in the United States Category:2008 in North Carolina Category:Gastonia, North Carolina ","title":"Disappearance of Jamie Fraley"},{"id":"56878574","text":"Riva Ganguly Das (born 24 December 1961https://web.archive.org/web/20180422070724/https://mea.gov.in/writereaddata/images/Civi_List_27-7-12.pdf) is an Indian diplomat who belongs to the Indian Foreign Service.

The show itself is based on the characters created by DC Comics set in the Batman mythology. Written by co-executive producers Steven Lilien & Bryan Wynbrandt and directed by Maja Vrvilo, it was first broadcast on April 5, 2018. The episode is notable for introducing the character Jeremiah Valeska, who becomes a major antagonist in the series going forward. In the episode, Gordon and Bullock attempt to track down Jerome Valeska, who has assembled a legion of criminals to wreak havoc in Gotham and is looking for \\"Xander Wilde\\", an engineer with whom he shared a dark past with. Meanwhile, Lee faces Nygma off on a riddling contest in order to solve a conflict. ==Plot== Bruce (David Mazouz) arrives at St. Ignatius, the school that Jerome's (Cameron Monaghan) next target, \\"Xander Wilde\\", attended. The Headmaster (Steven Hauck) reveals that he has already given information regarding Wilde to Jerome. Jerome holds a meeting with Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor), Tetch (Benedict Samuel), Fries (Nathan Darrow), Pike (Michelle Veintimilla), and Crane (David W. Thompson). He reveals his plans to wreak havoc in the city before invading Wilde's engineering offices in search of him. Jerome arrives at Wilde's proxy's apartment but is knocked unconscious, and subsequently wakes up in a cell with Wilde watching him via CCTV cameras. Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) arrive at the control room in the underground facility and confront Wilde, who looks exactly like Jerome. Wilde is revealed to be Jeremiah Valeska (also played by Monaghan), Jerome's twin brother. Jeremiah claims to have suffered severe abuse at Jerome's hands throughout his childhood, forcing their mother to send Jeremiah away to be adopted and renamed \\"Xander Wilde\\". Jerome's allies arrive and free Jerome, who vows to drive Jeremiah mad.

It aired in the United States on Fox on March 18, 2018. It is the final episode written by long time writer Kevin Curran, who died in 2016. The episode is dedicated to Stephen Hawking, who died four days before the episode's airing. ==Plot== At Gavelby's Auction House, Homer and Mr. Burns lose to tech mogul Megan Matheson at bidding for Joan Miró's painting The Poetess, with which Homer is obsessed, to the point of attempting to steal the painting at the end of the auction. Once the painting arrives at her home, Megan finds out that it has been stolen. Detective Manacek is called to solve the case. Manacek goes to Megan's due to insuring the painting for double the price she paid of $30 million. She denies the accusation and sends Manacek to Burns' mansion. He shows he can't stand losing a bid to a woman, but dismisses the accusation too and sends Manacek to the final suspect, Homer, due to the obsession he showed about it. Homer demonstrates to him how much he wants the painting at the Power Plant, but denies stealing it. In the evening, Marge shows up at Manacek's apartment Brick Townhomes to convince him Homer is innocent, but he says they'd only talk at dinner. So Marge invites him to dinner at her house with their family. After dinner, Homer panics when they start talking, and Bart and Marge explain how Homer became obsessed with the painting at the Springfield Museum of Fine Arts while chaperoning a field trip there, even dreaming about it at night. Lisa then reveals that Homer confided in her about the painting, forming a common interest between them. The two then went to the museum, only to find it closed due to being out of funds and the painting shipped off to an auction house. Springfielders protested on the museum's closure while Mayor Quimby explained the cuts, including the cut of 1/3 of the Springfield Police Department with Eddie having been fired, resulting in them giving up on the protests. Homer then decided to enter the auction in a bid to save the painting, where the scene returns to the start of the episode where the bids took place, and Homer tried to steal it. After the story, Homer escapes from home, but Manacek finds him at the museum where he assures him he's innocent because he finds him too dumb to steal anything. Manacek later gathers all the suspects together in the museum and reveals that Megan and Burns are the thieves of the painting. Megan exchanged the security guards by twins hired by her, to simulate the steal, so she could collect the insurance policy for her girlfriend. However, Burns beat her to it when he built an identical auction house next to the original and stole it from the vault. After Megan and Burns are arrested and the painting is retrieved from Burns' manor, Manacek reveals the true culprit to be none other than Lisa herself, as the painting is nothing other than her tote bag. Lisa explains that she secretly switched the painting before the auction happened, so it wouldn't go to millionaires' houses hidden away from people who love it, like Homer. As ownership of the painting reverts to the city, it is returned to Mayor Quimby, who chooses to preserve it at the Springfield Arena Football Arena, built with the money from selling the public arts, where Homer and Lisa happily go to view the painting together. During the credits, there are different shots of Manacek as if they are part of a detective TV show. ==Reception== Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave this episode a B, stating, \\"At this point in its record-setting run, The Simpsons is entitled—encouraged, even—to muck about with its format all it wants. Here, the series’ traditional linear sitcom storytelling style is upended, from the classic theme song right on through. Starting out with Homer, fancy duds and ping pong paddle at the ready, bidding millions of dollars for Joan Miró's abstract painting The Poetess, being outbid by first Mr. Burns and then ‘billionaire tech mogul’ Megan Matheson (Cecily Strong), and, enraged, being dragged out by security bellowing, ‘Don’t take that painting, I love it’—clearly, there's a mystery here. Both as to the hows and whys of Homer J. Simpson being involved in high- end art intrigue, and to what form this rejiggering of the Simpsons formula is taking. It's neat.\\" \\"Homer Is Where the Art Isn't\\" scored a 0.8 rating with a 3 share and was watched by 2.10 million people, making it Fox's second highest rated show of the night.

It is known within the Anglosphere for publishing localized versions of video games like Myst III, Nocturne and Hopkins FBI. The company initially focused on local game versions and multimedia presentations in order to increase funding for a new, unique video game. The company finalized this game while developing Ski Jumping 2005 and two games set in the modern theatre of war. Maciej Oginski finished writing the game's screenplay and dialogue in December 2003. The development process officially began a few months later. Oginski aimed to write a script in the style of Monty Python and South Park that would be enjoyable to those who had not seen the earlier films. The finished script consisted of 500 pages, and voice actors recorded over five hours of dialogue, filled with slang, newspeak and expletives. Developers chose to make the game in 2D as they were against 3D and felt FMV was tacky. It was reported in a Just Adventure preview, published August 19, 2004, that the company hoped to find a North American publisher for the game. They ended up publishing the title themselves. The game was originally meant to be published in Poland in September 2004. == Plot and gameplay == The game is loosely based on the comedy film Chłopaki nie płaczą (2005) and centers on a duo of gangsters named Fred and Grucha. Gameplay is similar to a classic two-dimensional LucasArts adventure game, where players interact with characters, collect inventory items and complete puzzles to advance the story. == Critical reception == Przygodoskop thought the game would appeal to players who just wanted a fun experience, noting that it \\"wasn't ambitious, intellectual, or a milestone\\". GryPC wrote that the game's script could reasonably be used as a sequel to the film Chłopaki nie płaczą. Game Press gave specific praise to the title's \\"Polonization\\" for its emphasis on appealing to Polish players and including historical or cultural references they would likely appreciate. Adventure Gamers enjoyed the title's \\"gorgeous [...] sumptuous looking stylized artwork.\\" Gry.imro thought it was the best Polish adventure game in years. Imperium Gier praised the game's humour and cast of characters, but disliked the plot and gameplay. Gry.mocny disliked the \\"annoying\\" interface but appreciated how the game was not merely a straight remake of the film. Gra.pl noted the game's humor contained a large amount of social and political satire. == References  External links == * Home page * Mobygames Category:2005 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Video games based on films Category:Video games developed in Poland Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Chłopaki Nie Płaczą (video game)"},{"id":"56878668","text":"The Blue Nile patas monkey (Erythrocebus poliophaeus) is a species of Old World monkey found in Africa along the Blue Nile river valley. It is known from Ethiopia and Sudan, and may be threatened by habitat loss. While first described in 1862, it was synonymized with the patas monkey in 1927. A reclassification in 2018 confirmed its status as a distinct species. It can be easily distinguished from the common patas monkey by the distinctive hair on its face, which resembles a handlebar moustache. == Taxonomy == Classification of the Blue Nile patas monkey has been widely debated for years, with previous taxonomic decisions being based only on a single specimen which did not come with extensive background knowledge. The first widely adopted taxonomy was created by Schwartz through his research in 1927. The Erythrocebus monkeys were classified into three subspecies: patas, pyrrhonotus and baumstarki, creating and overall monotypic genus. Erythrocebus species were classified by their nose colour and this created gaps in their classification. Around 1974, it was noticed that nose colour could actually change due to age or physiology, but this only created further confusion within the research community and the previous classification was left unchanged. In 2018, E. poliophaeus was resurrected as a separate species based on a number of distinct physiological characteristics. == Description == Blue Nile Patas monkeys are medium in size but have distinctly long limbs in comparison with other monkeys of a similar size. They possess a long tail which arches behind them as they walk. Their tails are not prehensile, which is characteristic of all Old World Monkeys. Their feet are long and padded. These structures make them a fast-paced monkey, equipped for efficient long distance travel. They have a slender frame, consisting of a deep chest which curves down at the torso. Their coat and pelage vary across individuals and age group. It is mainly wiry and reddish in nature, with the lower half of the face and inner limbs being a lighter brown or white colour and a blackish grey along their upper limbs. This distinction between the under and upper sides of their body is most prominent in males. The crown of the head is a deep reddish-brown colour, which turns grey with age. This species of patas monkey is most famously known for their white upper lip hair which forms the shape of a handlebar moustache. Their weight ranges from 7 to 13 kilograms, with adult males being double the size of adult females. Similar to this weight difference, males have canine teeth about twice the size of females, showing many characteristics of sexual dimorphism. Females tend to have a less distinctive arch in their tails as well. Mustached Monkey Blue Nile Patas monkeys have binocular vision, with their eyes facing straight forward. Their nostrils are quite narrow and tilt downwards in a catarrhine formation. In terms of dental formula; their molars are bilophodont, incisors spatulate with conspicuous canines. == Distribution and habitat == Blue Nile River The Blue Nile Patas monkey prefers savannah or woodland type habitats over dense vegetation or forests as their fastest form of transport is running on land. Although they prefer open land for travelling, they seek out areas of tall trees to sleep in for safety from predators at night. Patas monkeys do not stray far from water sources and as their name suggest typically can be found along the Blue Nile River. This river flows across Ethiopia and Sudan, with monkeys from these areas being found as far south as Tanzania and far west as Senegal and Kenya. These areas of Africa range from the borders of the Sahara Desert to tropical equatorial conditions, making E. poliophaeus a highly adaptive and resilient monkey. The E. poliophaeus species is able to be physically distinguished from other species in the genus through their geographical distribution. They reside along the western areas of Ethiopia and Sudan which is separated by the Ethiopian highlands and Sudan’s swampy region. This is also one of the key reasons that the E. poliophaeus needed to be separated from the E. patas subspecies. == Behaviour == Young Patas monkeys, typically three to twelve months in age, spend the majority of their time playing. Activities such as play-wrestling and chasing other juveniles allows them to build key social skills that they will require as adults. Most of these play behaviours occur on the ground where Patas monkeys are most comfortable. Young monkeys learn to groom each other early and this is a common behaviour amongst both juveniles and adults. Adult male Patas monkeys are the watch guards of their family. They observe predators from the tops of trees and have a noisy bouncing display that they perform when disturbed, to dissuade attacks and intrusion. Males tend to separate from the group when they are not resting, grooming or mating. Female adult Patas monkeys lead the family and initiate any movement that needs to occur. They are the primary caretakers of the young. Any physical defence against threats are mainly made by the females of the family. It is rare for a male to be involved in this and females usually attack in groups of three. Patas monkeys are very fast and can silently travel distances at a high speed. When threatened, smaller or more vulnerable monkeys tend to resort to quickly fleeing. Males also possess a contralto bark which they utter repeatedly when encountered by another group of Patas monkeys. == Conservation == The Blue Nile Patas monkey was originally an abundant species in Kenya, but studies from 2000 onwards showed a lack of their distribution in this part of Africa. It was discovered the growing human population in Kenya around this time may have been the cause. Farmers were converted the dry areas inhabited by the monkeys into farmland, thus decreasing their numbers in this region. Crop raiding was also a key cause in their lack of abundance. Research showed that Patas monkeys also positively affected by human modifications to their environment, as shown by their use of on man-made water sources in Kenya. Combined with a reduction in numbers of their non-human predator population drove their numbers up and allow them to co-exist on the land with humans. == References == Blue Nile patas monkey Category:Mammals of Ethiopia Category:Mammals of Sudan Blue Nile patas monkey ","title":"Blue Nile patas monkey"},{"id":"56878694","text":"JW Clay Blvd/UNC Charlotte is a light rail station on the LYNX Blue Line in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States.

He has appeared on five releases with the Blues Music Award- nominated Kilborn Alley Blues Band, with three of them being produced by fellow blues musician Nick Moss at his Blue Bella Records label. He was also a part of the International Blues Challenge finalist group the Sugar Prophets from 2011-2013. More recently he has worked with several other Champaign-based local blues, rock, and country bands and released his own solo acoustic album Blue Genes in 2016. ==Biography== Asselin originally learned how to play keyboards and harmonica when he was eight years old. While living in Litchfield, New Hampshire, he supposedly picked up the harmonica after stealing one out of his older brother Mark's glove box in his car. Music was a large part of his early family life. His brother Mark worked for the alternative band Cold as their guitar tech throughout the 1990s and also plays guitar. Before moving to Illinois, Asselin played with the short-lived American Folk Project as the singer, harmonica player, and acoustic guitar player. After turning 22, Asselin came to Illinois in search of playing blues music. He connected with the Kilborn Alley Blues Band in Champaign in 1998 and began playing shows around the area. By 2001, the band had secured its first recording session, a live session at Urbana's WEFT radio station. In 2003, after some major regional success, Kilborn Alley put their first release proper, the eponymous Kilborn Alley Blues Band on local label PeeDee Records. The band's version of Johnny \\"Guitar\\" Watson's \\"Too Tired\\" single found its way to local blues jukeboxes as far north as Chicago. The album and the band's few gigs into some small South and West Side Chicago clubs brought them to the attention of Nick Moss. Prior to the release of the band's first major record, Asselin was nearly killed in a rear-end accident by a semi truck on Interstate 57 outside of Champaign. He went on to make a full recovery and resume playing with Kilborn Alley in 2006. Moss produced the band's 2006 Blues Music Award- nominated release Put It in the Alley on his Blue Bella label. Asselin contributed 12 songwriting credits and harmonica to all the tracks. Asselin was also a part of the band's 2007 BMA-nominated follow-up Tear Chicago Down, in which he once again contributed songwriting and harmonica efforts. By 2010, Asselin began taking on a lesser role in the band but still appeared as the featured harmonica player on the second-to-last release on Blue Bella for Moss, entitled Better Off Now. By the end of 2010, Asselin had left the band permanently to pursue full-time a small business in landscaping. By early 2011, Asselin found himself playing the occasional small acoustic shows around Champaign and Urbana, Illinois. He had long been acquainted with fellow local harmonica player and vocalist Josh Spence. Spence had begun putting together a project that was more of a mixture of blues, rock, and jam band music. Spence's guitarist for the project was moving out of state, and Asselin was asked to join as a guitar player. Asselin joined the band and immediately found success again both locally and regionally. In January 2011, shortly after Asselin joined, the band released their eponymous debut to regional and blues radio fanfare. Mixed by Larry Nix at Ardent Studios, the album was a blend of blues, rock, and rhythm & blues. Asselin contributed songwriting and arrangement credits on all twelve of the album's tracks. The record was placed in the top 20 of the Roots Music Report Contemporary Blues Chart and peaked at number 21 on the Living Blues Magazine Radio Charts. The notoriety saw them compete at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, Tennessee. At the challenge, the band placed in the Top 8 at the finals on the third day of competition, which earned them invitations to play at many blues festivals around the country. Due to illnesses and scheduling conflicts within the band, Asselin started working solo again after 2013. Local musical relationships again helped Asselin find a home as a guitarist, vocalist and lyricist with a new project with fellow guitarist and vocalist Noah Williams. With some small regional success, Asselin and his new band mates in the William Marsala Blues Band returned to Memphis to compete in the International Blues Challenge in 2016. In 2019, the William Marsala Blues Band released their first album Stuck In the Blues: Live From Home on May 17th. The album was recorded live at Dark Soul Studios in Decatur, Illinois on December 30, 2018 with no overdubs. The session came about due to the band wanting to shoot a professional promotional video for an upcoming show, and went ahead with recording a full-length list of material in the process. Asselin, through the help of a GoFundMe campaign, also put together the funds to record his solo self-released acoustic debut Blue Genes. Asselin has worked with country artist John David Daily and opened for Eric Paslay. Asselin signed with Nashville Entertainment Weekly Records in June 2018. He went on to release the EP Flat Head Ford in June 2018 to all platforms. Asselin began performing with Champaign-Urbana, Illinois vocalist/guitarist Lindsay Lilly in March 2019 and will be releasing an album in 2020 under the project called The Black Eyed Lillies. The album is set to be recorded at Blackbird Recording Studios in Nashville in January 2020 and has been funded through a GoFundMe campaign. The Black Eyed Lillies have also been selected by the Illinois Central Blues Club as its solo-duo performance representative at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, Tennessee on January 28-February 1, 2020.. ==Discography== (with Kilborn Alley Blues Band) *WEFT Sessions (2001) *Kilborn Alley Blues Band (2003) *Put It In the Alley (2006) *Tear Chicago Down (2007) *Better Off Now (2010) *The Tolono Tapes (2017) (with The Sugar Prophets) *The Sugar Prophets (2011) (with the William Marsala Blues Band) *Stuck in the Blues: Live From Home(2018) solo *Blue Genes (2016) *Flat Head Ford EP (2018) ==See also== *List of Chicago blues musicians *List of electric blues musicians ==References *The Stage Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:American blues guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American blues singers Category:American male singers Category:Songwriters from New Hampshire Category:American blues harmonica players Category:Chicago blues musicians Category:Harmonica blues musicians Category:Electric blues musicians Category:Singers from New Hampshire Category:Guitarists from New Hampshire Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:People from Manchester, New Hampshire Category:People from Litchfield, New Hampshire Category:21st-century American singers Category:21st-century American guitarists Category:20th- century American singers Category:20th-century male singers Category:21st- century male singers ","title":"Joe Asselin"},{"id":"56878746","text":"Wendy Lian Williams (born 14 June 1967) is a retired American diver.

The resulting explosion killed 5 people and wounded 12 others. Over 100 years later, it remains the largest industrial accident in the city’s history. == Incident == In early 1913, the Malcolm Canneries building had recently been sold to the Western Canada Cold Storage and Packing company. The new owner was in the process of installing machinery used for meat packing. A watchman noticed a fire around the walls and called the local fire department. In the meantime, spectators began to gather nearby to watch the event. When the first responders saw where the fire was coming from, they started to chop a hole in the floor of the building to locate the source. A fireman, B. Ringler, was using an axe and had just opened a hole in the floor when he felt a sudden rush of natural gas. Realizing the danger, he yelled to the other firemen to get out of the building. As the men rushed towards the exit, a mighty roar was heard as the building exploded before everyone could get out. The explosion reportedly raised the roof of the 3-storey building in the air while the brick side walls collapsed. The roof then came crashing back down and buried two people inside. The resulting debris of bricks and timbers was launched into the surrounding area, wounding officials and spectators. In total, five people died, two of them firemen, one a city employee and two spectators including a twelve year-old boy. == Aftermath == Following the explosion, crews worked to remove the debris to locate the missing. The weather in March made recovery difficult, as the temperature that night dropped to -20 degrees Celsius. The local hospital received the seriously injured as well as those with minor injuries from flying bricks. An investigation was held and it was determined that the firemen had triggered the explosion when they used an axe to cut into a sewer pipe, where the gas was seeping from. At the time, gas leaks were common and the use of mercaptan to odorize natural gas was not yet established. == Commemoration == On March 19, 2013, a public ceremony was held at Fire Station No. 3 in Medicine Hat, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the incident. The ceremony was held at the Firefighters Memorial to recognize the loss of life and community impact due to the explosion.

Hopkins, published by Broadway Play Publishing. A political satire criticizing American views on extremism and foreign terrorism, it revolves around a television talk show host interviewing a counterterrorist expert on the imminent danger of the extremist threat. The play first premiered at the English Theatre Berlin, in Berlin, Germany, in February 2009, followed by a production at Seven Stages Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia, in March 2009. ==Plot summary== The audience is welcomed to \\"Issues in Focus,\\" a political news and talk program based out of Washington, and are introduced to the show's host, self-described Washington insider Dick Hedgerow. Dick announces the entirety of the night's program will be devoted to an in-depth discussion on the threat of extremism and welcomes his guest; Norman \\"Norm\\" Krieger, a co-founder of the fictitious polling and counterterrorism organization, the Center of Advanced Strategic Studies. Norm has been invited on the show to discuss his newly-published book, Extremism in the 21st Century, which focuses on the mindset of extremists and their psychological motivations, as well as how they're able to spread their beliefs globally. Norm explains that he believes extremism should be considered the final threat to a democratic world (albeit there are other, manageable threats that are easy to handle), and tells Dick that while the government should be constantly fighting back against this threat, it's important to keep the public placated, and allow them to carry on with their normal lives. Norm further elaborates that as the threat of extremism is combated, the public's understanding of it will be skewed, and it will ultimately become too difficult to keep up with the narrative, and the majority of the details will be indiscernible. Dick insists that this isn't an issue, suggesting that they refrain from complete transparency with the American people, citing security concerns, and instead try and help them adjust the way they see things, which Norm claims were his motivations for writing his book. As their discussion continues, Dick inquires about a concrete definition of the word \\"extremism,\\" which Norm initially struggles with; he eventually decides that extremism is primarily defined by violence, or advocating for its use. When Dick asks if this definition transcends political leanings, such as conservative or liberal views, Norm proposes that these labels have lost their meaning beyond the competition aspect, but later contradicts himself when he says it is absolutely necessary for America to maintain the two-party system, as a country with no ideological opposition would be undemocratic. The interview then shifts gears as it begins to investigate the extremists' intentions, which Norm believes is not only to incite violence but to make people think, asking complicated and dangerous questions that will only lead to insanity. Instead of engaging in the destructive act of thinking, Norm insists that the viewers need to stick to the facts provided by those in power in the government and the media and unquestionably devote their minds to the programming that \\"freedom-loving people\\" such as himself are trying to ensure all of society conforms to. When Dick objects to this concept, claiming it is nothing better than the brainwashing that extremists are guilty of, Norm reassures him that this is brainwashing people with the truth, while the other option is to be brainwashed with \\"made-up extremist nonsense.\\" As the play carries on, Dick and Norm constantly renege on their stances and their beliefs, and at its conclusion, they nearly break the fourth wall, seemingly aware that they are actors in an elaborate performance and are no less extremists than the terrorists they have warned the audience of. ==List of characters== *Norman Krieger – A poetic terrorist posing as an anti-terrorism expert. *Dick Hedgerow – A poetic terrorist posing as a television journalist. **In some productions, Dick Hedgerow is renamed to Jane Woolwraith. ==Production History== The Extremists was first produced at the English Theatre Berlin, in February 2009, directed by Walter D. Asmus. It was followed by a production at Seven Stages Theatre, who co-produced the original showing, in Atlanta, Georgia, in March of the same year. In 2010, a staged reading of the play was performed at the Schauspielhaus Bochum in Bochum, Germany, as well as the Acker Stadt Palast performing arts center in Berlin, 2012. A German translation of the play translated by Jasna Miletic was used for both productions. Clancy Productions & Assembly produced the play at the 2013 Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Edinburgh, Scotland, with David Calvitto in the role of Norman Krieger, and Carol Scudder playing Jane Woolwraith, a female counterpart to the script's Dick Hedgerow. A 2018 production was performed at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, directed by Raymond Munro, with Jake Rosenthal as Norman Krieger, and Brett Iarrobino as Dick Hedgerow. ==Critical Reception== Critics have praised the play for its complex and intricate text; a review of the 2013 Edinburgh Festival Fringe production describes Hopkins' script as a \\"fiendishly complex rollercoaster.\\" Critics found the performances of Calvitto and Scudder dazzling, citing an incredible pace, and noting that audiences would leave the show questioning their understanding of western democracy. Kolja Reichert of the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel called the performance at the English Theatre Berlin \\"heady theater in the truest sense,\\" and focused on the question of reality: \\"Hopkins builds a construct of ideas out of rhetoric until everything revolves around one thing - what is the truth for the good guys and what is it for the bad guys?\\" A review of the production in Die Tageszeitung claimed the play was an excellent example of the advantages theater holds over film, in that it lays bare the mechanisms of the media. ==References== Category:2009 plays Category:Satirical plays Category:Political satire plays Category:Plays set in the United States Category:Terrorism in fiction ","title":"The Extremists (play)"},{"id":"56878883","text":"This is a list of Presidents of Galmudug, a Federated state that is part of the Federal Republic of Somalia.

It was written by Corey Reed and Channing Powell, and directed by Greg Nicotero. ==Plot== At the Sanctuary, Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) organizes the Saviors to cover their weapons in the blood and viscera of the walkers prior to an attack on the Hilltop community. Dwight (Austin Amelio) struggles with hiding his loyalty to Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and his allies from Negan and his other lieutenants, particularly Simon (Steven Ogg) as the Saviors start to convoy towards Hilltop. Meanwhile, Rick and Michonne (Danai Gurira) return to the Hilltop to regroup. Daryl (Norman Reedus) apologizes to Rick for enabling the Saviors to clear out Sanctuary, resulting in the attacks on the various communities, but Rick admits he also didn't want anyone to die. The two decide to continue scouting around Hilltop, leaving Maggie (Lauren Cohan) in charge. While waiting, Maggie spots empty crates outside of Hilltop, and on retrieving them, finds a note requesting supplies and vinyl records in exchange for the promise of \\"the key\\" to help them. Though Maggie is cautious, she, Michonne, Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Enid (Katelyn Nacon) decide to comply to see who might be willing to help. At the planned meeting point, the four meet Georgie (Jayne Atkinson) with her aides, Hilda (Kim Ormiston) and Midge (Misty Ormiston), who offers them knowledge in exchange for the supplies they were to bring. Maggie decides to hold them at Hilltop until they can figure out what they can do. As Maggie and Michonne discuss what to do, Enid suggests they should just turn Georgie away. Michonne talks her down, and Maggie realizes that the better option would be to fulfill Georgie's wishes. Georgie, in return, offers them some of their food, and a book of plans for constructing rudimentary structures like windmills, hoping that Maggie can turn Hilltop into a thriving community the next time she visits. As Georgie drives off, Enid admits to Michonne she killed the leader of Oceanside, Natanya, and is unsure of how she can know what the right thing is to do. Outside the walls of the Hilltop, Rick spots the Saviors' convoy, and proceeds to chase them down, ramming Negan's car out of the convoy. Rick chases Negan through a desolate town, eventually tipping his car over. Negan flees into an abandoned building; Rick follows him upstairs with walkers following after them. Rick tries to kill Negan with a hatchet. Negan dives for cover but falls into the building's basement after crashing through some of the rotten wood. Rick follows Negan into the basement, finding his bat \\"Lucille\\". As the two play cat-and-mouse in the dark basement, Negan offers Rick to forgo their hostilities with a reduced Savior take as long as he cooperates. Rick rebukes him, knowing that the Scavengers had been wiped out which he believes were by Negan's orders; Negan, who had Simon go make \\"his standard deal\\" with the Scavengers, realizes Simon disobeyed him by killing the Scavengers. To lure Negan out, Rick sets fire to Lucille and uses it to bash through a door that he heard walkers behind. The two fight as walkers swarm them; Negan manages to recover Lucille and get away before Rick can safely escape. In the midst of events, Simon orders the other Saviors to surround the area while he and Dwight go to find Negan. While looking, Simon talks to Dwight, suggesting that they consider Negan may be dead so they can take control of the Saviors and make the group stronger. They find Negan's upturned car, but instead of searching for Negan, Dwight sets fire to it, and they return to rest of their men. Simon takes control, stating that Negan may be dead, and he now plans to \\"expunge\\" the other communities. Elsewhere, Negan wakes up to find that he was taken captive by Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh), holding him at gunpoint. ==ReceptionCritical reception=== \\"The Key\\" received very positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an 83% average rating of 7.77 out of 10, based on 24 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"\\"The Key\\" injects interesting new characters and action into TWD season 8's ongoing arc of betrayal, though the series sorely needs to break some predictable patterns.\\" ===Ratings=== The episode received a total viewership of 6.66 million with a 2.8 rating in adults aged 18–49.

It was released on September 8, 2016 for Windows, OS X and Linux, and October 19, 2017 for iOS. Taking place in a science fiction setting, the player must reclaim and rebuild the derelict ancient space station Halcyon 6 in order to stop an impending alien invasion of Earth. The game received mixed reviews from critics, praising the game's concept but criticizing its slow progression. This caused the game's developers to release an enhanced version, Lightspeed Edition, which decreased the game's length significantly, in addition to adding new features. == Gameplay == The game revolves around managing and building the player's base, which has individual rooms that must be cleared out. To do this the player must gather resources from nearby worlds. They must also deal with attacking enemies such as pirates and aliens entering through portals that must be closed. There are two types of combat, ground and ship-to-ship, both of which operate in the manner of a turn-based RPG. The player can use combos to exploit vulnerabilities and apply status effects. == Development == Halcyon 6 was funded on Kickstarter, where its initial budget was USD $40,000. It ended up making almost $200,000 due to coverage from large gaming sites and promotional assistance from Square Enix Collective. The developers emulated the successful marketing campaigns of Darkest Dungeon and Moon Hunters. Its development team was based in Toronto. The game was inspired by the setting of Star Trek, and by the gameplay of Master of Orion, Jagged Alliance, and Star Control. Its base-building gameplay also took inspiration from XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Combining the individual systems of different genres was stated to be difficult, with the developers going through \\"5 or 6\\" different combat systems. Each aspect of the game was assigned to a different developer. In 2017, the game's developers released Halcyon 6: Lightspeed Edition, which fixed aspects that were criticized about the original game. This included a sped-up and \\"streamlined\\" campaign, slightly increased difficulty and improved combat and UI. It was released for free as a separate game to owners of the original. == Reception == Halcyon 6 received mixed reviews, with an aggregate score of 71/100 on Metacritic. Adam Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun called the game enjoyable, but \\"less than the sum of its parts\\", saying that its mixture of gameplay genres \\"don't quite fit\\" with each other. He described the game's aliens as \\"dangerous [...] but also kind of adorable\\", saying that \\"Halcyon makes cosmic horror cute\\". Jason Bohn of Hardcore Gamer rated the game 4/5, calling it \\"one of those titles that cannot be recommended enough to fans of 4X games, JRPGs or space-based science fiction\\", despite \\"a few small details holding it back\\". Kat Bailey of USgamer rated the game 60/100, calling it \\"flawed but promising\\", praising the game's overall concept and calling its soundtrack \\"phenomenal\\", but criticizing its \\"tedious resource gathering, repetitive combat, and bugs\\". == References  External links == * Category:2016 video games Category:Indie video games Category:IOS games Category:Kickstarter-funded video games Category:Linux games Category:Mac OS games Category:Space opera video games Category:Video games about space warfare Category:Strategy video games Category:Turn-based tactics video games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Windows games ","title":"Halcyon 6"},{"id":"56878960","text":"Rev. Stephen Joseph Herben (11 May 1861 – 22 February 1937) was an editor and clergyman in the Methodist Episcopal Church. Born in London but raised in America, by 1906 he was considered \\"one of the best known men in the Methodist Church\\". In 1931 he conducted the service at the burial of Thomas Edison, a close friend. ==Early life and education== Herben was born in London, England, and moved to the United States as a child, where he attended public schools in Jersey City. Following a move west, he attended Evanston Academy in Illinois, and then in 1889 obtained a Bachelor of Arts from Northwestern University. That year he was ordained to the Methodist Episcopal Church ministry; he continued studies at the Garrett Biblical Institute, and received a Bachelor of Divinity in 1891. Later, he would also receive two honorary degrees: a Doctor of Letters from Syracuse University in 1897, and a Doctor of Divinity from the Garrett Institute in 1904. ==Career== Herben served as the associate editor of The Epworth Herald from 1890 to 1895, and the assistant editor of The New York Christian Advocate from then to 1904; the same year he was elected editor of the Herald, serving for the next eight years. From 1902 to 1904 he also served as the minister of Morrow Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church in Maplewood, New Jersey, and in 1912 he left editorship to take up the pastorate of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Orange, New Jersey. From January 1916 to 1919, he served at the Methodist Episcopal Church in Westfield, New Jersey, excepting a break during which he was commissioned as a captain in the United States military and ministered to those in France. After his 1919 return to the United States, he became the director of the literature department of the Interchurch World Movement, serving through 1920. In 1921 he was then appointed to oversee book publicity for the Methodist Book Concern in New York, a position he held until his 1933 retirement. By 1906 newspapers considered Herben \\"one of the best known men in the Methodist Church\\". He was a close friend of Thomas Edison, and in 1931 conducted the service at his burial. ==Personal life== On 27 May 1891 Herben married Grace Ida Foster, a classmate at Northwestern, in Park Ridge, Illinois. They had two children, George Foster Herben, a physician, and Stephen J. Herben Jr., a philologist who taught at Bryn Mawr College. In later life Stephen Herben returned to Maplewood, where he died of heart disease on 22 February 1937. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Category:1861 births Category:1937 deaths Category:Methodist ministers Category:Northwestern University alumni Category:English emigrants to the United States Category:20th-century American newspaper editors Category:Garrett–Evangelical Theological Seminary alumni Category:American army personnel of World War I Category:United States Army chaplains Category:Herben family ","title":"Stephen J.

In 1919 the State Budget of Azerbaijan amounted to 665 million manats. The bulk of it was replenished by selling oil and levying profit tax, which was 30% then. Other sources of fiscal revenues were excise taxes on the sale of wine, tobacco and oil. The custom services, established in those years, contributed 100 million manats to the treasury. 15 million manats came from duties levied on free trade, freight and passenger transportation. In those years Azerbaijan was a more agrarian country, aimed mainly at animal husbandry. During this period the cattle reached 1 million heads, horses – 150 thousand heads, buffaloes – 300 thousand heads, camels – 12 thousand head, rams and goats 1.5 million heads. Bartering was common in trade and economic relations of the Republic: oil was given in exchange for imported goods. Azerbaijan was paying for military goods, telephone sets, cars, 100 locomotives, 2 thousand tanks, 5 thousand closed wagons, food products of America, France, Italy and other countries mainly with oil, cotton, wool, silk and leather. The export of Azerbaijani oil declined significantly following the revolution in Russia. Because of the closure of the northern market in 1919 only 600 thousand tons of oil were exported from the 3.6 million tons of oil produced. Exporting oil to Europe became possible only after the restoration of the Baku-Batumi oil pipeline in 1919 and construction of the Baku-Julfa railway. In the years 1918-1920 the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan made some changes in the administrative-territorial structure of the country and reorganized financial affairs of the country. == Within the Soviet Union == The shaping of economic structure of the country continued at a slow pace during 1920-1939. The primary economic sectors were oil, gas, chemical, light industries, food processing, machine building and metalworking. In the first years after the Second World War, all the branches of the economy were adjusted to the requirements of the peacetime period. In 1948, the republic's industry produced more goods than in the prewar years. In 1950, the production of industrial goods increased by 39% compared to 1940. In the 1950s and 1960s, the development of Azerbaijan industry was intensified, regional and sectoral structures had been improved. The output of industrial goods increased by 5.5 times in comparison with 1940. 146 large industrial facilities, which amounted to 60% of all constructions, were built and put into production in the years between 1941 and 1970s. Major factories such as the plant for the production of pipes, aluminum and rubber synthesis in Sumqayit, the Ganja aluminum smelter, the Dashkesen ore purification plant, the Mingechaur hydroelectric power station, etc., were built and put into production for the Azerbaijani industry. Thereby the foundation was laid for the development of such industries as heavy industry, energy, chemistry, petrochemistry, oil refining, ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, instrument making and electrical engineering. During these years, a lot of work was done in the direction of profitable placement of industrial sectors and facilities in the country, developing of the regions with a low standard of living, increasing the level of use of labor resources in small and medium-sized cities. == Years of Independence == Since the country's independence in 1991, the Republic of Azerbaijan has embarked on an independent policy in the field of economy. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan's economy had been severely damaged. The poverty rate had reached 49% in 2001. Later Azerbaijan's gross national income (GNI) amounted to $7,350 (2013) per capita, GDP per capita to $7,912.5 (2013), and a poverty rate decreased to 5% in 2013. The exploitation of hydrocarbon resources has played a pivotal role in the economic development of Azerbaijan. The number of agreements with foreign companies and foreign investments had also contributed to the state's economy. Transition to market economy by adopting relevant reforms had also been one of the main objectives of the economic policy. The first period of the economical development of Azerbaijan (from 1991-1995) can be described as the period of economic recession. The period after 1996 can be portrayed as the period of dynamic economic development. Azerbaijan had broad-based economic foundations, which had been developing in different directions before 1991. Independence led to economic decline in Azerbaijan. Many factors caused GDP shrinking until 1996. The situation with Armenia aggravated the economic downturn. In 1994, one of the important oil contracts was signed between Azerbaijan and 13 major oil companies, representing 8 countries of the world. This agreement went down in history as \\"the Contract of Century\\". In the same year, the Presidents of the United States, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan signed inter-State agreement on the construction of oil export pipeline Baku- Tbilisi-Ceyhan. A contract was signed in Baku between BP, Statoil, LUKAgip, Elf Aquitaine (France) (now TOTAL), OIEC (Iran) (now NICO), TPAO and SOCAR on the promising structure of Shah Deniz gas condensate field in 1996. In 1999, the Baku-Supsa oil pipeline was put into operation. The pipeline was built as part of the contract for the development of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli fields.Oil-gas sector contributed to the flourishing of other fields of economy. New reforms and measures were taken to reach macroeconomic and financial stability. During those years, Azerbaijan had joined different international institutions (IMF, World Bank, EBRD, Islam Development Bank, Asian Development Bank). The poverty rate had been decreased from 68% in 1995 to 29% in 2005 due to the economic growth. In 2005, the government decided to revalue the manat at the rate of 5,000 to 1 new manat (AZN). In 2005–2010 years average annual growth rates of \\"oil\\" GDP more than 3.5 times higher than the increase in \\"non-oil\\" GDP. The share of the oil sector in the country's GDP for this period rose from 39 to 60%. Bank loans and incentive measures of the government contributed to the rapid growth of non-oil industries. Significant growth in the construction industry and service sector led to the fact that in 2010, the non-oil sector of Azerbaijan's economy overtook the oil industry in terms of growth rates. 3 five-year programs related to the socio- economic development of the Republic of Azerbaijan were implemented during 2004-2013. These programs were aimed at economic diversification. \\"State Programs for Social and Economic Development for 2014-2018\\", \\"State Programs on Poverty Reduction and Sustainable Development in the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2008-2015\\", \\"State Programs for reliable food supply of the population of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2008-2015\\" and a number of sectoral development programs were implemented to date. A number of socioeconomic region development programs aimed at economic diversification were implemented between 2004 and 2018. The estimates of the Davos World Economic Forum showed that Azerbaijan's economy ranked 38th in the world for the level of competitiveness. == See also == * The Azerbaijan Economy * History of Azerbaijan == References  External links == * Economic Development in Azerbaijan ","title":"Economic history of Azerbaijan"},{"id":"56879043","text":"The John Hutcherson House, in Garrard County, Kentucky near Buckeye, is a historic stone house built around 1800.

In 2007, Georg Nöldeke's contributions to economics of information - in particular on the communication within financial markets - as well as to game theory and contract theory were awarded the Gossen Prize by the German Economic Association. == Biography == After having spent his undergraduate studies at the University of Bonn and at the University of California, Berkeley, Georg Nöldeke earned a diploma in economics from the University of Bonn in 1988. In 1992, after graduate studies at the University of Bonn and at the London School of Economics, he further earned a Ph.D. from the former while simultaneously working there as a teaching and research assistant (1989-92). Following his studies, he became an assistant professor of economics at Princeton University (1992-94) before returning to Bonn in 1994, where he took up the position of an associate professor. Three years later, Nöldeke moved to the University of Basel, where he was made professor of economics (1997-99) and directed the university's graduate studies in economics, before taking up the same position at the University of Bonn two years later (1999-2006). During his tenure at Bonn, he also served as co-director of graduate studies, chairman of the Department of Economics, and Dean of the Faculty of Law and Economics.

It occurs in the eastern Atlantic from Scotland south to Namibia, extending into the western Mediterranean. This bottom dwelling species is sometimes caught as bycatch but is of little interest to fisheries. ==Description== Arnoglossus imperialis is a flatfish which has a short snout, shorter than diameter of eye. The eyes are separated by a bony ridge with the lower eye slightly in front of the upper eye. It has 95-106 rays in its dorsal fin and 74-82 in its anal fin, the males have the second to sixth dorsal fin rays elongated and thickened, in the females and it is the second to fifth. The lateral line has 51-66 scales and curves above the pectoral fin. The eyed side is greyish or brownish in colour with dark, irregular blotches; there are some small spots or blotches on the fins and in males there is a distinct black spot on posterior part of pelvic fins; in females, this spot paler and often quite indistinct. They grow to around to about 25 cm standard length. ==Distribution== Arnoglossus imperialis ranges along much of the eastern Atlantic from Scotland south to Nambia, including the Azores. This species is also found in the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. ==Habitat and biology== Arnoglossus imperialis is found on sandy or muddy bottoms down to a depth of 350m, it can also be found on substrates made of shell or coral The major part of its diet is polychaete worms, although benthic crustaceans are probably also important. Off the coast of Portugal crustaceans of the order Mysidacea were the most important food item preyed on by A imperialis while an earlier study off northern France had found gish to be an important food, especially Callionymus lyra. ==References== Category:Bothidae Category:Fish described in 1810 ","title":"Arnoglossus imperialis"},{"id":"56879313","text":"Fish v. Kobach (officially known since 2019-01-19 as Fish v. Schwab) was a bench trial in United States District Court for the District of Kansas in which five Kansas residents and the League of Women Voters contested the legality of the Documentary Proof of Citizenship (DPOC) requirement of the Kansas Secure and Fair Elections (SAFE) Act, enacted in 2011, which took effect in 2013. Then-Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach claimed these procedures were needed to protect the nation from a supposedly massive problem of vote fraud by people not legally allowed to do so, including 11.3 percent of non-citizens residing in the US amounting to some 3.2 million votes in 2016, greater than Hillary Clinton's lead in the 2016 popular vote. The plaintiffs in this case claimed there was essentially no evidence to support Kobach's allegations. Trial hearings ran from March 6 to 19, 2018, with a contempt hearing for Kobach on March 20 with Chief District Judge Julie A. Robinson presiding. Robinson was appointed to the District court by President George W. Bush in 2001. On May 18 Judge Robinson ruled Kobach in contempt. Final rulings were issued June 18 and 19, 2018. In brief, Judge Robinson found that the defense had presented no credible evidence of the massive problem claimed and instead had erected substantial obstacles to voter registration by people eligible to vote per the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Robinson (2018-06-18, p. 2) She further found defendant Kobach in contempt of court.Robinson (2018-06-18, p. 117) == TimelineMost but not all of this is conveniently summarized in Election law @ Moritz == * 2011-04-18: The Kansas Secure and Fair Elections (SAFE) Act was passed by the Kansas legislature in 2011 and signed by the Governor. * 2016-02-18: The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against it.Election law @ Moritz * 2016-05-17: The United States District Court for the District of Kansas issued a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Documentary Proof of Citizenship (DPOC) provisions of the SAFE act. * 2016-05-24: Kobach appealed this ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. * 2016-10-18: The appellate court upheld the injunction. * 2017-06-23: US Magistrate Judge James P.

Kobach complained that the discussions \\"are relying on numbers that are stale\\". After three days, Robinson said, “We're not going to have a trial by ambush here... You're stuck with what you provided to [the plaintiffs] by the deadline\\". ==Kobach contempt hearing== Secretary Kobach had been fined $1,000 in 2017 for violating previous court orders in this case. In the March 20, 2018, contempt hearing Judge Julie Robinson was visibly agitated when it was revealed that he had still not complied with her 2016 court orders in two specific ways: * In 2016 Judge Robinson ordered Kobach to update the state's election manual to make it clear that newly registered voters are exempt from the state's proof-of-citizenship requirements, at least until there is a different judicial ruling in this case. The manual was taken offline but had not yet been updated. Judge Robinson asked, \\"Isn't one of the advantages of having the manual online is that they can be modified quickly?\\" She later added it was a \\"ridiculous system\\" to take so long to change a few sentences in the manual. * Kobach was also ordered in 2016 to instruct county election officials that the 35,000 Kansans impacted by the new law should receive the same voter instructions as other voters. This order was upheld against Kobach's appeal to the 10th Circuit Appellate Court in Denver. In the March 2018 hearings, Kobach claimed he had given verbal instructions to that effect but acknowledged that some county election offices may not have complied with this ruling. Robinson said that Kobach had assured her in telephone hearings that he had instructed his office to order county election officials to mail the postcards to all voters covered by her order. Kobach claimed she had not put that requirement in writing. She replied, “Why would I order something in writing that you've told me is being taken care of? ... (As an officer of the court) you are under an ethical obligation to tell me the truth.'” On April 18, 2018, Judge Robinson ruled Kobach in contempt. She did not fine him but did order him to pay court costs, including attorney fees for the American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the contempt ruling. Moriah Day, a spokeswoman for Kobach's campaign for governor, said the secretary of state's office would appeal the decision and would have no other comment. Robinson ordered Kobach to pay court costs, including more than $26,000 in attorney fees for the American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the contempt ruling. (Governor Jeff Coyler, who lost to Kobach in the 2018 Republican primary for Governor, said Kobach should be required to personally pay those fees that had been awarded. Secretary Kobach's office said that Kobach is shielded from any such liability.)Colyer says Kobach should personally pay legal fees after trial over Kansas voter law, Kansas City Star, Jonathan Shorman and Hunter Woodall, August 2, 2018. Retrieved October 22, 2018. == Findings of fact and conclusions of law == On June 18 and 19, 2018, Judge Robinson published 118 pages of “Findings of fact and conclusions of law” in this case. In broad strokes, she sided with the plaintiffs on most of the major points in question and with the defense on a few relatively minor points. === Substantive rulings === Most importantly, “the Court finds in favor of the Plaintiffs in the Fish case,” establishing that the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (the “motor voter” act) takes precedence over the Kansas DPOC requirements. In addition, the “Court further finds in favor of Plaintiff Bednasek in his constitutional challenge”, concluding that the DPOC violated the fourteenth amendment. (Bednasek v. Kobach started as a separate case that was later joined to Fish v. Kobach, because of the similarities of the issues involved.) “Further, the Court imposes specific compliance measures given the Defendant's history of non- compliance with this Court's orders. And the Court imposes sanctions responsive to Defendant's repeated and flagrant violations of discovery and disclosure rules.”Robinson (2018-06-18, pp. 2-3) In particular, “Defendant shall strictly comply with the directives in this Order meant to enforce the Court's permanent injunction of the DPOC law and K.A.R. sec. 7-23-15. It is further ordered that Defendant shall attend 6 hours [of continuing legal education (CLE) on civil rules of procedure or evidence] in addition to any other CLE education required by his law license for the 2018-2019 reporting year.”Robinson (2018-06-18, p. 118) === Lesser findings and rulings === Defendant Nick Jordan, Kansas Secretary of Revenue, was dismissed from the case.Robinson (2018-06-19) Mr. Fish's complaint was declared moot, because “in September or October 2016, he relocated within Douglas County and changed his address with the DOV in person. ... He is now registered to vote ... not due to the Court’s preliminary injunction, but his voluntary action of reapplying to register to vote at which time he provided DPOC.\\"Robinson (2018-06-28, p. 79) Judge Robinson further generally found the plaintiff's expert witnesses credible while expert witnesses for the defense were often found to be not credible. For example, “Defendant's expert Hans von Spakovsky is a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, 'a think tank whose mission [is to] formulate and promote conservative public policies. ... [He] cited a U.S. GAO study for the proposition that the GAO 'found that up to 3 percent of the 30,000 individuals called for jury duty from voter registration roles over a two-year period in just one U.S. district court were not U.S. citizens.' On cross-examination, however, he acknowledged that he omitted the following facts: the GAO study contained information on a total of 8 district courts; 4 of the 8 reported that there was not a single non-citizen who had been called for jury duty; and the 3 remaining district courts reported that less than 1% of those called for jury duty from voter rolls were noncitizens. Therefore, his report misleadingly described the only district court with the highest percentage of people reporting that they were noncitizens, while omitting mention of the 7 other courts described in the GAO report, including 4 that had no incidents of noncitizens on the rolls.A careful researcher may wish to see the exact passage summarized in Mr. von Spakovsky's testimony and Judge Robinson's evaluation thereof. The relevant passage in the GAO report can be found on pp. 42-43 (47-48 of 71 in the pdf) of : \\"[F]ederal jury administrators in eight U.S. district courts provided either exact numbers or estimates [of the number of non-citizens among people called for jury duty]. Of the eight district courts, four federal jury administrators said no one had been disqualified from jury service because they were not U.S. citizens. In the other four district courts: * a federal jury administrator in one U.S. district court estimated that 1 to 3 percent of the people out of a jury pool of 30,000 over 2 years (about 300 to 900 people) said they were not U.S. citizens; * a federal jury administrator in a second U.S. district court estimated that less than 1 percent of the people out of a jury pool of 35,000 names each month (less than 350 people) said they were not U.S. citizens; * a federal jury administrator in a third U.S. district court estimated that about 150 people out of a jury pool of 95,000 names over 2 years said they were not U.S. citizens [less than 0.2 percent]; and * a federal jury administrator in a fourth U.S. district court estimated that annually about 5 people typically claimed non-citizenship in a jury pool of about 50,000 individuals [0.01 percent]. ... While [Mr. von Spakovsky's] lack of academic background is not fatal to his credibility ...., his clear agenda and misleading statements ... render his opinions unpersuasive. In contrast, Plaintiffs offered Dr. Lorraine Minnite, an objective expert witness, who provided compelling testimony about Defendant's claims of noncitizen registration. Dr. Minnite ... has extensively researched and studied the incidence and effect of voter fraud in American elections. Her published research on the topic spans over a decade and includes her full-length, peer reviewed book, The Myth of Voter Fraud, for which Dr. Minnite has received grants and professional distinctions, and numerous articles and chapters in edited volumes. ... Notably, Dr. Minnite testified that when she began researching the issue of voter fraud, ..., she began with a 'blank slate' about the conclusions she would ultimately draw from the research. ... Although she admits that noncitizen registration and voting does at times occur, Dr. Minnite testified that there is no empirical evidence to support Defendant's claims in this case that noncitizen registration and voting in Kansas are largescale problems. ... [M]any of these cases reflect isolated incidents of avoidable administrative errors ... and / or misunderstanding on the part of applicants. ... For example, 100 individuals in ELVIS [the Kansas Election Voter Information System] have birth dates in the 1800s, indicating that they are older than 118. And 400 individuals have birth dates after their date of registration, indicating they registered to vote before they were born.\\"Robinson (2018-06-28, pp. 52-58) === Magnitude of the problems === \\"The voting rate among purported noncitizen registrations on [a Kansas temporary drivers license] match list is around 1%, whereas the voting rate among registrants in Kansas more generally is around 70%.”Robinson (2018-06-28, pp. 52-58) Beyond noting that only about 1% of registrants purported to be noncitizens actually voted, the court found that \\"31,089 total applicants ... were denied registration for failure to provide DPOC, ... [which] represented 12.4% of new voter registrations between January 1, 2013 and December 11, 2015\\", the cutoff date for confidential ELVIS data provided to plaintiff's expert witness, Dr. Michael McDonald, an Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Florida and a leading scholar on American elections, voter registration, and factors affecting voter behavior and turnout.Robinson (2918-06-18, pp. 26-28) By comparison, \\"Defendant already has prosecutorial authority over Kansas election crimes. Yet, since obtaining this authority, and despite claiming to have located 129 instances of noncitizen registration in Kansas, Defendant has filed zero criminal complaints against noncitizens for registering to vote.\\"Robinson (2020-06-18, p. 93) But \\"looking closely at those [129] records reduces that number to 67 at most. Even these 67 instances are a liberal estimate because it includes attempted registrations after the DPOC law was passed, a larger universe than what the Tenth Circuit asked the Court to evaluate. Only 39 successfully registered to vote. ... And several of the individual records of those who registered or attempted to register show errors on the part of State employees, and/or confusion on the part of applicants.\\" Moreover, those 39 represent only \\"0.002% of all registered voters in Kansas as of January 1, 2013 (1,762,330). Defendant Kobach “insists that [published numbers of noncitizens voting] are just 'the tip of the iceberg.' This trial was his opportunity to produce credible evidence of that iceberg, but he failed to do so. ... Instead, the Court draws the more obvious conclusion that there is no iceberg; only an icicle, largely created by confusion and administrative error.”Robinson (2018-06-28, pp. 87-89). === Summary of impact on democracy in Kansas === The court found that \\"31,089 total applicants ... were denied registration for failure to provide DPOC, ... [which] represented 12.4% of new voter registrations between January 1, 2013 and December 11, 2015\\".Robinson (2918-06-18, pp. 26-28) Meanwhile, Kansas Secretary of State Kobach, who claimed this was a massive problem, provided evidence of only 39 cases of non- citizens having registered to vote in Kansas, which represented only \\"0.002% of all registered voters\\".Robinson (2018-06-28, pp. 87-89). == References == * * Election law @ Moritz: * * ==Notes * Kansas voting trial over.

It is situated at the border between the villages of Barangay 187 and Barangay 188 (Zone 16, District I) in the former Tala Estate in North Caloocan close to the boundary with San Jose del Monte, Bulacan. The park is one of three city-owned parks in Caloocan under the management of the Caloocan Parks Administration Services, the others being the Buena Park and Sports Complex in South Caloocan and the Caloocan Amparo Nature Park in eastern Tala, North Caloocan. The park occupies the central section of the former friar estate known as Hacienda Tala in the old municipality of Novaliches. This estate was purchased by the Philippine Commonwealth government under President Manuel Luis Quezon in 1938 for use as a leper colony to decongest and eventually replace the San Lazaro Hospital for Hansenites in Manila. The Central Luzon Leprosarium, built in 1940, was eventually reduced to an area of in 1971 through Proclamation No. 843 issued by President Ferdinand Marcos which set aside for the National Housing Authority, for the Caloocan local government for use as a civic center containing its city hall, public high school, stadia and park to be located at its geographic center, for the Department of Social Welfare and Development bordering the planned civic center, and the remaining for housing and resettlement sites to be administered by the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation. Glorieta Park is at the junction of Uyguanco Avenue and Langit Road and is the largest open space and recreation area in Barangay 187. It features a children's playground and the Glorieta Multi-Purpose Gymnasium, a covered court formerly known as the Glorieta Kiosk. The Our Lady of Holy Rosary Parish Church borders the park to the north. It is also the location of the Tala Health Center, the Tala Post Office, the Tala United Methodist Church and Holy Rosary College. The barangay hall of Barangay 187 lies immediately to the east on Uyguanco Avenue. It is accessible from the Caloocan districts of Camarin and Bagong Silang on the south and west via the Zabarte/Old Zabarte Road and Langit Road, and from Novaliches, Greater Lagro and Fairview on the east and southeast via Quirino Highway and Uyguanco Avenue. In February 2012, as part of the city's 50th anniversary, the Caloocan City Government under Mayor Enrico Echiverri hosted a mass wedding at the Glorieta Park wherein a total of 1,510 couples were wed in an attempt to beat India's Guinness record for holding the world's largest mass wedding. In October 2015, Mayor Oscar Malapitan formally inaugurated the Glorieta Amphitheater within the park which has a seating capacity of 1,500 and which will serveas a venue to showcase the talents and skills of Caloocanians. The amphiteater, which cost to build, was approved in the 2014 Caloocan City Supplemental Budget No. 14 under its Sangguniang Panlungsod Ordinance No. 0541. Under the Caloocan City Comprehensive Development Plan 2017–2019, the Caloocan local government plans to construct additional sports facilities within the park, as well as a lagoon and fountain at the left and right side of the covered court, and a perimeter fence with lamp posts. The plan also includes the installation of a permanent front and back door access to the park for VIP use. ==Gallery== {  File:9848Caloocan City Barangays Landmarks 11.jpgThe Glorieta Multi-Purpose Gymnasium File:9862Caloocan City Barangays Landmarks 13.jpgChildren's playground File:47Tala Caloocan City Buildings Church 33.jpgOur Lady of the Holy Rosary Parish Church } ==See also== * List of parks in Metro Manila ==References== Category:Parks in Metro Manila Category:Buildings and structures in Caloocan ","title":"Glorieta Park"},{"id":"56879337","text":"Wojciech Świętosławki - Polish physical chemist, chairman of the TKDN, later cabinet minister Temporary Advisory and Scientific Committee (, TKDN) was established in 1933 under the patronage of the Ministry of Military Affairs in Poland.

It has between four and six linear leaves and up to eight pale yellow to cream-coloured flowers with reddish markings. It is only known from near the Arrowsmith River north of Eneabba. ==Description== Diuris eburnea is a tuberous, perennial herb with between four and six linear leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Up to eight pale yellow to cream-coloured flowers with reddish markings, long and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long, wide and curves upwards. The lateral sepals are oblong, long, wide and turned downwards, parallel to or crossed over each other. The petals are more or less erect and spread apart from each other, egg-shaped to elliptic, long and wide on a purplish brown stalk long. The labellum is long, turns slightly downwards and has three lobes.

She has worked her entire teaching career of 12 years at Alperton Community School and was promoted to Deputy Head of Art within a year of her arrival. She is now Associate Deputy Headteacher leading on staff professional development. She is married to a fitness instructor and has two daughters. ==The school== Alperton Community School is a coeducational secondary school situated in the northwest of London with a student intake that reflects a variety of backgrounds. There are about 130 languages spoken in the London Borough of Brent and Ms Zafirakou has taught herself the basic phrases used by children in about 35 of them - including Hindi, Gujarati and Tamil - in an effort to build links with her pupils and their families. [1] > “By getting pupils to open up about their home lives, I discovered that many > of my students come from crowded homes where multiple families share a > single property.” Ms Zafirakou said. > “It’s often so crowded and noisy I’ve had students tell me they have to do > their homework in the bathroom, just to grab a few moments alone so they can > concentrate.” > “What is amazing is that whatever issues they are having at home, whatever > is missing from their life or causing them pain, our school is theirs.” Zafirakou organised extra lessons during the day and the weekend, including giving pupils a quiet place to work. ==Teaching philosophies== > “(Teaching) it’s all about building relationships.

And then everything else can happen.” When a child comes into a big frightening secondary school and the teacher greets them in their own language the child is won over, and the parents are won over too and will come into school when requested. Ms Zafirakou started with art, seeing it as a language-free method of communication. She would introduce children to the art of their own culture before relating it to the white western art movements prescribed in the National Curriculum. She was aware about the levels of deprivation suffered by her pupils, with multiple families living in one house running a rota on when they may use the kitchen or bathroom. She created space for children to work after school and introduced classes on wellbeing and yoga. The curriculum was altered to make many subjects more applied rather than theoretical. ==See also== * Hanan Al Hroub ==References * Meet the winner of the Global Teacher Prize 2018; globalteacherprize.org Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Artists from London Category:English women educators Category:People from the London Borough of Brent Category:Recipients of the Global Teacher Prize Category:Schoolteachers from London ","title":"Andria Zafirakou"},{"id":"56879696","text":"The 2005 Humboldt State Lumberjacks football team represented Humboldt State University during the 2005 NCAA Division II football season.

The branch originated in the 17th century and still exists today. During the last two centuries, a number of members of the lineage have achieved prominence in different domains of public life including theatre and cinema director Luchino Visconti. ==Origins== The Visconti di Modrone descend from Uberto, younger brother of Matteo Visconti, Lord of Milan between 1287 and 1322. Since the main residence of the first generations of Uberto's offspring was in the castle of Somma Lombardo, they were known by the surname of Visconti di Somma. In 1473, the castle and other family properties were divided by the two brothers Francesco and Guido Visconti di Somma. In 1683, Niccolò Visconti, a descendant of Guido, married Teresa Modroni, originating the Visconti di Modrone lineage. The origins of the Visconti di Modrone can be recognised in their current peerages. The title of Count of Lonate Pozzolo traces back to the properties and noble rights in Lonate Pozzolo, a few kilometres south of Somma Lombardo, received by Guido Visconti di Somma in the division with his brother Francesco. ==History== Veduggio The entrance to Grazzano Visconti In 1778, Francesco Antonio Visconti di Modrone, grandson of Niccolò, obtained the title of Marquess of Vimodrone. In 1813, the title of Duke Visconti di Modrone was granted by Napoleon to Carlo Visconti di Modrone (1770–1836). Between 1884 and 1890, a family mausoleum was erected at Cassago Brianza. Its appearance, inspired by the dome and the spires of the Milan Cathedral, has become part of the local landscape. During the 19th and 20th centuries, industrial undertakings were started by different family members around Milan: silk production in Canegrate, a weaving plant in San Vittore Olona, a bleaching factory in Somma Lombardo, and a cotton mill in Vaprio d'Adda. At the beginning of the 20th century, Giuseppe Visconti di Modrone (1879–1941), the father of Luchino Visconti, renovated a group of hovels and old stables surrounding the family castle located from Piacenza in the municipality of Vigolzone, transforming them into a village of Middle Age aspect named Grazzano Visconti. In 1937, the title of Duke of Grazzano Visconti was granted to Giuseppe Visconti by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. ==Notable Members== Some members of this branch were: * Uberto Visconti di Modrone (1871–1923), entrepreneur * Marcello Visconti di Modrone (1898–1964), son of Uberto * (1901–1942) * Luchino Visconti di Modrone (1906–1976), theatre, opera and film director * Eriprando Visconti di Modrone (1932–1995), director * , set decorator in the Academy awards nominated 2017 Call Me by Your Name (film) == References == ","title":"Visconti di Modrone"},{"id":"56879753","text":"José Erasmo Janer Gironella (1833-1911) was a Spanish entrepreneur and politician.

Historians note that as tycoons of new bourgeoisie the Janers and the Gónimas were Liberals,one author claims that Liberalism was naturally the option embraced by a new breed of Catalan industrialists, including the ancestors of Janer Gironella, Wray McDonogh 2014, pp. 148, 161 while the Gironellas were even related to the revolutionary exaltado version of Spanish liberalism.the maternal uncle, Antonio Gironella Ayguals, was a revolutionary Exaltado at one point deported to the Canary Islands; he was the co-founder of a masonic lodge, see La finca de Gironella, [in:] Historia Sarria service, available here One source claims that during the First Carlist War his father joined the liberal Barcelona juntasManuel Santirso Rodríguez, Gerifaltes de antanó. Los señores catalanes en el primer carlismo, [in:] Militars. Espai i História XXIII (2000), p. 152 while another one states that in the mid-1840s he was a Traditionalist,Creixell, Sala 2005, p. 189 which might point to not an unusual conservative evolution of certain section of the Moderados. One author notes that Janer himself sort of neared Traditionalist outlook during his academic years,La Defensa 19.03.11, available here yet his first public engagements did not demonstrate such a penchant. In the late 1850s and early 1860s he was noted for engagement in various institutions related to local business, recorded as member of Instituto Agrícola CatalanRevista de agricultura práctica, economía rural, horticultura y jardineria, Barcelona 1855, available here; during the lifetime of his father and for some time afterwards in the press Janer Gironella was referred to as \\"José de Janer\\", probably to avoid confusion with his father, usually noted as \\"Erasmo de Janer\\"; it was only later that he started to feature as \\"José Erasmo de Janer\\" and eventually as \\"Erasmo de Janer\\" and an insurance company La ProvidenciaEl Lloyd Español 12.08.62, available here or sitting in the board of Asociación de Socorros y Protección a la Clase Obrera y JornaleraLa Corona 25.02.63, available here and in Junta de Patronato of his Barcelona borough.La Corona 19.06.63, available here One source claims he initially practiced as a lawyer.B. de Artagan [Reynaldo Brea], Políticos del carlismo, Barcelona 1912, p. 272 In the mid-1860s Janer was first noted running for public office, as propietario and haciendario competing for the concejal post in the Barcelona ayuntamiento;La Corona 01.11.64, available here there is no confirmation of his success. It seems that during final years of the Isabelline monarchy he neared the entourage of the then capitán general of Catalonia and the Conservative politician, Juan de la Pezuela; Janer used to address him in public homage lettersDiario de Córdoba 18.08.68, available here and was nominated by Pezuela to the last Isabelline city council, where he was sitting as the youngest concejal until the body was dissolved during the 1868 revolution.La Defensa 19.03.11, available here Tirso Olazábal One author claims that Janer passed from Conservative to Carlist position when faced with the revolutionary developments of the late 1860s.Melchor Ferrer, Historia del tradicionalismo español, vol. 28, Sevilla 1959, p. 293 Some sources maintain he fielded his candidature in elections to the Constituent Assembly of 1869 and indeed in 1871 he was already reported as nominated by the regional Carlist junta as their representative in the Cortes elections from Sant Feliu de Llobregat,La Independencia 20.02.71, available here the bid which proved unsuccessful. In 1872 Janer became president of Círculo Católico-Monárquico in BarcelonaArtagan 1912, p. 272 and entered the provincial party executive, noted as member of the Barcelona Junta Provincial Católico-Monárquica. In the council he was sitting with his father-in-law, Manuel Milá de la Roca,La Regeneración 02.03.72, available here and forged the lifelong friendship with the junta leader and later Catalan Carlist leader, Luis de Llauder y Dalmases. Following outbreak of the Third Carlist War Janer found himself the target of Republican persecutions and had to flee the city a number of times.Erasme de Janer i de Gónima entry, [in:] Gran Enciclopédia Catalana online, available here l Eventually with his familywhen in France during the Third Carlist War Janer was accompanied at least by 2 children, Edina Polácska, Karlista emigráció Franciaországban (1872–1876) [PhD dissertation University of Szeged], Szeged 2008, p. 40 he sought exile in France and settled in Saint Jean de Luz.La Defensa 19.03.11, available here According to one source he joined a small team, led by Tírso de Olazábal and busy procuring arms for the Carlist troops;La Defensa 19.03.11 it is likely that taking advantage of his wealth, Janer contributed financially.a number of sources claim vaguely that Janer dedicated his fortune to the Carlist cause, yet none of them provides any details, compare Erasme de Janer i de Gónima entry, [in:] Gran Enciclopédia Catalana online, available here, Wray McDonogh 2014, p. 159, Gemma Tribó Travería, El naixament de la fira i els grans propietaris, [in:] L'Espai 2 (1999), p. 72, Creixell, Sala 2005, p. 181 ==In the second row (1877-1888)== El Correo Catalan logotypes It is not clear whether Janer's massive property was embargoed during the war, whether he suffered any other persecutions and when he returned to Barcelona after the Carlist military defeat. A number of sources point vaguely to the late 1870s when claiming that together with Milá de la Roca and Llauder Janer was among co-founders of a new Carlist daily which would remain in print for the following 60 years, El Correo Catalan.El Norte 30.07.10, available here, Artagan 1912, p. 272 In 1879 he entered the Barcelona ayuntamientoDiari Catalá 30.05.79, available here, see also Cèlia Cañelles Julià, Rosa Toran, Els governs de la ciutat de Barcelona (1875-1930): Eleccions, partits i regidors. Diccionari biografic, Barcelona 2014, available online here yet duration of his term is not known; except an 1888 spell in Junta MunicipalLa Dinastía 17.08.88, available here it proved to be a unique Janer's episode in official administration. In the 1880s he was noted rather for looking after his family enterprises, especially in Caja de Ahorros.La Dinastía 08.03.84, available here However, some scholars claim that he demonstrated neither interest nor skills in commercial activities and that during his tenure the family business went into decline;Ceixell, Sala 2005, p. 181; the authors claim that Janer Gironella did not demonstrate much interest in family business. His stand gave rise to \\"three generations theory\\", namely that a family business can be sustained and developed during 3 generations only some go as far as to claim that to sustain the Carlist cause he kept selling off his private propertyin the early 20th century Janer Gironella sold his rural property in Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Tribó Travería 1999, p. 72 or even that he ruined his fortune with the legitimist zeal.Wray McDonogh 2014, p. 159 Janer was also known for engagement in numerous public initiatives, often flavored with charity: he held executive or presidential positions in Junta de Obra, Junta de la Beneficiencia in his Nuestra Señora del Carmen parish, Real Archicofradía de la Virgén de los Dolores,Artagan 1912, p. 272 Junta Local de Salvament de NáufragsCañelles Julià, Toran 2014 and various makeshift committees, e.g. the body assisting victims of the 1885 earthquake in Andalusia.La Ilustración 11.01.85, available here Lluís Llauder Dalmases In the 1880s Carlism did not exist as organized structures present in the Spanish public life; the movement languished as a set of loose quasi-political initiatives flavored with Traditionalist spirit and intransigent religiosity. Part of this strategy was mobilizing support by means of mass pilgrimages; Janer contributed as member of the Barcelona Junta Organizativa branch, which co-ordinated the 1882 romería to Rome.El Siglo Futuro 14.01.82, available here Adhering to the same line he used to sign various public letters denouncing perceived injustice to the Catholics and secular course of the government, e.g. the entire Janer family subscribed to an 1883 document which protested curtailment of Catholic rights;El Siglo Futuro 14.06.83, available here in 1884 he emerged as leader of the Catalan branch of Asociación Católica.Cañelles Julià, Toran 2014 Stress on religious features, focus on Traditionalist values and de-emphasizing of dynastical threads was very much the vision of the Carlist political leader Candido Nocedal and later his son Ramón. Janer seemed on perfect terms with bothcompare his taking part in initiatives of Nocedal and Sarda y Salvany, El Ancora 17.01.82, available here despite the fact that the Nocedalistas, known also as Integrists, were increasingly on collision course with the claimant Don Carlos; as late as in 1886 Janer took part in a homage banquet honoring Ramón Nocedal.El Siglo Futuro 10.03.86, available here However, when in 1888 the Integrists broke away from Carlism to form their own Traditionalist organization Janer decided to stay loyal to his king; in 1889 he was already lambasted by the Integrists as the sidekick of Llauder.La Fidelidad Castellana 20.05.89, available here ==Deputy leader (1889-1901)== Marques de Cerralbo Following the Integrist secession Carlism abandoned its quasi-political format of the 1880s and assumed a decisively more active political stance; the nationwide structures started to emerge, initially styled as committees celebrating 1,400 years since the Conversion of Recaredo. In Catalonia the organization was headed by Llauder, yet Janer – together with Manuel de Torrents – was nominated its vice-president, effectively the second-in-command in the regional party infrastructure.Jordi Canal, El carlisme catala dins l'Espanya de la restauracio: un assaig de modernització politica (1888-1900), Barcelona 1998, , p. 79 However, his contribution to Carlist buildup seems meager. Though Carlist candidates started to take part in electoral campaigns and under the new nationwide leadership of Marqués de Cerralbo the movement took shape of an organized modern political party, there is little information on Janer's public activity in the early 1890s. Despite consolidation and growth of Catalan Carlism under the regional leadership of Llauder, Janer neither stood as candidate in elections nor was recorded as active in supporting electoral campaigns. While de Cerralbo was striving to implement a new formula of mass mobilizationon the new format of Carlism as build by de Cerralbo see Agustín Fernández Escudero, El marqués de Cerralbo (1845-1922): biografía politica [PhD thesis], Madrid 2012 Janer seemed attached rather to old-style patterns and at best took part in closed-door party feasts, like the one in 1893.El Correo Español 14.02.93, available here His popular initiatives stuck to the pilgrimage format, e.g. when organizing workers' romería to Rome in 1894El Correo Español 22.02.94, available here or signing homage letter to the papal nuncio; the document protested the governmental secularization policy.La Dinastía 28.10.94, available here Don Carlos In 1895 Janer was officially confirmed by de Cerralbo as vice-president of the Catalan Carlist organization,El Baluarte 10.10.95, available here yet he still remained in the shadow of Llauder. He was barely mentioned when new party círculos in the region were being opened, typically noted when presiding over official banquetsCanal 1998, p. 177 or entertaining royal Carlist figures, e.g. the second wife of the claimant Berthe do Rohan, who visited Barcelona in 1896.El Correo Español 16.12.96, available here Though historiographic studies either on Catalana monograph on Catal Carlism during the late 19th century mentions Janer only 2 times in rather episodical roles, see Canal 1998 or nationwide Carlismthe work nearest to the overall history of late 19th century Carlism does not mention Janer at all, compare Fernández Escudero 2012 of the 1890s barely mention his name, de Cerralbo was apparently satisfied with Janer's contribution to the cause; Jefe Delegado addressed him with effusive letters of gratitude and thanked him for electoral efforts;Correo de Tortosa 28.9.96 press of the era provides little evidence of such support.El Correo Español 18.09.96 Actually, it seems that in the late 1890s the Catalan Carlism was vibrant yet increasingly leaderless and disorganized. Since 1898 due to his poor health Llauder's leadership became largely theoretical, while the movement was plagued by personal squabbles, emerging social radicalism, urban pistolerismo, Catalanist sympathies and insurrectional currents. None of the sources consulted mentions Janer when discussing the local 1899-1900 Carlist revolts in Catalonia.Janer is not a single time mentioned in works dealing in detail with the Carlist conspiracy and revolts of 1899-1900, see Joan Villarroya i Font, 1900. Els carlins a l'assalt de Badalona, [in:] Carrer dels Abres 1 (1990), pp. 69-76, Eduardo González Calleja, Jordi Canal, No era la ocasión propicia..... La conspiración carlista de fin de siglo en un memorial a don Carlos, [in:] Hispania 181 (1992), pp. 705-742, Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, Las derechas españólas ante la crisis del 98, [in:] Studia Historica 15 (1997), pp. 193-219 The press noted that in the very first years of the 20th century the Catalan Carlism was led by 3 competitive juntas: 1) the old one headed by Llauder, 2) the new one appointed by recently nominated Jefe Delegado Matiás Barrio and headed by Duque de Solferino, and 3) the one associated with general Moore, headed by Janer;Luz Católica 10.04.02, available here this claim is not confirmed by other sources. Following the death of Llauder and despite rumors pointing to Solferino, following Janer's visit to Don Carlos' residence in VeniceLa Correspondencia de España 09.06.03, available here in 1902 the claimant nominated him the new Catalan leader.La Epoca 02.07.02, available here ==Jefe (1902-1910)== Carlist standard Janer's tenure fell on a period when Catalan Carlism was challenged by massive social and political change, the decade which shifted the region's centre of gravity from rural traditional hinterland to the coastal strip, dominated by new urban classes. The rising Catalanist and anti-establishment tide gave rise to Solidaridad Catalana; on the one hand the Carlists were attracted by its opposition to the Restoration regime, on the other they were estranged by Republican, nationalist and secularist features of the alliance. Janer, who in 1903-1905 limited himself to making appointmentsLa Lucha 13.07.05, available here and presiding over party feasts,La Correspondencia de España 18.05.93, available here in 1906 gave in to the pressure of pro-Solidaridad Carlists like Solferino and Junyent and permitted access to the pact. His key concern was that only authorized individuals were allowed to stand on joint electoral listsEl Correo Español 09.05.06, available here and that the move did not go beyond a temporary tactical cooperation.La Tarde 02.04.07, available here Faced with anti-Solidaridad opposition in the party rankse.g. the Catalan branch of Juventud Carlista protested to Janer over taking part in alliance with overtly pro-republican and secular zealots, La Cruz 17.04.07, available here he enforced disciplineAlbert Balcells, Joan B. Culla, Conxita Mir, Les eleccions generals a Catalunya de 1901 a 1923, Barcelona 1982, pp. 122-123; in 1908 Janer dissolved a local branch for opposition to official policy, La Correspondencia de España 12.09.98, available here yet it seems he kept vacillating himself.the press provides conflicting evidence of Janer's stand towards Solidaridad, compare El Intransigente 09.04.07, available here, La Tarde 02.04.07, available here, La Reconquista 06.04.07, available here, La Lucha 07.04.07, available here Carlist access was rewarded with great success in the 1907 electionsthe claimant congratulated Janer on excellent electoral results, La Lucha 11.05.07, available here but it seems that Janer had few regrets when the alliance fell apart in 1908, even though debates persisted until 1909.in 1909 Solferino resigned from provincial Barcelona jefatura due to differences with Janer over strategy for forthcoming elections, El Siglo Futuro 01.12.09, available here, El Restaurador 01.12.09, available here Another problem Janer had to face as a regional leader was the insurrectional tide, rising among the Catalan Carlists. Though the 1900 preparations boiled down to few isolated attempts some sections of the party kept gearing up for a violent overthrow of the regime.

The film is co-written by Mridul George and stars Tovino Thomas and Ahaana Krishna in lead roles. Debutantes Nimish Ravi and Nikhil Venu handles the cinematography and editing departments respectively. Sooraj S. Kurup is the music director. ==Plot== The film starts off with an unexpected event that sets in motion an investigation by police officer Akbar (Nithin George). A diary that Akbar reads takes the audience through the lives of Luca (Tovino Thomas) and Niharika (Ahaana Krishna), with the diary playing the role of a storyteller. Luca is a talented scrap artist with a very small circle of friends. Luca does not know how to control his anger and he expresses them in violent streaks when something irritates him. The film is set against the backdrop of Kochi Biennale and Luca locks horns with Niharika when she passes simple remarks about his installation. She later seeks his forgiveness and moves into his home as a paying guest and from there develops a very close relationship and an encompassing love. He had mental problems after his mother's passing away and still has fear of anything that is related to death (Necrophobia), and partly arts were a distraction from these aspects. Niharika after knowing this takes on the role of a calming figure for him when he simmers with anger and becomes his guiding strength ready to brave every storm that threatens them to any ‘end’. Whenever Luca has panic attacks about death-related matters, Niharika becomes his comfort. Niharika was abused in her childhood by a close relative and that has left a permanent emotional scar. Luca becomes the loving force that fills her emptiness. Their dreamy world shatters when Luca is diagnosed with stage four cancer. Akbar going through the chain of events in Luca's and Niha's begone lives begins to be affected. Akbar was fighting his own demons with a prior failed relationship and at an impending divorce with his wife Fathima (Vinitha Koshy). Luca’s and Niharika’s romantic story changes him at some point, while he solves his case. It is later revealed during investigation that Niha being a chemistry student makes a poison herself after going back to Bangalore and applies poison in her diary which Luca longed to read. Luca had a habit of turning pages with the help of saliva keeping this in mind Niha did so. She couriers this diary to him, which he read the way she had imagined and he died peacefully without any pain or discomfort; thereby protecting him from all the worldly pains by going to an extreme extent, as she had mentioned to him previously .https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/290619/luca- movie-review-the-lead-pair-dazzles-in-luca.html ==Cast== * Tovino Thomas as Luca * Ahaana Krishna as Niharika Banerjee a.k.a Niha **Hansika Krishna as young Niharika * Nithin George as Akbar Hussein * Anwar Shereef as Aloshi * Neethu Bala as Jannet *Rajesh Sharma as Sivan Ashan *Vinitha Koshy as Fathima *Sooraj S Kurup as Sooraj * Shalu Rahim as Rohan * Chembil Ashokan as Martin *Devi Ajith as Forensic surgeon *Jaffer Idukki as Antony *Neena Kurup as Adv.

Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion South wrote \\"But even if Luca never becomes the Great Love Story the makers were trying for, it’s an easy watch. The sensuality of the imagery has an almost tactile quality.

Oxygenic photogranules (OPGs) are a type of biological aggregate with an approximately spherical form, typically from a millimeter to a centimeter scale. OPGs are characterized by the cloth- like layer of phototrophic organisms, predominantly filamentous cyanobacteria of the order Oscillatoriales. Oxygen production by these phototrophs through photosynthesis is typically coupled to oxygen consumption of heterotrophic biomass, releasing CO2 that is presumably utilised in a syntrophic relationship by autotrophic phototrophs. Cross section of an OPG cultivated under static conditions Cross section of an OPG under fluorescence light == Discovery/Context == In 2011, Park and Dolan first observed the transformation of activated sludge into oxygenic photogranule (OPG).,Park C, Dolan S. Algal- sludge granule for wastewater treatment and bioenergy feedstock generation. Patent Cooperation Treaty WO 2015112654 A2, 2015. when incubated in unagitated and sealed vials exposed to natural light for several months. Since then, this static cultivation of OPG was observed with activated sludge coming from various places over the worldMilferstedt, K., Kuo-Dahab, W.C., Butler, C.S., Hamelin, J., Abouhend, A.S., Stauch-White, K., McNair, A., Watt, C., Carbajal-González, B.I., Dolan, S., Park, C., 2017.

OPGs were discovered recently and serendipitously in laboratory conditions, but very similar granules, called cryoconites, are found in glaciersChristner, B.C., Kvitko, B.H., Reeve, J.N., 2003. Molecular identification of Bacteria and Eukarya inhabiting an Antarctic cryoconite hole. Extremophiles 7, 177–183. doi:10.1007/s00792-002-0309-0 == Formation of oxygenic photogranules == Anaerobic and aerobic granule formation are typically postulated to be driven by hydrodynamic shear and washout. Oxygenic photogranules do form when exposed to hydrodynamic shear in sequencing batch reactors; however, they also form under static batch&. They can form over the course of several weeks from a source of activated sludge exposed to light. How oxygenic photogranules form is far from understood, but filamentous and motile cyanobacteria seem to play an essential role in their formation. Cyanobacteria are enriched from the activated sludge and form the outer layer of photogranules that gives structural integrity for both photogranules generated under hydrodynamic and static conditions. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the initial presence of inorganic nitrogen in the activated sludge inoculum promotes cyanobacterial growth over microalgal growth, resulting in successful oxygenic photogranules.Stauch-White, K., Srinivasan, V. N., Kuo-Dahab, W. C., Park, C. & Butler, C. S. The role of inorganic nitrogen in successful formation of granular biofilms for wastewater treatment that support cyanobacteria and bacteria. AMB Express 7, 146 (2017). Oxygenic photogranule formation is thus not driven by hydrodynamic shear and washout are not required for the formation of oxygenic photogranules, even though these factors may play an important role when applied. Filamentous, motile cyanobacteria play a key role, but exact mechanisms have to be elucidated to be able to control the formation and properties of oxygenic photogranules and apply them to bioengineering processes. Temporal progression of photogranulation under static conditions. == Oxygenic photogranules applied to wastewater treatment == Oxygenic photogranules is a new type of biogranules that has not been applied in bioengineering processes yet.Milferstedt, K., Hamelin, J., Park, C., Jung, J., Hwang, Y., Cho, S.K., Jung, K.W., Kim, D.H., 2017.

The budget was presented to the House of Representatives by Treasurer Scott Morrison on 8 May 2018. It was the fifth budget to be handed down by the Liberal/National Coalition since their election to government at the 2013 federal election, and the third and final budget to be handed down by Morrison and the Turnbull Government. ==Background== In mid-April, Acting Prime Minister Michael McCormack described Treasurer Scott Morrison as \\"Santa Claus\\" in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, also hinting that there would be spending on transport infrastructure. Morrison stated that the $5 billion Melbourne Airport rail link would be part of this budget. There has been an increase in revenue recently due to stronger than expected commodity prices and an increase in employment. This budget has been described as effectively a pre- election budget for the 2019 federal election. Polling prior to the budget revealed that the public thought the most important issues for the government to address were the cost of living and improving health infrastructure. Student newspapers were not invited to the 2018 budget lockup. ==Forecasting== A Deloitte Access report issued in April 2018 found that total revenue was $7.6 billion more than had been forecast in December 2017. ==Income taxes== The budget proposes to introduce a Low and Middle Income Tax Offset (LMITO) of $530, from July 2018. This offset will not be reflected in adjustments to PAYG rates, which would translate to a PAYG cut of about $10 a week for low to middle income earners, but will be applied when the tax returns are lodged. The LMITO will not be a refundable offset. From July 2022, the 32.5% tax bracket is to raise from $37,000 to $41,000. From July 2024, the 37% tax bracket (which currently applies to incomes between $87,000 and $180,000) is to be abolished, and the 32.5% tax bracket is to apply to incomes between $41,000 and $200,000. The 0.5% increase in the Medicare levy from 1 July 2019, announced in the 2017 budget, has been abandoned, and the funding of the National Disability Insurance Scheme of $8 billion is now to be funded out of general revenue. The Government still wants to reduce the corporate income tax rate from 30% to 25% for all companies by 2026/27. From 1 July 2019, businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million will get a 2.5% tax break to 27.5%. ==Social welfare == The Social Welfare Debt Recovery scheme (dubbed robo-debt by the media) will be extended for another three years, until 2022, and is expected to recover $300 million from current and former Centrelink customers. The Commonwealth will seek the power to automatically deduct state fines from welfare payments. The rules for suspending the disability support pension for prisoners and people awaiting trial will be changed from allowing a suspension period of 2 years to allowing a suspension period of 13 weeks. There is to be no increase in the Newstart Allowance, and the Department of Human Services was targeted with further 1,200 job cuts. Spending on social security was $6.3b less than forecast in this budget. ==Programs and expenditureAged care=== Home care packages will be increased by 14,000 places. It has been noted that this measure will not meet demand in the sector. ===Agriculture=== Sea imports will be subject to a levy to help the government identify and respond to biosecurity threats. The macadamia levy has been increased to raise funds to combat the Varroa jacobsoni mite in Queensland, and the mushroom and honey levies have been decreased. ===Arts=== The funding freeze of the ABC will be continued, and SBS will be funded with an additional $14.6 million. $50 million will be allocated to the construction of a Captain Cook memorial at Kurnell commemorating the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook's landing. ===ASIC=== ASIC was given $11 million in the budget to cover the costs of the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry, but lost $28 million of funding and 30 staff. ===Cash transactions=== A limit of $10,000 will be imposed on cash transactions to counter the black economy. While amnesties were recommended by a parliamentary committee, these were not adopted by the government. ===Illicit tobacco=== A four-year program targeting illicit tobacco is expected to be announced, with import permits required from 1 July 2019 for all imports of tobacco except those purchased duty free. ===Infrastructure=== There will be an infrastructure spend of $24.5 billion in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. ===National School Chaplaincy Programme=== The National School Chaplaincy Programme has been extended for four years with funding of $247 million. ===Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme=== Additional medicines will be added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, for the treatment of breast cancer, refractory multiple myeloma, and relapsing- remitting multiple sclerosis. Additionally, pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV/AIDS will be added to the PBS. ===Self-managed superannuation auditing=== The requirement for self-managed superannuation to be audited annually has been relaxed to allow auditing to occur once every three years. ===Space agency=== $50 million will be allocated to the creation of a space agency. ===Superannuation consolidation=== Fund exit fees are to be banned. The Australian Tax Office will be given powers to consolidate superannuation from a person's inactive accounts, sending it to their active account. Superannuation accounts that have had no contributions for over 13 months and that have a balance of under $6,000 will be subject to this scheme from 1 July 2019.https://www.hesta.com.au/content/dam/hesta/Documents/HESTA-budget-fact- sheet-2018-19.pdf HESTA factsheet ===Women's Budget=== An analysis of how the budget measures will affect women has concluded that the taper effect will create a disincentive to work. A statement on women's economic security will be unveiled by Kelly O'Dwyer in spring 2018. ==Debt and deficit== The Budget deficit for 2017/18 is expected to be $18.2 billion, falling to $14.5 billion in 2018/19. The Budget is expected to return to a surplus of $2.2 billion in 2019/20, and increasing to $16.6 billion in 2021/22. The government's debt level is forecast to be $629 billion in 2019/20.Australian Federal Budget analysis 2018/19 ==Opposition and crossbench response== Upfront fees for up to 100,000 TAFE students will be scrapped. The Greens party has stated that they will refuse to pass the tax cuts advocated by either major party, describing them as a \\"bribe\\". ==Reception== In response to an anticipated tax cut, the hashtag #keepmytendollars trended on social media. Some people have criticized the New tax System with Australians earning between $41,000 and $200,000 paying the same tax as moving away from a progressive taxation system.https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/may/10/the-flat- tax-is-really-about-cutting-services-not- taxeshttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/11/its-the-neoliberal- budget-when-we-no-longer-believe-in-neoliberalism Labor has asked for the potential costs from scrapping the 37% tax bracket, but Morrison has declined to release the cost modelling. Analysis of the budget and budget reply by Australian National University researchers shows that neither proposed budget adequately addresses bracket creep. This budget marks the fifth consecutive year that Australia's foreign aid budget has been cut. The second stage of the Coalition's company tax cuts for big business was rejected by the Senate on 22 August 2018. ==See also== * Australian government debt * Economy of Australia * Taxation in Australia ==References *Official website *Budget 2018: Winners and losers at ABC News *Budget Speech transcript, delivered by Scott Morrison *Full transcript: Bill Shorten’s Budget reply at news.com.au Category:Australian budgets Australian federal budget Australian federal budget Category:2018 in Australian politics ","title":"2018 Australian federal budget"},{"id":"56879969","text":"Jamel Vaughn Morris (born November 14, 1992) is an American professional basketball player for Legia Warszawa of the Polish Basketball League.

He was brought in to the Gable Endies by player-manager Alex Stuart in 1970, around the same time as defenders Dennis D'Arcy and Les Barr arrived. All would play important roles in the Links Park club's gradual improvement in fortunes, as they followed up a win in the 1972–73 Forfarshire Cup with a best-ever finish of 3rd in the 1974–75 Scottish Division Two campaign, just one point behind winners Falkirk. To finish near the top of the table was particularly important that year as the leagues were reconstructed, with only the top six being placed into the new 'First Division', which was actually the middle level between the Premier and the Second. Montrose also recorded their longest unbeaten league run of 15 matches, and set their record margin of victory with a 12–0 win over amateurs Vale of Leithen in the 1974–75 Scottish Cup. The following year was even better, as Montrose finished 3rd again – but this time among stronger opposition – in the 1975–76 Scottish First Division. They also made it to the quarter-finals of the 1975–76 Scottish Cup, losing narrowly to eventual finalists Heart of Midlothian after two replays, and reached the semi-final of the 1975–76 Scottish League Cup, where they led for much of the tie against Rangers at Hampden Park before eventually succumbing 5–1 to the team who would lift the trophy. ===Partick Thistle=== The contribution of Johnston (who by now had successfully graduated from Jordanhill College to become a Physical education teacher) in Montrose's strong period had not gone unnoticed, and in summer 1976, after over 200 matches for the Angus club, he was approached by Partick Thistle, who had just achieved promotion to the Premier Division. the Jags manager Bertie Auld stated in his autobiography that he had to persuade Johnston to make the step up, as the player was unsure if he had the quality needed. After signing for a fee of £20,000, his spell with the Glasgow club was short, encompassing little more than one season due to injuries and a loss of trust from manager Auld, himself a combative character who eventually concluded that Johnston had been correct in his self-assessment of being not good enough for the top division, or at least not sufficiently confident in his own ability to make an impact. However, the midfielder did contribute 14 league appearances to the team which finished 5th in the 1976–77 Scottish Premier Division, playing alongside the likes of Scottish internationals Alan Hansen, John Hansen and Alan Rough, as well as Jim Melrose and Doug Somner. He was in the team for Thistle's first win in the new Premier Division (beating Motherwell), and two of his three goals were scored against Rangers, one in a defeat at Ibrox and the other to open the scoring in a 4–3 win at Firhill, with the third strike a winner against Kilmarnock. After a period out injured and a loan to third tier Brechin City, Johnston returned to Montrose in 1979, with the club having just been relegated to the bottom division. ===Return to Montrose and later years=== Johnston spent three further seasons with Montrose and two with Stenhousemuir, who were playing at the same level and closer to his home and workplace in the Central Belt, amassing 128 further league appearances between the two clubs, before returning to the Juniors with Viewpark-based Thorniewood United in his mid-30s prior to retiring. He was made a member of the Montrose Hall of Fame upon its introduction in 2004. ==Cricket career== Johnston was also an accomplished cricketer, appearing at club level for Aberdeenshire in his early career and later for Uddingston and Fauldhouse Victoria. A skilled spin bowler and batter, he was selected for Scotland for first-class cricket matches against Ireland at Rathmines in August 1975, and against the same opposition at Clontarf in July 1981. He also made the team for 17 List A matches: 16 in the Benson & Hedges Cup (between 1980, the first year Scotland entered a team, and 1984), plus one in the NatWest Bank Trophy in 1983. The high-level appearance totals would almost certainly have been greater had Johnston not absented himself from cricket between 1976 and 1979 to concentrate on football. ==Personal life== Johnston became a secondary school PE teacher by profession; he had already embarked on this career when his profile as a footballer began to increase in his mid-20s, and spent many years teaching at Stonelaw High School in Rutherglen. He never became the department's principal teacher nor served as the school's football coach, those responsibilities falling to colleagues Alan Byrne and Iain Burns respectively, but was involved in youth cricket coaching. ==See also== *List of Scottish cricket and football players ==References== Category:Living people Category:1949 births Category:People from Kirkwall Category:People educated at Northfield Academy Category:Alumni of the University of Strathclyde Category:Sportspeople from Aberdeen Category:Rutherglen Category:Scottish schoolteachers Category:Scottish cricketers Category:Scotland cricketers Category:Scottish footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Scottish Junior Football Association players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Lewis United F.C. players Category:Montrose F.C. players Category:Partick Thistle F.C. players Category:Brechin City F.C. players Category:Stenhousemuir F.C. players Category:Thorniewood United F.C. players Category:Sportspeople from Scottish islands Category:Footballers from Aberdeen ","title":"Harry Johnston (footballer, born 1949)"},{"id":"56880029","text":"Alfred Louis Laubmann (20 October 1886 - 18 October 1965) was a German zoologist and ornithologist who worked as curator at the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology in Munich.

Marais (April 23, 1919 - 2009) was a South African banker and politician. He was the founder and chairman of the Trust Bank of Africa, one of South Africa's largest banks. He was a National member of the Parliament of South Africa, and a critic of apartheid. ==Early life== Jan S. Marais was born as Johannes Stephanus Marais on April 23, 1919 in Fraserburg, Northern Cape. He graduated from Stellenbosch University. ==Banking career== Marais was the general manager of Federale Volksbeleggings, an Afrikaner investment company. Marais founded the Trust Bank of Africa in 1954, and he served as its chairman. By the 1970s, it had become \\"one of the country's major banks.\\" Marais subsequently sold the Trust Bank to Sanlam. Marais served as the non- executive chairman of FundTrust, an investment company, until it went bankrupt in 1991. ==Politics== Marais was a critic of apartheid. As the chairman of the South Africa Foundation in the 1970s, he argued that the Anti-Apartheid Movement hurt South African businesses. Marais sold Trustbank to join the National Party and served as a member Parliament of South Africa as the representetive of Durban, the only time ever that the liberal constitiunaty was won by the National Party. He stood until 1981. He used his platform as a politician to call for the repeal of the Group Areas Act. ==Personal life and death== Dr. Jan S Marais was born in the Karoo, in the town of Fraserburgh, Northern Cape, South Africa. After school, as the oldest son, he had to manage the farm. Within months he reorganized the farm and spend his time reading detective stories and had only one dream, to become a train driver! His father knew better and send him to university where he went from class to class with no direction. A senior played a joke on him by inviting him to a statistic class where they were writing a test to Marais's surprise. That was the first time that he thought that he should visit the same class twice. He went back the next week for his results but the lecturer did not hand it out. After class, he asked if there is a Mr. Marais and asked him to stay behind. He handed Marais his test for which he had full marks! After a short interview, he took Marais under his wing up to the time that he went to work for the Federale Volksbeleggings. From there he was later sent to study in America. He did his Master Degree on Successful People and later with his return to South Africa, started the TrustBank that changed banking worldwide. The change in his bank's approach towards their clients stemmed from the time that he saw Mary Poppins as a little boy. There was a scene where a child approaches the bank with a little porcelain pig containing all her savings... When she enters the bank the atmosphere was so thick with the counters protected by bars back then. The small child got so scared, dropped her savings and it scattered all over the floor while she was running out. Marais decided that day that he would like to change this one day. He felt it should be an inviting, appreciating atmosphere as the bank wants people to entrust their savings with the bank. That was one of many things that made his banking system unique at the time. One of his claims to fame from those days was that all female workers got hair and clothing allowance and were encouraged to wear mini dresses. Marais had a wife, Peggy, who died in the 1980s, and an adopted daughter, Carla, she had three children. He resided in Seapoint during the early TrustBank days and later in Cape Town city center. After the Fundtrust debacle, he moved to Durbanville. to his death.

The type and only species is T. regalis. ==Discovery and naming== Maps showing phosphate mines in Morocco where the fossils were found Since 2015, a group of paleontologists is acquiring pterosaur fossils from commercial Moroccan fossil traders, who obtain these from workers in the phosphate mines on the Khouribga plateau, which is located within the Ouled Abdoun Basin. The purpose of this project is to determine pterosaur diversity in the latest Cretaceous. From this stage, no Konservat- Lagerstätten are known, sites combining a large variety of species with exceptional preservation. It is in such sites that the vast majority of pterosaur fossils and taxa have been discovered. The latest Cretaceous had only produced some partial skeletons of Azhdarchidae. Researchers usually have concluded from this fact that other pterosaur groups had already gone extinct. However, an alternative explanation could be that the poor fossil record caused a distorted image of the true situation through undersampling. To test this hypothesis, it was tried to collect all pterosaurs bones brought to light by the massive and systematic commercial exploitation of the Khourigba phosphate layers. It transpired that indeed some finds could not be determined as azhdarchids and likely represented other groups. It was decided to publish four of these as new species. In 2018, Nicholas R. Longrich, David M. Martill and Brian Andres described and named the type species Tethydraco regalis. The generic name combines a reference to the Tethys, the ocean in the Late Cretaceous separating Africa from Europe and Asia, with a Latin draco, \\"dragon\\". The specific name means \\"royal\\" in Latin. The holotype, FSAC-OB 1, was found in the middle Couche III, itself the lowest phosphate layer complex at Sidi Daoui, dating from the late Maastrichtian. It consists of a left humerus. The bone is relatively crushed. Other specimens have been referred to the species. FSAC-OB 199 is an ulna. FSAC-OB 200 is another ulna. FSAC-OB 201 is a thighbone. FSAC-OB 202 consists of a thighbone with shinbone. The describing authors admitted that a connection between the holotype and the referred specimens is hard to proof, in view of the lack of overlapping material. However, the wide ulnae fit the exceptional distal width of the humerus. The thighbones were, more tentatively, referred because they seemed to be pteranodontid. ==Description== Size (blue, middle left) compared to other pterosaurs, birds, and a human The wingspan of Tethydraco has been estimated at . The describing authors indicated some traits in which Tethydraco could be distinguished from known pteranodontids. In the humerus, the deltopectoral crest is placed rather proximally, closer to the torso of the animal, its closest border being positioned just proximal to the beginning of the opposite crest, the crista ulnaris. Distally, away from the torso, the humerus has a broad triangular expansion. The bone ridge running to the outer joint condyle has a distinct process pointing to above, when the wing is in a stretched position. The ridge leading to the inner condyle is enlarged and extends towards the torso over a long distance. The ulna is relatively short and wide while its proximal end, towards the humerus, is massively expanded. ==Phylogeny== Referred hindlimb elements Tethydraco was placed in the family Pteranodontidae; it would have been the youngest known member of that family, since its fossil remains dated back 66 million years ago. Its existence was seen as proof that pterosaur diversity in the Maastrichtian was higher than previously assumed. Pterosaur decline was an illusion caused by the Signor–Lipps effect, groups seeming to disappear earlier than a mass extinction because their youngest fossils by chance have been found at somewhat older layers than the extinction event. Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis first presented by Andres and colleagues in 2014, and updated with additional data by Longrich and colleagues in 2018. In this analysis, they found Tethydraco to be the sister taxon of the two species of Pteranodon (P. longiceps and P. sternbergi); all three of them forming the family Pteranodontidae, which is found as the sister taxon of the family Nyctosauridae. ==Paleoecology== Tethydraco was discovered in the Ouled Abdoun Basin in Morocco. This basin is divided into layers called \\"Couches\\", and Tethydraco was discovered in Couche III. It coexisted with the pterosaurs Alcione, Barbaridactylus, Simurghia and Phosphatodraco and the abelisaurid dinosaur Chenanisaurus. ==References== Category:Pteranodontoids Category:Fossil taxa described in 2018 Category:Pterosaurs of Africa ","title":"Tethydraco"},{"id":"56880067","text":"Marek Geišberg (born 4 May 1982) is a Slovak actor.

As a child he lived and studied in Przemyśl. He enjoyed a large collection of books gathered by his father, and was greatly influenced by the creativity of the Ukrainian socialist writer Ivan Franko. At school, Yaroslav's critical thoughts brought him into conflict with priests who taught theology. At the beginning of the First World War his father, along with other \\"unreliable\\" elements who sympathized with the Russians, was placed in the Thalerhof internment camp by the Austrian authorities. Eventually Galitzia was taken by the Russians. During the next Austrian offensive, in order to avoid repressions, his mother evacuated the family with the retreating Russian army to Rostov-on-Don, where Yaroslav studied at the gymnasium and performed in the local theatre. Living there, Halan witnessed the events of the October Revolution. He became familiar with Lenin’s agitation. Later these events formed the base of his story Unforgettable Days. While in Rostov-on-Don, he discovered the works of Russian writers such as Leo Tolstoy, Maxim Gorky, Vissarion Belinsky, and Anton Chekhov. Halan often went to the theatre. Thus his obsession with this art was born, which in the future determined his decision to become a playwright. === Student years === After the war Halan returned to Galitzia (annexed by Poland), where in 1922 he graduated from the Peremyshl Ukrainian Gymnasium. He then studied at the Triest Higher Trade School in Italy, and in 1922 enrolled in the University of Vienna. In 1926 he transferred to the Jagiellonian University of Kraków, from which he graduated in 1928 (according to some sources he didn't pass the final exams). Halan then began working as a teacher of the Polish language and literature at a private gymnasium in Lutsk. However, ten months later he was banned from teaching due to political concerns. In his student years Halan became active in left-wing politics. While at the University of Vienna he became a member of the workers' community Einheit (Unity), overseen by the Communist Party of Austria. From 1924 he proactively participated in the underground national liberation movement, which in the Ukrainian lands of the Second Polish Republic (except of Glitzia being under OUN influence) was headed by the Communist Party of Western Ukraine (CPWU). He joined the CPWU when he was on vacation in Peremyshl. Later, while studying in Kraków, he was elected a deputy chairman of the legal student organization Życie (Life) ruled by the Communist Party of Poland. === Creativity and political struggle in Poland === Yaroslav Halan with his first wife Anna Henyk and her relatives in the village Bereziv, 1929 In the 1920s, Halan's creative activity also began. In 1927 he finished work on his first significant play, Don Quixote from Ettenheim. For the first time he revealed the venality of nationalistic and chauvinistic parties in his play 99% (1930). The theme of class struggle and condemning segregation were actualized in the plays Cargo (1930) and Cell (1932), calling for united actions and class solidarity of Ukrainian, Jewish and Polish proletarians. Halan's play 99% was staged by the semi-legal Lviv Workers’ Theatre. On the eve of the premiere, Polish authorities launched a campaign of mass arrest against Western Ukrainian communists, sending them to the Lutsk prison. As the theatre's director and one of the key actors were arrested, the premiere was on the verge of failure. Despite risks of being arrested, the workers continued rehearsing, so that the play was presented with a delay of only one day. About 600 workers attended the premiere; for them, it was a form of protest mobilization against repression and nationalism. Halan was one of the founders of the Ukrainian proletarian writers’ group Horno. From 1927 to 1932, along with other communist writers and members of the CPWU, he worked for the Lviv-based Ukrainian magazine Vikna, being a member of its editorial board, until it was closed by government censors. Living in the Polish-controlled city of Lviv, Halan frequently had to earn money by translating novels from German into Polish. In 1932 he moved to Nyzhniy Bereviz, the native village of his wife, located in the Carpathian mountains, close to Kolomyia, and kept working on his own plays, stories and articles there. In the village he spread communist agitation among peasants, creating cells of the International Red Aid and the Committee for Famine Relief. Without opportunities to find work, he lived in the countryside until June 1935, when he was summoned by the CPWU to return to Lviv. Halan was denied Soviet citizenship in 1935. In 1935, Halan traveled extensively around Prykarpattia, giving speeches to peasants. He became an experienced propagandist and agitator. Addressing the city workers, Halan explained to them the main points of Marxist theory. In particular, he held lectures on Friedrich Engels's Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, and Karl Marx's Wage Labour and Capital. Together with the young communist writer Olexa Havryliuk, Halan organized safe houses, wrote leaflets and proclamations, and transferred illegal literature to Lviv. Throughout his political career the writer was repeatedly persecuted, and twice imprisoned (for the first time in 1934). He was one of the organizers of the Lviv Anti- Fascist Congress of Cultural Workers in May 1936. Halan also took part in a major political demonstration on April 16, 1936, in Lviv, in which the crowd was fired on by Polish police (in total, thirty workers were killed and two hundred injured). Halan devoted his story Golden Arch to the memory of fallen comrades. Participation in the Anti-Fascist Congress forced him to escape from Lviv to Warsaw, where he eventually found work at the left-wing newspaper Dziennik Popularny, edited by Wanda Wasilewska. In 1937, the newspaper was closed by the authorities, and on April 8 Halan was accused of illegal communist activism and sent to prison in Warsaw (later transferred to Lviv). Released in December 1937, Halan lived in Lviv under strict supervision by the police, and remained unemployed until 1939. In 1937, his elder brother, a member of the CPWU, died in Lviv. After the Communist Party of Poland and the Communist Party of Western Ukraine, as its autonomous organization, were dissolved by the Comintern on trumped-up accusations of spying for Poland in 1938, Halan's first wife Anna Henyk (also a member of the CPWU), who was studying at the Kharkiv Medical Institute, USSR, was arrested by the NKVD and executed in the Great Purge. === In the Soviet Lviv === After the USSR annexed Western Ukraine and Western Belarus in September 1939, Yaroslav Halan worked for the newspaper Vilna Ukraina, directed the Maria Zankovetska Theatre, and wrote more than 100 pamphlets and articles on changes taking place in the reunified lands of Western Ukraine. > «A group of writers such as Yaroslav Halan, Petro Kozlaniuk, Stepan Tudor > and Olexa Havryliuk [...] treated the liberation of Western Ukraine [by the > Red Army] as a logical conclusion of the policy of the Communist Party, > which fought for the reunification of the Ukrainian people. In this, they > actively helped the party in word and deed. In return, they have already had > experience with Polish prisons and oppression from their fellow countrymen. > Now [after it happened] they could breathe a sigh of relief. That is why > their smiles were so sincere and celebratory.» > Petro Panch, Lviv, Kopernyka str., 42, Vitchyzna, 1960, issue No 2, 172 In November 1939 Halan went to Kharkiv to try to locate his vanished wife Anna Henyk. Together with the writer Yuri Smolych he came to the dormitory of the Medical Institute, and asked the porter for any information about her fate. The porter only gave him back a suitcase with Anna's belongings and said that she had been arrested by the NKVD, in response to which Halan burst into tears. In June 1941, being a journalist of the newspaper Vilna Ukraina, he took his first professional vacation, in Crimea, but didn't manage to rest for long, as on June 22 Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. === War period === When the war on the Eastern Front began, Halan arrived in Kharkiv and went to the military commissariat having a big desire to become a volunteer of the Red Army and to go to the frontline but was denied. He was evacuated to Ufa. In September 1941, Alexander Fadeyev summoned him to Moscow for working at the Polish-language magazine Nowe Horyzonty. In the days of the Battle for Moscow, on October 17, he was evacuated to Kazan. Later the writer arrived in Saratov, where he served as a radio host at the Taras Shevchenko Radio Station. Then he was a special front-line correspondent of the newspaper Sovietskaya Ukraina, and then Radianska Ukraina. > «The majority of his radio-comments have been born spontaneously. He listens > to the enemy's radio shows, thinks for a while, then goes to the studio with > an open microphone and without any preparations responds, expressing > everything what he feels. That was a true radio-battle with all Hitler's > propagandists starting from Goebbels, Dietrich, and others. The opportunity > to fight like this – immediately, without paper [and censorship] – > demonstrates a high confidence given to him by the Government and the > Central Committee of the CPSU(b).» > Volodymyr Beliayev, Literaturna Ukraina, 1962 In 1943, in Moscow, he met his future second wife Maria Krotkova, who was an artist. In October 1943, the publishing house Moscovskiy Bolshevik released the collection of 15 Halan's war stories Front on Air. At the end of the year, Halan moved to the recently liberated Kharkov and worked there on the frontline radio station Dnipro. During and after the war he was sharply condemning the Ukrainian nationalists – banderivtsi, melnykivtsi, bulbivtsi – as accomplices of the Nazi occupiers. === Post-war times === In 1946 Yaroslav Halan as a correspondent of the Radianska Ukraina newspaper represented the USSR at the Nuremberg trial of Nazi military criminals. Yaroslav Halan wrote much about Ukrainian nationalists. In his story What Has No Name he described the OUN crimes: > «Fourteen-years-old girl can’t calmly look at meat. She trembles if someone > is going to cook cutlets in her presence. A few months ago, on Easter Night, > armed people came to a peasant house in a village close to the town of > Sarny, and stabbed its inhabitants with knives. The girl having the eyes > widened of fear was looking at the agony of her parents. The girl with > horror in her eyes was looking at the agony of her parents. One of the > gangsters put a knife blade to the child’s neck, but at the last moment a > new “idea” came to his mind: “Live in glory to Stepan Bandera! And to avoid > you being starved to death we will leave you some food. Guys, slice pork for > her!\\" The \\"guys\\" liked such a proposal. In a few minutes a mountain of meat > made from the bleeding father and mother grew up in front of the horror- > struck girl...» In Halan's tragedy Under the Golden Eagle (1947) the writer harshly criticizes the American occupation administration in Western Germany for its rude attempts to prevent Soviet soldiers interned in special camps to return to their homeland. In his play Love at Dawn (1949, published in 1951) he described the triumph of Socialism in the rural areas of Western Ukraine. Often he was focused on counteracting the nationalistic propaganda. Nevertheless, Halan complained that these \\"Augean stables\\" were not his vocation but it had to be done by someone: > «I understand: the asenisation work is a necessary and useful work, but why > only me? Why should I be the only cesspool cleaner? The reader of our > periodicals will involuntarily have the thought that there is only \\"maniac\\" > Halan, who has clung to Ukrainian fascism like a drunk clings to the raft, > [while] the vast majority of the writers ignore this issue. It isn't needed > to be explained what further conclusions the reader will make from this.» > From Halan's letter to his friend Yuri Smolych, on January 2, 1948. In his last satirical pamphlets Yaroslav Halan criticized the nationalistic and clerical reaction (particularly, the Greek Catholic Church and the anti- Communist doctrine of the Holy See): Their Face (1948), In the service of Satan (1948), In the Face of Facts (1949), Father of Darkness and His Henchmen (1949), The Vatican Idols Thirst for Blood (1949, in Polish), Twilight of the Alien Gods (1948), What Should Not Be Forgotten (1947), The Vatican Without Mask (1949) etc. When the Vatican had discovered that Halan is going to publish his new anti-clerical pamphlet Father of Darkness and His Henchmen, in July 1949 the Pope Pius XII excommunicated him. In response to this, Halan wrote a pamphlet I Spit on the Pope, that caused a significant resonance within the Church and among believers. In the pamphlet he ironized on the Decree against Communism released by the Vatican on July 1, in which the Holy See had threatened to excommunicate all members of the Communist parties and active supporters of the Communists: > «My only consolation is that I am not alone: together with me, the Pope > excommunicated at least three hundred million people, and with them I once > again in full voice declare: I spit on the Pope!» == Assassination == Halan's body after the murder on October 24, 1949. Yaroslav Halan was assassinated on October 24, 1949, in his home office, which was situated at Hvadiyska street in Lviv. He received eleven blows to the head with an axe. His blood spilled on the manuscript of his new article, Greatness of the Liberated Human, which celebrated the tenth anniversary of the annexation of Western Ukraine with the Ukrainian SSR. The killers – two students of the Lviv Forestry Technical Institute, Ilariy Lukashevych and Mykhailo Stakhur – committed the assassination after receiving the appropriate order from the OUN leadership. On the eve of the murder Lukashevych gained the writer's confidence, so the students were let into the house. They came to the apartment under the pretext of being discriminated against at the university and seeking his help. When Lukashevych gave a signal, Stakhur attacked the writer with the axe. After Stakhur was convinced that Halan was dead, they tied up the housekeeper and escaped. The Ministry of the State Security (MGB) accused the Ukrainian nationalists of his murder, while the OUN claimed that it was a Soviet provocation in order to start a new wave of repressions against locals. Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of the Ukrainian SSR at that time, took personal control of the investigation. In 1951, the MGB agent Bohdan Stashynsky infiltrated into the OUN underground network and managed to find Stakhur, who himself bragged about the assassination of Halan. He was arrested on July 10, and afterwards fully admitted his responsibility for the crime during the trial. According to Stakhur, he did that because of the writer's critical statements on the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, Ukrainian Insurgent Army and the Vatican. On October 16, 1951, the military tribunal of the Carpathian Military District sentenced Mikhail Stakhur to death by hanging: the court hall applauded the announcement of the verdict. The verdict was enforced on the same day. Some contemporary Ukrainian historians and journalists put forward the hypothesis that Halan was killed by the Soviets. However, nowadays the fact of the OUN guilt proved with the numerous pieces of evidence is widely recognized by the vast majority of historians. The assassination of Halan caused tightening of measures against the nationalist Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), which continued insurgent activities against the Soviet power in Western Ukraine. All the leadership of the MGB arrived in Lviv, Pavel Sudoplatov himself worked there for several months. One of the consequences of the murder of Halan was the elimination of the UPA leader Roman Shukhevych four months later. == Evaluations by contemporaries == thumb260x260px The writer at his home office where he usually worked. 1947. > «Yaroslav Halan is a talented publicist, was a progressive writer in the > past.

Parkhomenko to the Central > Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine December 15, 1947. In 1962, in Toronto, Olexandr Matla, aka Petro Tereschuk, a pro-nationalist historian from the Ukrainian diaspora in Canada, published the brochure History of a Traitor (Yaroslav Halan), in which he accused Halan of being an informer of both Polish and Soviet intelligence services, and of helping them to oppress nationalists and even some pro-Soviet writers from Western Ukraine such as Anton Krushelnytsky, who moved from Lviv to Kharkiv in the 1930s and was killed during the Great Terror. > «[Halan] has used his undeniable publicistic talent to serve the enemy, > thereby placing himself outside the Ukrainian people.

The program began locally in Massachusetts in 1992 and then went nationwide in 2012 under the aegis of the America's State Parks alliance. The hikes are intended to promote an alternate way of celebrating the new year by going outside, getting some exercise, and experience local nature and history. In 2017, more than 62,000 people participated in First Day Hikes, covering over on some 1,300 hikes around the nation. ==Hikes== A group of First Day Hike participants in 2015 at Monmouth Battlefield State Park in New Jersey makes a turn after crossing an open field The number of different hikes offered within each state varies, with for example in 2018 New Jersey listing 30, Oklahoma having 19, and California offering over 80 of them. Hikes vary widely in duration and difficulty, with many being in length, easy-to-moderate in difficulty, and starting between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. and taking one to two hours to complete. However some are very short and easy and are family- friendly for all ages, while others are strenuous with significant elevation gains. Still others, such as at Spruce Run Recreation Area in New Jersey or at Red Rock Canyon State Park in California, are all-day affairs. Walks often stop to hear the guides describe local flora, fauna, or historical sites of interest, such as at Monmouth Battlefield State Park in New Jersey. In some locations, park officials offer hot drinks and treats after the hikes. The number of participants on any given hike can range from a dozen to a hundred or more; some hikes even draw two or three hundred people, and in any case numbers often vary depending upon the weather. A First Day Hike in James M. Robb – Colorado River State Park in Colorado in 2015 In some cases, such as at Spring Mountain Ranch State Park in Nevada, guides may take participants into areas of a park normally off-limits to the general public. A few hikes feature modes other than walking, such as horseback riding, mountain biking, or all- terrain vehicles. Night hikes have even been held when there is an especially bright moon. Cold weather is usually expected on January 1 across much of the nation and participants are advised to dress in layers appropriately. In cases of severe winter weather some of the hikes in a state may be cancelled, while others go on. People do turn out even in very cold weather, with for instance over 1,000 participants across Indiana in 2018 despite an average high temperature in the state that day of . ==History== The tradition began on January 1, 1992, at the Blue Hills Reservation state park in Norfolk County, Massachusetts outside of Boston. It was the idea of Patrick Flynn, supervisor of Blue Hills Reservation, who had remembered a February winter hike taking place in his home state of Ohio. The New Years Day hike at Blue Hills drew 380 people that first year, and has since become so popular at that site that the parking lots become full and people must stop their cars along nearby roadsides. The start of 2018 marked the 27th annual First Day Hike at Blue Hills Reservation. For his contribution, Flynn subsequently received an award from the National Association of State Park Directors; as one Massachusetts state official said at the ceremony, \\"One person having one idea can really spark a revolution.\\" Breakheart Reservation in Massachusetts was another park that started the practice early on. Then in 2008, hikes were added at other sites in Massachusetts under the sponsorship of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. The hikes continued to grow in popularity in that state. A group of all ages during a First Day Hike in Caledon State Park in Virginia in 2012, the first year the practice went national Independently, another first day walk tradition began on January 1, 1970, in Assateague State Park on the Maryland Eastern Shore. It was started by two women who sought to celebrate the beauty of Assateague Island and rally against plans to develop it. It subsequently became an annual tradition, with the 30th iteration taking place in 2010, and became very popular over time, with people driving from various other parts of the state to join in with up to 300 others. The Ilia Fehrer / Judy Johnson Memorial Beach Walk, named after the two women who started it, is now part of Maryland's roster of First Day Hikes. During 2011, Priscilla Geigis, the director of state parks in the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, suggested that other state park directors in nearby states adopt the practice. The idea quickly spread and by January 1, 2012, state park directors across the country became involved. Thus, First Day Hikes became a nationwide event in 2012, under the America's State Parks association, with some 400 hikes being offered. The practice has continued to grow in popularity since then. In 2016, about 55,000 participants were involved in the hikes nationwide. with that number exceeding 62,000 in 2017 with some 1,300 hikes being given. The effects of the 2017–18 North American cold wave, which gave frigid temperatures across much of the nation, resulted in numbers for 2018 decreasing to 32,000 participants across some 1,200 hikes. ==Purpose== A guide checks on the progress of his group during a First Day Hike in Cheesequake State Park in New Jersey in 2017 The America's State Parks association proclaims, \\"What better way to kick off the New Year than by getting a jump start burning off those extra holiday calories in the great outdoors?\\" Or as New Jersey's park system says about the activity, \\"These free First Day Hikes offer a great incentive to get outside, exercise, experience history, enjoy nature, and celebrate the New Year with friends and family in one of your state parks.\\" As one state parks official in Massachusetts itself said, \\"We want to launch the year saying, 'Get outside!'\\" Some people engage in First Day Hikes to counteract the effects of New Year's Eve celebrations the night before, while others find the outdoor activity the best aspect of the whole holiday. Another parks official in Iowa said, \\"We started this as a health initiative, but it's really just grown into a good way to spend time with the family and do something that you maybe normally wouldn't do on that holiday.\\" ==References * Official website Category:Hiking in the United States Category:State parks of the United States Category:Annual events in the United States Category:1992 establishments in Massachusetts Category:2012 establishments in the United States ","title":"First Day Hikes"},{"id":"56880249","text":"Amrita Sawaram (born 13 August 1980) is a Mauritian badminton player.

Chmielarz has co-founded and led Metropolis Software, People Can Fly and The Astronauts. He is one of the most famous Polish video gaming figures, as well as one of the most divisive figures in the industry. ==Life and career Piracy business and amateur game development === Born in Lublin on April 9, 1971, Adrian Chmielarz moved into game development in a roundabout way. In 1985, at the age of 15, Chmielarz attended the first Polcon science fiction convention in Błażejewko, where he first discovered an affinity for computers. He soon went through a Star Wars fan phase that saw him interact with a computer for the first time. By the late 1980s, he had become fascinated with computer games such as Knight Lore and Bugsy by reading about them in Przegląd Techniczny. He began saving for a ZX Spectrum despite never having used one before. His first experience playing games would see him typing in each line of code from gaming magazines into his friend's computer, though each time he turned off the computer the games were wiped as there was no way to save them. Chmielarz was pushed by a desire to buy a computer with his own money, knowing that his parents had been forced into the black market to \\"put food on the table\\". In 1987, Chmielarz earned financial sustainability by traveling 40 miles each day to sell bootleg foreign films on VHS tapes, copied from a friend at a bazaar in Wrocław (such type of copyright infringement was not illegal in Poland until 1994). The Wrocław marketplace where such goods were sold often had access to newer titles earlier. He noted that while an Englishman could buy a game the day of release, the average Pole would often have to wait up to five weeks and become impatient during that time, leading to this natural solution. According to Chmielarz \\"many people would buy games, if only it would be possible.\\" At one point, Chmielarz set up a distribution deal with the to-be-founders of what would become Polish distribution company CD Projekt, whereby they would drop cassette tapes full of pirated games at a local train station. After picking them up, to get an advantage over his competitors at the bazaar, he would add subroutines to alter gameplay (such as changing the number of lives or adding invulnerability); he would also himself crack the games and then apply his own anti-piracy protection measures to prevent other pirates from copying and selling it. Eventually, his bootleg business expanded into a brick-and-mortar company which sold different types of media, including movies and games, while also building computers to feed the local business industry. However, large companies started to enter Poland and the market became crowded. While he had a computer engineering company, the times were getting tougher and only giants with big money could survive on the market. Chmielarz decided to leave his profitable business and study at Wrocław University of Technology. However, he became bored and left without finishing his degree; he would later regret wasting his time at college. By 1990, Chmielarz had his own computers and his obsession led to him playing and making games all the free time. He sent the results of his experiments with creating video games the editorial offices of the magazines Komputer and Bajtek, winning a subscription to the latter as a result. One of these early titles was an erotic game Erotic Fun that sold well without any long-term profit; he later deemed this a good business lesson about exploiting an opportunity in the gaming market. Some of his other early games included text adventure games Kosmolot Podróżnik and Sekretny Dziennik Adriana Mole, which he wrote on the Timex Computer 2048. === Professional game development === In 1992, Adrian Chmielarz and Grzegorz Miechowski co-founded video game developing and publishing company Metropolis Software. The group realised that they could fill a gap in the untapped Polish software market, in which hundreds of thousands of people owned computers but were unable to become fully immersed in adventure games as they did not understand English. Chmielarz was not worried about the Polish gaming market being a small niche, as he knew the trail had already been set by developer xLand. Furthermore, he had assessed that while the local market was currently not active it was potentially big, noting the number of people who attended conventions. This project evolved into Chmielarz's first commercially released video game, the 1993 point-and-click adventure Tajemnica Statuetki. Some of Chmielarz's next projects, such as another point-and-click adventure game Teenagent (1995), scrolling shooter Katharsis (1997), and tactical role-playing game Gorky 17 (1999, known as Odium in North America), have been published also outside Poland. Due to an internal conflict, Chmielarz left Metropolis in 1999. Founding the video game development studio People Can Fly in 2002, he went on to create the successful first-person shooter Painkiller (2004) and its follow-ups Painkiller: Battle Out of Hell (2004), Painkiller: Hell Wars (2006), and Painkiller: Hell & Damnation (2012). A partnership with Epic Games and the work on the Gears of War series of third-person shooters, in which he personally went from a multiplayer level designer for the first two games to being the original creative director of Gears of War: Judgment (2013), led to Epic acquiring People Can Fly in 2007 and the creation of their next first- person shooter, Bulletstorm (2011). After leaving People Can Fly (by then fully owned by Epic) in 2012, Chmielarz formed the independent video game studio The Astronauts, which developed and published its debut game, the first-person adventure The Vanishing of Ethan Carter in 2014. His next game and a return to the first-person shooter genre, Witchfire, is to be released \\"when it's done\\". Chmielarz has also written commentary articles for Polish video game magazines, including his monthly columns \\"Gawędy bez fai\\" and \\"Gawędy po fai\\" in Secret Service and NEO+. In English, he has written blogs at Gamasutra and Medium. == References  * *Adrian Chmielarz at MobyGames Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:People from Lublin Category:Polish video game designers Category:Video game directors Category:Video game producers Category:Video game critics Category:Video game programmers Category:Video game writers ","title":"Adrian Chmielarz"},{"id":"56880289","text":"Berthe Kal Berthe Dyck Kaleka called Kal (10 November 1913 – 25 April 2015) was a 20th-century French soprano and music educator.Dépêches notes 28 April 2015 on France Musique. == Biography == Born in Paris, Kal, daughter of Russian and Lithuanian immigrants, came to study music at the age of six, through piano and music theory.

It is dually aligned with both the United Church of Christ and the Southern Baptist Convention, holding to a conservative view of the Bible and holding to the traditional Reformed view of theology. It is the last church to be pastored by John Harvard, a founder, benefactor, and namesake of Harvard University. == History  1600s === The church was founded in 1632 and held its services for a time in the Great House in the City Square and was later one of the six churches that led to the creation of Harvard University. Rev. John Harvard served as an assistant minister at the church until his death from tuberculosis, from 1637-1638. Rev. Increase Mather and his son Rev. Cotton Mather were close friends of the Shepherds of whom two of them, Thomas Sr. and Thomas Jr. became pastors of First Church. === 1700s === During the Revolutionary War, the British Army burned down the historic first building of First Church. A second building was built and used until the merger with its daughter church in the 1800s === 1800s === In the 1800s the church merged with its daughter congregation and moved into their facility which is the one used today as the current home of the church which shares some of the same architecture design as the original building. At one point, the church launched daughter churches in Charlestown and Old South Church in Boston, MA === 1900s === The church was used during the bussing controversy as a safe haven for African-American students. Some of the front windows are still boarded up today as a result of rocks and bricks being thrown through them in violence that rocked the city. === 2000s === The church has been historically and still is a Congregational church; upon the installation of Rev. Erik Maloy in 2015, the church also became a member of the Southern Baptist Convention through its affiliation with the Baptist Convention of New England. The church is also a part of The Gospel Coalition and 9 Marks networks, as well as one of the cohort churches in Overseed, an organization dedicated to reviving historic New England churches, by returning them to a Gospel preaching view of theology. The church has been going through a number of updates on its interior to make the church more modern in appearance. The downstairs fellowship area was updated in 2017 to include themed lights and a projector screen for presentations, as well as new paint and wood flooring. The Sanctuary was recently painted, as well as two LED TVs and a screen for music and other needs of the church. At its height in 1837, the church had 271 members, in 2015 it had just 15, and, as of 2018, boasts 45-60 members and attendees. The church is involved in a number of activities within the Charleston neighborhood, that has helped its reputation with the community and made it begin to thrive once more. In 2017, the church began to livestream its Sunday morning services on its Facebook page. == Design == The current structure's design is similar to the original wood building. A fire in the 1950s caused the interior of the church to go through an extensive redesign. The balconies that surrounded the sanctuary were taken down and parts of the lower floor were enclosed to create Sunday School class rooms. The pews are of the art deco design on the 1960s. == Pastors of First Church in Charlestown == # Thomas James (1632-1636) # # Zechariah Symmes (1634-1671) # # John Harvard (1637-1638) # # Thomas Allen (1639-1651) # # Thomas Shepherd (1659-1677) # # Thomas Shepherd Jr.(1680-1685) # # Charles Morton (1686-1698) # # Simon Bradstreet (1698-1741) # # Joseph Stevens (1713-1721) # # Hull Abbot (1724-1774) # # Thomas Pretince(1739-1782) # # Joshua Paine(1787-1788) # # Jedidiah Morse(1789-1819) # # Warren Fay (1819-1840) # # William Ives Buddington (1840-1854) # # James B.

Taking place in the far future, the player character is a hacker- for-hire who hijacks a surveyor robot to investigate the barren world of Tölva in search of a strange signal. The game contains walking simulator elements, with tactical engagements being broken up by large segments of slow-paced exploration. The game received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its setting and concept art-inspired aesthetic, but criticized its slow walking speed and the simplicity of its gameplay. == Plot == The player character is a mysterious hacker who was contacted by The Broker, who hired them to infiltrate The Surveyors, a faction of robots who are probing the planet Tölva. The player can remotely commandeer drones located on the planet's surface, but is opposed by two other robotic factions, the Zealots and Bandits, who will attack on sight. == Gameplay == The game alternates between combat in a first-person shooter style and exploration while traversing the planet's surface in a robot chassis. Robots have access to laser-based weaponry in the form of assault rifles and beam rifles. They also have a defensive shield system, and an area-of-effect attack that can disrupt enemies or heal allies. The player gains the ability to reprogram other robots to assist them in battle. During exploration segments, the player can use a scanner to search for hidden messages and upgrades. The game contains a day/night cycle. == Development == The game's visual aesthetic was inspired by the concept art of Ian McQue, who also designed the robots featured in the game. == Reception == The Signal From Tölva received mixed reviews, with an aggregate score of 69/100 on Metacritic. Chris Schilling of PC Gamer rated the game 80/100, calling it a \\"lean, intelligent sci-fi shooter\\" with a \\"fascinating setting\\" and a \\"watchmaker's eye for detail\\". He criticized the fact that the game can be \\"unfair\\" due to the existence of friendly fire against allies and no way to defend and fortify bases from other factions. Edwin Evans-Thirlwell of Eurogamer called the game a \\"dark, frustrating work\\", praising the game's artistic style, story and sound, but criticized the \\"strong element of grinding\\", saying the game later becomes \\"tedious\\". Glenn Wigmore of IGN rated the game 6.5/10, calling its concept \\"promising\\" and its visuals and audio \\"awe-inspiring\\", but calling its movement speed \\"plodding\\" and the plot only \\"partially\\" compelling. == References == Category:2017 video games Category:Windows games Category:MacOS games Category:Linux games Category:Indie video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:First-person shooters Category:Open world video games Category:Hacking video games Category:Exploration video games Category:Art games Category:Video games about robots Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"The Signal From Tölva"},{"id":"56880408","text":"Pirangut is a census town in Pune district in the Indian state of Maharashtra. ==Demographics== Pirangut, Tal.

Montes had limited pastoral experience before being appointed as a bishop but had served for a period as a spiritual director and after his appointment was known for upholding traditional teachings. But his defense of tradition on marriage and divorce led to his expulsion from Venezuela on the charge of inciting \\"rebellion\\" to which he was forced to reside at Port of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago from late 1929 until late 1931. He later resigned from his see following an attack of peritonitis and moved to Lucca to enter the Carthusians as a novice. He and other monks were killed after a Nazi raid who alleged the monks were harboring their enemies. The beatification process for Montes opened on 11 March 2017 in the latter's old diocese and he is now titled as a Servant of God. ==Life== Salvador Montes de Oca was born in Carora in Venezuela on 21 October 1895 as one of five sons to Andrés Montes de Oca Zubillaga and Rosario Montes de Oca Perera. He was baptized as Andrés Salvador María del Carmen Montes de Oca on 12 December 1895 in the church of San Juan Bautista in Carora with his uncle Julio Montes de Oca presiding. He received his Confirmation from the diocesan bishop Liscano on 25 May 1901 and his First Communion later on 7 May 1905 from the priest Carlos Zubillaga. He began his schooling in his hometown under the watch of his kinsman Lucio Montes de Oca. Montes studied for the ecclesial life in Barquisimeto. On 5 July 1914 he accompanied Bishop Aguedo Felipe Alvarado Liscano to Rome so Montes could continue his studies at the Pontifical Latin American Pontifical College at the time the bishop attended an \\"ad limina apostolorum\\" visit to the ailing Pope Pius X. Montes was made a subdeacon on 24 September 1921 and was elevated into the diaconate on 22 January 1922 (coinciding with the death of Pope Benedict XV). He was ordained to the priesthood on 14 May 1922 and said his first Mass in his hometown on 28 May before being appointed as Bishop Liscano's private aide. Montes later was appointed as the spiritual director for seminarians and then served as a chaplain at the Santuario della Paz. He later became named as the Bishop of Valencia and he received his episcopal consecration on 23 October 1927 before he was enthroned in his new see the following 27 October. The political strife he faced with the government of President Juan Bautista Pérez led to his exile on 11 October 1929. The reason for his exile was a document he released on 4 October 1929 and which was later published in the newspaper \\"La Religione\\" on the traditional teaching on marriage and divorce which he railed against. Montes set sail via boat to his exile at Port of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago where its archbishop John Pius Dowling welcomed him. But public backlash against his exile placed great pressure on the government who terminated his exile and sent word to him that he would be able to return to his diocese in 1931. Montes arrived in his homeland at the port of La Guairá on 10 October 1931 to resume his pastoral duties and on 18 March 1934 left for Rome to attend an \\"ad limina apostolorum\\" with Pope Pius XI. On 3 October 1934 he suffered a violent attack of peritonitis brought on from acute appendicitis which prompted an operation on 6 October. These health complications motivated his desire to resign from his see. Upon the resignation of his episcopal see he was granted the ceremonial role of a titular bishop but later resigned from that position upon his desire to enter the religious life. It was in the Tuscan region in the Italian kingdom that he lived with the Padri Sacramentini and even joined their ranks before deciding instead to enter the Carthusians at their convent in Lucca in 1943 and became a novice. His first novitiate with the Padri Sacramentini from 15 August 1935 led to his initial profession on 8 December 1936 and his perpetual profession on 8 December 1939. But the Carthusian charism caught his attention and he decided to leave his order to join them instead and entered on 5 September 1942 during World War II. On 10 September 1944 he and other monks were gunned down after Nazi authorities raided their convent and had slain them on the accusation of having granted safe haven to Italian political opponents. His remains were thrown into a mass grave alongside the other monks slain with him. In 1947 a paramedic team under the direction of Doctor Mariotti located his remains which were later transferred to Montes's old diocese back in his native land after their arrival on 11 June 1947 in the La Guairá port. His remains are now interred in his old cathedral beneath the main altar. On 5 September 2001 the Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi granted Montes and ten other monks slain in the 1944 attack the Gold Medal for Civil Merit. ==Beatification process== The beatification process for the late bishop had been of interest in his homeland since the 2000s and the formal application for the cause's introduction was lodged to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 2015 who granted the request and allowed for the cause to open in his old diocese rather than in Lucca where he had been killed. The diocesan process was launched on 11 March 2017 and is ongoing; Montes has been titled as a Servant of God. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Silvia Mónica Correale. ==References * Hagiography Circle * Catholic Hierarchy Category:1895 births Category:1944 deaths Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:20th-century Roman Catholic martyrs Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:20th-century Venezuelan people Category:Carthusian bishops Category:Deaths by firearm in Italy Category:Martyred Roman Catholic priests Category:Murdered Roman Catholic bishops Category:People from Lara (state) Category:Roman Catholic titular bishops Category:Venezuelan exiles Category:Venezuelan people murdered abroad Category:Venezuelan Roman Catholics ","title":"Salvador Montes de Oca"},{"id":"56880505","text":"Fung Tsui is one of the 17 constituencies in the North District, Hong Kong.

The mountain village is classified by the National Trust as a heritage village and is part of the Macleay Valley Coast. Historic Bellbrook General Store Macleay River, Bellbrook NSW, Australia == Population == Bellbrook had a population of 273 as of the . ==Etymology== The town was laid out and gazetted as Bellbrook in 1892. Caroline McMaugh, wife of early settler John McMaugh, named the village. At that time, and still today, the distinctive call of bellbirds could be heard echoing through the dense scrub they inhabited along Nulla Nulla Creek. In 1882 the name Bellbrook was first adopted as the official title for the original post office. A postal receiving office at Bellbrook opened on 16 January 1882, became a post office on 1 January 1884 and closed on 10 April 1987. The present day post office is located at Bellbrook Hotel. == Climate == Located within the same post code as Crescent Head and Port Macquarie (considered one of the most livable towns in Australia), Bellbrook enjoys a humid, sub-tropical climate with hot, humid summers and cold winters with significant rainfall. Many locals utilise fireplaces during the colder months. == History  Pre-History === Bellbrook is on the traditional lands of the Dunghutti Aboriginal people, some of whom continue to live on the local Aboriginal reserve. === Settlement === It was first settled by Europeans in the mid-1830s, and there was \\"very active antagonism\\" between the Europeans and the Dunghutti, which slowed the development of the village. A Aboriginal reserve was established at Bellbrook in 1885. It was initially an unsupervised reserve, but was later managed by the Aboriginal Protection Board. Residents \\"came under intense government surveillance\\" from the APB and had to sign in and out. Many of the residents worked on local pastoral stations, generally poorly paid. === Bellbrook Hotel === Bellbrook Hotel c1922 The Bellbrook Hotel overlooks the Macleay River. Opening in 1913, the Bellbrook Hotel is of historical significance, enjoying over one hundred years of service in addition to its notoriety as the watering hole of renowned Country Music Singer Slim Dusty. In 2018 the pub was nominated for the Best Bush Pub category in the Australian Hotels Association 2018 awards for excellence. In the same year, Bellbrook Hotel featured as one of twenty-five historic pubs in a travel book by the publisher of Australian Bush Pubs, titled, 'Historic Pubs, New South Wales'. === General Store === The iconic Bellbrook General Store The Bellbrook General Store is located in Main Street, with the store and post office relocating to the Bellbrook Hotel in late 2019. It was the location of the Country Women's Association for many years in addition to catering for functions, meetings and local gatherings. The General Store is situated in the middle of the village, opposite the public school and the local War Cenotaph. === Water === In 2005, the town's raw water supply was contaminated by heavy metals and arsenic from former mines in the Hillgrove area. In 2008, water was reportedly having to be trucked into the town because the supply was so contaminated. A new $700,000 water treatment plant was installed in 2009 to address the issue. === 2019-20 Bushfires === In November 2019, Bellbrook locals were forced to evacuate as their community was engulfed by the Carrai East fire for over two weeks and which resulted in the loss of some homes. The Nulla Nulla Creek home of country music legend Slim Dusty was saved. Mobile phone coverage was lost in the mountain village with locals relying upon both each other and the local Rural Fire Service for updates. Fires blocked the road to and from Bellbrook, some locals stayed to fight the fire and create containment lines around their properties while other residents sheltered at the local school. Locals were later able to leave under Emergency Service escort once the road was deemed safe. == Culture  Art === Bellbrook's rich history and unique location has been the subject of many landscape artists, notably award-winning Kempsey born artist Les Graham and Stephen Franks (1942-2002). The Bellbrook community continues to embrace its Dunghutti Aboriginal roots. In December 2018 community members attended the official unveiling of its new sculpture “Wupu Manhatinum”- translation- 'Travelling Star', which now resides in the local park. The public artwork was dedicated to the late Aboriginal elder and artist, Aunty Esther Quinlin. The sculpture is part of the Dunghutti Story Trail – the Dhanggati Wirriyn Yapang project, which celebrates the Macleay Valley Coast’s significant cultural heritage and \\"-mark['s] the western gateway into Dunghutti country.\\" === Music === Internationally renowned musician Slim Dusty was a Bellbrook local, growing up at Nulla Nulla Creek. Slim's 1957 song Pub with No Beer was based on the pub at nearby Taylor's Arm. thumb The Pub With No Beer, NSW Australia == Notable People == 'Homewood', Bellbrook is the childhood home of country music star Slim Dusty. It is located at Nulla Nulla Creek. == Schools  Bellbrook Public School === Education in the district began in 1883 at Midnight Creek, located approximately three kilometres east of Bellbrook, opening initially as a provisional school. The school then moved to half-time with Pee Dee from 1887 to 1890, closed from 1890 to 1910, then re-opened half-time with Nulla Nulla from 1910 to 1911, and has been continually open since then. The first school on site was built in 1911. In 1930, the current Bellbrook School was built. Carcolla School was moved to Bellbrook school grounds in 1970 and is now the infants department. A former boarding school, the Mirriwinni Gardens Aboriginal Academy, also operated at Bellbrook for more than thirty years. It educated more than 1500 children, but was forced to close in 2009 after running into financial difficulties.

Cap. (29 June 1622, Komorn – 25 February 1685, Vienna) was of the Capuchin Order and Prince-Bishop of Vienna. ==Biography== He was born the son of a butcher of the then Hungarian town of Komárom, Michael Senelli, and baptized under the name Johann Anton. He studied first in Linz and then Philosophy in Ingolstadt, entered the Capuchin Order at age twenty- one and took the religious name Emerich. In 1644 he swore his eternal vows in the Capuchin monastery in Gmunden. Sinelli was the first missionary designated for the conversion of Protestants in Lower Austria, then in Prague and in the Viennese Schottenkirche. In his orations he denounced the grievances at court and the greed of the dignitaries and became an advisor to Emperor Leopold I. The expulsion of Jews from the Leopoldstadt in 1670 was carried out on his advisement. On 17 November 1680, the Emperor appointed him Prince-Bishop of Vienna, but as a mendicant he was reluctant to accept this honor. Pope Innocent XI had to order Sinelli through an apostolic nuncio to accept his consecration, which took place on 4 May 1681 and was officiated by Nuncio Francesco Buonvisi. Sinelli was then made First Minister on the Imperial Privy Council in 1682, but continued to lead his characteristically modest life. In his episcopal functions he was represented by the Bishop of Wiener-Neustadt, Leopold Karl von Kollonitsch. During his tenure came the Second Turkish Siege in 1683, in which Marco d'Aviano served as the Papal legate in Vienna. Sinelli at first fled the besieged city with the Imperial Court, but after an Imperial victory at the Battle of Kahlenberg, he returned to the city on 14 September with the Emperor and initiated the reconstruction of destroyed churches. Sinelli died before receiving his elevation to cardinal, and is buried in the episcopal tomb of St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna. ==Bibliography== * * Rudolf Leeb u. a.: Geschichte des Christentums in Österreich.

Scomadi Headquarters was based in Olympia House, London Road, Preston, Lancashire, England. The two founders, with 60 years of experience between them, put together 10 prototypes named Turismo Leggera (TL). These were sold quickly. They realised there was demand so a further 20 TL300 were produced and painted to customer specification. === Mass Production === In November 2013 Scomadi launched its first production models the TL50 and TL125 at EICMA motorcycle show in Milan. In August 2014 the first TL50 rolled off the production line. Scomadi edited their badge in April 2015 changing the Italian Flag at the top of the badge to the Union Flag. In June 2015 the first batch of TL125's came off the production line, one month later the first Scomadi's were sold outside of the UK in Thailand. In 2016 the first batch of 100 Scomadi TL200 scooters arrived with this batch being known as the First Production (FP) and came numbered with a plaque. By the end of 2016 Scomadi's were available in the UK as well as across much of Europe, parts of East Asia, New Zealand, Australia and Columbia. === Move to Thailand === After Scomadi's divorce from Chinese manufacturing company Hanway Motors they announced a new factory in Thailand in 2017. In March 2017 Scomadi launched their new Model, the Turismo Technica (TT), at the Bangkok International Motor Show. In February 2020 Scomadi opened their new Factory in Thailand located near Pattaya. == Management/Ownership change and New factory== In 2019, after some difficult financial times, Scomadi saw a change in management. The company since the start had been British owned. Following financial challenges, the management structure was changed. This saw the involvement of two firms, Minor International and CT Engineering. Minor International is a leisure brand specialist, and CT Automotive is a component manufacturer. CT Automotive in particular, bought the double effect of bringing components manufacture into the process, as well as being able to utilise their distribution channels. \\"scomadi-factory-open-for-business-news\\" https://scooterlab.uk/scomadi- factory-open-for-business-news/.

This is a state of the art assembly factory with an advanced assembly line that can pump out a scooter every 20 minutes. \\"Scomadi Factory Open For Business News\\" Scooterlab UK https://scooterlab.uk/scomadi-factory-open-for-business-news/. == Controversy with Royal Alloy Scooters == Scomadi scooters were originally manufactured in China by Hanway Motors, to Scomadi UK specifications.

As a two-year-old in 1904 he was highly tried and won six of his ten races including the Brocklesby Stakes and Molecomb Stakes as well as being placed in the Coventry Stakes and Gimcrack Stakes. In the following spring he recorded his biggest win in the 2000 Guineas but was injured shortly afterwards and failed on his only subsequent start. He was reported to have died in early 1906. ==Background== Vedas was a brown horse bred by Valerie, Lady Meux and owned during his racing career by West Fenton de Wend-Fenton. The colt was sent into training with William Thomas \\"Jack\\" Robinson at his Foxhill stables in Wiltshire. He was sired by Florizel II, a full-brother to both Diamond Jubilee and Persimmon and a top-class performer in own right, with wins including the Goodwood Cup, Jockey Club Cup and Ascot Gold Vase. As a breeding stallion he sired Volodyovski and Doricles and was the damsire of St Louis. Vedas' dam Agnostic, a half-sister of the Epsom Oaks winner Bonny Jean, also produced Gemma (also by Florizel II) who in turn produced Sardanapale. ==Racing career1904: two-year-old season=== Vedas began his racing career in the Brocklesby Stakes over five furlongs at Lincoln Racecourse on 23 March in which he was made the 2/1 favourite and led from the start to win by four lengths from Captain Jack. In the following month, he won again, taking the Sefton Park Plate at Liverpool at odds of 2/5, but on this occasion he was eased down by his jockey in the final strides and was almost caught on the line by the filly Princess Sagan. At the end of April, the colt started joint-favourite for the Sandown Park Stud Produce Stakes and won \\"easily\\" by three lengths from Norman Bride. In May, he extended his winning run when he successfully conceded thirteen pounds to the highly regarded filly Queen of the Earth in the Spring Two-Year- Old Plate at Kempton Park Racecourse. In June, Vedas started 11/10 favourite for the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot but sustained his first defeat as he was beaten two lengths into second by Lord Rosebery's colt Cicero. At the time, many of Jack Robinson's trainees were suffering from Equine influenza, and it was suggested that Vedas may have been affected. Vedas returned to the track in July and won the Royal Plate over five furlongs at Windsor Racecourse. On 5 August, Vedas contested the Molecomb Stakes over five furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse in which he was ridden by G McCall and started the 8/15 favourite. He led from the start and won \\"as he liked\\" by two lengths from Standen. At York Racecourse in August, the colt started favourite against thirteen opponents for the Gimcrack Stakes but finished third behind a filly named Desiree. On his penultimate appearance of the season, he was assigned top weight (alongside Polymelus) in the Imperial Produce Stakes at Kempton in October and finished unplaced behind Khammurabi. Vedas ended the year with a narrow defeat, again under top weight, in the Chesterfield Nursery Plate at Derby Racecourse. Vedas earned a total of £3,939 in 1904. ===1905: three-year- old season=== Vedas began his second season by finishing unplaced in the Lincolnshire Handicap over one mile in March. In April he was an easy winner of the Bickerstaffe Stakes at Liverpool. On 3 May 1905, ridden by Herbert Jones, Vedas started at odds of 11/2 for the 97th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket. His twelve opponents included the Dewhurst Stakes winner Rouge Croix, who started favourite, Llangibby (New Stakes), Plum Centre and Signorino (runner-up in the Middle Park Stakes). Racing on heavy ground Vedas tracked the leaders as the outsider Brother Bill set the pace before moving up to take the lead approaching the final furlong. He went four lengths clear of his rivals and despite tiring in the final strides he prevailed by two lengths from Signorino with Llangibby a head away in third. The result provided an unusual coincidence concerning the number \\"13\\": Vedas, on his thirteenth start, was number 13 on the racecard, and drawn number thirteen in thirteen-runner field, while the numbers in his starting price (11/2) totalled 13; his win came 13 years after his trainer rode Bona Vista to victory in the race. Vedas was strongly fancied for the Epsom Derby but was found to be lame a few days before the race and was withdrawn from the contest. After a lengthy break he returned in the Gratwicke Stakes over one and a half miles but failed to reproduce his earlier form and was well-beaten in a race won by Polymelus. Towards the end of the year Vedas's owner, Mr West Fenton de-Wend Fenton was \\"warned-off\\" (banned from any involvement in horse racing) by the Jockey Club after riding his own horse to defeat in a match race at Sandown which involved highly suspicious betting patterns. Vedas earned £5,150 on 1905. ===1906: four-year-old season=== Vedas remained in training as a four-year-old but in April it was announced that he had \\"broken down badly\\" and would not race again. He was reported dead shortly afterwards. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Vedas an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1902 racehorse births Category:1906 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 16-c Category:2000 Guineas winners ","title":"Vedas (horse)"},{"id":"56880699","text":"One Day is the debut studio album by Dutch musician and singer-songwriter Peter Toussaint, who has been living in Pretoria since 2003.

It is directed by Kong Sheng and Huang Wei, and stars Wang Kai, Yang Shuo and Dong Zijian as budding entrepreneurs who take advantage of the economic reforms being rolled out in 1970s China. The drama is a celebration of 40 years of China's open door policy, and will be split into two parts. The first part will run for 45 episodes, and air on Dragon TV and Beijing TV beginning December 10, 2018. The second part will begin filming in 2019. == Cast Main=== * Wang Kai as Song Yunhui, a naturally gifted man who comes from a family oppressed by the government, since it didn't belong to the peasant class prior to the establishment of PRC. As such, it was difficult for him to rise in the existing system. He grabs hold of the opportunity of the resumption of traditional examination based on academics and eventually becomes a technical engineer. * Yang Shuo as Lei Dongbao, who is resolute and efficient and comes from a military background. During China's Rural Reform, he leads his whole village in following the government initiatives. However, along the way, he realizes he is tied down by his limited knowledge and world view. * Dong Zijian as Yang Xun, a self-employed man who scrambles for every little business opportunities, and has undergone several failures, before finally attaining his own business and property. ===Supporting=== * Tong Yao as Song Yunping, Song Yunhui's sister and Lei Dongbao's wife. A gentle, kind and courageous woman who provides endless support and warmth to her brother and husband.

As the Yeshan iron ore plant in Nanjing retains the 1970s to 1980s appearance, the building was used for a variety of scenes; scenes of bookstores, photo studios, guest house, government offices, etc. were all shot there. The drama also filmed in Nanjing Yuntai Shan Pyrite Co., Ltd., also in Nanjing, where the crew filmed the mine dormitory, canteen, town hall and children's school, where Song Yunhui taught. The Ministry of Chemical Industry was filmed at Nanjing Art Institute. In order to create a more authentic \\"Xiao Lei Jia Village (小雷家村)\\", the crew planted a large tree at the location a year in advance, and spent more than 20 days in the village to shoot. It is reported that the money used to \\"restore the texture of the age\\" was double the amount used in other TV series, with ultra-wide format used for the first time. For the many snow scenes, the crew used naturally degradable paper foam instead of the cheaper magnesium sulfate or aluminum, citing that the old way produced pollution. Actor Wang Kai reportedly lost weight to achieve the look the impoverished main character, while Yang Shuo gained weight to become the well-off secretary of the village. Principal photography began on February 23, 2018 in Jing County, Xuancheng, Anhui and ended on June 26. === Casting and release === At Tencent Video VVision Conference held on November 8, 2017, Like a Flowing River was announced, with confirmation of its television broadcast on Dragon TV as a tribute to the 40th anniversary of China's open door policy.

Favell creates self-portraits, sometimes featuring her own image and other times featuring imagery that represents her, often making use of archival photos of family members and images from pop culture. == Early life == Rosalie Favell was born in 1958 to a Métis father named Gerald, and a mother of Scottish/English descent named Florence McFadyen. She was raised in an Anglican household where the family's ancestry was not openly discussed. Receiving her first camera at age ten, Favell first formally explored her artistic impulse a number of years later at a night photography course which inspired her to continue learning the medium. == Education == Favell completed a bachelor of applied arts at Ryerson Polytechnic Institute in 1984, a master of fine arts at the University of New Mexico in 1998, and a PhD(ABD) in Cultural Mediations at Carleton University in 2009. In the late 1990s, when she was making a shift from documentary photography to digital photo manipulations, Favell learned from fellow artist Larry Glawson. Rosalie Favell has taught many courses and workshops throughout her career. She has taught courses at the University of Manitoba (98-99), the Institute of American Indian Art Santa-Fe, (94-95), Carleton University, and the University of Ottawa, to name a few. Favell has also taught digital photography at Discovery University since 2013, a program run jointly by The Ottawa Mission and the University of Ottawa to offer people of low-income situations educational opportunities. Favell has done several residencies as well, including residencies at the Banff Centre, and the Nigig Visiting Artist Residency at OCAD University, where she presented the work Facing the Camera (2008-ongoing) that consisted of a series of portraits of members of the Indigenous arts community. == Involvement in organizations == Favell was an early member of the NIIPA (Native Indian/Inuit Photographers’ Association) in Hamilton, the first artist-run centre specializing in photo-based artwork by Indigenous artists in Canada. She was a board member at the Floating Gallery Centre for Photography in Winnipeg and the Original Women's Network: a Native Women's Resource Centre. Favell has also worked with Nepalese women's groups in Katmandu. == Themes == A prominent and ongoing theme in Favell's work is self-portraiture. Favell often references the traditions of portraiture and self-portraiture, using traditional composition or even existing portraits, and replacing the historical sitter with herself. An example of this is Favell's The Artist in Her Museum: The Collector (2005) that references Charles Wilson Peale's self-portrait displaying his collection, The Artist in His Museum (1822). In Favell's work she replaces the collector with her own image and the collection of specimens with her family photos, and in doing so questions and overwrites the colonial practice of collection and display. In her photo manipulations, Favell re-contextualizes specific portraits and the portrait tradition on a whole, often introducing her own Indigenous identity to create a dialogue. Fellow artist and writer Barry Ace summarizes Favell's approach by stating: “The collected images act as an aide-memoire, igniting personal and collective memory, while photo-digital practice provides her with an expansive tableau for visual expressions of self, family, identity and sexuality.” Favell has also created many works using documentary photography to create an image of the Indigenous community that she is a part of. Works such as Portraits in Blood (1980s) use photographic portraits of Indigenous artists and friends to express and document Favell's own navigation of Indigenous identity. Her ongoing Facing the Camera series, which began in 2008, consists of dynamic photographic portraits of roughly 450 Indigenous artists from across the globe including Daphne Odjig, Greg Hill, Bear Witness of A Tribe Called Red, Caroline Monnet, Heather Igloliorte, Kent Monkman, Mary Watt, Maree Clarke, Alex Janvier, and Mary Anne Barkhouse. The active poses that Favell captures in Facing the Camera lend agency to the sitters and call into question stereotypes created in part by a history of portraiture of Indigenous people from a colonial perspective. == Awards == Favell has received recognition and support for her work through several awards and grants throughout her career. Favell was awarded the biennial Karsh Award in 2012 in recognition of her extensive body of photographic work, the Ontario Arts Council Chalmers Arts Fellowship in 2004, and the Canada Council for the Arts Victor Martyn Lynch-Staunton Award in 2003, to name a few. In 2017, Favell was awarded The Paul de Hueck and Norman Walford Career Achievement Award for Art Photography. == Exhibited and Collected Works == Favell's work has been exhibited at and collected by the National Gallery of Canada, the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography, Library and Archives Canada, the Ottawa Art Gallery, Karsh-Masson Gallery, Cube Gallery, the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, and the Rockwell Museum of Western Art. An exhibition at the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography (National Gallery of Canada) called Steeling the Gaze: Portraits by Aboriginal Artists that challenged stereotypical portrayals of Indigenous people through portraiture featured Favell's work. Her portraits appeared alongside the work of other Indigenous artists such as KC Adams, Carl Beam, Dana Claxton, Thirza Cuthand, Kent Monkman, David Neel, Shelley Niro, Greg Staats, Jeff Thomas, and Bear Witness. == Group Exhibitions == * 2013: Steeling the Gaze: Portraits by Aboriginal Artists, Mendel Art Gallery, Saskatoon, SK * 2019: Hearts of Our People: Native Women Artists, Minneapolis Institute of Art, Minneapolis, MN == Selected works == * 1994 Living Evidence * 1980s Portraits in Blood * 1998 Longing and Not Belonging * 2005 The Artist in Her Museum: The Collector * 1999-2006 Plain(s) Warrior Artist * 2010 Wish You Were Here * 2008-ongoing Facing the Camera == Collaborative projects and groups == In 2017, Rosalie Favell organized a collaborative project called Wrapped in Culture which involved Indigenous artists from Canada: Favell herself, Barry Ace (Anishinaabe-Odawa), Meryl McMaster (Cree) and Adrian Stimson (Siksika- Blackfoot), and from Australia: Maree Clarke (Mutti Mutti, Yorta Yorta, Boon Wurrung), Vicki West (Tasmanian), Mitch Mahoney (Boon Wurrung, Barkindji), Molly Mahoney (Boon Wurrung, Barkindji), Kerri Clarke (Boon Wurrung), and Wade Mahoney (Barkindji). The ten artists created a traditional Blackfoot buffalo robe and an Australian Aboriginal possum skin cloak at workshops spanning a few weeks. The robes were incised and painted with designs in an act of storytelling, reclamation, and community building. Rosalie Favell is part of the OO7 (Ottawa Ontario Seven) Collective, a group of Indigenous artists that includes Ariel Smith, Barry Ace, Frank Shebageget, Leo Yerxa, Michael Belmore, Ron Noganosh, and invited “special agents.” The group provides an alternative and experimental space for Ottawa-based Indigenous artists at different stages in their careers. == References  Further reading == * Ace, Barry and Rice, Ryan. “Rosalie Favell: Longing and not Belonging.” CV: Photographie contemporaine, 53 (Winter 2000), 23-30. * Ace, Barry.

It was an adaption of the logic game nim. Inspired by the discussion in the magazine Przekrój of a variant of nim in the 1961 film Last Year at Marienbad (L'Année dernière à Marienbad), named \\"Marienbad\\" by the magazine, Podgórski programmed the game for the in-development 1003 mainframe, released in 1963. The game had players opposing the computer in alternating rounds of removing matches from a set, with the last player to take a match the loser. As the computer always played the optimal moves, it was essentially unbeatable. Like many games in the early history of video games, Marienbad did not spread far beyond the initial location. Elwro did not produce or advertise the game, though Podgórski recreated it at the Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna (Military University of Technology in Warsaw). The game fell into obscurity, with no pictures or documentation surviving to recreate it in its original form; as there is only one known Odra 1003 remaining and no way of recreating the game exists, it is considered lost. Despite its simplicity, it is considered possibly the first Polish computer or video game. ==Gameplay== In nim, players take turns removing at least one object from a set of objects, traditionally matchsticks, with the goal of either being or not being the player who removes the last object. The gameplay options can be modeled mathematically. In Marienbads default game mode, four rows of matches were generated, with either one, three, five or seven matches within each row. The side that was left with the last match lost. The computer printout showed the player the current layout of matches. A single player could play the game at a time, whose turn alternated with the computer's. Regardless of which side started the game, the computer was almost certain to be the winner, as it always made the perfect moves. On its maximum settings, the game consisted of 8,000 rows containing up to 1 trillion matches, requiring an hour for the computer to choose its next move. The game did not support a video output, as the Odra 1003 did not have a screen. Instead, the game was played via a teletypewriter and card perforator, on which the machine printed the results. ==Development== Elwro was a Polish company established in 1959 and based in based in Wrocław, Poland, that designed and manufactured mainframe and microcomputers. Its first release was the Odra 1001 mainframe in 1960, followed by the Odra 1002 in 1962 and the Odra 1003 in 1963. Witold Podgórski was a recent graduate of the Wrocław University of Technology, having majored in electronic engineering and specialized in mathematical machines. Having first heard about the existence of \\"electronic brains\\" in 1955 in high school, he embarked on five years of study toward the automation of \\"digital machines\\". He completed his masters thesis at Elwro, where he was employed on 10 October 1961, working with the Odra 1001. He developed a way to manipulate the computer's memory to allow content to be saved, thus paving the way for the Odra 1003. The new machine used modern transistor switches that allowed for 500 operations per second, and the drum memory of the Odra 1003 program had a capacity of 40 kilobytes. While working for Elwro in 1961, Podgórski discovered the logic game nim while reading an issue in the weekly magazine Przekrój. The magazine described a two-player game where players remove any number of items from one of four rows, with the player holding the last item losing. Przekrój named this variant of nim as \\"Marienbad\\" after the 1960 French film Last Year at Marienbad (L'Année dernière à Marienbad), in which characters frequently play these mathematical duels. Podgórski became inspired by the use of the game nim in the film after reading about its principles. While sitting in a multi-hour lecture for his obligatory military study class, Podgórski decided to decipher the Marienbad algorithm and save it to a binary system which could be understood by computers. Podgórski would later assert that the algorithm was extremely simple to implement into a computer and could be expressed in two words, adding that if nobody was interested in it he would take it to the grave. He programmed the game for the first prototype of the Odra 1003, then in development and scheduled to be installed in the Board of the Topographic General Staff of the Polish Army in Wrocław. The game, intended for logical duels, was developed solely by Podgórski by creating the algorithm, writing a list of instructions which were printed on sheets the size of postcards, and manually setting the initial state of each memory cell. He designed the game to be unbeatable: if the human player made a single mistake, the computer would win. While employees in the Elwro factory knew that the result of the game was predetermined, many volunteered to play it. They could not beat the standard 16-match version of Marienbad, let alone higher settings of the game. ==Legacy== An Odra 1003 mainframe, photographed in 1974 Like many games in the early history of video games, Marienbad did not spread far beyond the initial location. Mainframe computers were rare throughout the world and primarily located in government or military institutions or large corporations, so were generally unavailable for amusement purposes. Elwro produced only 42 Odra 1003 mainframes between 1963 and 1965. Elwro declined to publish or advertise the game, and the title was mostly forgotten. The game did spread beyond the Elwro factory, however. After developing the game, Podgórski became a student at the Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna (Military University of Technology in Warsaw), and with the assistance of fellow student Bogdan Bleja set up a version of the game there on an Odra 1003 that was mediated by a university operator. The computer, and therefore the game, could be used or played by any student, but only through an operator who received the intended input from the player and passed the information to the computer. As in Podgórski's original game instance, the game was essentially unbeatable; the operators as a result actively discouraged the players from participating. The university authorities supported this, as they wanted to forcibly remove the \\"nasty habit of harassing computers for logic games\\", which they believed should be used only for serious military purposes. Players took to holding secret meetings in front of the massive computer in the late evenings when the operators were gone. Podgórski recalled that despite knowing that the game was designed to always beat the player, many people spent many hours trying to decipher the algorithm or win. In later years, variants of nim and Marienbad were the second most popular type of computer game present on Polish computers after noughts and crosses, since it was a relatively simple game to program. , who would later become the two-decade long host of Wheel of Fortune from the 1970s, proposed to Polish television a game show where players compete against a computer in nim on a Momik 8b minicomputer. Meanwhile, Podgórski continued to work for Elwro, co-creating Odra computers, though he did not stop working on games. After colleagues brought a variant of the Mancala board game from Egypt, he became inspired to adapt it to the computer. This time he did not want to create an unbeatable game, but included adjustable difficulty levels to create a fun experience regardless of the player's expertise. Writing for Polish Bytes (Bajty Polskie), Bartłomiej Kluska asserts that as the only copy of the Odra 1003 is kept at the Museum of Technology in Warsaw in an inactive state, the original game of Marienbad no longer exists outside of the memory of players. No recreations of the game have been made for more modern computers, and there are no known photos or documentation for how the game was played or created. In the research paper Gry komputerowe jako dziedzictwo kulturowe (Computer games as a cultural heritage) by Maria Garda, she notes that the game should be written about only in the past tense as the original elements have not been preserved, adding that while the Marienbad algorithm can be recreated in a new programming environment, reconstruction of the physical transistors of the original computer would be nearly impossible. The paper further compared the challenges of playing this title in the modern era to playing Super Mario Bros. on the originally intended equipment in 50 years' time. Marienbad is considered one of the first Polish video games, developed almost 20 years before later candidates OiX (1984), Gąsienica (1985), and Puszka Pandory (1986), and well before the first well-known Polish game, Tajemnica Statuetki (1993). Łódź game historian Bartek Kluska made this assertion in his foundational book on the Polish video gaming industry, Polish Bytes; his research uncovered the game as 24 years older than the game that previously held the title. Kluska notes, however, that it was preceded by \\"Kółko i krzyżyk\\", a version of tic-tac-toe written by Department of Mathematical Apparatus programmer Bogdan Miś in 1960 for the computer, using a chess-sized grid. Michał Nowicki of Gram.pl asserted that Kluska's research, in contrast with the previous and more imprecise Polish video gaming text Dawno temu w grach (Once upon a time in games), allows Marienbad's claim as the first Polish computer or video game to be made with almost 100% certainty. An article by retailer Empik further asserts that Marienbads simplicity and lack of video output means that the term \\"computer game\\" is a somewhat exaggerated term to describe it, much less \\"video game\\". Garda's paper claims, however, that regardless of its simplicity the game has importance as one of one the earliest computer or video games from the region, although Marcin Kosman of Gamezilla notes that this first attempt at creating a Polish computer game went largely unnoticed. Jacek Głowacki of Gry Online stated that despite its obscurity, it should be considered the ancestor of the modern Polish video gaming industry, and that its existence and creation are worth remembering. The 2018 Ars Independent Festival held an exhibition entitled \\"From Marienbad to Novigrad\\" which explored the history of the Polish video gaming industry from Marienbad to The Witcher 3 (2015). == See also== * Nimrod, a 1951 mainframe computer built to play nim * Early history of video games * Early mainframe games ==References Further reading == * Początek – Historia Polskich Gier #1 (History of Polish Games # 1) by Polskie Gry Wideo Category:1962 video games Category:Mainframe games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Video games developed in Poland ","title":"Marienbad (video game)"},{"id":"56880784","text":"The Relative temperature index (RTI) is a characteristic parameter related to the thermal degradation of plastic materials.

In 2019, the name was split out from Volkswagen to become its own marque and the model became known as the Jetta VA3. == First generation (Jetta Mk2/A2/King/Pioneer; 1991) == The Mark 2 Jetta went on to become the first Volkswagen model produced in China by Volkswagen Group China's second joint venture partner FAW-Volkswagen. Production began on 5 December 1991. Initially sold as complete knock down (CKD) kits, local manufacturing has gradually taken over in the form of Semi-Knocked Down kits in 1992, and full local production in 1995. The car has had three revisions since its inception in China. ===Jetta King=== Pre facelift Jetta taxi in Xi'an Facelift Jetta taxi in Guangzhou The Volkswagen Jetta King, is a Chinese Volkswagen model produced by FAW-Volkswagen at its plants in Changchun and Chengdu. It was launched in April 1997 and replaced the Volkswagen Jetta. The Jetta King was the result of the technical combination between the Volkswagen Jetta and design scheme from the fourth generation Volkswagen Passat in 1997. Production started in August 1998, and its name was changed to \\"Jetta King\\" (or 大众捷达王 in Mandarin). The second facelift was revealed in March 2004 (taking influences from Volkswagen's most expensive model, the Phaeton). On 29 July 2007, it was announced that First Automotive Works expanded its production of the Mark 2 Jetta by building a new assembly plant in Chengdu, Sichuan Province in Southwest China. The expansion was driven by the high demand for the car, a desire to expand in the western part of the country, as well as the long-term goal of FAW to develop new derivatives from the car's platform independently of Volkswagen. The most striking feature of the Jetta King was the new front end. The interior of the different equipment lines came from the Corrado and Passat B5. The dimensions of the vehicles are different depending on the chosen equipment line. Only the trunk volume of 660 liters is the same for all units. Initially it was only the 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with 5 valves per cylinder and a displacement of 1595 cc available. The power of it was 74 kW. It had a manual four-speed gearbox, which later was replaced by a five speed gearbox. From November 1998 onward, there was an option for a 4-speed automatic. A month earlier, the first units were made with ABS (option). In April 2001, the equipment line Meeresbrise was launched with an EFI engine and a power of 64 kW. A 1.9-liter diesel engine with a displacement of 1896 cc and a power output of 47 kW was added to the lineup in April 2002. The 1.6-liter engine was removed from the engine range. At the same time, the Jetta König was facelifted in 2002 with new front and rear fascias. A 1.6-liter EFI engine producing 70 kW was included in the range. At the same time the prestige model Meeresbrise was replaced by the new Avantgarde. It had dual airbags and can be recognized on the green or black tinted windows. From June 2009 the 1.6-liter RSH engine (type EA111) engine with a power of 70 kW was available. Following equipment lines of the Jetta King were offered: AT, ATF, Avantgarde, CDX, CiF, CiX, CT, GDF, GiF, GT, GTI, GTX and Meeresbrise. The Volkswagen Jetta King was also available in the form of a 2-door pickup truck. Few of these were produced. ===Jetta Pioneer=== The third facelift called the Volkswagen Jetta Pioneer, is a Chinese Volkswagen model produced by FAW-Volkswagen at its plants in Changchun and Chengdu. It was released in March 2010 replacing the Volkswagen Jetta King and taking some inspirations from stylings of Volkswagen models of the newest generation. A diesel version of the Jetta is also on sale, but a large proportion are in service as taxis in many cities in China, rather than as private cars. Rear side. The new exterior brought new production and sales records. It received new front and rear bumpers, along with new grill and lights. Furthermore, there was a new instrument panel with a three-spoke steering wheel to give the impression of a sporty car and driver's airbag as standard. Other standard features were a CD player that could read MP3 CDs, an ISOFIX system for child seats, the seat belt alarm for the driver and an antilock braking system and EBD for better distribution of the braking force. Only the taxi version had electrically adjustable rear view mirrors. The 1.6-liter RSH with an output of 70 kW (94 HP) served as the standard engine. The consumption is indicated at 7.5 liters per 100 km (31 MPG US). However, the favorable fuel consumption was the optional 1.9L SDI engine with a power of 47 kW (63 HP). The consumption of this engine was indicated at 4.5 liters per 100 km (52 MPG US). This version of the Jetta was not offered in different trim levels. It was a single model for the Chinese market. It varied in two forms only, one as a family car and the other as a taxi. VW Jetta facelift taxi in Laiwu City, Shandong Province == Second generation (New Jetta; 2013) == The Volkswagen New Jetta 2013 (in Chinese: “大众新捷达2013款”) is a Chinese Volkswagen model produced by FAW-Volkswagen at its plants in Changchun and Chengdu. It was launched in March 2013 and replaced the Volkswagen Jetta Pioneer. The New Jetta is available with two different engines of the type EA211. These are corresponding by region to the China IV or China V emission standard. It is a four-cylinder in-line engine with 4 valves per cylinder. The fuel injection is controlled electronically, as in all modern engines. The performance is 66 or 81 kW. Following equipment lines are offered: Avantgarde (时尚), Comfortline (舒适) and Luxury (豪华). There's a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic transmission option. The New Jetta was given a facelift in 2017 with a new front and rear design and a brand new 1.5 litre engine and 7 speed dual clutch gearbox for the 230TSI model. To differentiate this version with 2013 type, the selling name was branded as \\"New Jetta 2017\\" (in Chinese: “新捷达2017款”). Jetta VA3 A new car marque was launched in China in February 2019 known as Jetta and the one of the models, the Jetta VA3 is a facelifted and rebadged Jetta Night. According to pictures found on Chinese car website Autohome, the Jetta VA3 said to be powered by two engines, a 1.4 litre turbo and the 1.5 litre naturally aspirated EA211 four cylinder engine. The VA3 was officially listed in September 2019 and the EA211 is available paired to a 5 speed manual and 6 speed automatic gearbox.

In 2018, she plans to open the first microbrewery within Rwanda which will feature a staff composed entirely of local women. ==Early Life== Josephine was born in 1964 to a family with five other siblings. In 1974, her father was assassinated during the 1973 Rwandan coup d'état which led Fina's mother to exile Rwanda with all of her children in tow. The Uwineza family went to a few neighboring countries where other exiled family members had been staying but eventually ended up in Canada. Josephine later returned to Rwanda in 1998 to provide aid to the nation following the Rwandan genocide which led to a large chunk of the population dead and the nation in shambles. ==Career== Upon returning to Rwanda with her husband and child, Josephine managed a Chinese restaurant, Flamingo, within the city of Kigali. She managed the restaurant for 13 years before deciding to close it down in 2015 after deciding that she wasn't getting enough satisfaction from the business and wanted to spend more time with her family. Following the closing of Flamingo, Josephine became a member of the Peace Through Business program held by the Institute for Economic Empowerment of Women which targets women in the countries of Rwanda and Afghanistan who are starting their own businesses. Through the Peace Through Business program, Josephine met Nancy Coldham, a consultant who aids in the financial pursuits of women in low-income nations. Josephine had the beginnings of an idea to open a new business within Kigali which Coldham encouraged and even helped instigate by helping Josephine find an outside source for help with this start-up. Coldham found help in the form of Beau's All Natural Brewing Company, a brewing company in Ontario, Canada. Beau's had interest in providing resources and training to someone who wanted to start their own brewery which Josephine could take advantage of. A team of leads from Beau's visited Rwanda in 2016 to assess the situation firsthand which ultimately lead to agreeing to aid Josephine with her start-up. Following the visit from Beau's, Josephine and her newfound friends in Beau's launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funding for the brewery, citing the importance of a brewery within Rwanda as well as the business plan for the brewery to be owned and operate entirely by women. The Kickstarter campaign raised over CAD $95,000 with over 1,000 backers. ==Rwanda Brewery== Josephine's brewery, planned to open in 2018, will feature a staff composed entirely of women from areas surrounding Kigali. The brewery will make use of ingredients that are sourced mostly from Rwanda. The main ingredients for the majority of the brews that will be produced include banana and sorghum which are popular ingredients to use within African brews. Josephine hopes that the implementation of Rwanda's first microbrewery will be a positive step for the country as a whole since Rwanda enjoys the consumption of beer and being able to have a locally produced microbrew will be a source of unifying strength for the nation. ==References== Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Rwandan businesspeople ","title":"Josephine Uwineza"},{"id":"56880809","text":"Bajtek is one of the first popular magazines devoted to computer science in Poland.

The source in March 2018 reports him as age 52. The source in June 2018 reports him as age 53. He was born sometime between March and June 1965.) is an American businessman who is the former president and chief operating officer of Theranos, which was a privately held health technology company founded by his then-girlfriend Elizabeth Holmes. Theranos is known for its false claims to have devised revolutionary blood tests that used very small amounts of blood such as that which can be extracted from a fingerstick. Starting in 2015, Theranos came under criticism in the media due to its questionable claims and practices. The company was eventually forced into bankruptcy. Balwani was charged by federal authorities for operating the business as a multi-million-dollar scheme to defraud investors, doctors, and patients. A trial was set to begin in October 2020, but has been pushed back to March 9th 2021 due to COVID-19 concerns. ==Early life and education== Ramesh Balwani was born in Pakistan to a Sindhi Hindu family. The family moved to India, and later immigrated to the United States. In 1986 Balwani began undergraduate studies at the University of Texas at Austin where he was a member of the Pakistani Students Association. He received an undergraduate degree in information systems. ==Career== Balwani worked for Lotus Software and Microsoft before 1998, when he helped to create CommerceBid, a software development company that helped businesses buy and sell items over the burgeoning Internet. In 1999, the company was purchased by Commerce One, another business development software company with a high valuation. The buyout was done entirely with stock, and Balwani joined the board of the new company. In July 2000, Balwani sold his shares in Commerce One, netting nearly $40 million shortly before the company went out of business, just before the dot com bubble burst. He later went back to school and received a Master of Business Administration from the University of California, Berkeley in 2003. He spent another four years in a computer science graduate program at Stanford University, but dropped out in 2008. While enrolled at Berkeley, Balwani met Elizabeth Holmes, who was in her senior year of high school. Holmes pursued an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering at Stanford, but later dropped out to focus full-time on Theranos. ==Theranos== Theranos Logo Balwani joined Theranos in 2009. He ran the company's day-to-day operations as its president. He had no training in biological sciences or medical devices, which became an issue due to the absence of medical experts on the company's board of directors and Balwani's behavior. He was described by former Theranos employees as overbearing, uncompromising and so concerned about industrial espionage that he verged on paranoia. Balwani publicly equated the Edison, Theranos' blood testing device, with the discovery of antibiotics. Within Theranos, Balwani was known for using technical terms he seemingly did not understand in what others believed were attempts to appear more knowledgeable. Note: the British edition of Bad Blood incorrectly gives Balwani's country of origin as India. The Wall Street Journal reported in October 2015 that the Edison blood testing device by Theranos produced inaccurate medical diagnoses and results. Edison machines frequently failed quality-control checks and produced widely varying results, a finding that was corroborated in a report released in March 2016 by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In April 2016, Theranos told regulators it had voided all test results from Edison machines for 2014 and 2015, as well as some other tests it ran on conventional machines. In January 2016, the CMS sent a warning letter to Theranos after inspecting its Newark, California, laboratory. CMS regulators proposed a two- year ban on Balwani from owning or operating a blood lab after the company had not fixed problems within its California lab in March 2016. The other charges of fraud against Theranos include claiming the company's technology was being used by the U.S. Department of Defense in combat situations despite never having been used. Another false claim included claiming a $100 million revenue stream in 2014 that was actually $100,000. ==Legal proceedingsSEC fraud charges=== In March 2018, Balwani and Holmes were charged by the SEC with securities fraud, \\"raising more than $700 million from investors through an elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company's technology, business, and financial performance\\". Holmes settled the case out of court without admitting or denying wrongdoing, but Balwani is still in litigation as of 2019. He says he is innocent of the charges. ===Criminal charges=== On June 15, 2018, following an investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco that lasted more than two years, a federal grand jury indicted president Ramesh \\"Sunny\\" Balwani and Elizabeth Holmes on nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Prosecutors allege that Holmes and Balwani engaged in two criminal schemes, one to defraud investors, the other to defraud doctors and patients. In June 2019 a U.S. District Court judge ordered Balwani and Holmes to stand trial beginning in July 2020. In March 2020, a U.S. District Court Judge ordered that Balwani will stand trial separately from Holmes. Holmes's trial is scheduled to start in October 2020. Balwani's trial will begin after the conclusion of Holmes's. Balwani's attorneys were expected to argue that he never made any money for his work at Theranos. ==Personal life== Balwani was in a romantic relationship with Elizabeth Holmes during his tenure at Theranos. Holmes met him in 2002 at age 18, while still in school. He was 19 years older than Holmes and married at the time. Their relationship was not disclosed to their Theranos investors. He was previously married to Japanese artist Keiko Fujimoto. Fujimoto and Balwani lived in San Francisco before their divorce in December 2002. ==References * In the archive video, click the blank video screen to begin playing and on the sound- bar to enable sound.

The game achieved popularity after trading on the Grzybowska Commodity Exchange (including trade from a lot of pirates, which were rampant in the country at the time due to a Communist approach to copyright). The first version of the game was written in BASIC, and was wiped after the tape was accidentally placed into a tape recorder. Borkowski lost enthusiasm for the game and didn't have a second attempt. He returned to the project in 1986 when house sitting for a friend. The text compression on the ZX Spectrum computer (due to the fact that it only had 48 kilobytes of memory) imposed many restrictions on programmers, and the game was created as a challenge to see if these restrictions could be bypassed. According to the book Polish Bytes, the game is the first one written by a Pole, attempted to be sold in Poland, and whose description appeared in the Polish press. Bajtek's review of the game is notable for being the first extensive description of a Polish video game in the media. However, Borkowski actually wrote the review himself, under the anagram pseudonym \\"Karol B. Mirowski\\". ==Legacy== On the game's 25th anniversary, 100 limited edition copies were released at the Poznań Game Arena, with each copy signed by Marcin Borkowski.

Different sources predicted that he would run as an independent to capitalize more support from the population, and although he could also have been nominated by the United Russia party as in 2012, Putin chose to run as an independent. ==PlanningPlace of the ceremony=== On 19 April it became known that Vladimir Putin was offered two options for the inauguration ceremony. The first, the traditional option, was to hold the event as before in the Grand Kremlin Palace.

However, according to the presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin is not inclined to change the venue of the ceremony, and the inauguration is likely to take place traditionally in the Grand Kremlin Palace.В Кремле рассказали о предложении Путину провести инаугурацию на площади.

The Army Foundation College recruit abuse investigation 2014–18 was a response to allegations from a group of 17-year-old British army recruits that 17 instructors had maltreated them during their training over nine days in June 2014. It was reported as the British army's largest ever investigation of abuse. Among the allegations were that the instructors assaulted recruits, smeared cattle dung into their mouths, and held their heads under water. The accused were initially charged with 40 counts of battery, actual bodily harm, and other offences; all denied the charges made against them. Charges against seven of the accused were dropped by the time of the preliminary hearing on 21 September 2017. The court martial began with the remaining ten accused on 12 February 2018. The hearing was expected to last four weeks, but soon collapsed after the judge ruled that the Royal Military Police (RMP) had abused the investigatory process and that a fair trial would therefore not be possible. Specifically, the judge criticised the investigation as 'seriously flawed': the RMP had failed to interview several key witnesses, took two years to arrest the accused for questioning under caution, and took three years to bring the case to trial. All the accused were released without further charges. == Background == The British army enlists new recruits from age 16. Recruits aged between 16 and 17.5 years, known as Junior Soldiers (JS), undergo 12 months of initial training based at the Army Foundation College in Harrogate, Yorkshire. Towards the end of this period, recruits destined for the infantry travel to battle camp in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, which includes bayonet practice. Infantry recruits then complete their training at the Infantry Training Centre in Catterick, Yorkshire. Allegations of abuse at the Army Foundation College have been common. Between 2014 and 2017, recruits made 50 formal complaints of assault or ill-treatment. == Allegations and charges == Among the initial allegations reported in the Mail on Sunday on 12 August 2017 were that seventeen instructors from the Army Foundation College, having taken their trainees to battle camp in Kirkcudbright, had pushed cow dung into the recruits' mouths, held their heads under water, and kicked and punched them repeatedly during bayonet training. The recruits concerned were aged 17; the instructors were all corporals or sergeants, and included veterans of the Afghanistan War and Iraq War. The instructors faced 40 charges of battery, actual bodily harm and other ill- treatment. All the accused denied any wrongdoing. == Court martial == By the time of the preliminary hearing of 21 September 2017, charges against seven of the accused had been dropped, leaving ten defendants to face 25 counts of ill- treatment and six of battery. All defendants entered not-guilty pleas. The trial began on 12 February 2018 at Bulford Military Court Centre with Assistant Judge Advocate General Alan Large presiding. After the opening prosecution arguments, the defence applied to have the proceedings stayed as an abuse of process, meaning that the allegations were not investigated and brought to court in proper order. The judge agreed and, describing the investigation as 'seriously flawed' and 'totally blinkered', criticised the military police for failing to interview key witnesses and taking too long to bring the case to trial. On grounds that the defendants could no longer be fairly tried, the judge stayed the case and all defendants were released. == Timeline == The following chronology is summarised from the legal judgement. * June 2014: A cohort of infantry recruits aged 17 from the Army Foundation College travel to battle camp, where the incidents allegedly took place. The recruits concerned did not make a complaint at the time. * September 2014: The recruits concerned, now based at the Infantry Training Centre in Catterick, are overheard by staff as they discuss the alleged incidents at Battle Camp. Their accounts are recorded informally and passed to the chain of command for action. The Royal Military Police are contacted. * October 2014: The military police take formal witness statements from the recruits concerned, some of whom allege abusive treatment by instructors at battle camp during bayonet practice between 6 and 15 June. A statement is also taken from the Staff Sergeant responsible for delivering bayonet training at battle camp that June, who declares that he did not witness any ill treatment at the time. Other instructors were also present, including some of the accused, but statements were not taken from them. The reason for this, as explained later to the Court Martial by the officer in charge of the investigation, was that collecting these additional witness statements would have caused delay and 'the permanent staff [i.e. the instructors] were unlikely to corroborate any allegations of assaults or manhandling of the JS [i.e. the Junior Soldiers or trainees]'. In giving evidence to the court martial, the officer said of the Battle Camp instructors: 'It was unlikely they would say they had witnessed anything—they were likely to say they had not seen anything... If they said they had witnessed it and done nothing they would have incriminated themselves.' * December 2014: By December 2014, approximately 40 junior soldiers have made allegations against approximately 30 members of staff. * September 2016: Two years after the alleged incidents, the accused are arrested and questioned under caution. * July 2017: The Service Prosecution Authority, which prosecutes on behalf of the armed forces, decides to send the case for trial at court martial. * September 2017: At the preliminary hearing of the court martial on 21 September, all defendants plead not guilty pending a full hearing from 12 February 2018. * February 2018: After the prosecution arguments, defence counsel argue that the failure to interview potential key witnesses, as well as the long delay between the alleged incidents and trial amount to an abuse of process and they apply for the proceedings to be stayed. The judge agrees and the five defendants are released on the grounds that a fair trial is no longer possible. == Reaction == The collapse of the case was reported on the BBC ITV, STV, and in the Guardian, Mirror, Northern Echo, Telegraph, Times, Yorkshire Evening Post, and Yorkshire Post. Lewis Cherry, a defence lawyer at the court martial interviewed for the BBC said he was 'appalled' by the failure of the military police to conduct its investigation in proper order, and said his clients would be 'relieved that the nightmare of these false allegations hanging over them for many years is over'. Human rights campaigners argued that the 'multiple failures' that led to the case collapsing showed that the military should not be entrusted to administer its own justice. The campaign group ForcesWatch said that the case's collapse meant that 'serious allegations of abuse against some of the army's youngest recruits have gone untested'. The Ministry of Defence announced an internal review. == See also == * Army Foundation College * Children in the military * Recruit training == References == Category:British Army Category:Bullying Category:Children in war Category:Harrogate Category:Military education and training in the United Kingdom Category:Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) ","title":"Army Foundation College recruit abuse investigation 2014–18"},{"id":"56881287","text":"Eucyclodes divapala is a moth of the family Geometridae first described by Francis Walker in 1861.

The genus is widely distributed throughout the world, with the highest species diversity in the tropics. The name is derived from Ancient Greek poly (πολύ) \\"many\\" + podion (πόδιον) \\"little foot\\", on account of the foot-like appearance of the rhizome and its branches. They are commonly called polypodies or rockcap ferns, but for many species unique vernacular names exist. They are terrestrial or epiphytic ferns, with a creeping, densely hairy or scaly rhizome bearing fronds at intervals along its length. The species differ in size and general appearance and in the character of the fronds, which are evergreen, persisting for 1-2 years, pinnate or pinnatifid (rarely simple entire), and from 10-80 cm or more long. The sori or groups of spore- cases (sporangia) are borne on the back of the frond; they are globose and naked, not covered with a membrane (indusium). Polypodies have some use in herbalism, but are today most important in horticulture where several species, hybrids, and their cultivars like Polypodium 'Green Wave' are commonly used as ornamental plants for shady locations. Polypodium have a bitter-sweet taste and are among the rather few ferns that are used in cooking; in this case as a spice e.g. for nougat. ==Species== Several of the species form hybrids with other species in the genus; these may often be distinguished by being sterile, with very small \\"blind\\" sori. , Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World accepted the following species and hybrids: *Polypodium abitaguae Hook. *Polypodium aequale Maxon *Polypodium alavae A.R.Sm. *Polypodium amorphum Suksd. *Polypodium appalachianum Haufler & Windham *Polypodium arcanum Maxon *Polypodium × aztecum Windham & Yatsk. *Polypodium californicum Kaulf. *Polypodium calirhiza S.A.Whitmore & A.R.Sm. *Polypodium cambricum L. *Polypodium castaneum Maxon ex Tejero *Polypodium chionolepis Sodiro *Polypodium chirripoense Lellinger *Polypodium christensenii Maxon *Polypodium colpodes Kunze *Polypodium conterminans Liebm. *Polypodium diplotrichum Mickel & Beitel *Polypodium eatonii Baker *Polypodium echinolepis Fée *Polypodium × encumeadense (Neuroth, Jäger & Bennert) F.J.Rumsey, Carine & Robba *Polypodium ensiforme Thunb. *Polypodium eperopeutes Mickel & Beitel *Polypodium exsul Mett. ex Kuhn *Polypodium fauriei Christ *Polypodium fissidens Maxon *Polypodium flagellare Christ *Polypodium × font-queri Rothm. *Polypodium fraternum Schltdl. & Cham. *Polypodium glycyrrhiza D.C.Eaton *Polypodium haitiense Urb. *Polypodium × hemipinnatum (Tejero, Mickel & A.R.Sm.) comb. ined. *Polypodium hesperium Maxon *Polypodium hispidulum Bartlett *Polypodium × huancayanum G.Kunkel *Polypodium × incognitum Cusick *Polypodium interjectum Shivas *Polypodium iranicum Mazooji *Polypodium kamelinii Shmakov *Polypodium khasyanum Hook. *Polypodium longipetiolatum Brade *Polypodium macaronesicum Bobrov *Polypodium × mantoniae Rothm. *Polypodium martensii Mett. *Polypodium moricandii Mett. *Polypodium moritzianum Link *Polypodium otites L. *Polypodium oxylepis C.Chr. *Polypodium pellucidum Kaulf. *Polypodium pellucidum Kaulf. f. opacum (Hillebr.)

The book is about a fictional day in the life of Marlon Bundo, the real-life pet rabbit of Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence and details the same-sex romance between Marlon Bundo and another rabbit named Wesley. It is a loose parody of Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President, another children's book featuring Marlon Bundo written by Charlotte Pence and illustrated by Karen Pence. The book and its LGBTQ-inclusive theme was written by Jill Twiss (with Marlon Bundo credited as co-writer), who is a comedy writer for the television show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, aiming to deride Vice President Pence over his controversial anti-LGBTQ views, such as his alleged support for conversion therapy of gay adolescents and opposition to same-sex marriage. It was released on March 18, 2018, one day before the release of Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President. The audiobook version features Jim Parsons, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Jeff Garlin, Ellie Kemper, John Lithgow, Jack McBrayer, and RuPaul. Alli Brydon, a freelance children's book editor, worked as a consultant and editor. The book was designed by Andrea Miller. On the day of release, John Oliver promoted the book on Last Week Tonight at the conclusion of an episode mainly dedicated to Pence and his positions on LGBTQ issues; it became a bestseller and the No. 1 book and e-book on Amazon the following day. Oliver announced profits from the book were to be donated to The Trevor Project and AIDS United. ==Background== Marlon Bundo, the Pence family's pet rabbit A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo was conceptualized as a loose parody of Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President, a children's book written by Mike Pence's daughter Charlotte Pence and illustrated by his wife Karen Pence. Their book also tells about a fictionalized day of the Pence family's pet rabbit, but without the LGBTQ themes of A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo. Writer Jill Twiss stated she became interested in Bundo due to his name. Once she learned about the upcoming book she stated, \\"we thought we could use the opportunity to support some really great charities while also hopefully putting out an inclusive, loving children's book in the process.\\" Helped by input from the whole writing staff of Last Week Tonight, Twiss' work was done in a few months, faster than the normal picture book process. On March 18, 2018, the publication of both books was used as a comedy piece on Last Week Tonight to raise awareness of Mike Pence's stated anti-LGBTQ attitudes. John Oliver stated that Pence's pet rabbit was the one thing he liked about Pence, and that because of this, he had taken issue with the real-life Marlon Bundo having to make a stop at the anti-LGBTQ organization Focus on the Family during an upcoming promotional book tour with the Pences. With the Pences' book scheduled to appear on March 19, John Oliver announced the publication of a \\"better Bundo book\\" at that very moment (so preceding the Pences' book). According to the publisher, A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo is an actual children's story \\"about marriage equality and democracy\\", rather than a \\"straight-up\\" parody of the Pences' book. Twiss added that she hoped the book would resonate with children \\"feeling out of place or having a family that looks different than that of their friends\\". It nevertheless contains some stabs at Mike Pence, with the Marlon Bundo character claiming that Pence \\"isn't very fun\\" and a stink bug character sporting a white hairdo looking like Pence's. John Oliver acquired two domain names to promote A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo. According to Oliver, the domain betterbundobook.com contrasts the book with the Pence- family-written Bundo book and focusonthefurmily.com satirizes the anti-LGBTQ organization Focus on the Family. In the March 18 broadcast, Oliver said that aside from sending an inclusive message, he was hoping to annoy Pence over the competition for his family's book and the fact that Last Week Tonight is donating all proceeds of its book to LGBTQ-friendly organizations (The Trevor Project and AIDS United). ==Plot== Marlon Bundo, a black-and-white rabbit sporting a colorful bow tie, lives in the home of \\"Grampa\\", vice president Mike Pence. Marlon is lonely, but one morning after breakfast, he meets Wesley, a bespectacled brown rabbit. They spend the day together, hopping around in the garden and the house. They decide to get married, because they never want to hop without each other again. Marlon and Wesley tell their animal friends, who respond enthusiastically. But the stink bug, who is \\"In Charge and Important\\" (and bears a striking resemblance to Mike Pence, with white hair and a suit and tie), yells at them that boy rabbits can only marry girl rabbits. He calls them different, and he says that different is bad. The other animals speak up and tell him how each of them is different in their own way. They decide to vote on who is In Charge and Important, and the stink bug is voted out. Marlon and Wesley have their wedding, with their friends in attendance. They go to sleep in anticipation of their \\"bunnymoon\\". == Analysis == A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo was created as a parody with LGBTQ themes intertwined with the plot. John Oliver and his team wanted to mock the Vice President but they also wanted to create a children's book that has humor for kids who have no political interest. This book was a gesture to Mike Pence against his homophobic beliefs.https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document- view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/16B3CC83B8635D20 Jill Twiss said in an interview that her ambition for the book was to make a heartfelt story and also annoy Vice President Mike Pence. The message that went along with the sales of the book was that \\"different is special\\". Children who do feel out of place may have a hard time handling that. Jill Twiss was hoping for a bit of satisfaction or contentment for those kids when reading about two same-sex bunnies marrying each other. The book takes a position against laws and actions against LGBTQ rights.https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document- view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/16B1EC67AEB86F18 These themes consist of respect, approval, and equality. This children's book is a way to show young people that \\"love is forever and be proud of who you are\\".https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document- view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/16C676BEEE6D6FE0 The book is a presentation to delve into LGBTQ relationships and that \\"true love will always win out\\". == Publication == One day after its release, the book overtook James Comey's book A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership to become the No. 1 book on Amazon. The book sold out on Amazon and the publishing company of the book said it was hurrying to print 760,000 more copies.https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document- view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/16B1EC67AEB86F18 For three weeks A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo was on New York Times Children's Picture Books Bestsellers List. The book was once number one on that list, while the original book Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President written by Charlotte Pence who is Mike Pence's daughter was seventh of the same list. It also topped the e-book sales, thus making the two versions of the book No. 1 and No. 2 on overall Amazon book sales, with the printed edition selling the most of the two. A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo sold much better than the Pence book it parodied, which was ranked eleventh in book sales on Amazon on its first day, climbing to No. 4 later in the week. In the first two days, 180,000 copies were sold. Last Week Tonight had not anticipated a large demand and the printed version sold out after two days. While it was being reprinted, it remained possible to order the book on Amazon and it continued to be available as an ebook version for Amazon Kindle and its variant platforms. , the audiobook version with voice acting from Jim Parsons, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Jeff Garlin, Ellie Kemper, John Lithgow, Jack McBrayer and RuPaul was No. 1 on Audible. The book's distributor reported to have 150,000 books on back order three days before it was scheduled to be available in stores, on March 23. On March 28, publisher Chronicle Books reported to have over 400,000 copies in print. Independent booksellers expressed disappointment with Chronicle Books for its handling of the book's launch, making it available via Amazon prior to supplying other retailers. ==Reception Public response === The publication sparked large numbers of reviews and comments on Amazon. These were overwhelmingly positive, though only about a third of the reviews were left by actual buyers of the book. On its launch date, a number of one star reviews with negative comments were left on the page of the Pences' book by non-buyers who favored the Twiss book, while Pence fans counteracted with five-star reviews. Later that day, it was no longer possible to review the Pences' book without purchasing it and one star ratings from non-buyers had been removed. News about the book and the controversy it stirred up was picked up by mainstream news outlets in the U.S. and all over the world. In a segment on the book on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Ellen DeGeneres praised it and presented John Oliver with a $10,000 check from HBO for The Trevor Project, calling on her viewers to buy the book in support of the project. Will & Grace creator Max Mutchnik donated a copy of the book to every elementary school in Indiana, saying he wanted to counter Pence's \\"message of intolerance\\" about gay people, hoping to \\"provide positive role models and a story of inclusion for children in Pence's home state\\". Focus on the Family called John Oliver's treatment of the Pences' book \\"not just vicious in tone, but also vulgar and vile in every sense of the word and way\\". In 2018, the American Library Association stated the book was ranked second on a list of the most challenged titles, meaning it was requested for removal from various library collections on several occasions. === Reaction from Charlotte Pence and Regnery Publishing === Charlotte Pence, Mike Pence's daughter and the author of Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President, supported A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo. She posted on Twitter a picture of herself and the real-life Marlon Bundo wearing a bow tie identical to the one in Jill Twiss' book and said in a television interview: \\"His book is contributing to charities that I think we can all get behind... I'm all for it.\\" The official Instagram of Marlon Bundo also spoke of Twiss' book in a positive light, stating \\"Not gonna lie, I do look pretty fly in a bow tie. The only thing better than one bunny book for charity is...TWO bunny books for charity.\\" The proceeds from the Pences' book were also given to charities, namely The A21 Campaign which works to fight human trafficking and Tracy's Kids, an art therapy program for hospitalized children. Regnery Publishing, the conservative book publisher who published the Pence book, initially criticized the release of A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo, saying that it was \\"unfortunate that anyone would feel the need to ridicule an educational children's book and turn it into something controversial and partisan\\". When the success of both books became apparent, Regnery congratulated John Oliver and Chronicle Books with their sales figures, stating: \\"There's plenty to go around for everyone and, like Charlotte [Pence] said, we can all be happy the proceeds are going to a good cause.\\" === Critical reviews === Common Sense Media gave the book a four star rating and considers it appropriate for children of four years and older, giving it its highest marks for \\"positive messages\\" and \\"positive role models and representations\\". Susie Wilde of The News & Observer noted that Twiss \\"understands how to tell a simple story with comic touches and pacing, creating a parody that children might actually enjoy\\", while Keller's \\"details are playful and give a strong sense of motion, which works well for the two rabbit heroes who never want to hop without each other.\\" Katy Waldman in The New Yorker called the book \\"full of the attentive details and poetic grace notes that distinguish good children's books\\", while noting its \\"subtextual treats for adults\\". Kirkus Reviews calls the book \\"another tiresome political picture\\", that really just aims at older people and not for the age the book was supposed to be for.https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document- view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/16B3CC83B8635D20 The review also notes that the book is good for a little laughter but not for a message intended for inclusion. However, The Globe and Mail Anna Fitzpatrick wrote that \\"while an unabashed political parody, it also stands on its own as a children's book\\". ==See also== * Whose Boat Is This Boat?, a satirical children's book produced by The Late Show With Stephen Colbert ==References * Category:2018 in LGBT history Category:2018 children's books Category:2010s LGBT literature Category:American children's books Category:Books about the Trump administration Category:Children's books with LGBT themes Category:Chronicle Books books Category:Gay fiction Category:Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Category:LGBT literature in the United States Category:Mike Pence Category:Rabbits and hares in art Category:Rabbits and hares in popular culture Category:Political satire books ","title":"A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo"},{"id":"56881445","text":"Unity Biotechnology is a startup biotechnology company that develops drugs which target senescent cells.

It is a sequel of 2014 film Home Sweet Home. It stars John D'Silva, Rajdeep Naik and Aryan Khedekar. It is produced by Swapnil Shetkar and Madhav Gad under the banner of Go Goa Gollywood Productions. It is a mixture of political and courtroom drama. This film is inspired from real life incidents in Goan and National politics. It was released commercially all over Goa on 25 December 2015 and became an instant hit despite facing tough competition from two of the biggest Bollywood films Bajirao Mastani and Dilwale. It completed a record number of 900+ shows in first five weeks. == Plot == Home sweet Home 2 takes place 3 months after the incidents of the first film. This film kick-starts with real political happening in Goa. The C.M of Goa is called at the center to be one of the Union Minister of India. As soon as the new Chief Minister is appointed, Alliance party members, led by Digambar Singbal convince some of the ruling MLA's and make then withdraw their support causing the Goa Government collapse overnight. Re-elections are declared and every political party is trying their best strategies to win the elections. Liquor parties, money for votes, promises for jobs and threats by goons; Nothing is off limits. As these event are unfolding everybody is interested in knowing whereabouts of John and Raj who once challenged the system. Some believe they were killed by the people involved in scam while some say John has accepted a huge amount of money to be silent. But nobody knows the truth for certain. One fine day during a public meeting of Yuva Shakti Party arranged by Digambar Singbal, John and Raj make a surprise but dramatic entry and capture the public attention. It is revealed that they accepted the money offered by Digambar Singbal only with the intention to use it in their fight against corrupt system and bring justice to everyone involved in land scam. John's case is accepted in the court of law. John is helped by a press reporter named Priya. In the process of uncovering the evidences John and Raj also expose the biggest secret behind this scam and Goan Politics, a spiritual leader who has been the King Maker of Goan politics for years. == Production == Given the open ending of the first Home Sweet Home the audience had been very eager to know what happens with John & Raj. The director and producer would get bombarded with similar questions wherever they went. This was a time when The then Chief Minister of Goa, Mr Manohar Parrikar was appointed as the Defence Minister of India and Goa was witnessing political instability. Clubbing this scenario with the first film's plot Swapnil came up with basic storyline for the sequel. The sequel was readied within a year from release of the first film. Because of the huge success of the first film, the well known businessman Ashutosh Khandekar and Charles Lobo came on board as the co-producers for the film. This film was also shot on real locations in Goa. The principal photography began on 9 October 2015 and ended on 30 October 2015. == Release == The film was released commercially all over Goa on 25 December 2015 in only 4 Screens owing to presence of 2 big Bollywood films Bajirao Mastani & Dilwale. Seeing the strong audience response the multiplex owners agreed to increase the shows as well as the film was released in 8 additional screens in the second week. In order to encourage regional cinema, this film was made tax free from second week. Due to limited numbers of screens the producers came up with an alternate way of taking the film to the audience. The film was screened in auditoriums like Ravindra Bhavan and multipurpose venues like Marqinez Palace all over Goa, Panchayat halls and church halls. Special screenings were also arranged in remote villages of Goa by renting equipments like projector, screen and 5.1 surround sound system. Special screenings have also been arranged for audience in Gulf countries. == References == Category:2015 films Category:Indian sequel films Category:Indian courtroom films Category:Films set in Goa Category:2010s Konkani-language films Category:Indian films ","title":"Home Sweet Home 2"},{"id":"56881537","text":"Limonia duplicata is a species of limoniid crane fly in the family Limoniidae. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== * Category:Limoniidae Category:Articles created by Qbugbot Category:Insects described in 1900 ","title":"Limonia duplicata"},{"id":"56881553","text":"The Anglican St Lawrence Church, dedicated to St. Lawrence of Rome, is the Church of England parish church of Lechlade in Gloucestershire, England. The church building is Grade I listed and is described with admiration in Simon Jenkins’s England’s Thousand Best Churches. The current church was built on the site of an earlier one and was completed in 1476. The roof and parts of the structure were replaced following a fire in the early 16th century. Various refurbishments have been undertaken since, including the installation of a gallery in 1740. Percy Bysshe Shelley composed a poem afer visiting the churchyard in 1815. The church is notable for its eight-sided spire above the tower. The internal fixtures and fittings include a brass chandelier, 13th century piscina and carvings including the figure of the martyrdom of St Agatha. ==History== A church is known inferentially to have existed in Lechlade since at least 1210 when a fair was granted on St. Lawrence’s day. The present wool church replaced an earlier structure in 1476, funded by the dissolution of Lechlade Priory and local townspeople. The dedication of the church was originally to St Mary but changed in 1510 by Katherine of Aragon. The nave roof and clerestory, the north porch, and the tower and spire may have been added in the early 16th century following a fire in 1510. A west gallery for singers was installed in 1740 and there were further internal additions in the 1880s. ===Literature=== The interior of the church In September 1815 Percy Bysshe Shelley visited Lechlade with his future wife Mary, her step-brother Charles Clairmont, and the novelist Thomas Love Peacock, and was moved to compose a poem, A Summer-Evening Churchyard, Lechlade, Gloucestershire, which was published the following year. The path through the churchyard is now named “Shelley’s Walk”, in a tribute to the famous atheist. ===Community=== The Vicar is Dr Andrew Cinnamond. The church has strong links with the nearby St Lawrence Church of England Primary School. The parish of Lechlade is part of the South Cotswold Team Ministry benefice within the Diocese of Gloucester. ==Architecture== St Agatha The church is of dressed freestone from Taynton Quarry near Burford. It consists of a nave with clerestorey, four-bay aisles, north porch, north and south chancel chapels and chancel with a vestry on the north side. The three-stage west tower is supported by diagonal buttresses and topped with angle pinnacles, embattled parapet and an eight-sided spire. The bells in the tower are of various ages; the oldest of which is from 1590. The peal was rehung in 1911 when a new treble added, and again in 1966. ===Fitings and fixtures=== Some of the fittings including the 13th century piscina, font and the figure of St Agatha in the north aisle are from the earlier church on the site. St Agatha is scuplted with a sword through her naked breasts depictng the nature of her martyrdom. The brass chandelier hanging from the ceiling is from 1730, and is inscribed \\"the gift of Mr Richard Ainge\\". The pulpit was added in 1882 but the base on which it stands is much older and was found in the vicarage garden. There are some medieval brasses and marble monuments. Under the stained glass east window is a wooden reredos with a carving of Agnus Dei. ===Graveyard=== The graveyard is now closed for burials, with modern burials taking place in the town cemetery, but it includes many gravestones dating back hundreds of years. Chest tombs include those to William Hobbs, Ann Lambert, William Giles, Sarah Pace, Henry Yeatman, Thomas and John Walker, William Gearing, Mary Sophia Matthews, Thomas Hipsley, Mary Anne Walker, John Raven, William and Elizabeth Hobbs, Thomas Andrews, John Taylor, William and Thomas Hall and multiple unidentified monuments. ==External links== * St Lawrence Church ==References== Lechlade

is a genus of parasite attacking the eggs of sturgeon and similar fishes (Acipenseridae and Polyodontidae). It is one of the few metazoans (animals) that live inside the cells of other animals. Polypodium hydriforme is the only species of this monotypic genus. The parent family (Polypodiidae), order (Polypodiidea) and class (Polypodiozoa) are also monotypic. == Taxonomy == Unusual characteristics have led to much controversy regarding the phylogenetic position of Polypodium within metazoans. Polypodium has traditionally been considered a cnidarian because it possesses nematocysts, the stinging structures characteristic of this phylum. However, molecular phylogenetic studies using 18S rDNA sequence data challenged this interpretation, and indicated that Polypodium is a close relative to myxozoans and that together they share a closer affinity to bilaterians than cnidarians.Zrzavý J. & Hypša V. (2003). \\"Myxozoa, Polypodium, and the origin of the Bilateria: The phylogenetic position of \\"Endocnidozoa\\" in light of the rediscovery of Buddenbrockia\\". Cladistics 19(2): 164–169. Due to the variable rates of 18S rDNA sequences, these results have been suggested to be an artifact of long branch attraction, and myxozoans have in the meantime, also been firmly classified within cnidarians. Evans et al. (2008) have performed phylogenetic analyses of metazoans with 18S and partial 28S rDNA sequences in a large dataset that includes Polypodium and a comprehensive sampling of cnidarian taxa. This supports the placement of Polypodium within Cnidaria. This accords with the fact that Polypodium possesses nematocysts and a cnidarian-like body plan. Myxozoans are now recognized as cnidarians as well. == Description and life cycle == Free living stolon. Polypodium hydriforme is an endocellular parasite with an unusual life cycle, a peculiar morphology, and high rates of DNA evolution. Polypodium spends most of its life inside the oocytes of acipenseriform fishes (sturgeons and paddlefish). Its hosts include Acipenser ruthenus, Polyodon spathula and Scaphirhynchus platorynchus. During this time, Polypodium develops from a binucleate cell into an inside-out planuliform larva and then into an elongate inside-out stolon; the epidermal cell layer is located internal to the body and the gastrodermis is located externally. This anatomy has a strong similarity with Placozoa.Early animal evolution - Royal Society Publishing The embryo, larva and stolon are surrounded by a protective polyploid cell, which also functions in digestion. Just prior to host spawning, Polypodium everts to the normal position of cell layers, revealing tentacles scattered along the stolon. During eversion, the yolk of the host oocyte fills the gastral cavities of the parasite, supplying the future free-living stage with nutrients. Finally, upon emerging from the host egg in fresh water, the free-living stolon fragments into individual medusoid-like forms that go on to multiply by means of longitudinal fission, form sexual organs, and ultimately infect host fish with their gametophores. == Habitat == The habitat of Polypodium hydriforme is freshwater. Although the fresh water habitat of Polypodium is unusual for cnidarians, it is not unheard of, especially within hydrozoans. For instance, the model organism Hydra and the jellyfish Craspedacusta sowerbii are both exclusively fresh-water hydrozoans. Hydra and Craspedacusta sowerbii are distantly related and they are not closely related to Polypodium. Also, the obligate parasite Myxobolus cerebralis lives in freshwater. Thus, it appears that in the evolution of cnidarians, invasion to fresh-water habitats has happened at least three separate times. ==References== This article incorporates CC-BY-2.0 text from the reference.

It was Computer Adventure Studio first and last game. It was created by ex- Atari alumni Piotr Kucharski, Krzysztof Piwowarski and Wiesław Florek. The team had previously created Smok Wawelski in 1987. The script was created within an hour and the whole game was ready after six weeks, without professional graphic programs or documentation. Reviews of the title were featured in Bajtek 10/1998 and Top Secret 1/1990, Top Secret 2/1990 also included an interview with the developers, which at the time was unprecedented for a Polish game. Despite the title's massive popularity in Poland, the game was readily pirated which significantly eroded the profits of the young development company and prevented it from releasing a second title. According to Techsty, it is the most discussed and most developed of all the Polish text-based adventure games. Gadzetomania thought the title was probably the first, Polish game published in a professional way.

After spending the first three years in Grenoble, he lived for ten years in Lyon where he enrolled at the National Academy of Fine Arts. He took the courses taught by the master Joseph Guichard and made contact with other protagonists of the art scene such as , , and Jean Seignemartin. The outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War impelled the Cavalli family to move first to Paris, then to Marseille, where Enrico met and frequented Adolphe Monticelli, whose teachings on the subject of light and colour greatly influenced the young Italian painter. His pictorial production of this period remains largely unknown, however we do know that two portraits by Cavalli were accepted for the Paris Salon of 1881 and particularly admired by the critic of magazine . The Cavalli family returned to Santa Maria Maggiore, where Carlo Giuseppe and Enrico taught at the local Rossetti Valentini Art SchoolSchool of Fine Arts \\"Rossetti Valentini\\" in Santa Maria Maggiore from 1881 until 1892. Enrico succeeded in stimulating and involving his students – who included the brilliant Carlo Fornara, Giovanni Battista Ciolina, Gian Maria Rastellini, Maurizio Borgnis and Lorenzo Peretti Junior – through the study of the great masters and practical experience en plein air, according to the rules of modernity he had learnt in France. Enrico Cavalli's teaching experience at the small academy in the Val Vigezzo was brusquely interrupted in 1892 by the death of his father, who officially held the position. The school's Administrative Commission announced a competition to replace Carlo Giuseppe Cavalli without taking into consideration the decade- long experience of his son, who abandoned the field in protest. Accompanied at first by Fornara and Peretti Junior, the former teacher left again for France, beginning a tormented journey that saw him wandering from place to place until, in 1901, he returned home to accept a temporary teaching post at the same Rossetti Valentini School, which nevertheless was not renewed at the end of the school year. There followed another fifteen years of commissioned works, restorations and private lessons in Italy and France. Only in 1917, with the support of some Santa Maria Maggiore notables, was the artist assigned a permanent teaching position at the Rossetti Valentini School, where he taught until his death. In 1946, on the initiative of Carlo Fornara and arts patron Amedeo Catapano, a commemorative plaque was placed on the facade of the Rossetti Valentini School, its polemical tone aimed at those who had prevented Cavalli from succeeding his father as director of the school. Also in 1946, the Municipality of Santa Maria Maggiore dedicated the street, in which the School of Fine Arts is located, to Enrico Cavalli. == Exhibitions == * \\"Una scuola di pittura in Val Vigezzo: 1881–1919\\": Turin/Novara, 1990 * \\"Paesaggi dell'Ottocento.

According to Tacitus, Nero used Christians as human torches During the Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire, many early Christians were executed by being doused with tar, pitch and oil, and set alight in Rome. According to Tacitus, the Roman Emperor Nero used Christians as human torches. As such, they martyrs wore the metaphorical \\"Shirt of Flame\\" as they were consumed. Often they were stripped and forced to wear a Tunica molesta or \\"annoying shirt\\" that was impregnated with oil, that was also a \\"Shirt of Flame\\". \\"The tunica molesta, or flaming shirt, was commonly used to execute criminals in ancient Greece and Rome.\\" ==Roman Catholic== In Roman Catholic countries such as France, Italy and Spain, heretics after their trial were confined until the execution. The shirt of flame in the auto-da-fe under the Inquisition also was worn at different times through the centuries. Often the outfit for those to be burned were funny hats, and a shirt or tabard with flames, and sometimes imps and demons, sewn upon them. These images were used to terrify the convicted heretics, as well to subject them to ridicule and abuse as they were paraded to the place of execution. The clothing worn by the two convicted men in the lower center-right of the painting, waiting for their execution in turn, is made to ridicule and to invite shame and abuse. In Spain, special clothing such as the sanbenito was worn as part of their penance. Often made of yellow or faded sackcloth, these shirts used special symbols, including the Cross of Saint Andrew, for the convicted. The humiliation of the shirt of flame outfit was part of the punishment, and also was used to warn others of the penalties of nonconformity in faith, speech and practice. Heretics were often people who did not conform to church teachings or doctrine. Many of them remained Catholic in most of their beliefs, but felt that they had betrayed that church or strayed from the church's teachings. Unlike areas with larger Protestant communities, the heretics were shamed and humiliated, rather than seeing themselves as martyrs to the Protestant religion. The shirt of flame worn by these men and women was never a gown of pride or sacrifice, but of despair. ==Biblical references== The white gown or Shirt of Flame used by Protestant martyrs was modeled in part on the long white garments worn by the martyrs \\"of the great tribulation\\" in heaven, as mentioned in chapter seven of the Bible's Book of Revelation. \\"9 After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands... 13 And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? 14 And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\\" ==Protestant martyrs in England== Under the De heretico comburendo of 1401, heretics in England would be executed by burning at the stake. Many Protestants were later sentenced to \\"death by burning\\" in 16th-century England because of their faith. A number of them were ministers to small congregations, who were arrested and tried for heresy. Sometimes, they were given a special \\"Shirt of Flame\\" to wear under their clothes. Then, just before their execution, they were stripped to their underclothes, which would be this special shirt. Plaque in Maidstone, Kent, commemorating those burnt nearby When he was sentenced to death by burning, John Bradford was give a special shirt by a Mrs. Marlet, for whom he had previously written a devotional work. This was a clean shirt that was sewn specifically for the burning, made in the style of a wedding shirt. \\"This clothing with a new shirt to wear at the stake became a common feature at the burnings, a way of signaling support for and honouring the victim, as though he were being dressed as a bridegroom for a wedding.\\" Also, the ceremonial donning of the shirt of flame could be seen as similar to the priest donning his vestments, thus subverting Catholic ritual. \\"...and so the martyr might pray over and kiss the shirt before putting it on... underlining their oneness with Christ and the fact they were willing to die...\\" ==In popular culture== Oscar Wilde, in his letter \\"De Profundis,\\" written from prison, writes: \\"The martyr in his shirt of flame may be looking on the face of God, but to him who is piling the faggots or loosening the logs for the blast the whole scene is no more than the slaying of an ox is to the butcher, or the felling of a tree is to the charcoal burner in the forest, or the fall of a flower to one who is mowing down the grass with a scythe.\\" T. S. Eliot, after his conversion to Anglicanism, wrote in \\"Little Gidding\\" (one of his Four Quartets): \\"Love is the unfamiliar Name / Behind the hands that wove / The intolerable shirt of flame / Which human power cannot remove.\\" ==References== Mayor, Adrienne. 1997. \\"Firey Finery\\".

The Northern American Triangle refers to the Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The Northern Triangle of Central America three countries, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. These countries share a border tripoint at Trifinio biosphere reserve, and also aspects of classical cultures, history, society, and politics. Studies shows that the trend of unaccompanied migration from the Northern Triangle is strongly influenced by the poverty and violence of the sending countries. Given that these children are considered underage migrants, the manner in which the Department of Homeland Security and the United States in general receives them differs from that of adult migrants. ==Background== Section 462 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 defines an unaccompanied minor as a child who meets the following requirements: \\"(A) has no lawful immigration status in the United States; (B) has not attained 18 years of age; and (C) with respect to whom— (i) there is no parent or legal guardian in the United States; or (ii) no parent or legal guardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody.\\" Between 2009 and 2014, U.S Customs and Border Protection saw a rise in the number of unaccompanied minors from the Northern Triangle being apprehended at the border; among these minors there was a 77% increase in girls and 117% increase children ages twelve and under. The Northern Triangle refers to the countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, which since the late 20th century have undergone a series of crises and civil wars which the United States has intervened in. There has been a 120% increase in the number of children from Honduras, more than 100% increase in the number of children from El Salvador, and almost a 60% increase in the child migrants from Guatemala who have crossed or tried to cross the U.S. border since 2013. Individuals who research migration from countries in South America to the United States cite numerous push and pull factors varying from country to country. The surge in unaccompanied minors from the Northern Triangle is a result of violence, war, and poverty. Examples of this war and violence include the Guatemalan Genocide which resulted in 200,000 Maya individuals being killed or disappearing at the hands of the Guatemalan military after they were believed to support and hide guerrillas. In addition, many of the children flee gang recruitment which forces them to participate in wars against other gangs and police enforcement. The recruitment age for gangs is as low as 7 to 8 years old. Many children brought into gangs are torn away from their families or forced to partake in violent actions. There is also an increase in the migration of children from the Northern Triangle that correlates with the spike in homicide rates. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported that for every 100,000 people in Honduras, the homicide rate was 90.4. The homicide rate for El Salvador was 41.2 and Guatemala's was 39.9. Many children cite that this violence, in all of its forms is their primary reason for fleeing their home country. ==Immigration laws== Children entering the United States illegally under the age of 18 are considered to be minors and are subject to the policies instituted for children entering the United States alone, without permission. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 gave two options for the detention of the unaccompanied children. The first is directed by the Department of Homeland Security and their responsibilities lie in transferring the children back to their home country. The other option functions under the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and they place the children in the foster care system. In 2006, 85% of the unaccompanied children found and placed into the hands of either the Department of Homeland Security or the Office of Refugee Resettlement were from countries in the Northern Triangle, including Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. The process of the removal of unaccompanied minors in the United States is outlined in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Under the INA, children with a criminal record or dangerous to society (deemed by the Department of Homeland Security) are often subject of expedited removal. The children oftentimes face the process of the juvenile criminal justice system, rather than the civil procedure their crossing calls for. This includes their lack of legal representation in courts, with a frequent need for a translator that they do not often receive. Unaccompanied minor at a detention facility in South Texas. The Flores Settlement Agreement, enacted in 1997, attempted to bring regulations regarding the treatment of unaccompanied children in custody under the INA. Beforehand, they were often subject to maltreatment from authorities that detained them without any type of protection. The Flores Settlement Agreement required officials to allow the Department of Homeland Security to handle the detention of the minors and place them in the system of the ORR. This might include family members or sponsors, or other provisions that have a standard of care. There are four main types of U.S. immigration relief that unaccompanied children can receive. These four are asylum, Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, U visas and T visas. Asylum is an international protection granted to unaccompanied children who face and fear persecution of \\"race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership a particular social group.\\" A migrant child with Special Immigrant Juvenile Status is a minor who experienced abandonment, neglect, or abuse from a parent or both parents. Unaccompanied children who qualify for a U visa are victims of particular crimes and whose experiences have left a negative physical or mental mark. The child migrants granted a T visa are victims of trafficking of critical forms who can prove that if returned to their country, they would suffer tremendously. ==Relocation of the children== According to 2014 data, the most popular U.S regions that obtained unaccompanied children were Texas (7.4%), New York (5.8%), California (5.5%), and Florida (2.8%). All four of these regions contain shelter programs - Texas with 11, California with 5 and Florida with 2. Both Texas and Florida have a long-term foster care site and Texas has a transitional foster care program. In addition Florida also has a residential treatment center. In regards to the custody option that some unaccompanied children are given, there are complications surrounding who the children are given to. Many are incorrectly assumed adult status. Many of the child migrants identify themselves with the age of 19, in the hopes of not being placed in their home country's child services if they are sent back. While the older age might protect them from that transfer, in the United States it calls for a different process. Most of the unaccompanied children entering the United States do not have an ID to confirm their age. If correctly determined to be a minor, some children are given to family members in the United States or to sponsors. Other children are placed in foster care systems. ==Education of the children== In Plyer v. Doe, the U.S Supreme Court challenged Section 21.031 of the Texas Education Code which granted public schools in Texas the right to charge undocumented children tuition and even deny their admittance. It held that any child regardless of immigration status living within the United States' borders can enroll and attend K-12 public schools free of cost. This is limited to elementary, middle, and high school, and does not extend to higher education such as college. Plyer v. Doe is also only applicable to undocumented minors with either a guardian or a sponsor and excludes unaccompanied minors held by the Office of Refugee Resettlement. The Reno v. Flores landmark case was an attempt to better the conditions within ORR detainment centers. Between 2009 and 2010 the average stay of an unaccompanied minor was 61 days. That is 61 days without attending a public school and socializing with other individuals. In 2014, the Office of Refugee Resettlement declared that they are required to provide unaccompanied minors educational services in a classroom setting from Monday to Friday. In these classrooms within the detainment facility, children are taught the essentials of science, math, writing, physical education, and social studies by a licensed teacher fluent in both English and Spanish. Although they are encouraged to work with local schools to develop a curriculum and enhance the educational experience of unaccompanied minors, the ORR rarely does so. In the 2014 to 2015 school year, 50,000 unaccompanied minors were estimated to be attending public schools. Certain individuals do so while also having a full- time job. Schools in Oakland, California have also requested additional funding in order to provide unaccompanied minors with mental health and legal resources. ==Children in the workforce== Being both undocumented and underage, unaccompanied minors who enter the workforce find employment in the secondary sector; that is, blue-collar jobs. Jobs in this segment are characterized for being labor-intensive, having low-wages, unpleasant working conditions, inconsistent schedules, few benefits, limited upward mobility, and being tenuous in that one can be fired at any time without affecting the employer. This includes jobs in the garment industry, hotel, restaurant, agricultural, child caring, vendor, and landscaping industry. Unaccompanied minors from the Northern Triangle who enter this segment of the labor market are likely to face exploitation, yet they tolerate such conditions because many have families back in their sending countries that depend on their remittances. In 2012 the number of remittances immigrants sent to their respective sending countries amounted to $3.9 billion. In Los Angeles, unaccompanied minors from the Northern Triangle find employment in L.A's garment industry. This industry is characterized by its poor working conditions which include wages being withheld, lack of ventilation, and long work schedules that prohibit minors from attending school during the day. Stephanie Canizales, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern California, works with Guatemalan youth and reported that among the participants in her study the median weekly income was $350 for working 11 hours a day, 6 days a week. == Mental health of children == Unaccompanied minors migrating to the United States from the Northern Triangle are considered hidden populations, a term applied to certain populations within society for which there is few observable data.Cullins, Gabriel, Solages, Call, Mcknight, Concepcion, and Cho. \\"Pediatric Community Mental Health.\\" Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care 46.11 (2016): 354-88. Web. In the case of unaccompanied minors, there is scarce scientific data because their illegal status can discourage their sponsors from participating in studies,Roschelle, Greaney, Allan, and Porras. \\"Treacherous Crossings, Precarious Arrivals: Responses to the Influx of Unaccompanied Minors in the Hudson Valley.\\" Children and Youth Services Review (2018): Children and Youth Services Review. Web. and policies forbid researchers from interviewing unaccompanied children placed in shelters. In \\"Pediatric Community Mental Health\\", doctors Cullins, Gabriel, Solages, Call, McKnight, Concepcion, and Cho make the point that the mental health of unaccompanied minors can be categorized into three distinct phases. The first is that of their mental health pre-departure, which can be poorly affected by the fact that many unaccompanied minors either lack a parental figure (as they may be working in the United States in order to provide) or witnessed the death of one. The second stage occurs during their journey in which traveling alone poses dangerous implications such as kidnapping, extortion, violence at the hands of gangs, and having to fend for themselves. In particular, unaccompanied girls often report experiencing rape and sexual assault traveling through Mexico. The third stage takes place after their arrival when unaccompanied minors must acculturate to the United States without the guidance of an adult such as a parent or legal representative. This can be detrimental to their mental health and also may involve struggling with the fear of being deported and the challenges of not knowing English. Many unaccompanied migrant children endure traumatic events and violence in their home countries. The effects of those experiences take a toll on their mental health, shown in the higher rates of mental illnesses among refugee children. The anxiety and grief accumulated through those experiences, added with language barriers and difficulty in adapting to the new culture or environment, can make a child vulnerable and contribute to a poor mental state, causing a higher susceptibility to illnesses like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Drawn from a sample in a research study, the rates of PTSD among unaccompanied migrant minors from the Northern Triangle is 11.8%. Anxiety affected 54.4% of the children and 38.8% of the children showed symptoms of depression. Although the Office of Refugee Resettlement is required to perform mental health screenings, according to the previously mentioned doctors, the process in which they do so has been questioned. Previous research performed on unaccompanied children abroad shows that children cope with anxiety, post traumatic stress disorders, trouble sleeping and eating, and on rare occasions self-harming behavior. ==References== Category:Refugees in the United States Category:Child refugees Category:Northern Triangle refugee crisis ","title":"Reception of Unaccompanied Minors from the Northern Triangle"},{"id":"56882489","text":"Capo San Marco Lighthouse () is an active lighthouse located on Capo San Marco promontory, on the tip of Sinis peninsula overlooking the ruins below of Tharros.

The Centennial Arena was the city's main ice hockey facility from 1967 to 2010 and was a venue for the 1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. The arena has been the community's secondary indoor recreation facility since the opening of Stride Place in 2010 and since been renamed the BDO Centre. ==History1967-2010=== The Portage Centennial Arena was constructed in 1967 and was one of several projects across the country partially funded by the federal government as part of Canada's Centennial celebration. The same year, the Portage Terriers junior \\"A\\" hockey team was revived and became one of the arena's major tenants, along with the city's minor hockey teams. The city explored the idea of building a new sports complex to replace the Centennial Arena in the 1970s, however, this project was rejected by local residents. The city then expanded the Centennial Arena in 1980, adding a second indoor rink on the west side of the building. The east rink, with a maximum capacity of 1,350 and affectionately known by local hockey fans as the \\"Dog Pound\\", hosted seven Turnbull Cup (Manitoba Junior Hockey League championship) and five ANAVET Cup series in which the Terriers appeared between 1973 and 2009. The city was one of the several Manitoba communities that co-hosted the 1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships with Winnipeg. Russia and the United States both played matches at the Centennial Arena. The future of the Centennial Arena was uncertain after the city and joined together with the Rural Municipality of Portage la Prairie to build a new state-of-the-art recreational facility, the Portage Credit Union Centre (now Stride Place), which opened in 2010. A group of local residents petitioned Portage la Prairie city council not to decommission the old arena, citing the need for a third indoor rink to accommodate the community's minor hockey and other recreational programs. The city, not willing to provide further funding to the aging arena, agreed to transfer control of the Centennial Arena to the Centennial Community Club Inc.

It was later placed in either the genus Monorchis or the genus Androcorys, both now included in Herminium.

Its members are Stephanie Phillips (guitar and vocals), Estella Adeyeri (bass guitar and vocals), and Chardine Taylor-Stone (drums and vocals). ==History== Big Joanie was formed by Stephanie Phillips in 2013, who posted online asking for bandmates with whom to start a black feminist punk band after becoming frustrated with the lack of intersectionality in the scene. Chardine Taylor- Stone, and the band's original bassist Kiera Coward-Deyell responded. They played their first set at the inaugural First Timers, an event where all the bands had to be new, most of the members had to be playing a new instrument and they had to include someone from a marginalised group. The name of the band is partly a tribute to Phillips’ mother, Joan, and partly based on a Caribbean figure of speech. ‘When we say a child is “acting big”, they’re acting bigger than themselves. I just thought that would be a great phrase for a strong, confident woman.’ In 2014 the band released their first EP Sistah Punk on Tuff Enuff Records, and in 2016 they self released a 7\\" three song single entitled Crooked Room on their own Sistah Punk Records. The title track is inspired by a lecture by the writer Melissa Harris-Perry, who compared life as a black woman in a white patriarchy to trying to find a true vertical in a room where everything is crooked. Another song on the release is a punk cover of No Scrubs by TLC. Estella Adeyeri (also of Witching Waves) joined in 2017 to replace Coward-Deyell after she moved to Scotland. Later that year the band supported American bands Sad13 and Downtown Boys on UK tours. In early 2018 they recorded their debut album with producer Margo Broom at Hermitage Works Studios. Over the weekend of 2–4 June 2017, DIY Diaspora Punx (a collective started by Phillips and also containing other London musicians such as Rachel Aggs) put on the first Decolonise Fest at DIY Space For London. Decolonise Fest is the UK's first music festival created by and for people of colour. The second edition of the festival, again mostly held at DIY Space, occurred from 22 to 24 June 2018. The festival was held for a third time over 29 to 30 June 2019, at which Big Joanie performed. In March 2017 Stephanie Phillips contributed a chapter to 'Under My Thumb' – a book published by Repeater Books, edited by Rhian E. Jones and Eli Davies. Phillips' chapter praised/critiqued the work Phil Spector. The book was launched with a concert hosted by feminist punk promoter Loud Women on 9 March 2017 at The Fiddler's Elbow in London, where bands including Big Joanie and I, Doris played songs by politically-problematic male musicians. On 5 September 2018 Big Joanie announced their debut album Sistahs would be released in late November the same year with a music video for lead single \\"Fall Asleep\\". It is the first album to be released by Ecstatic Peace Library, a publishing company ran by visual book editor Eva Prinz and musician Thurston Moore, in their Daydream Library Series. Sistahs was released on 30 November to positive reviews, including in The Guardian, Rolling Stone, and The Quietus. In November 2018 they supported American band Parquet Courts on a UK and European tour. They played their first American shows in March 2019 at South by Southwest, debuting via BBC Music Introducing, and were announced in April as Bikini Kill's main support for their two European shows of the year at Brixton Academy in June. On 26th February 2020, Big Joanie supported Sleater-Kinney alongside Harkin at the Brixton Academy. Phillips cites Sleater-Kinney as having \\"really influenced the way I thought about writing emotional songs, and my approach to punk music\\". ==DiscographyAlbums=== *Sistahs – Ecstatic Peace Library, LP, MP3 (2018) ===EPs=== *Sistah Punk – Tuff Enuff Records, Cassette, MP3 (2014) *Crooked Room – Sistah Punk Records, 7\\", MP3 (2016) ===Singles=== *Cranes in the Sky / It's You – Third Man Records, 7\\" (2020) ==Further reading== *Gal Dem interview, 2016 ==ReferencesBig Joanie on Bandcamp Category:Underground punk scene in the United Kingdom Category:Musical groups established in 2013 Category:Musical groups from London Category:British musical trios Category:Black British musical groups Category:All-female bands ","title":"Big Joanie"},{"id":"56882994","text":"Savely Alekseyevich Kozlov (; born 19 January 1997) is a Russian football player.

Production started in 2016 with the majority of financing coming in the way of a large crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. The game was originally marked for an estimated December 2017 release, but was not met. The game is on an indefinite hiatus. Soulbound Studios closed its doors and laid off its staff on March 25, 2020. == Development Kickstarter campaign== Chronicles of Elyria had a Kickstarter campaign from May 3 to June 3, 2016 raising $1.36 million, surpassing their goal of $900.000. However, developing an massively multiplayer online role-playing game of the quality Soulbound Studios was aiming for requires more than that and so the company continued crowdfunding on their website and raised over $7.7 million as of October 2019. Pre- production ended in November 2016 at which time active production began. ===Indefinite hiatus=== After being delayed from its tentative December 2019 date, a special virtual land auction event called \\"Settlers of Elyria\\" was launched on March 12, 2020. On March 20, Soulbound Studios released a pre- alpha, gray box demo showcasing parkour mechanics. Four days later, Soulbound Studios announced the closure of the studio, complete staff layoffs and the indefinite hiatus of the project. In response to the perceived lack of delivery of a tangible product after years of development and millions of dollars in funding, as well as the close succession of the land auction, demo and abrupt studio closure, hundreds of backers of Chronicles of Elyria began to organize and explore legal avenues to take against Soulbound Studios and Jeromy Walsh. Within days, the office of the attorney general of Washington had received hundreds of filed complaints - amidst the highest in the state's history. On April 9, Walsh released a new statement, claiming that his announcement was misinterpreted and that he would be pursuing continuing the project by having former staff members continue their work on a pro bono basis, while he would seek new sources of funding. == References  * Official website Category:Cancelled Windows games Category:Crowdfunded video games Category:Fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:Kickstarter-funded video games Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Parkour video games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games using procedural generation Category:Virtual economies Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Chronicles of Elyria"},{"id":"56883034","text":"Donna Scott is a Canadian business person best known as the founder of the fashion magazine Flare Magazine.

In 1940, the investigative branch was excluded from the Blue Police and converted into the Polish Criminal Police (Polnische Kriminalpolizei) connected and directly supervised by the German criminal police Kripo.Marek Mączyński, Organizacyjno-prawne aspekty funkcjonowania administracji bezpieczeństwa i porządku publicznego dla zajętych obszarów polskich 1939-1945, Kraków 2012, s. 304-305.

The Polish criminal police team was trained at the Security Police School (Sicherheitspolizei) and the Security Service of the Reichsführer SS (SD) in Rabka-Zdrój. It's estimated that there were between 1,790 to 2,800 ethnic Poles in the Polish Kripo units. The organization of the Polish Criminal Police was analogous to the organization of the German “Kriminalpolizei\\" and consisted of various police stations. Station 1 dealt with robberies, assaults, murders and sabotage; station 2 - with small thefts; station 3 - with burglary and house thieves; station 4 - moral crimes; station 5 - with internal service, search of Jews in hiding and other wanted persons; station 6 - with registration of wanted persons, station 7 - with forensic technique, and photographic laboratory.Marek Mączyński, Organizacyjno-prawne aspekty funkcjonowania administracji bezpieczeństwa in porządku publicznego dla zajętych obszarów polskich w latach 1939-1945, Kraków, s.305 == See also == *Blue Police == References == Category:Polish collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:Collaboration during World War II Category:Poland in World War II Category:Holocaust perpetrators in Poland ","title":"Polish Criminal Police"},{"id":"56883215","text":"Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President is a 2018 children's book by Charlotte Pence as author and Karen Pence as illustrator. It details a fictional day in the life of Marlon Bundo, pet rabbit of Vice President of the United States Mike Pence, father of Charlotte and husband of Karen. It received lukewarm reviews from professional critics, who praised the illustrations but found fault with the prose. ==Concept== The book is an educational story explaining to children what the job of Vice President of the United States entails as seen through the eyes of the Pence family pet rabbit Marlon Bundo. The book was announced on the Instagram account dedicated to Marlon Bundo on September 15, 2017. Second Lady Karen Pence, a former teacher and a watercolor artist, painted the book's illustrations over a period of about four months. The book was released on March 19, 2018, by the children's arm of Regnery Publishing, a conservative book publisher. A book tour stopped at military bases, the Nixon and Reagan presidential libraries, and the conservative nonprofit organization Focus on the Family. Proceeds from the book's sales were to be donated to Tracy's Kids – an art therapy program Karen Pence brought to the Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis – and The A21 Campaign, a nonprofit organization working to end human trafficking. Two of Karen Pence's original watercolors for the book illustrations were also auctioned to raise money for Tracy's Kids. ===The rabbit=== Marlon Bundo, the Pence family's pet rabbit Charlotte Pence acquired the rabbit that became the book's lead character when she was a film school student at Chicago's DePaul University in 2013. The rabbit was later named Marlon Bundo after the seller asked Pence to make an offer on the rabbit. This was taken as a reference to Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone saying \\"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\\" in the 1972 film The Godfather. Pence featured the rabbit in a short film project and then kept him as a family pet. He is said to be well-behaved and is the first rabbit to have flown on Air Force Two, when the Pences moved to Washington, D.C. The Pences planned to take Marlon Bundo on the book's press tour. ==Plot== The story details the experiences of Marlon Bundo, the Pence family pet rabbit and BOTUS (Bunny of the United States), as he follows Grampa (vice president Mike Pence) around for a day. Included are visits to the Oval Office, the Senate, the vice president's office, and the telescope at their home at the Naval Observatory. At the end of the day, Marlon joins the vice president in reading the Bible and praying before bed. ==ReceptionCommercial performance=== One week after the book's launch date, Regnery Publishing reported that Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President was in its third printing, totaling more than 100,000 copies. Publisher's Weekly estimated the book had sold 26,000 copies as of May 11, 2018. ===Critical reception=== On its launch date, a number of one-star reviews with negative comments were left on the book's Amazon page by non- buyers who favored the parody book, A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo. Later that day, it was no longer possible to review the Pences' book without purchasing it and one-star ratings from non-buyers had been removed. Kirkus Reviews called the book's illustrations \\"competent\\", the author's verse \\"execrable\\" and the publication as a whole \\"[a]nodyne at best\\", noting the absence of 'people of color' throughout the book and giving it a \\"skip it\\" rating. Similarly, Susie Wilde of The News & Observer praised the illustrations and criticized the writing, \\"Pence shows her skill at realistic watercolors and captures the cuteness factor of the real BOTUS.... The book fails when it comes to the text, though.\\" Esquire mentioned the strained verse as well and called the book mediocre. Katy Waldman in The New Yorker also criticized the book's verse as \\"mostly embarrassing.\\" ===Parody=== Charlotte Pence's book and Mike Pence's staunch opposition to same-sex marriage inspired Last Week Tonight with John Oliver writer Jill Twiss to author A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo. The story details the same-sex romance of rabbits Marlon Bundo and Wesley, who face opposition from a stink bug who is against same-sex marriage. A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo is billed as an actual children's story about marriage equality and democracy, rather than as a straight-up parody of Charlotte Pence's book, yet it includes some \\"definite digs\\" at the vice president. Charlotte Pence supported A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo, posting on Twitter a picture of herself and the real-life Marlon Bundo wearing a bow tie identical to the one in Jill Twiss' book, and saying on Mornings with Maria: \\"His book is contributing to charities that I think we can all get behind... I'm all for it.\\" The official Marlon Bundo Instagram account also referred to Twiss' book in a positive light, stating \\"Not gonna lie, I do look pretty fly in a bow tie. The only thing better than one bunny book for charity is...TWO bunny books for charity.\\" The Twiss book's profits were also given to charities, namely The Trevor Project and AIDS United. Conversely, Regnery Publishing initially criticized the release of A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo, saying that it was \\"unfortunate that anyone would feel the need to ridicule an educational children's book and turn it into something controversial and partisan.\\" When the success of both books became apparent, Regnery complimented John Oliver and Chronicle Books for their sales figures, adding: \\"There's plenty to go around for everyone and, like Charlotte [Pence] said, we can all be happy the proceeds are going to a good cause.\\" ==References Category:2018 children's books Category:American children's books Category:Books about American politicians Category:Mike Pence Category:Rabbits and hares in popular culture Category:Regnery Publishing books Category:White House in fiction Category:American picture books ","title":"Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President"},{"id":"56883219","text":"The 2007 Humboldt State Lumberjacks football team represented Humboldt State University during the 2007 NCAA Division II football season.

Its purpose is to create a soothing, pleasant environment through the use of imagery. A typical video might include footage of waves rolling over the beach accompanied by soft ambient music. Some additional examples might include movement of water, sunrise or sunset, or slow movement such as that of a jellyfish. Ambient video can be the subject of focus or alternatively run unobtrusively in the background. == Uses == Because of its ability to transform spaces, ambient video is often used for meditation or relaxation. In addition to providing visual focus, ambient video can figuratively transport viewers to new locations and, although is often accompanied by, is not dependent on music. Although ambient video often serves as background art, its visual nature allows it to also be used: * as a meditation tool * to explore new locations * as an aid for concentration or productivity * to create atmosphere at home or in public places * as a calming backdrop homes or public places (such as airports, hotels, hospitals, restaurants, shopping venues and so forth) == History of ambient video == Ambient video is a new art form made possible by the increasing availability of large-scale, high-definition video display units. Introduced in the late 1990s, the first flat wide-screen televisions were expensive, costing as much as $15,000 in 1997. As costs rapidly declined, by 2008 larger screens became affordable and available for average consumers, increasing the demand for new content. In addition, the number of televisions per household increased.

Applications have been developed in a variety of domains, such as education, architectural and urban design, digital marketing and activism, engineering and robotics, entertainment, fine arts, healthcare and clinical therapies, heritage and archaeology, occupational safety, social science and psychology. == Architecture and urban design == One of the first recorded uses of virtual reality in architecture was in the late 1990s when the University of North Carolina virtually modelled Sitterman Hall, home of its computer science department. Designers wore a headset and used a hand controller to simulate moving around a virtual space. With an Autodesk Revit model they could \\"walk through\\" a schematic. VR enables architects to better understand the details of a project such as the transition of materials, sightlines, or visually displays of wall stress, wind loads, solar heat gain, or other engineering factors. By 2010, VR programs had been developed for urban regeneration, planning and transportation projects.Roudavski, S. (2010). Virtual Environments as Techno-Social Performances: Virtual West Cambridge Case-Study, in CAADRIA2010: New Frontiers, the 15th International Conference on Computer Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia, ed. by Bharat Dave, Andrew I-kang Li, Ning Gu and Hyoung-June Park, pp. 477-486 Entire cities were simulated in VR. == Restorative nature experiences == An example of a nature- oriented virtual environment made with real-time rendering engine Unity. Studies on exposure to nature environments shows how it is able to produce relaxation, recover attention capacity and cognitive function, reduce stress and stimulate positive mood. Immersive virtual reality technology is able to replicate believable restorative nature experiences, either using 360 degree video footage or environments created from 3D real-time rendering often developed using game engines (for example Unreal Engine or Unity) This is useful for users who are deprived from accessing certain areas, due to e.g. physical restraints or complications, such as senior citizens or nursing home residents. Restorative virtual environments are able replicate and mediate real world experiences using video footage, replicate these using 3D rendering or can be based loosely on real world environment using real-time 3D rendering . == Healthcare == Immersive VR environment, used to motivate senior citizens to exercise regularly, by driving along the path and exploring the nature surroundings VR began to appear in rehabilitation in the 2000s. For Parkinson's disease, evidence of its benefits compared to other rehabilitation methods is lacking. A 2018 review on the effectiveness of VR mirror therapy and robotics found no benefit. Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is a form of exposure therapy for treating anxiety disorders such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and phobias. Studies have indicated that combining VRET with behavioral therapy, patients experience a reduction of symptoms. In some cases, patients no longer met the DSM-V criteria for PTSD. Immersive VR can motivate exercise with challenged sedentary users, such as for rehabilitation centers or senior citizen homes, increasing quality of life and independence through increased physical activity (see right image). Immersive VR has also been shown useful for acute pain management, on the theory that it may distract people, reducing their experience of pain. Some companies and researchers are adapting VR for fitness, either motivating physical therapy or exercise, e.g. by contextualizing e.g. biking through VR-based experiences (see right image) , or by using gamification concepts to encourage exercise. == Digital marketing == Virtual reality presents an opportunity and an alternative channel for digital marketing. International Data Corporation expected spending to increase for augmented and virtual reality, forecasting a compound annual growth rate of 198% in 2015–2020. Revenues were expected to rise to $143.3 billion in 2020. Global spending on digital advertisements was forecast to increase to $335.5 billion by 2020. A 2015 study found that 75% of companies on Forbes' World's Most Valuable Brands list had developed a VR or AR experience. Although VR is not widespread among consumers compared to other forms of digital media, many companies have invested in VR. Some companies adopted VR to enhance workplace collaboration. VR can present high definition, three-dimensional interactive imaging. Its marketing benefits were observed by Suh and Lee through via laboratory experiments: with a VR interface, participants' product knowledge and product attitude noticeably increased. VR marketing can engage consumers' emotions. Both studies indicate an increased desire to purchase products marketed through VR; however, these benefits showed minimal return on investment (ROI). Suh and Lee found that products that are primarily experienced through hearing and vision (but not others) benefit more from VR marketing. Ads that appear during a VR experience (interruption marketing) may be considered invasive. Consumers want to decide whether to accept an ad. Organizations can for example require the user to download a mobile app before experiencing their VR campaign. Non-profit organizations have used VR to bring potential supporters closer to distant social, political and environmental issues in immersive ways not possible with traditional media. Panoramic views of the conflict in Syria and face-to-face encounters with CGI tigers in Nepal are some examples. Retailers use VR to show how a product will fit in consumers' homes. Consumers looking at digital photos of the products can virtually spin the product to view it from the side or back. Architectural design firms allow clients to tour virtual models of proposed buildings. Architects can use VR to experience their developing designs. VR models can replace scale models. Developers and owners can create VR models of existing structures. == Education and training == VR is used to help learners develop skills without the real-world consequences of failing, especially useful in realms with life-or-death implications. The specific device used to provide the VR experience, whether it be through a mobile phone or desktop computer, does not appear to impact on any educational benefit. === Flight and vehicular applications === Flight simulators are a form of VR training. They can range from a fully enclosed module to computer monitors providing the pilot's point of view. Driving simulations can train tank drivers on the basics before allowing them to operate the real vehicle. Similar principles are applied in truck driving simulators for specialized vehicles such as fire trucks. As these drivers often have limited opportunity for real-world experience, VR training provides additional training time. === Medicine === VR technology has many useful applications in the medical field. Through VR, novice surgeons have the ability to practice complex surgeries without stepping into the operating room. Physicians who experience VR simulations improved their dexterity and performance in the operating room significantly more than control groups.Larsen, C.R., Oestergaard, J., Ottesen, B.S., and Soerensen, J.L. The efficacy of virtual reality simulation training in laparoscopy: a systematic review of randomized trials. Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand. 2012; 91: 1015–1028 VR can produce a three dimensional representation of a particular patient's anatomy that allows surgeons to map out the surgery ahead of time. === Military === 2nd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment walk through a scenario during a Future Immersive Training Environment (FITE) joint capability technology demonstration at Camp Lejeune in 2010.alt= In 1982 Thomas A. Furness III presented the United States Air Force with a working model of his virtual flight simulator, the Visually Coupled Airborne Systems Simulator (VCASS). The second phase of his project, which he called the \\"Super Cockpit\\", added high-resolution (for the time) graphics and a responsive display. The United Kingdom has been using VR in military training since the 1980s. The United States military announced the Dismounted Soldier Training System in 2012. It was cited as the first fully immersive military VR training system. Virtual training environments have been claimed to increase realism while minimizing cost,Shufelt, Jr., J.W. (2006) A Vision for Future Virtual Training. In Virtual Media for Military Applications (pp. KN2-1 – KN2-12). Meeting Proceedings RTO-MP-HFM-136, Keynote 2. Neuilly-sur-Seine, France: RTO. Available from: http://www.rto.nato.int/abstracts.asp e.g., by saving ammunition. In 2016, researchers at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory reported that instructor feedback is necessary for virtual training. Virtual training has been used for combined arms training and instructing soldiers to learn when to shoot. Military programs such as Battle Command Knowledge Systems (BCKS) and Advanced Soldier Sensor Information and Technology (ASSIST) were intended to assist the development of virtual technology. Described goals of the ASSIST initiative were to develop software and wearable sensors for soldiers to improve battlefield awareness and data collection.Technology evaluations and performance metrics for soldier-worn sensors for assist BA Weiss, C Schlenoff, M Shneier, A Virts - Performance Metrics for Intelligent Systems Workshop, 2006 Researchers stated that these programs would allow the soldier to update their virtual environment as conditions change. Virtual Battlespace 3 (VBS3, successor to the earlier versions named VBS1 and VBS2) is a widely used military training solution adapted from a commercial off the shelf product. Live, Virtual, Constructive – Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) is a U.S. military technology that allows for multiple training systems to work together to create an integrated training environment. Reported primary uses of the LVC-IA were live training, virtual training, and constructive training. In 2014, the LVC-IA version 1.3 included VBS3. === Space === NASA has used VR technology for decades. Most notable is their use of immersive VR to train astronauts before flights. VR simulations include exposure to zero- gravity work environments, training on how to spacewalk and tool usage using low cost tool mock-ups. == Engineering and robotics == In the mid-to-late 1990s 3D computer-aided design (CAD) data took over when video projectors, 3D tracking and computer technology enabled its use in virtual reality environments. Active shutter glasses and multi-surface projection units appeared. Virtual reality has been used in automotive, aerospace, and ground transportation original equipment manufacturers. Virtual reality aids prototyping, assembly, service and performance use-cases. This enables engineers from different disciplines to experience their design. Engineers can view the bridge, building or other structure from any angle. Simulations allow engineers to test their structure's resistance to winds, weight, and other elements. Virtual reality can control robots in telepresence and telerobotic systems.Rosenberg, Louis (1992). \\"The Use of Virtual Fixtures As Perceptual Overlays to Enhance Operator Performance in Remote Environments.\\" Technical Report AL-TR-0089, USAF Armstrong Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, 1992.Rosenberg, L., \\"Virtual fixtures as tools to enhance operator performance in telepresence environments,\\" SPIE Manipulator Technology, 1993. VR has been used in experiments that investigate how robots can be applied as an intuitive human user interface. Another example is remotely-controlled robots in dangerous environments. == Entertainment  Video games === A man plays a virtual reality video game at Tokyo Game Show 2018 Early commercial virtual reality headsets were released for gaming during the early-mid 1990s. These included the Virtual Boy, iGlasses, Cybermaxx and VFX1 Headgear. Since 2010, commercial headsets for VR gaming include the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR. The Samsung Gear VR is an example of a phone-based device. Other modern examples of VR for gaming include the Wii Remote, the Kinect, and the PlayStation Move/PlayStation Eye, all of which track and send player motions to the game. Many devices complement VR with controllers or haptic feedback. VR-specific and VR versions of popular video games have been released. === Cinema === Films produced for VR permit the audience to view scenes in 360 degrees. This can involve the use of VR cameras to produce interactive films and series. Pornography makers use VR, usually for POV-style porn. The 2016 World Chess Championship match between Magnus Carlsen and Sergey Karjakin was promoted as \\"the first in any sport to be broadcast in 360-degree virtual reality.\\"Virtual reality to be added to World Champs Viewing Experience (Chess.com) However, a VR telecast featuring Oklahoma hosting Ohio State, preceded it on September 17, 2016. The telecasts (which used roughly 180 degrees of rotation, not the 360 required for full VR) were made available through paid smartphone apps and head-mounted displays. === Music === VR can allow individuals to virtually attend concerts. VR concerts can be enhanced using feedback from the user's heartbeat and brainwaves. Virtual reality can be used for other forms of music, such as music videos and music visualization or visual music applications. === Family entertainment centers === In 2015 roller coasters and theme parks began to incorporate VR to match visual effects with haptic feedback. The Void is a theme park in Pleasant Grove, Utah that offers VR attractions that stimulate multiple senses. In March 2018, a VR water slide was launched using a waterproof headset. == Fine arts == \\"World Skin, A Photo Safari in the Land of War\\" - alt= David Em was the first fine artist to create navigable virtual worlds, in the 1970s. His early work was done on mainframes at Information International, Inc., Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and California Institute of Technology. Jeffrey Shaw with Legible City in 1988 and Matt Mullican with Five into One in 1991, were among the first to exhibit elaborate VR artworks. Virtopia was the first VR artwork to premiere at a film festival. Created by artist/researcher Jacquelyn Ford Morie with researcher Mike Goslin, it debuted at the 1992 Florida Film Festival. A more developed version of the project appeared at the 1993 Florida Film Festival.Goslin, M and Morie, J F (1996) Virtopia: Emotional Experiences in Virtual Environments with Mike Goslin. Leonardo Journal, Vol 29, no. 2, 1996. MIT Press.Reichhardt, Tony (1994) Virtual Worlds without End. American Way Magazine, 27 (22). November 1994 Other artists to explore the early artistic potential of VR through the 1990s include Jeffrey Shaw, Ulrike Gabriel, Char Davies, Maurice Benayoun, Knowbotic Research, Rebecca Allen and Perry Hoberman. The first Canadian virtual reality film festival was the FIVARS Festival of International Virtual & Augmented Reality Stories, founded in 2015 by Keram Malicki-Sánchez. In 2016, the first Polish VR program, The Abakanowicz Art Room was realized – it documented the art office of Magdalena Abakanowicz, made by Jarosław Pijarowski and Paweł Komorowski. Some museums have begun making some of their content virtual reality accessible including the British Museum and the Guggenheim. == Heritage and archaeology == Virtual reality enables heritage sites to be recreated.Pimentel, K., & Teixeira, K. (1993). Virtual reality. New York: McGraw-Hill. The sites may be have restricted or no access for the public,Pletinckx, D.; Callebaut, D.; Killebrew, A.E.; Silberman, N.A. (2000). \\"Virtual-reality heritage presentation at Ename\\", \\"On-site VR\\" paragraph, in MultiMedia, IEEE, vol.7, no.2, pp.45-48 such as caves, damaged/destroyed structures, or sensitive environments that are closed to allow them to recover from overuse.\\"Architecture's Virtual Shake-Up\\" Tayfun King, Click, BBC World News (2005-10-28) The first use of VR in a heritage application was in 1994 when a museum visitor interpretation provided an interactive \\"walk-through\\" of a 3D reconstruction of Dudley Castle in England as it was in 1550. This consisted of a computer controlled laserdisc-based system designed by engineer Colin Johnson. The system was featured in a conference held by the British Museum in November 1994.Higgins, T., Main, P. & Lang, J. (1996). \\"Imaging the Past: Electronic Imaging and Computer Graphics in Museums and Archaeology\\", Volume 114 of Occasional paper, London: British Museum. . == Occupational safety == VR simulates real workplaces for occupational safety and health (OSH) purposes. Within work scenarios, for example, some parts of a machine move of their own accord while others can be moved by human operators. Perspective, angle of view, and acoustic and haptic properties change according to where the operator is standing and how he or she moves relative to the environment. VR can be used for OSH purposes to: * Review and improve the usability of products and processes during design and development. * Safely test potentially hazardous products, processes and safety concepts. * Identify cause-effect relationships following accidents on and involving products. This saves material, personnel, time and financial outlay associated with in-situ testing. == Social science and psychology == Virtual reality offers social scientists and psychologists a cost-effective tool to study and replicate interactions in a controlled environment. It allows an individual to embody an avatar. \\"Embodying\\" another being presents a different experience from simply imagining that you are someone else. Researchers have used immersion to investigate how digital stimuli can alter human perception, emotion and physiological states, and how can change social interactions, in addition to studying how digital interaction can enact social change in the physical world. === Altering perception, emotion and physiological states === Studies have considered how the form we take in virtual reality can affect our perception and actions. One study suggested that embodying the body of a child can cause objects to be perceived as much larger otherwise. Another study found that white individuals who embodied the form of a dark-skinned avatar performed a drumming task with a more varied style than otherwise. Research exploring perception, emotions and physiological responses within VR suggest that virtual environments can alter how a person responds to stimuli. For example, a virtual park coupled affects subjects' anxiety levels. Similarly, simulated driving through dark areas in a virtual tunnel can induce fear. Social interaction with virtual characters has been shown to produce physiological responses such as changes in heart rate and galvanic skin responses. Research suggests that a strong presence can facilitate an emotional response, and this emotional response can further increase the feeling of presence. Similarly, breaks in the presence (or a loss in the sense of presence) can cause physiological changes. === Understanding biases and stereotypes === Researchers have utilized embodied VR perspective-taking to evaluate whether changing a person's self-representation may help in reducing bias against particular social groups. However, the nature of any relationship between embodiment and bias is not yet defined. Individuals who embodied old people demonstrated a significant reduction in negative stereotyping when compared with individuals embodying young people. Similarly, light-skinned individuals placed in dark-bodied avatars showed a reduction in their implicit racial bias. However, other research has shown individuals taking the form of a black avatar had higher levels of implicit racial bias favoring whites after leaving the virtual environment. === Investigating basal mental abilities like Spatial Cognition === One of the most general abilities in order to perform in everyday life is Spatial Cognition, which involves orientation, navigation etc. Especially in the field of its investigation, Virtual Reality became an invaluable tool, since it allows to test the performance of subjects in an environment which is highly-immersive and controllable at the same time. Furthermore, the newest head-mounted displays allow also the implementation of eye-tracking, which provides precious insight in cognitive processes, for example in terms of attention. == Obstacles == , motion sickness is still a major issue for virtual reality. The delay between a motion and the updating of the screen image is the source. Users often report discomfort. One study reported that all 12 participants complained of at least two side effects while three had to withdraw from severe nausea and dizziness. Virtual reality users remove themselves from the physical environment. This creates a risk that the user will experience a mishap while moving. Immersion in a virtual world has the potential for social exclusion that may decrease positive mood and increase anger. Behavior in virtual reality may have lasting psychological impact when returning to the physical world. Russian news agency, TASS, reported in 2017, a death from VR use, when a 44-year old man \\"tripped and crashed into a glass table, suffered wounds and died on the spot from a loss of blood\\". It is thought to be the first death from VR use. == References == Virtual reality Category:Virtual reality ","title":"Virtual reality applications"},{"id":"56883408","text":"The 1994 Humboldt State Lumberjacks football team represented Humboldt State University during the 1994 NCAA Division II football season.

Campbell was born in Lewes, East Sussex, England, the daughter of progressive rock musician Dirk Campbell. She was educated at the independent St Mary's Hall, Brighton, then went to study at University of Sheffield before moving to Bristol, where she worked as a plumber. Campbell was involved with many political movements, including the 2010 United Kingdom student protests, the Hunt Saboteurs Association, Anarchist Black Cross and other anarchist and abolitionist organisations. Campbell fought with the YPJ in their attack on the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant stronghold in Deir ez-Zor. She was also involved in the YPJ's activities in support of women's rights in Kurdistan. According to The New York Times, she was moved by the defence of \\"an autonomous, mostly Kurdish region in northern Syria, known as Rojava, whose leaders advocate a secular, democratic and egalitarian politics, with equal rights for women\\".

Found in 1951, the institute regularly publishes books, a journal, and hosts lectures annually lectures. The institute founded the \\"International Relations\\" journal (later acquired by SAGE Publications), to which the DDMI regularly contributes. ==History== The DDMI was established in 1951 to commemorate the legacy of Lord David Davies, 1st Baron Davies and his mission to promote a more orderly and just world through international cooperation, organization, and law. In 2001, the institute relocated from London to the department of International Politics at Aberystwyth University. The DDMI's research has evolved from efforts to understand important questions of disarmament and international organization to concentrations on security agendas, questions of global responsibility, and the status of the 'individual' in a world system of states. ==Research== The institute has on-going research projects led by its members. === Alliances and Trust Building in International Politics === The Alliances and Trust Building project explores the question of trust in international politics. The project seeks to answer the following question: \\"How, and under what conditions, do alliances lead to the establishment of trusting relationships between states?\\" The project is a collaborative effort of the institute and other international relations professionals that focus on bilateral relationships within the NATO alliance. The project is funded by the British Academy and the Gwendoline and Margaret Davies Charity. Key publications: * Booth, Ken and Nicholas J.

The project questions whether the human race has the capacity to control both non-violent and violent harm in politics. The volumes analyse the theoretical issues underlining the study of harm in international politics. The volumes consider the ways in which the Western international system has regulated harm, and the rise of cosmopolitan harm conventions. The research also explores the growth of human interconnectedness and emotional identification ranging from family ties to those of expansive nation-states.

The admission of transgender students to women's colleges in the United States has been a subject of debate. Some colleges have changed their policy in favor of admitting transgender students, but there is little uniformity in definitional details. ==Policy changesSmith College=== In 2013, high school senior, Calliope Wong, was denied acceptance to Smith College, one of the largest women's colleges in the United States, because she identified as a transgender woman. Wong marked her biological gender identity as male on her FAFSA, despite her self-identification as a woman. Subsequently, Smith deemed Wong inadmissible to the women's college and denied her application. Smith students, led by a trans-activist organization, Q&A;, protested against the decision and began a Change.org petition encouraging Smith to revise their admissions policy to include trans women. Although Smith was not the first women's college to amend their admissions policy, Wong's story catalyzed a nation-wide reconsideration of admissions policies at women's institutions. Smith College amended their policy to include admission of trans women in May 2015. ===Others=== Mills College, located in Oakland, California, was the first women's higher education institution to formally publish an inclusive policy accepting transgender women in 2014. Since then, a total of 11 of the 39 Women's College Coalition (WCC) member institutions have revised their admissions policies to admit transgender women according to NBC News. The schools are as follows: Mills College, Mount Holyoke College, Simmons College, Scripps College, Bryn Mawr College, Wellesley College, Smith College, Hollins University, Barnard College, Bennett College and most recently Spelman College. Yet, the policies at each institution vary and lack uniformity. ==Different policies at women’s colleges across the country== Spelman College, the most recent women's institution to revise its admissions policy, determined the institution “will consider for admission women students, including students who consistently live and self-identify as women, regardless of their gender assignment at birth.” President of Spelman College, Mary S. Campbell, announced the revised admissions and enrollment policy in September 2017. The policy goes on to state that Spelman does not admit male students, regardless of their gender at birth; but, if a woman is admitted and decides to transition to male during their tenure at the college, they will be permitted to continue their studies and graduate from Spelman. Spelman College is one of only two Historically Black Women's Colleges in the nation. Bennett College, located in Greensboro, North Carolina, is the only other Historically Black Women's College in the nation and adopted a similar policy in January 2017. Although Spelman College and other women's institutions across the country do not accept trans men, Mills College, the first women's institution to adopt “a formal admissions policy regarding transgender and transitioning,” does accept trans men. Yet, Hollins University, located in Hollins, Virginia, does not accept trans men nor allow for those who transition from female to male during their matriculation at Hollins to continue their studies or graduate. Additionally, Hollins accepts trans women, but clarifies the stipulations regarding their admission in the following, “trans women will be considered for admissions if they have completed physical sexual reassignment surgery and legal transformation from male to female.” Ultimately, the differences between the policies are determined by the individual institution's definition of womanhood and their varying degrees of inclusivity and/or exclusivity extended to the transgender community. ==Challenges against evolving transgender admissions policies== Although the exact number of trans women attending women's colleges nationwide is unknown, responses to the revised admissions policies have garnered mixed reactions over the past four years. Mills College, the first women's college to welcome trans students, reports approximately 8% of over 700 undergraduate students identify as transgender. Despite the low visibility of trans women at women's colleges, these institutions continue to face backlash and criticism, specifically from alumnae, who often believe the policies disregard and veer away from the core mission and purpose of women's colleges. Although majority of alumnae, current students and the institutions themselves agree women's colleges were created to educate and empower women, the discrepancies in defining and labeling womanhood fuel the differences in opinions and the revised policies themselves. Furthermore, with the introduction and adoption of trans-inclusive admissions policies on these campuses, additional challenges include the day-to-day implementation of the policy, such as adequately providing academic and residential resources for trans students while ensuring a welcoming and inclusive collegiate environment. Trans students even face the possibility of potential physical harassment and other forms of discrimination on traditional college campuses. == References == Category:Trans women Category:Women's education in the United States ","title":"Transgender admissions policies at women's colleges"},{"id":"56884079","text":"Pascale Casanova is a French Paralympic Gold medallist.

It occurred early in the morning of 29 June 1170. It formed part of a sequence of large earthquakes that propagated southwards along the Dead Sea Transform, starting with the 1138 Aleppo earthquake, continuing with the 1157 Hama, 1170 and 1202 Syria events. The estimated magnitude is 7.7 on the moment magnitude scale, with the maximum intensity of X (extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. ==Tectonic setting== Western Syria lies across the boundary between the African Plate and the Arabian Plate, which consists of the various segments of the Dead Sea Transform. The main strand passing through the Lebanon restraining bend is the Yammouneh Fault, which was responsible for the 1202 earthquake. To the north of this is the Missyaf Fault (or Ghab Fault), which continues up to the Ghab Basin. One earlier earthquake has been identified on this fault segment, the 115 Antioch earthquake. The Missyaf Fault is considered the most likely structure responsible for the 1170 event. The lack of any later major earthquakes on this segment suggests that one is now overdue. ==Earthquake== Due to the size of the area affected and the damage it caused, this earthquake is recorded in many contemporary accounts and appears in many more recent catalogues. There has been some confusion over the date, but there is a consensus now that it occurred on 29 June 1170. There is some uncertainty over the location of the epicentre and even whether it was two shocks or just one. The most likely location is on the Missraf segment of the Dead Sea Transform and the single earthquake appears most consistent with contemporary accounts. This implies a large area with high intensity of shaking and this has been used to suggest that the rupture was about 126 km long, involving more than just the Missraf segment, and that the magnitude was about 7.7 . Several foreshocks were reported and the aftershocks sequence lasted for three months. ==Damage== Severe damage was widespread from Antioch in the north to Tripoli and Baalbek in the south. Several places that had been badly damaged by the 1157 Hama earthquake, suffered again, such as Hama, Aleppo and Antioch. The fortress of Krak des Chevaliers (Hisn al‐Akrad) was badly damaged by the earthquake. Although the extent of the damage is unclear (one source says that no traces of the walls were left), the castle underwent major rebuilding in subsequent years. ==References== Category:Earthquakes in the Levant Category:12th-century earthquakes Category:12th century in the Seljuk Empire Category:12th century in the Kingdom of Jerusalem Category:Earthquakes in Syria ","title":"1170 Syria earthquake"},{"id":"56884118","text":"Jórunn Viggósdóttir (born 31 December 1957) is an Icelandic alpine skier.

He was born in Odessa, USSR (Ukraine in nowadays). Matusevitch started his painting career at school, where he was the class painter. ==Wartime== In 1941, Matusevitch and his brothers went for a summer vacation in the country with their grandparents. After two weeks, war broke out and it was impossible to return to his parents in Odessa, resulting in a long separation from their parents. The war period was hard. Matusevitch fled from the Nazis, making his way on foot and later by train, often exposed to bombing attacks. He passed cities in flames, suffered hunger and was wounded in the leg. In the end, the group reached Tadzhikistan in Central Asia, and there Matusevitch finished grade school. The local population was made up of Moslems and a Russian minority, who suffered from an unfriendly, anti-Semitic and even cruel attitude, according to Matusevitch. Matusevitch spent many hours painting at that time; he made postcard copies of large paintings, and painted portraits from photographs. He tried to use oil colors for the first time, and since a few shades were missing, he mixed oil colors with gouache and acrylics. Matusevitch stood for hours watching the painters at work in the craft center beside his house. ==Odessa== At the end of the war, the family returned to Odessa in 1945. Matusevitch got a job as a welder in a factory, but he dreamed of being a painter, and to study in the Grekov Odessa Art school. At the age of 19, Matusevitch passed the entrance examinations and was accepted despite heavy competition and the unofficial restrictions regarding Jews. His dream had come true. Matusevitch began his studies with great enthusiasm, but they were cut short in the middle of the first course, as he was recruited into the Red Army. Matusevitch served four years as a sailor on the Baltic Sea. He never saw his parents, but despite that, he used his time well in study, painting portraits of his friends and taking part in group exhibitions. ==Study== In 1953, Matusevitch returned to his study for an additional five years. The students were required to paint in the Socialist Realism mode, an outcome of the well-known slogan that the arts belonged to the people, and therefore the artist was the servant of the people. Modern art was avoided, as it was regarded as bourgeois and therefore unacceptable. In 1958, Matusevitch finished his studies. His parents, with whom he lived, helped him devote much of his time to painting. On this he says: “It was always important to me to paint what was close to my view on life. I was in a large Soviet city and from a Jewish family. My point of view was in a measure Jewish. I saw the closely packed life of the Jewish street, and this helped me to describe in painting the special atmosphere of Odessa. Some blamed me for painting Odessa as a village and not as a modern, official Soviet city. But this was the Odessa I loved. I felt that this atmosphere, so unique, was gradually disappearing.” ==Influential painter== An important painter who greatly influenced Matusevitch was Vincent Van Gogh. When an exhibition of Van Gogh arrived in Moscow from the Netherlands, Matusevitch hurried to see it. He found many things in common with the great artist: an outlook of the world, a total devotion to art and also a ritual inclination in painting. In 1962, Matusevitch participated in a group exhibition of Odessa artists. An article written on the exhibition noted and praised his painting: “A Spring Day with Horses.” Subsequently, the artist participated in many exhibitions organized by the confederation of painters in Odessa. The authorities were not enamored with his style and urged him to paint political subjects of note, but the public did like him very much, which was important for the artist. Pressure from the political establishment was the lot of many artists, among them several of Matusevitch’s friends: the painters Mezberg, Mazritsky, Ostrovsky, Shenkar and, closest to him, the excellent painter and poet, Sasha Richter. ==Israel== In 1974, he arrived in Israel and immediately felt a deep affinity with the landscape, as though he had been there before, and he depicted the country in paint. Here, Matusevitch met Rima Kravitz, a doctor who loved art. In 1975, he married her, and he relates: “Rima admires me and helps me. I give her the credit for many of my successes.“ Matusevitch received a warm welcome in Israel. A long list of exhibitions, a lecturer’s post at the People University and membership in the painters’ confederation, while he continued to create and establish himself in the Israeli family of artists. In 1987, Matusevitch finally opened his own gallery in Tel-Aviv. He had people passing by, events, he sold some of his paintings, and he kept painting new ones. It was a dream that came true for Matusevitch. ==Death and legacy== Matusevitch died in 2007, after an illness he suffered for the last few years of his life. Matusevitch left behind him more than 400 paintings, which stayed since then in the gallery, that was close the whole time. Rima Kravitz, he's wife, didn't have the time and courage to manage the gallery, as a full time doctor, although she wanted very much. In 2017, Matusevitch's grandson - Bar Matusevitch, in his twenties, decided to take responsibility for the gallery. As times changed, he created an online gallery, together with Rima, as they realized that was what Matusevitch would have want the most - all of his paintings are available worldwide - . It was a dream that came true for the Matusevitch family. ==References * matusevitchart.com * https://www.facebook.com/matusevitchart/ * https://www.matusevitchart.com Category:1929 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Ukrainian artists Category:Post-impressionist painters Category:Russian painters Category:Jewish artists ","title":"Michael Matusevitch"},{"id":"56884158","text":"Alexander James Ashburner Nix (born 1 May 1975) is a British businessman, the former CEO of Cambridge Analytica and a former director of the Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) Group, a behavioural research and strategic communications consultancy, leading its elections division (SCL Elections). Cambridge Analytica and its parent SCL were involved in psychological warfare operations for the British military and involved in influencing hundreds of elections globally; Cambridge Analytica helped Leave.EU with its Brexit campaign, according to both Leave.EU and Cambridge Analytica staff. The company was also engaged by the Ted Cruz and Donald Trump campaigns during the 2016 US presidential election. The company also ran Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's campaign. A member of the Ashburner-Nix family of Crawley, Nix grew up in Notting Hill, attended Eton and studied art history. Nix started his career as a financial analyst with Baring Securities in Mexico before moving to the strategic communication industry and joining SCL Group, a private intelligence company active in the military and political arenas founded by Nigel Oakes and whose president was former Conservative minister Sir Geoffrey Pattie; Nix's father was also a co-owner of SCL. In 2013 he became CEO of SCL's new subsidiary Cambridge Analytica. The men behind Cambridge Analytica and its parent SCL were described as having close ties to the Conservative Party (UK), the British royal family and the British military, and included some of the Conservative Party's largest donors, and former Conservative minister Jonathan Marland, Baron Marland. The company provided advice to the Foreign Office and Nix met with Boris Johnson in 2016.https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-s-undisclosed-meeting- with-alexander-nix-of-cambridge-analytica Both in the UK and the US campaigns, Cambridge Analytica used private information from over 87 million Facebook users harvested from their profiles without permission. In 2018 Cambridge Analytica was dissolved after undercover video footage showed Nix claiming his company was using honey traps, bribery stings, and prostitutes, among other tactics, to influence more than 200 elections globally for his clients. In 2019 Nix and his colleague Aleksandr Kogan settled with the Federal Trade Commission, agreeing to delete previously obtained data; in 2020 Nix agreed to a disqualification undertaking prohibiting him from running U.K. limited companies for seven years after permitting companies to offer potentially unethical services, while denying any wrongdoing. ==Background and early life== Tilgate House in Crawley, former estate of the Ashburner Nix family Tilgate House in Crawley, built for the Ashburner Nix family Alexander James Ashburner Nix was born on 1 May 1975 to a banking family that belonged to the English landed gentry and had close ties to British colonial history both in the West Indies and British India, the Ashburner-Nix family of Crawley and London; Nix is mainly of English descent, and has some Black Jamaican ancestry in the 19th century as well as ancestors born in India and Peru.Brittany Kaiser, Targeted: The Cambridge Analytica Whistleblower's Inside Story of How Big Data, Trump, and Facebook Broke Democracy and How It Can Happen Again, HarperCollins, 2019, His father Paul David Ashburner Nix (1944–2006) was an investment manager who spent twenty-seven years with the M&G; Group before joining Consulta in 1995, and was a shareholder of SCL Group. The Nix family is included in Burke's Landed Gentry as \\"Nix of Tilgate,\\" and were wealthy bankers for several generations. The Ashburner family was a prominent family of merchants and administrators linked to the East India Company during British Company rule in India from the mid 18th century. The Ashburner/Nix family owned Tilgate House, a large 2,185-acre estate in Crawley that employed around 150 people. It was purchased by the wealthy Indian-born businessman George Ashburner in 1862 and inherited by his daughter Sarah (born 1845 in Calcutta), who in 1865 married banker John Hennings Nix, one of the partners in the London private bank Fuller, Banbury, Nix & Co.Joseph J. Howard, \\"Ashburner,\\" in Miscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica. Vol. 1. pp. 224ff. 1874.Pedigree of the family of Ashburner Their son—Alexander Nix' great- grandfather—was the olympian Charles George Ashburner Nix who won a silver medal at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London; he sold Tilgate House in 1939 as the family lived primarily in London. Nix' great-grandmother Mildred Ashburner Nix (1876–1949) was a daughter of liberal politician James Clifton Brown (1841–1917), a sister of The Viscount Ruffside, the WWII-era speaker of the House of Commons, and a descendant of Sir William Brown. Through her mother Amelia Rowe (1845–1922) Mildred descended from slave owners, free people of color and black slaves in Jamaica; Amelia's father Charles Rowe, Jr. (1819–1876) was of mixed race, an octoroon in the parlance of the time, and was born in Jamaica to the wealthy slave owner Charles Rowe, Sr. (1754–1821) and his 28-years younger mistress Mary Gauntlett (1782–1831), \\"a free quadroon\\" who owned slaves herself. Mary's sister Susannah was the mistress to another member of the Rowe family; among women of colour in Jamaica it was considered more respectable to be the mistress of a white man than to marry a person of colour, and such relations were largely the rule for Jamaican women of colour at the time.John Stewart, A View of the Past and Present State of the Island of Jamaica: With Remarks on the Moral and Physical Condition of the Slaves, and on the Abolition of Slavery in the Colonies , Oliver & Boyd, 1823 Mary Gauntlett was herself born out of wedlock to Elizabeth Roche (De La Roche, Delaroche; 1761–1812), a half black woman described in 1795 as \\"a free mulatto\\", and Lieutenant William Gauntlett; Elizabeth Roche was the daughter of Mary, \\"a freed Negro\\" born around 1740, and white planter John De La Roche. After her lover's death in 1821, Mary Gauntlett moved to Liverpool, England with their children, where the family apparently passed as white; Charles Rowe, Jr. became a partner in the firm Graham, Rowe & Co. with his brothers and their English in-laws; based in Liverpool the company opened offices in Lima, Peru and Valparaíso, Chile, and notably imported sugar to England. Charles Rowe married 16-year old Sarah Amelia Pfeiffer in Liverpool in 1841; Pfeiffer was born in Lima in 1825 to Friedrich Pfeiffer, a flour merchant from Hanover who had moved to Peru around 1821.Ulrich Muecke (ed.), The Diary of Heinrich Witt , Vol. 1, p. 101, pp. 156–157, pp. 190ff.Alfonso W. Quiroz, Corrupt Circles: A History of Unbound Graft in Peru, pp. 105–106 Alexander Nix grew up in Notting Hill, in West London, attended fee-paying Eton College, and studied art history at the University of Manchester. He started his career as a financial analyst with Baring Securities in Mexico for Robert Fraser & Partners LLP, a tax and corporate finance firm. In 2003, Nix left finance to join the to the strategic communication industry with SCL Group. ===Family and personal life=== In 2010 Nix married Olympia Paus, a wealthy Norwegian shipping heiress. ==CareerCambridge Analytica=== In 2013, Nix set up Cambridge Analytica as an offshoot of the SCL Group, to target voters in \\"more than 40 political campaigns in the US, Caribbean, South America, Europe, Africa and Asia\\". The company ran Uhuru Kenyatta's presidential campaign in Kenya. In the United States, it was involved in the 2014 midterm elections and the 2016 presidential primaries and election, during which it received funding from the Mercer family. Nix's firm supported both the Ted Cruz and Donald Trump campaigns for the US presidency by using \\"psychographic\\" profiles of voters built on data harvested from Facebook. In an exposé of the company, Nix was filmed stating that \\"we are not only the largest and most significant political consultancy in the world, but we have the most established track record. We're used to operating through different vehicles, in the shadows\\" and offered a \\"secretive relationship.\\" Before the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Nix's firm was involved in supporting Leave.EU with its Brexit campaign, according to both Arron Banks of Leave.EU, former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie, Cambridge Analytica's business development director Brittany Kaiser, and Leave.EU's communications director Andy Wigmore.Business Insider 21 March 2018: \\"All the times Cambridge Analytica gave brazenly contradictory accounts of its murky work on Brexit\\" ; retrieved 22 March 2018.The Observer, 26 February 2018: Robert Mercer: the big data billionaire waging war on mainstream media ; retrieved 22 March 2018. During Boris Johnson's tenure as foreign secretary, the Foreign Office sought advice from Cambridge Analytica and Boris Johnson had a meeting with Alexander Nix in 2016. According to Wigmore, the work for Leave.EU was done pro bono, without any money changing hand: “Because Nigel [Farage] is a good friend of the Mercers. And Robert Mercer introduced them to us. He said, ‘Here’s this company we think may be useful to you.’ What they were trying to do in the US and what we were trying to do had massive parallels. We shared a lot of information. Why wouldn’t you?” Behind Trump’s campaign and Cambridge Analytica, he said, were “the same people. It’s the same family.” In February 2018, Nix told the British parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee that his company had not received data from Facebook; following further media reports the committee's chairman, Damian Collins, said \\"We will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments.\\" Nix denies deliberately misleading the parliamentary Select Committee. In March 2018, The Observer reported that Nix talked \\"unguardedly about the company's practices\\" when he was secretly filmed by Channel 4 News reporters posing as prospective clients and that Cambridge Analytica was trying to stop the broadcast of the resulting programme. Nix offered \\"beautiful Ukrainian girls\\" to discredit political opponents in Sri Lanka.\\"Cambridge Analytica sends 'girls' to entrap politicians \\". The Times. 20 March 2018. The secret filming was screened on 19 March as part of a 30-minute segment, with a follow-up scheduled for the next day, focusing on its involvement in the Trump campaign. The conversation appears to portray Nix including entrapment and bribery as potential Cambridge Analytica services. On 20 March 2018, Nix was suspended from Cambridge Analytica. On 11 April 2018, The Wall Street Journal published an article about the CEO position at Cambridge Analytica, saying Nix \\"has officially resigned from his position, according to a person close to the company\\", but also that a \\"company spokesman ... denied that Mr. Nix had submitted his resignation\\". On 2 May 2018, Cambridge Analytica announced they were \\"closing and starting insolvency proceedings\\". Christopher Wylie described Nix as \\"born in the wrong century\\" and \\"the type of person that would have been ideal at the height of the British Empire to go and become a governor of a colony, because he's the right station and class and went to Eton and all that.\\" On 8 October 2018, the Guardian reported that Nix referred to Mia Mottley, the elected Prime Minister of Barbados and other government figures via the racial slur of \\"Niggers\\" in email communications. === Emerdata === On 23 January 2018, Nix was appointed director of Emerdata Ltd., a new company incorporated in August 2017, along with SCL chairman Julian Wheatland and Cambridge Analytica chief data officer Alexander Tayler. On 16 March 2018, Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer were also appointed directors, members of the Mercer family which backed Cambridge Analytica financially (by at least $15 million, according to the New York Times).

In 2020 Nix signed a disqualification undertaking, accepted by the UK Secretary of State on 14 September 2020. The Insolvency Service commented that \\"Within the undertaking, Alexander Nix did not dispute that he caused or permitted SCL Elections Ltd or associated companies to market themselves as offering potentially unethical services to prospective clients; demonstrating a lack of commercial probity.\\" The unethical services offered included \\"bribery or honey trap stings, voter disengagement campaigns, obtaining information to discredit political opponents and spreading information anonymously in political campaigns.\\" Effective from 5 October 2020, Alexander Nix is disqualified for seven years from acting as a director or directly or indirectly becoming involved, without the permission of the court, in the promotion, formation or management of a UK company. Nix said he had made \\"no admission of wrongdoing\\" or broken any laws. ==In popular culture== Nix has been compared to \\"a Bond villain\\" with \\"the sinister-sounding surname, the cut-glass accent and his position at the centre of a conspiracy theory involving Brexit, Trump and dodgy data.\\" Nix is portrayed by Paul Bettany in an upcoming film on the Cambridge Analytica affair produced by the Russo brothers. ==See also== *Russian interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum ==References== Category:1975 births Category:British people of Jamaican descent Category:Living people Category:English chief executives Category:Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign Category:2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum Category:Alumni of the University of Manchester Category:People educated at Eton College Category:People from Notting Hill Category:People associated with the 2016 United States presidential election Category:Cambridge Analytica ","title":"Alexander Nix"},{"id":"56884166","text":"Bedlam is a first-person shooter game developed by British studio RedBedlam and published by Standfast Interactive. It was released on October 13, 2015 for PlayStation 4 and October 16, 2015 for Xbox One. Based on the novel Bedlam by Christopher Brookmyre, it follows an ordinary Scottish woman named Heather Quinn who is trapped inside the body of a video game character in a fictional 90s FPS title, Starfire, which is similar to Quake, in addition to other game homages. The game received mixed to negative reviews from critics, who praised its comedic writing but criticized its lackluster gameplay and high amount of bugs. == Plot == The game follows an ordinary woman named Heather Quinn, a.k.a. Athena, who is transported into the world of a fictional first-person shooter called Starfire. The game later features other homages, like Death or Glory, inspired by Medal of Honor, and Planetfire, inspired by Halo. A force known as the Corruption is destroying game worlds and the player must escape it and try to stop a villainous organization known as the Integrity. == Gameplay == The game plays in a similar manner to a 90s first person shooter, prioritizing constant movement and dodging rather than the use of a cover system. == Development == The game was created as a tie-in with the novel, Bedlam, featuring a similar concept of a person being transported inside a video game. It was intended as the first game in a trilogy of both novels and games. The release of the game forced another game called Bedlam to change its name to Skyshine's Bedlam. == Reception == Bedlam received mixed to negative reviews, with an aggregate score of 53/100 on Metacritic for the PlayStation 4 version. Ben Tyrer of GamesRadar+ rated the game 3/5, calling its world and story \\"immensely likeable\\", and its protagonist \\"one of the most engaging I've witnessed in some time\\", but noting the amount of \\"technical and gameplay issues\\", including \\"major glitches\\" that caused important story elements to be skipped and disrupted gameplay. He called the game's shooting mechanics \\"bland\\", criticizing slow character control despite the \\"blindingly fast\\" movement and weak-feeling guns. Jaz Rignall of USGamer rated the game 50/100, saying that while the game's concept was \\"absolutely brilliant\\", it failed in the execution, having \\"stiff, unforgiving gameplay\\" such as \\"finicky aiming and shooting\\", \\"punishing checkpoints\\" and \\"awkward difficulty spikes\\". He noted that it seemed like the developer \\"bit off more than it could chew\\". Sammy Barker of Push Square rated it 4/10, saying that the biggest problem with the game is that \\"you'll wish it was so much better\\", praising its \\"razor-sharp commentary\\" and \\"fascinating plot\\" but saying that its \\"rotten first-person shooter\\" gameplay did not do it justice, and comparing the guns to \\"a spud gun loaded with mud\\". == References == Category:2015 video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Xbox One games Category:First-person shooters Category:Parody video games Category:Video games based on novels Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Bedlam (2015 video game)"},{"id":"56884172","text":"Digi-Battle, also known as Digimon as well as Digital Monster Card Game / Hyper Coloseeum in foreign markets, is an out-of-print collectible card game by Upper Deck and Bandai.

In 2018, he released a cache of documents prompting the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal, giving The Guardian documents that described the secret workings behind Cambridge Analytica. The documents were centered around Cambridge Analytica's alleged unauthorized possession of personal private data from up to 87 million Facebook user accounts, which was obtained for the purpose of creating targeted digital advertising campaigns. The campaigns were based on psychological and personality profiles mined from the Facebook data which Wylie had commissioned in a mass-data scraping exercise.

He later completed a master's degree in Political Management at George Washington University in Washington D.C. ==SCL Elections/Cambridge Analytica, 2013-14Work at SCL=== In 2013, Wylie began working as a contractor for SCL Elections, and its offshoot for American elections (later renamed Cambridge Analytica), an international consultancy specialising in data-driven psychographic targeting in elections. Wylie's role at SCL was first revealed in May 2017 by The Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, who wrote that \\"He’s the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica\\".Carole Cadwalladr, 'The great British Brexit Robbery: how our democracy was hijacked', The Observer, 7 May 2017. https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit- robbery-hijacked-democracy Describing his role as being the company's \\"director of research\\", Wylie worked with Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan to illegally scrape the personal data of 87 million people from their Facebook profiles, and used the data to develop new forms of psychographic microtargeting. During his time at SCL, Wylie worked for American Republican candidates affiliated with the party's \\"Tea Party\\" wing in the 2014 United States elections; and on disinformation campaigns for political parties in Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana and the Caribbean.'Nigeria to launch probe into two elections over Cambridge Analytica', Mail & Guardian [South Africa], 3 April 2018, https://mg.co.za/article/2018-04-03-nigeria-to- launch-probe-into-two-elections-over-cambridge-analytica Wylie's research work included message-testing work for Steve Bannon on building a wall on the American-Mexican border, and he later recounted, \\"My ears perked up when I [later] started hearing some of these things like 'drain the swamp' or 'build the wall' or 'the deep state' because these were all narratives that had come out from the research that we were doing,\\" and that the wall \\"is not really about stopping immigrants.

It states that he was never the company's \\"director of research\\" as claimed (a role which did not exist within the company), but that his employment contract made it clear that he was hired as a part-time \\"intern\\" on a student visa, limited to 19 hours of work a week; it queried his claim that he worked at the company until late 2014, quoting his resignation emails which stated that he left on 10 July 2014; it concludes that there was no evidence to support his claim to being a \\"founder\\" of Cambridge Analytica; and that contrary to his claims to have resigned in disgust at the company's practices, contemporary correspondence \\"does not suggest that, at least as at the end of his engagement with SCL, he had any qualms about the work he had been doing at SCL or helping others to do.\\"Julian Malins QC and Linda Hudson, Report Regarding Cambridge Analytica LLC and SCL Elections Ltd.

At a 2018 Q&A; session, \\"Wylie appeared visibly wrong-footed when asked why he had obtained so much compromising material on Cambridge Analytica prior to his departure, and why he held onto it for three years, and seemed to visibly struggle to provide any clear answer.\\"'News', Private Eye No. 1467, 8 April 2018, p. 5. ==Eunoia Technologies, 2014-17== In 2014, Wylie co-founded Eunoia Technologies along with former SCL/Cambridge Analytica senior staff Brent Clickard, Mark Gettleson and Tadas Jucikas. In describing his ambitions for developing Eunoia, Wylie stated \\"I want to build the NSA’s wet dream\\". Eunoia Technologies has been criticized for the similar psychographic profiling tactics used by Cambridge Analytica, using the same dataset shared by Alexander Kogan. In December 2014, Wylie registered Eunoia Technologies Inc in the tax haven of Delaware.'Wylie's People', Private Eye No. 1497, 6 April 2018, p. 12.

Wylie's lawyer subsequently assured journalists that Eunoia had no data, but parliamentary testimony from Dr Kogan later revealed that Eunoia had possessed Kogan's full data set of 87 million Facebook users; and that SCL/Cambridge Analytica had only ever had access to some 4% of the scraped data, \\"in contrast with the contract with Mr. Wylie’s entity Eunoia, where Eunoia received all of the page like data as well as dyads\\",Aleksandr Kogan, 'Written evidence submitted by Aleksandr Kogan to the Digital Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee', House of Commons (UK), April 2018 https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and- sport/Written-evidence-Aleksandr-Kogan.pdf and that unlike SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie's company had been the only organization Kogan granted complete access to the dataset.Aliya Ram, 'Cambridge Analytica whistleblower approached Kogan for data access', Financial Times, 24 April 2018 https://www.ft.com/content/72691744-47b0-11e8-8ee8-cae73aab7ccb ===Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2015=== During the Easter of 2015, two of Wylie's Eunoia colleagues who had joined him from SCL, Tadas Jucikas and Mark Gettleson, flew to New York to meet Donald Trump's then-campaign manager on his 2016 presidential bid, Corey Lewandowski, for a meeting in a Central Park hotel. They pitched for Eunoia to work on the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, but were ultimately unsuccessful. The approach to the Trump campaign was made with Wylie's knowledge as CEO of Eunoia, and reportedly had his blessing.Ryan Mac, 'The Cambridge Analytica Whistleblower Wanted His New Company To Work With Trump Campaign’s Manager', Buzzfeed, 28 March 2018. https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanmac/cambridge-analytica-chris-wylie-eunoia-trump- campaign ===Liberal Party of Canada, 2015=== In November 2015, Eunoia Technologies pitched Facebook data-mining techniques to the Liberal Party of Canada, securing a $100,000 contract in January 2016 for \\"a short-lived pilot project\\" with the Liberal Caucus Research Bureau. However, the contract was not renewed beyond the pilot.Andy Blatchford, 'Liberals awarded $100,000 contract to man at centre of Facebook data controversy', CBC, 21 March 2018. http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/christopher-wylie-facebook-liberals-canada- cambridge-analytica-1.4586046Amanda Connolly, 'Here’s what the Liberals paid Cambridge Analytica’s Chris Wylie to do — and what they say he didn’t do', Global News, 21 March 2018. https://globalnews.ca/news/4097287/cambridge- analytica-christopher-wylie-justin-trudeau/ ===EU Referendum campaign, 2016=== Wylie has repeatedly denied having had any involvement in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union referendum, describing himself as \\"A Eurosceptic, but I wouldn’t call myself a Brexiteer\\", and pointing to his having been abroad at the time of the referendum - although he has conceded that most of the key personnel involved in the Vote Leave campaign's digital and campaign financing controversies were all friends or colleagues of his, including BeLeave founder Darren Grimes, BeLeave Trasurer Shahmir Sanni, AggregateIQ founders Zack Massingham and Jeff Silvester (a company set up at Wylie's instigation when he was SCL's director of research), and Vote Leave HQ staffer Mark Gettleson (who recruited AggregateIQ to work for Vote Leave), with Sanni and Gettleson later becoming witnesses in criminal investigations of the Vote Leave campaign. It subsequently emerged that in January 2016, Wylie and Gettleson wrote a joint proposal, on behalf of Eunoia, to Vote Leave campaign Director Dominic Cummings, to pitch for a pilot providing microtargeting services to the Leave campaign in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. The pitch was ultimately unsuccessful, with Cummings later describing them as \\"charlatans\\".Dominic Cummings, 'On the referendum #24: Global conspiracies and a Scooby Doo ending?', Dominic Cummings' blog, 23 March 2018. https://dominiccummings.com/2018/03/23/on-the-referendum-24-global- conspiracies-and-a-scooby-doo-ending/ Gettleson subsequently admitted that they had only made the pitch to Vote Leave after first making a pitch to the opposing Remain campaign in November 2015. It was subsequently reported that on the morning of the referendum result, Wylie posted the \\"Brexit butterfly\\" graphic to his social media in support of Brexit, along with the caption \\"We did it\\", tagging four individuals: Conservative MP Nigel Evans of the Vote Leave campaign board; BeLeave founder Darren Grimes, later found guilty by the Electoral Commission of using BeLeave as a vehicle for illegally breaking campaign spending limits; and Leave campaigners Luis Lopez and Shahmir Sanni, with the latter later becoming a \\"whistleblower\\" on Vote Leave's campaign finance breaches.'News', Private Eye No. 1466, 23 March 2018, p. 5. ===Eunoia litigation with SCL/Cambridge Analytica, and closure=== From 2015, Wylie and Gettleson became embroiled in litigation with Cambridge Analytica's parent company, the SCL Group, with SCL alleging that Eunoia had infringed SCL's intellectual property, had misappropriated SCL's data, had attempted to 'poach' other SCL contractors, and had attempted to 'poach' SCL's clients. Wylie elaborated on the Eunoia allegations when denying them: \\"They tried to sue me over their claims that I was somehow trying to steal their clients, or to somehow try to interfere with their contractual relations with other employees, or what have you.\\"Christopher Wylie [interview], 'Data, Democracy and Dirty Tricks: Part 1', Channel 4 News, 17 March 2018, interview at 14 minutes, 40 seconds. https://www.channel4.com/news/cambridge-analytica- facebook-profiles-whistleblower-chris-wylie-election SCL later claimed that Eunoia had been \\"the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent the misuse of the company's intellectual property\\".'Tweet relating to Christopher Wylie', Cambridge Analytica official twitter account, 17 March 2018. https://twitter.com/CamAnalytica/status/975081780553310209 A QC's report noted: ::\\"On 21 May 2015, SCL discovered that Eunoia Technologies Limited had approached at least one of SCL’s existing clients in the USA, following confirmation from a US political client that they had received a proposal from Eunoia Technologies, which purported to deliver exactly the same services as SCL. Consequently, SCL’s lawyers wrote to Wylie and others at Eunoia Technologies Limited regarding suspected breaches of covenants on intellectual property, client solicitation, staff solicitation and non-competition.\\" Eunoia Technologies Ltd was voluntarily wound up in October 2017, with accounts running up to 31 May 2016.'Eunoia Technologies Ltd: filing history', Companies House, 23 March 2018. https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09596348/filing-history ==Whistleblower== Wylie (right) and Shahmir Sanni in March 2018 On the 18 March 2018, Wylie gave a series of detailed interviews to The Observer with revelations about his time at SCL/Cambridge Analytica, presenting himself as a \\"whistleblower\\". He subsequently provided testimony and materials to a range of inquiries and legislatures around the world, and his revelations were instrumental in the May 2018 collapse of Cambridge Analytica. Wylie admitted to having been the principal anonymous sourceCharlotte Tobitt, 'Observer's Carole Cadwalladr: I became a 'news slave' in pursuing Cambridge Analytica data harvesting scoop', Press Gazette, 22 March 2018 for a May 2017 The Observer article by Carole Cadwalladr, which first drew attention to Cambridge Analytica. Cadwalladr subsequently related how she had tracked Wylie down via LinkedIn in early 2017, and after finding him \\"fascinating, funny and brilliant\\", had spent a year persuading him to go public with his allegations. On March 27, 2018, Wylie provided evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the UK Parliament that contained further revelations about the practices at Cambridge Analytica and its associated companies. In an interview with The Guardian, Wylie stated that Rebekah Mercer \\"loved the gays, and so did Steve Bannon. He figured if you could get the gays on board, everyone else will follow...(like the) Milo Yiannopoulos thing\\". His memoir Mindf*ck: inside Cambridge Analytica's plot to break the world was published in 2019. ==Post-whistleblowing career== On 1 December 2018, Wylie was hired by H&M; as its consulting director of research. Wylie criticised Facebook co- founder Mark Zuckerberg over Facebook's role in spreading religious intolerance in Sri Lanka. Moulavi Zahran Hashim, a radical Islamist imam believed to be the mastermind behind the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings, preached on a pro-ISIL Facebook account, known as \\"Al-Ghuraba\\" media. ==Bibliography== * Export edition. ==Personal life== Wylie is self-described as gay and vegan. ==ReferencesVideo interview with The Guardian, published 17 March 2018 Category:Cambridge Analytica Category:Data scientists Category:21st-century Canadian scientists Category:People from Victoria, British Columbia Category:Scientists from British Columbia Category:Canadian whistleblowers Category:Gay men Category:LGBT scientists from Canada Category:Living people Category:1989 births ","title":"Christopher Wylie"},{"id":"56884473","text":"The 1993 Humboldt State Lumberjacks football team represented Humboldt State University during the 1993 NCAA Division II football season.

It was first described in 1864 by the American marine zoologist Alexander Agassiz as Toxocidaris depressus, having been collected during the North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition undertaken by Captain Cadwalader Ringgold and later Captain John Rodgers. ==Description== This sea urchin is distinctive in its shape, with the oral (lower) surface being flat and the aboral (upper) surface markedly depressed in the centre. The tubercles are numerous and even in size, and the spines are fine and short, their diameter being about a quarter of their length. The inter-ambulacral plates are broad and the pore pairs are arranged in slightly curved groups of six or seven pairs. ==Ecology== As is the case with most other sea urchins, the sexes are separate in this species, and adults liberate eggs and sperm into the water column. After fertilisation, the echinopluteus larvae spend several months swimming and drifting with the plankton. Metamorphosis is stimulated by the detection by the larvae of suitable locations to settle on the seabed, cues being provided by the presence on the substrate of films of micro-algae or of microbes. In the absence of a suitable habitat, the larvae can continue swimming, but metamorphosis will eventually happen even in the absence of these cues. ==Uses== P. depressus is used for human consumption and is the most important species of sea urchin in the southern Japan fishery. ==References== Category:Strongylocentrotidae Category:Edible shellfish Category:Animals described in 1864 ","title":"Pseudocentrotus depressus"},{"id":"56884529","text":"Zoë Marieh Urness (born 1984) is a photographer of Alaskan Tlingit and Cherokee Native American heritage. ==Biography== Urness was adopted, with her twin sister, by their Norwegian great-great uncle and aunt in Stanwood, Washington, and was introduced to tribal arts and history at the Alaskan Native American Cultural Association.

He played college football at Vanderbilt, and was drafted by the Packers in the third round of the 2018 NFL Draft. ==High school== Burks attended South County High School in Lorton, Virginia. Rated as a 3-star prospect out of high school, Burks committed to Vanderbilt over other offers from Duke, Maryland, Boston College, and others. ==College career== In a game against Kentucky during his second year, Burks intercepted 2 passes, one of which was returned for a touchdown. This feat caused him to become the SEC defensive player of the week. Following his senior season, Burk was also invited to play in the 2018 Senior Bowl as an alternate. ==Professional career== The Green Bay Packers selected Burks in the third round (88th overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft. The Green Bay Packers traded their fourth (101st overall) and fifth round (147th overall) picks in 2018 to the Carolina Panthers in exchange for the Panthers' third round pick which they used to select Burks. Burks was the 12th linebacker drafted in 2018. On May 17, 2018, the Green Bay Packers signed Burks to a four-year, $3.43 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $820,756. Burks entered training camp slated as a backup inside linebacker. He competed against Antonio Morrison to be a starting inside linebacker after Jake Ryan sustained a torn ACL during training camp. Burks sustained a shoulder injury during pre-game warmups before the start of the Packers' third preseason game at the Oakland Raiders and was subsequently inactive for the first two regular season games (Weeks 1–2). Head coach Mike McCarthy named Burks a backup starting inside linebacker, behind Antonio Morrison, upon his return from injury. On September 23, 2018, Burks made his professional regular season debut and recorded two combined tackles during a 31–17 loss at the Washington Redskins in Week 3. ==NFL career statisticsRegular season=== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - ! rowspan=2Year !! rowspan=2Team !! rowspan=2GP !! rowspan=2GS !! colspan=5 Tackles !! colspan=6 Interceptions !! colspan=2 Fumbles - !

Protagonist of Wilayat-e Faqih in Jammu & Kashmir. Former chairman of Madras E Babul Ilm. ==Early life and education== Aga Syed Mustafa Al-Moosavi Al-Safvi was born on 2 February 1918 to Ayatullah Aga Syed Ahmad. He is a descendant of Mir Shams-ud-din Muhammad Iraqi, who came to Kashmir in the 15th century as a political envoy. Aga Syed Mustafa began studying the Quran and theology from a young age and was assisted in his religious studies by his grandfather Aga Syed Muhammad, his father Ayatullah Aga Syed Ahmad, his uncle Aga Syed Yousuf, and Haji Amin Sahab. At the age of 22 years he lost his father Aga Syed Ahmed Al-Moosavi, people chose Aga Syed Mustafa as Aga Syed Ahmad's successor but Mustafa refused to accept the role, wanting his uncle Aga Syed Yousuf as the successor of his father. He entrusted the family affairs to his uncle who took over the traditional responsibilities performed by the Aga family. Aga Syed Mustafa went to Hawza 'Ilmiyah Najaf, Iraq for higher studies to fulfill his late father's wish. He was edified by Al-Haaj Aga Syed Abul Hassan Mashadi, Al-Uzma Al-Haaj Hazrat Aga Syed Mohsin Al-Hakeem Tabatabie, Aga Buzurg Tehrani, Mohammad Fazel Lankarani, Abdullah Sharudi, Mohammad Hadi Milani. He was very close to Ayatullah Al-Uzma Al-Haaj Hazrat Aga Syed Mohsin Al-Hakeem Tabatabaei and learnt from marja's like Al- Azm Mohsin Al-Hakeem, Ayatullah Syed Borjadi, Ayatullah Mar'ashi Najafi, Ayatullah Hadi Milani, Ayatullah Agha Bozorg Tehrani, Ayatullah Abdullah Shirazi, and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. ==Clerical career== After returning to Kashmir Aga Syed Mustafa worked as the deputy of his uncle and helped him in the religious affairs. In Kashmir he headed the Sharia Court founded by Ayatullah Aga Syed Mehdi Sarkaar over 100 years previously. Aga Syed Yousuf and Aga Syed Mustafa introduced and promoted the concept of Wilayat Al-Faqih in Kashmir. In 1980 Ayatullah Khamenei was invited to Kashmir by Aga Syed Yousuf, Ayatullah Khamenei addressed the people of Kashmir from the pulpit of historic Jamia Masjid Srinagar and his speech was translated by Shaheed Aga Syed Muhammad Hussain. After the death of Aga Syed Yousuf in August 1982, a division took place regarding the matter of succession. The Iranian Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini, Grand Ayatollah Nasir Makarem Sherazi, and several other religious leaders declared Ayatullah Aga Syed Mustafa to be the rightful successor. Aga Syed Mustafa took an initiative to abolish sectarianism which are known as Firqa Qadeem and Firqa Jadeed, this discord among the Muslims was installed by the Governments and anti Islamic elements. Maulana Iftekhar Hussain Ansari and Shaheed Aga Syed Muhammad Hussain were the patrons of this movement. In February 1984, the eldest son of Ayatullah Aga Syed Mustafa, Hujjat-ul-Islam Aga Syed Muhammad Hussain was poisoned by the enemies of Islam . Aga Syed Mohammad Hussain was the patron of unity among Muslim as well as non-Muslims in Kashmir. After the death of Imam Khomeini in 1989, Aga Syed Mustafa introduced Ayatullah Ali Khamenei to the people of Kashmir as Wali- Amr-al-Muslimin. He said: \\" I recognize both Imam Khomeini and Imam Khamenei as one.\\" He bestowed Ayatullah Uzma Sayyid Ali Khamenei with the title of \\"Rahbar E Kabeer Saani\\"(. In November 2000, another son of Ayatullah Aga Syed Mustafa, Shaheed Aga Syed Mehdi was assassinated by an improvised explosive device on his way to attend a Majlis e Hussaini at Magam. After this incident, Ali Khamenei invited Aga Sahab to the Islamic Republic of Iran to show empathy and offer condolences. Following martydom of two of his sons, Aga Sahab became popularly known as \\"Abu Shaheedain\\" (Father of Martyrs), among the people. \\"Oh Muslims! Unity Unity. \\" were the lines Aga Syed Mustafa frequently used to quote. == Death== Abu Shaheedain Aga Syed Mustafa died on 21 August 2002 due to prolonged illness, according to official reports hundreds of thousands of people attended the funeral prayer at Budgam.

It was played between the winners of the competition's 100th edition, and the record winners of the competition at the time. It was held at the Stadium of Light on 18 May 1999, two days after the end of the Premier League season. The match was played between Sunderland, champions of the 1998–99 Football League First Division (the second-tier of English football at the time), and Liverpool, 18-time Football League champions (all first-tier titles). Sunderland took an early lead through Allan Johnston's curling effort, but a penalty from Robbie Fowler and a close-range finish from Jamie Redknapp put Liverpool 2–1 in front. Sunderland brought the game back level via a Kevin Phillips header, but the Reds restored their lead within a minute when Paul Ince saw his deflected shot hit the back of the net. This proved to be the decisive goal as Liverpool won 3–2 to claim the glass trophy in front of a crowd of 18,111. ==Background== The match was announced in a press conference on 30 April 1999 in the presence of Sunderland manager Peter Reid and Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier, to celebrate 100 editions of the Football League First Division. The game was scheduled for 18 May 1999, two days after Liverpool's final match in the 1998–99 Premier League. The match was billed as being Steve McManaman's final game in a Liverpool shirt as he was to join Real Madrid at the end of the season, however McManaman was forced to withdraw due to the death of his mother. The winners of the game were to receive a trophy made from glass, while the match was also given its own logo featuring the colours blue, red and white. Liverpool's line-up for the game was: Brad Friedel, Rigobert Song, Dominic Matteo, Phil Babb, Jamie Carragher, Jamie Redknapp, Paul Ince, David Thompson, Patrik Berger, Karl-Heinz Riedle and Robbie Fowler. ==MatchDetails=== { style=\\"width:92%\\" -   } ==Post-match== Sunderland manager Peter Reid expressed worry about the potential length of the injury suffered by their top scorer Kevin Phillips during the game, stating \\"We are just hoping it's a few torn fibres instead of a full-blown hamstring tear\\".

In 2000, he earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts at Northern Illinois University. Klos then studied abroad in France, where he investigated Renaissance painting techniques at L'Atelier Neo Medici in 2002. By 2009, he earned a Masters of Fine Arts at Hunter College. == Art == Klos's work is influenced by his childhood growing up on Chicago's South Side. His work commonly explores themes surrounding African-American identity in contemporary society. Through his large scale collages, Klos challenges notions of marginalization, masculinity, and urban mythology. He paints portraits of people from Chicago's South Side, highlighting narratives of suppression, denial, and pain associated with the vulnerability experienced in black communities. There was a \\"stoicism\\" among the \\"black folks\\" Klos witnessed, an element he attempts to unpack by studying the behavioral nature of adapting and thriving. Overall, he challenges conventions often attached to the African-American man. Klos is represented by Jack Tilton Gallery. === Printmaking === In his earlier works, Klos was known for printing giant woodcuts on large stretches of muslin. His interest in the technique grew out of the many African-American activists who employed it during the mid 20th century, such as Charles White, Elizabeth Catlett, and Emily Douglas. By cutting and etching using a series of erratic, jagged marks, he imitates this \\"kinetic devotion to image-making\\" that grounds this element of humanity he desires to achieve. === Collage === Klos' collages derive from his practice as a printmaker. Using a personalized approach, he creates swatches and samples of textures by hand-carving and inking woodblock prints to create a library of source material. By piecing and arranging a selection of patterns, they are layered on top of a pencil blueprint to create a complete portrait. His ideas of memory and distortion are demonstrated by the manifestation of fractured impressions and angled perspectives. Klos views collage as more than just a technique, but more a \\"metaphor for the fragmentation of African-American identity\\". === Sculpture === Klos references earthly materials, physical mediums he views as strong yet vulnerable over the passage of time. He associates timelessness to ancient monuments, an concept he applies to his sculptures to communicate the \\"monumentality of a culture's identity and relationship to time\\". Often, he incorporates materials leftover from urban renewal, such as milk crates, bricks, and wooden beams. The use of these mediums suggest Klos' desire to construct an identity relevant to his background. == Selected exhibitions == 2018 \\"Go Figure\\", The Pizzuti Collection, Columbus, OH 2017 \\"Everyday Anomaly\\", WHATIFTHEWORLD, Cape Town, South Africa 2017 \\"Art on the Vine\\", presented by The Agora Culture, Edgartown, MA 2017 \\"Face to Face: Los Angeles Collects Portraiture\\", California African American Museum, Los Angeles, CA 2017 \\"Give Us the Vote\\", ArtsWestchester, White Plains, NY 2016 \\"Black Pulp!\\", The International Print Center, New York, NY 2016 September: Galerie Anne DeVillepoix, \\"Blank Black\\", Paris FR 2016 September: Papillon Art, \\"Yashua Klos: How to Hide in the Wind\\", Los Angeles CA 2015 \\"To Be Young, Gifted, and Black\\", curated by Hank Willis Thomas, Goodman Gallery, Johannesburg, South Africa 2015 \\"Broken English\\", curated by Kim Stern, Tyburn Gallery, London, UK 2015 September: Jack Tilton Gallery, “As Below, So Above”, New York NY 2014 February: Carnegie Mellon University, Draw 2014 Symposium, Pittsburgh PA 2014 November: Opa Locka ARC, In Plain Sight, Opa-Locka FL 2013 March: Jack Tilton Gallery, \\"We Come Undone\\", New York NY 2012 October: Memphis College of Art, “Singular Masses”, Memphis TN 2012 Weatherspoon Museum, “Art on Paper”, Greensboro NC 2012 November: Studio Museum in Harlem, “Fore”, New York NY 2012 Dodge Gallery, “Bigger Than Shadows”, New York NY2013 February: Jack Tilton Gallery, “We Come Undone”, New York NY 2011 June: Kravetz Wehby, “Paperwork”, New York NY 2010 July: Scaramouche Gallery, “Lush Life”, New York NY 2010 September: Tilton Gallery, “ELSE”, New York NY 2010 October: Catskill Art Society, “Utopia and Wallpaper”, Livingston Manor NY 2009 January: Museum of Science and Industry, “Black Creativity 09”, Chicago IL 2009 June: Hunterdon Museum of Art, “Up and Coming”, Clinton NJ 2008 February: Rush Arts Gallery, “Garveyism”, New York NY 2008 August: Port Authority Bus Terminal, “The Mt.

There, the universe has been rebuilding since Don Armage's defeat four years ago under Tsurugi Ohtori's leadership while the Kyurangers have parted ways to live their lives, until Shou Ronpo discovers that Hammie stole four of the newly developed Neo Kyutamas. This causes a division within the Kyurangers, with those following Tsurugi seeking to arrest Hammie while Lucky and the rest want to find her and find out the reason behind her actions. Hammie brings the Kyutamas to Demost, who uses them to revive past Sentai villains Mere, Juzo Fuwa, Basco Ta Jolokia, and Escape to serve under him. He then sends the five to attack the other Kyurangers in a hit-and-run, worsening Hammie's credibility as Shu and his fellow Space Sheriff Geki Jumonji offer their aid. It is revealed that Hammie is being extorted by Demost, who is holding her mentor hostage after she was assumed dead during Jark Matter's reign, the space ninja forcing Hammie to comply with his order to assassinate Tsurugi. Hammie makes the attempt when Tsurugi makes a public announcement of stepping down in light of the recent events, only to hesitate as Geki and Shu reveal her forced compliance to Demost as he is exposed as one of Tsurugi's aides in disguise; Naga and Balance having rescued Hammie's master as added evidence.

It is based on the DC/Vertigo Comics limited series of the same name by Ollie Masters and Ming Doyle. The film stars an ensemble cast, led by Melissa McCarthy, Tiffany Haddish, and Elisabeth Moss as the wives of Irish mobsters, who take over organized crime operations in New York's Hell's Kitchen in the late 1970s, after the FBI arrests their husbands. The film also features Domhnall Gleeson, James Badge Dale, Brian d'Arcy James, Jeremy Bobb, Margo Martindale, Common, and Bill Camp in supporting roles. Produced by New Line Cinema, Bron Creative, and Michael De Luca Productions, the film was theatrically released in the United States on August 9, 2019, by Warner Bros. Pictures. It received mostly negative reviews from critics, who criticized the convoluted plot, and grossed $16 million against its $38 million budget, making the film a box-office bomb. ==Plot== In Hell's Kitchen 1978, three women are married to members of the Irish mob. Kathy is married to the reluctant but kind Jimmy; Ruby is married to Kevin, the son of Helen and heir to the mob empire; Claire is married to Rob, who abuses her. One night, the men are busted by FBI agents and sentenced to three years in prison. Little Jackie becomes head of the mob and tells the wives they'll be taken care of, but the money isn't enough for the women to survive. When the women discover that the local businesses paying protection fees are not happy under Little Jackie, they begin collecting protection fees and helping out the neighborhood, making a profit and becoming beloved in the community. When Jackie finds out, he goes after the women, but is killed by Gabriel O'Malley, a former Irish mob enforcer called in by Ruby. With Jackie out of the way and Gabriel as their enforcer, the women begin running the neighborhood, while Gabriel and Claire begin a relationship. The women eventually are ordered to meet with Alfonso Coretti, the head of the Italian mafia. He suggests they make a deal and tells them he's arranged for their husbands to be released from prison. Knowing that this will threaten the women's power, Coretti says he'll support them and give them more of the city to control. The women decide to take the deal. When their husbands get out of prison, Kevin thinks that he's still in charge, Jimmy pressures Kathy for them to leave their life of crime, and Rob is furious that Claire has left him for Gabriel. When Rob tracks Claire down, she kills him. After Rob's murder, Coretti tells the women that a contract has been placed on them by members of their own gang. Ruby offers more money for the mafia to kill Kevin and three other gangsters, but Kathy makes her drop teenager Colin from the list. The hit goes through, but Claire is killed when Colin comes back to exact revenge. After Claire's funeral, Kathy realizes that Ruby has been paying off one of the FBI agents. Ruby explains that she set up their husbands to be caught on the night they were originally arrested so that she could take over. Kathy later finds that Jimmy has taken her children to Coretti against her will because Jimmy was unhappy about not having a place in the business. Feeling betrayed, Kathy leaves, allowing Coretti to kill Jimmy. Ruby asks Kathy to meet her at a vendor. When Kathy arrives, she finds that Ruby and Gabriel are planning to kill her, but Kathy has brought all of the local Irishmen as backup. Gabriel admits he only got back into the life because he loved Claire, and he leaves. Kathy tells Ruby that the only way the two of them will survive is if they work together, so the women reconcile, with plans to take on Uptown next. ==CastProduction== In February 2017, Andrea Berloff signed on to direct an adaptation of The Kitchen, a Vertigo comic book miniseries by Ollie Masters and Ming Doyle. Berloff had already been commissioned to write the screenplay for the film, but she impressed executives at New Line Cinema, the film's production company, with her \\"edgy and subversive\\" perspective. In November 2017, Tiffany Haddish, off of a breakthrough performance in Girls Trip, signed on as one of the film's three female leads. In February 2018, Melissa McCarthy came on board for another lead role, and in March 2018, Elisabeth Moss was cast as the last of the three leads, while Margo Martindale, Bill Camp, and Brian d'Arcy James were also added. In April 2018, Domhnall Gleeson, Common, James Badge Dale, Jeremy Bobb, and Alicia Coppola joined the cast, and in May 2018, James Ciccone was added as well. Coppola did not appear in the finished film. Principal photography began on May 7, 2018, in New York City, and wrapped in September 2018. ==Release== The Kitchen was released on August 9, 2019, by Warner Bros. Pictures. ==Reception Box office === In the United States and Canada, The Kitchen was released alongside Dora and the Lost City of Gold, The Art of Racing in the Rain, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark and Brian Banks, and was projected to gross $9–14 million in its opening weekend. Playing at 2,742 theaters, it was the smallest wide release of McCarthy's career. After making $1.8 million on its first day, estimates were lowered to $5–6 million. The film ended up debuting to $5.5 million, the worst wide ening weekend of both McCarthy and Haddish's careers. The film dropped 60% in its second weekend to $2.2 million before being pulled from 2,125 theaters in its third weekend and making just $342,506. The Hollywood Reporter estimated the film would lose \\"tens of millions\\" for the studio, although noted it could find success in home media. ===Critical response=== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 24% based on 221 reviews, with an average rating of 4.45/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"With three talented leads struggling to prop up a sagging story, The Kitchen is a jumbled crime thriller in urgent need of some heavy-duty renovation.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B–\\" on an A+ to F scale. Varietys Owen Gleiberman described the film as \\"just like Widows, except not as good.\\" Gleiberman was critical of the script but praised McCarthy's fierce performance, wished Tiffany Haddish had more to do, and that Margo Martindale had a bigger role. Ty Burr of The Boston Globe wrote, \\"There's only one Scorsese, and he ain't here.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: \\"Speaking of female gangsters, no review of The Kitchen should overlook Margo Martindale, who steals every scene she's in as a mob matriarch – a gravelly voiced monster with a gutter mouth and a big photo of John F. Kennedy on her wall. Martindale gets to be evil and has as much fun onscreen as she can without smiling.\\" == References * Category:2019 films Category:2010s female buddy films Category:2019 crime films Category:American crime films Category:American female buddy films Category:American films Category:2019 directorial debut films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on American comics Category:Films based on Vertigo titles Category:Films produced by Michael De Luca Category:Films set in 1978 Category:Films set in Brooklyn Category:Films set in Manhattan Category:Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan Category:Live-action films based on comics Category:Mariticide in fiction Category:New Line Cinema films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Films about the American Mafia Category:Films about the Irish Mob Category:Films shot in New York City ","title":"The Kitchen (2019 film)"},{"id":"56885018","text":"Platanthera carnosilabris is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae, native to south-central China (north-west Yunnan). ==Taxonomy== The species was first described by Tsin Tang and Fa Tsuan Wang in 1940, as Herminium carnosilabre.

It is situated at the corner of Castle Hill and Belmont Terrace in Nelson Mandela Bay. The building aims to cultivate, develop and promote the culture, heritage and arts of the Eastern Cape. It was opened on 26 July 1896 and was designed by George William Smith. It was declared a national monument in 1980 and is listed as one of the provincial heritage sites of Port Elizabeth. ==Architecture== The Athenaeum was erected during the height of the Victorian era thus the designer, George William Smith, designed the building in a typically Victorian manner. It is a two-storey building with two distinct sections which were opened in 1896 and 1901 respectively. The Belmont Terrace facade has two wings which are joined by a central arched entrance porch, which is a classic of the Victorian style. The building has elements of 19th century neoclassicism and the architectural style used was Edwardian Baroque. Entrance of The Athenaeum ===History=== In the 1850s, a group of intellectuals and willing citizens in the area of Algoa Bay came together to form the Athenaeum Society with the aim of promoting cultural, artistic and scientific activities within the town. The formation of this society was largely motivated by the lack of public entertainment within their region. Committee members from the local library, the Athenaeum Society and the municipality held a meeting on 20 October 1856 to appeal to the colonial government to accord land to erect a Town Hall, which would accommodate municipal offices, a library, a museum and an athenaeum (place of further learning). A Town Hall was erected in 1858, which secured a home for the Athenaeum Society. Thus the society initially operated out of a space in the Town Hall but, as the library and museum grew and expanded into the space which the Athenaeum Society occupied, the society was forced to cease all activities in that space. In 1882 an Art School was founded in Port Elizabeth. The number of its members grew exponentially so new premises were sought after. In 1891 Dr Hewitt, the founder of the Young Men's Institute, was also looking for premises for his society. In that very year the Photographic Society and Naturalist Society were founded and also sought premises in which to operate. The four societies thus came together to reinvigorate the Athenaeum. The Town Council subsequently granted the new Athenaeum some council land and offered to erect a building if each society contributed the equivalent of €1000, which they did. An agreement was signed that stated that the building would remain the property of the Town Council, but would be made available to the societies, rate free. It also stipulated that the Athenaeum Council was responsible for the interior maintenance of the building whilst the municipality was responsible for the exterior. The Athenaeum Council, together with further funding from the Town Council, erected The Athenaeum in 1896. Since its opening in 1896, the Athenaeum has been home to numerous creative societies and leveraged off partnerships with the Mandela Bay Development Agency (MBDA), the Arts Journey, the National Arts Festival, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University and Nelson Mandela Bay Tourism. 1900s In 1946, the Port Elizabeth Music and Dramatic Society (PEMADS) rented and renovated the Loubser Hall into a theatre, which is known today as the Ford Little Theatre. In the early 2000s the Athenaeum building went into a state of dilapidation and closed down. The Mandela Bay Development Agency (MBDA) took over the building in 2010 and started renovations. The Athenaeum and Ford Little Theatre were reopened in 2012. Present day The Athenaeum serves as a cradle of diverse activities within the arts industry. It showcases both national and international art exhibitions, live performances, art interventions and theatre shows. A number of emerging creatives hold office and studio space within the building. It is considered a fusion of new South African art and old South African design. To ensure sustainability, The Athenaeum also offers services such as venue hire, exhibition hosting and curation, event management, bar services, marketing and promotion and service provider management.

He was brought up under the care of his maternal grandfather, Mr. Potinger. At age 12 he was sent to Westminster School, and in 1732 he was elected from the foundation to a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge, but entered Christ Church, Oxford as a commoner. After taking his B.A. degree he was elected a fellow of All Souls, and there graduated M.A. in 1739 and B.D. in 1748. At All Souls he formed lasting friendships with Sir William Blackstone and Dr. Benjamin Buckler, whom he assisted in drawing up the Stemmata Chicheliana. In 1746, during the Jacobite rebellion, Bingham served the office of proctor in the university, and acted with great spirit. On the death of the Rev. Christopher Pitt, the translator of the Æneid, Bingham was instituted, on 23 May 1748, to the rectory of Pimperne, Dorsetshire. He resigned his fellowship on his marriage; but his wife, by whom he had a daughter and two sons, died in 1760 at the age of thirty-five. He had just been presented by Sir Gerard Napier to the living of More Critchell (1755), to which that of Long Critchell was annexed in 1774. He was elected proctor for the diocese of Salisbury in the convocations of 1761, 1768, 1774, and 1780. His eldest son, the senior scholar at Winchester, was accidentally drowned while bathing in the river Itchin in 1708. In 1781 Bishop Bagot offered him the Warburtonian lecture, but he declined to preach it, because he held that the church of Rome, though corrupt, was not chargeable, as Warburton meant to prove, with apostasy. Bingham died at Pimperne on 11 October 1800, aged 85, and was buried in the chancel of the church. A marble monument, with a long inscription in Latin, was erected to his memory. ==Works== Bingham published in his lifetime: *An anonymous essay on the Millennium, entitled Τά χίλια έτη, 1772. *A Vindication of the Doctrine and Liturgy of the Church of England, occasioned by the Apology of the Rev. Theophilus Lindsey, M.A., on resigning the vicarage of Catterick, Yorkshire, Oxford, 1774. It was dedicated to Thomas Newton, Bishop of Bristol, who mentioned it in a charge to the clergy of his diocese in 1776. Both these works were reprinted in Dissertations, Essays, and Sermons (2 vols., London, 1804), edited, with a biographical memoir, by his son, Peregrine Bingham the elder, rector of Edmondsham, Dorset. The collection also includes: **Dissertationes Apocalypticæ, in three parts. **Paul at Athens, an essay. **Commentary on Solomon's Song. **Four sermons.

She has published studies in Venezuela, Spain, the United States and Lithuania in which she supports the hypothesis that the Goths were not a Germanic but a Baltic people. == Biography == Rosales was born on 9 September 1929 in Kaunas, Lithuania and lived with her parents, at least partly in Paris, until 1938. Her father, Jonas Statkus, was head of the State Security Department of Lithuania until he was arrested on 6 July 1940 along with Augustinas Povilaitis, General Kazys Skučas, and several other high officials after the Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania. He was sent to Butyrka prison in Moscow where it is presumed he died on an unknown date. After the end of the Second World War Rosales moved to France where she learned Latin and French, receiving a degree as a teacher of French. She continued her studies at Columbia University in New York, where she taught English, Spanish, and German. In 1960 she married Venezuelan engineer Luis Rosales; they raised five children—Luis, Juan, Sarunas, Rimas, and Saulius—in a multi-lingual household, using both Spanish and Lithuanian. Starting in 1983 she held the position of editor-in-chief of the Venezuelan opposition magazine Zeta, in addition to writing for Venezuelan daily paper El Nuevo País and the Cleveland-based Dirva. She holds an honorary doctorate from the Lithuanian University of Educational Sciences. == Hypothesis on the Goths being Baltic == Rosales has published studies in the US, Spain, Venezuela, and Lithuania supporting the idea that the Goths were a Baltic, not Germanic people. Rosales traces her research on the controversial hypothesis back to 17th-century Prussian scholar Matthäus Prätorius who is thought to have first proposed the idea, which was supported by several Lithuanian historians including Simonas Daukantas and Česlovas Gedgaudas as well as linguist Kazimieras Būga. Most of what is known of the Gothic language is from the sixth-century Codex Argenteus, the only substantive text in the Gothic language. The surviving Codex is a translation of part of the Bible; it contains the greater part of the four Gospels. It was written for a small Gothic population living on the banks of the Danube surrounded by a much larger Germanic population. Rosales's controversial theory is that this latter fact was not taken into account by the Swedish linguist Johan Ihre when he determined that in 1769 that this work was in a Germanic language. Rosales states that instead the people for whom it was translated—referred to by Jordanes as the \\"little Goths\\", distinguished from the Ostrogoths and Visigoths—spoke a mix of Gothic (a Baltic language, according to Rosales) and an exogenous Germanic language. According to Rosales, prior to Ihre's work, the non-German inhabitants of northeast Europe were referred to as Getas or Gethes in medieval chronicles; she adduces several examples from those gathered by Būga and Aleksandras Račkus, like: *Gethas id est Letwanos, Chronicon polonisilesiacum, around 1278 (Goths, that is, Lithuanians) *Gete dicuntur Lithuani, Prutheni et alias ibidem gentes, W. Kadlubek, XII century (Goths are called Lithuanians, Prussians and other peoples like them) Rosales maintains that from the middle of the second millennium BCE and into the first millennium BCE, the territory of the Baltics was in Central and Eastern Europe, from which Goths (which she identifies as being the same people as these Getas), the largest and most southern tribe, made incursions into Asia, going as far as India. She considers the Getica (Jordanes circa 551 A.D. book on the Goths and self-described as a summary of a now lost work by Cassiodorus), and the 13th-century Estoria de España or Primera Crónica General of Alfonso X of Castile (Alfonso El Sabio, \\"The Wise\\") to be basically accurate. The island of Scandza, the place of origin of the Gothic people, is usually presumed to be Scandinavia, but Rosales says that the Curonian Spit (a thin strip of land along the Baltic Sea that joins modern-day Lithuania with the Kaliningrad Oblast, now a Russian exclave), is more congruent with the description in the Primera Crónica General, based on the Spit's nearness to the lower portion and mouth of the Vistula. She proposes that the Gulf of Codano is the Gulf of Gdansk. According to Rosales, Lithuanian name of the spit, (Kuršių) nerija, means the same as Scandza, \\"that which submerges\\". She concurs with Gedgaudas's date of 1490 BCE for the departure of the Goths from Scandza. Asserting that the Crónica mentions (without naming) the Battle of Kadesh (between the Ancient Egyptians and Hittites in the 13th Century BCE), she identifies the Egyptian king Uesoso named in the Crónica with Ramesses II; the Crónica recounts the Gothic king Thanauso handing Uesoso a major defeat in battle. Subsequently, Thanauso (king in 1290 BCE) continued eastward, arriving 15 years later in India, where some of his warriors settled and became the Parthians and Bactrians; the mythological Amazons, she states, would have been Gothic women. On the linguistic front, she concurs with Gedgaudas according to which the etymology of Goth is from the Baltic verb gaudo, \\"to catch\\" or \\"to trap\\", which could refer to a man who captures a cow/bull or, equally, a slave, so either a rancher or a warrior and further proposes that the German Gott (English \\"God\\") is the same word, owing to the Goths deifying some of their kings after they died; the Crónica relates, \\"so good was this Thanauso, king of the Goths, that after his death they counted him among the gods.\\" . She proposes that Scythia means \\"place of passage\\" (a place one passed through) and Scythian means \\"transient\\" (one who is passing through), related to the Baltic aisčiai (from the root eiti, \\"to go\\"). She suggests that millennia-long continuity of a population in northeastern means that the Balts are one and the same as the first Indoeuropeans, and that this region was the source of the various migrations that created the Indoeuropean domain. On the base of the finding of names like Sembus and Neuri in inscriptions gathered by Julien Sacaze in the French area which belonged to the Visigothic Kingdom, Rosales sustains that among the Visigoths there was a contingent of Sambians, whose origin was the North of Poland, and other of Neuri, who had lived in the area embraced by the upper Volga, Moscow and Kiev, the dialects spoken by them are extinct, although the dzukas dialect, still alive in Lithuania, seems to be the last remain of the old Prussian language spoken by the sambians. She also believes that Baltic languages significantly influenced the phonetics of Latin in the Iberian Peninsula, attributing to it the arising of the palatalization and the characteristic diphthongs of the Spanish, Leonese and Galician-Portuguese and indicates that some Spanish words and surnames are of Baltic origin. === Criticism === The idea has been heavily criticized by other academics such as Zigmas Zinkevičius as pseudohistory primarily driven by nationalist, not academic concepts. Professors Alvydas Butkus and Stefano M.

His father is Nikolai Nalobin, a former KGB agent and later FSB General. His brother also worked for the FSB. In 1996, Nalobin graduated from Moscow school No.594. From 1996 to 2001, Sergey Nalobin studied in Moscow State University of International Relations, he graduated with excellence from the faculty of International Law. ==Career== After graduation, Sergey Nalobin joined the Russian diplomatic service: from 2001 to 2004, he served as the attaché and later as the third secretary of the Russian Embassy in Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. During 2010–2015, Nalobin was the first secretary of the political section at the Russian Embassy to the United Kingdom where his dossier included the development of bilateral relations between both countries and political and legal issues. In 2011, as the head of Bilateral Relations section at the embassy in London, Sergey Nalobin took part in the Cambridge Union Society debates “This House Believes there are no Freedom-Fighters, only Terrorists”. Mr Nalobin's speech was devoted to the Russian experience in fighting terrorism. Sergey Nalobin presents the Medal of Ushakov to the survivors of the Second World War Arctic convoys in Wales, December 2014. In June 2012, he attended informal meetings of the British parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee along with Alexey Pushkov, chairman of the committee for International Affairs of the Russian State Duma and Alexander Yakovenko, Russian ambassador to London, in which he was described as head of the Bilateral Relations Group at the Russian Embassy. In August 2012, as the political counsellor, he helped to arrange a reception at the Embassy on the occasion of establishment of the Conservative Friends of Russia, headed by the Honorary President RtHon Sir Malcolm Rifkind. The Organisation was aimed at strengthening relations between British and Russian communities, business and organizations, encouraging individuals to explore history and culture, advancing a greater understanding of the comparative political systems and providing a forum for open discussion of issues related to Russia and Great Britain. In November 2014, Nalobin, presented the Medal of Ushakov to the survivors of the Second World War Arctic convoys and their descendants at a ceremony in Worcester when he was described as a counsellor at the Russian Embassy. In December 2014, he presented more Ushakov medals in Exeter. In 2015, Sergey Nalobin took part in the discussion on the issue of religious intolerance in the Middle East at the House of Lords hosted by Lord Howell and Lord Lothian. On March 19, the Russian diplomat took part in a seminar devoted to the European Union Committee's report “The EU and Russia: before and beyond the crisis in Ukraine\\". It was a thought-provoking discussion with a professional approach to the matter in question. Nalobin left London in 2015 after concluding his five-year mission to the UK. In November 2017, The Guardian published an article about the reason of Sergey Nalobin's leaving the UK. However, in February 2018, The Guardian added a note with a correction that the Russian diplomat left the country, because his visa was expired: \\"At the readers' editor’s request the Russian embassy provided copies of its note to the FO on 10 November 2017, which sought an explanation of whether Mr Nalobin had been expelled by having his permission to stay revoked, and the FO’s reply. The FO confirmed the authenticity of its reply, 9 February 2018, which says in part that it 'can confirm that Mr Sergey Nalobin was not expelled from the UK. The [relevant FO] Directorate understand that Mr Nalobin left the UK upon the expiry of his vignette [a kind of visa].'\\" == Digital Diplomacy == The Digital Diplomacy Unit at the Department of Information and Press of the Russian MFA is under the direction of Sergey Nalobin. The Unit sets the priority of providing the target audience (who is the Russian-speaking people) with the most recent official foreign policy coverage conducted by rich media content. Hence, over the past few years the Ministry has maintained its strong presence on the most popular global media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Flickr, as well as services like Viber and VKontakte. On the platform of Twiplomacy, Mr. Nalobin stresses that \\"one of the goals is to deliver multilingual content with as little latency and as much outreach that we can possibly achieve. This, of course, applies to Facebook, where we have a 'multi-purpose' account for both Russian and English-speaking followers. While the majority of our publications on this platform are indeed in Russian, all comments, statements and interviews related to the most pressing foreign policy issues, as well as coverage of Foreign Minister’s activities are translated into English.\\" Regarding all the social media pages of the Ministry, the Digital Diplomacy Unit foremost relies on the Foreign Ministry's multilingual website as a news source which is as well as covered on Facebook. This compromises: text publications, visual content provided by its own team of photographers, camera crews and IT engineers. Therefore, they facilitate the social media division to manage the platform features, for instance, streaming Foreign Minister's public appearance worldwide directly to its Facebook account. == Activity == In May 2017, Sergey Nalobin gave an interview to Sputnik at the International forum of the Russian-speaking broadcasters where he touched on the issue of how digital diplomacy is crucial for promoting objective information on the Russian policy. In November 2017, Nalobin was a visiting lecturer in Moscow State University of International Relations: he outlined the modern information policy of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affaires. In July 2018, Nalobin attended the Conference “The prospects for development of medical tourism in Russian regions” in Ryazan. The diplomat pointed out that the Russian MFA is interested in proposing its digital resources for development of medical capacity in Ryazan in order to properly capture positive significant events concerning medicine in this region. In the same month Nalobin delivered a speech in the panel discussion, which was part of the International Cybersecurity Congress, where he brought up a topic “The truth about fakes”, he stressed the threats of disinformation. ==See also== * Westminster Russia Forum *Digital Diplomacy *Ministry of Foreign Affaires of Russia == References  External links == *https://twitter.com/snalobin?lang=en Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Russian diplomats Category:20th-century Russian people Category:21st-century Russian people ","title":"Sergey Nalobin"},{"id":"56885673","text":"Gaius Calpetanus Rantius Sedatus was a Roman senator, who held a number of offices in the imperial service.

He married the Rashtrakuta princess Lakshmi. When the Kalyani Chalukya chief Tailapa II overthrew the Rashtrakutas, Bhillama transferred his allegiance to Chalukyas.

Related activities such as brothel keeping and solicitation are prohibited. UNAIDS estimate there to be 755 prostitutes on the islands, the majority are migrants from other Caribbean countries. They tend to move around the Caribbean, never staying in one territory for long. In 2011, prostitution was on the rise due to poor economic conditions. In the capital, St. John's, there is a red-light district in Popeshead Street. The most famous brothel in the street was Wendy's. It had operated for a number of years and was a household name on the island. In 2016 the owners were charged with trafficking. A 'rescue mission' raided the establishment in 2018, looking for trafficking victims. The nearby 'Jam Dung' was also raided. The NGO, 'Health, Hope and HIV Network', offers counselling and testing for HIV and other STIs to sex workers. Their motto is 'Creating Positive Change' and the organisation receives government funding. ==Sex trafficking== Sex trafficking is a problem in Antigua and Barbuda. Human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in Antigua and Barbuda, and traffickers exploit victims from Antigua and Barbuda abroad. Documented and undocumented immigrants from the Caribbean region, notably Jamaica, Guyana, and the Dominican Republic, are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Authorities reported an increased number of trafficking victims in multiple-destination trafficking, arriving in Antigua and Barbuda for a few months before their traffickers exploited them in other Caribbean countries such as St. Kitts and Nevis and Barbados. Sex trafficking occurs in bars, taverns, and brothels, including with minor girls. There are anecdotal reports of parents and caregivers subjecting children to sex trafficking. There have been reports of trafficking-related complicity by police officers who tend to receive administrative sanctions instead of being tried under the trafficking law. The Trafficking in Persons (Prevention) Act, 2010, which was amended in 2015 to vest jurisdiction for trafficking cases to the High Court of Justice, prohibits all forms of trafficking and prescribes punishments of 20 to 30 years imprisonment and fines of 400,000 to 600,000 Eastern Caribbean dollars. Experts noted the prosecutor's office had limited staff and resources and were concerned the police were not undertaking proactive raids to uncover sex trafficking cases. Between 2010 and 2015, a total of 43 women were reported to the Directorate of Gender Affairs as being trafficked.

Some of the households were large, and each included an average of three resident servants.Mitchell, Anne (1993), \\"The People of Calton Hill\\", Mercat Press, James Thin, Edinburgh, . Following the social changes after the First World War, up to half of the houses were turned into small private hotels, which in some cases lasted down to this century. Furthermore, from the 1930s, there were offices, including the Commissioner for Special Areas, followed by the Royal Observer Corps and the Scottish Home Office in numbers 13 and 14. Towards the end of the 20th century, the South Edinburgh School of Nursing was at 15, 16, and 17 (still indicated by a marble step with Carlton House in black lettersSchool of Nursing website entry for South Edinburgh School of Nursing 1974) and the Ingleby Gallery of modern art was at number 6. In 1934, the owner of number 13 asked the George Heriot Trust to change the title deeds in order to allow him to divide the property, the first attempt anywhere in the three terraces (Regent, Royal and Carlton) to create apartments. The case went to court and the application was refused. Subsequently, the demand for smaller units became irresistible and many of the houses were indeed converted into residential flats. Today the street is entirely residential with no offices or hotels. Only four or five townhouses remain, the other houses being typically divided floor by floor, or in some cases an upper house on top of a separate basement and garden flat. ==Carlton Terrace Mews== Carlton Terrace Mews in April 2017 Each Carlton Terrace townhouse was designed by Playfair to have its own stable mews, 19 units for 19 houses, located in a circle within the bend of the road. This was unlike Regent and Royal Terrace which only had 22 mews for 74 townhouses. The units were feued, house by house with the terrace in the 1830s, but may have been built later. Playfair stipulated the exact size of the mews before they were built. They were two-storey dwellings with horses and carriages below, and the coachmens' living accommodation above. During the early 20th century, the mews were converted into garages, and more recently some of the ground-floor garages have been turned into living accommodation. The mews have windows looking into the back street but not outwards towards the terrace. In the centre there is a shared garden, where an Anderson air-raid shelter was located during the Second World War. ==See also== *Regent, Royal and Carlton Terrace Garden *London Road Gardens *Calton Hill *Regent Terrace *Royal Terrace, Edinburgh *William Henry Playfair ==ReferencesBibliography== * Mitchell, Anne (1993), \\"The People of Calton Hill\\", pp. 99-112 (Chapter 5) Mercat Press, James Thin, Edinburgh, ==External Links== *Regent, Royal, and Carlton Terraces & Mews Association (RRCTMA) official website Category:Georgian architecture in Scotland Category:Streets in Edinburgh Category:Category A listed buildings in Edinburgh Category:Calton Hill Category:Listed houses in Scotland ","title":"Carlton Terrace, Edinburgh"},{"id":"56885762","text":"Lucile Berkeley Buchanan Jones (1884-1989) was the first Black woman to graduate from the University of Colorado Boulder. She graduated with a degree in German in 1918 and the Lucile Berkeley Buchanan Scholarship was created in her honor in April, 2010. Buchanan Jones is remembered for her \\"fierce independence, tenacity, and resolve\\". ==Early life== Lucy Berkeley Buchanan was born on June 13, 1884 to Sarah Lavina Bishop Buchanan and James Fenton Buchanan. Both of her parents had been born into slavery on Virginia plantations. Buchanan Jones claimed--and other evidence suggests--that Edmund Berkeley, the white slave owner of Sarah Bishop’s plantation, was Sarah Bishop’s father and Buchanan Jones’s grandfather. “Lucy” was the name of one of Edmund Berkeley’s white daughters. Her middle name “Berkeley” followed a Virginia tradition of naming a child for a parent or grandparent. Buchanan Jones later unofficially changed her name from Lucy to Lucile. Buchanan Jones’s parents married in November 1872 in Virginia. While still living in Virginia Sarah Bishop Buchanan gave birth to a daughter who died shortly after birth, and then to Hattie, Hannah, Laura, and her only son Fenton Mercer. The Buchanans moved to Denver, Colorado in May 1882. They were the first Black family to own property in the Barnum subdivision. However, they did not move to Barnum until between 1886 and 1888 because of a lack of water, roads, transportation, postal service, churches, physicians, and shops. The Buchanans constructed a five bedroom Queen Anne style house on the land which was still standing in 2018. Lucy Berkeley Buchanan was the Buchanans’ first child born in Colorado. Four more children were born in Colorado: Sadie, Edith, Nellie and Claribel. ==Education and career== Buchanan Jones graduated from Villa Park High School in June 1901. Following graduation she briefly worked as a substitute teacher at the high school, then for a publishing company and as a bookkeeper. Buchanan enrolled in a two-year teacher certification program at the now University of Northern Colorado in 1903 (then the Colorado State College for Education at Greeley). She was the only Black student in her 1905 graduating class and was the first Black student to earn a normal (teaching) degree there. After graduating from UNC Buchanan Jones unsuccessfully tried to get a teaching job in Colorado.She took a teaching job at Arkansas Baptist College in Little Rock. She applied for a teaching job in Denver in 1908 but again was unsuccessful. Buchanan Jones next taught at Langston High School, the only black high school in Hot Springs, Arkansas, between 1912 and 1915. The following year, Buchanan enrolled at the University of Chicago to study Greek, German, and English, where she studied for a year before pursuing a degree in German at the University of Colorado Boulder. Buchanan was fluent in German and read Latin. Buchanan Jones was the University of Colorado Boulder's first black female graduate in 1918. Although the classrooms at the University were integrated, school officials apparently did not want her to walk on stage to receive her diploma at the graduation ceremony in June 1918. A woman was sent to her while she was sitting and waiting for her name to be called and told her “I’ll be your partner, Lucy”, then handed Buchanan Jones her diploma and disappeared. Buchanan Jones never went onstage at her own graduation ceremony. She vowed never to return to the University of Colorado, and never did. She was not pictured in the university's yearbook in 1918, however she was pictured in a 1918 edition of \\"The Crisis,\\" an official magazine of the NAACP. The university posthumously honored her on May 10, 2018, when Polly E. Bugros McLean accepted a diploma on Buchanan's behalf. McLean, an associate professor of media studies at the university, wrote a book about Buchanan titled Remembering Lucile: A Virginia Family's Rise from Slavery and a Legacy Forged a Mile High, published in May 2018. In 1919 Buchanan Jones took a position teaching English at the all-black Lincoln High School in Kansas City. There she enjoyed attending baseball games and was one of the advisers for the local Junior Branch of the NAACP. She created the World News Club for her students to discuss international events. In 1925 she created the school’s first newspaper, the Observer. A student of hers who worked on the paper, Lucile Bluford, became one of the most highly recognized and respected journalists in Missouri as well as a leading voice in the civil rights movement. Buchanan Jones returned to Chicago in 1925 and obtained a teaching position at the Stephen A. Douglas School. She spent the next 24 years teaching in the Chicago Public School System. During that period she enhanced her teaching skills by taking classes at the University of Chicago and the University of Denver. She retired in 1949 at age 65, the mandatory retirement age for teachers. ==Marriage and personal life== Lucile Buchanan married John Dotha Jones in October 1926. Jones, who already had a degree from Columbia University and had enrolled in the graduate program at the University of Chicago, obtained employment at the US Postal Service. Their marriage eventually fell apart and Jones left without notice on December 1, 1935. Buchanan Jones filed for a divorce which was granted in April 1940 on the grounds of adultery, extreme and repeated cruelty, willful desertion, and habitual drunkenness. Nevertheless Buchanan Jones continued to use her married name “Mrs. Jones” 46 years after the divorce. The shoes that she wore for her wedding, made by the Louvre Boot Company in Kansas City, Missouri, are at the Museum of Boulder. With deep Baptist roots, Buchanan Jones became the first recording secretary of the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses. Buchanan Jones was a lifelong Republican, as were her parents and most blacks at the time. She cast her first vote for president in November 1920 and voted in 14 presidential elections. She felt strongly that voting and freedom were tied together. ==Later life and death== Following her retirement in 1949 Buchanan Jones returned to live in her family home in Denver with her brother Fenton. After Fenton passed away in 1963 a neighbor and friend of Fenton’s, Herman Dick, became her driver and personal assistant. Later in life Buchanan Jones’s eyesight and overall health deteriorated. In 1986 she was placed under the jurisdiction of the Colorado Department of Human Services, and on March 3 of that year, was physically restrained, removed from her home and taken to the Stovall Care Center. She would never return home again. She passed away on November 10, 1989 at age 105. She was initially buried in an unmarked grave. Fred Walsen, a history buff, read about Buchanan Jones’s burial the Rocky Mountain News and arranged to have her name added to her tombstone in 1998. ==References== Category:African-American people Category:1884 births Category:University of Colorado Boulder alumni Category:University of Northern Colorado alumni Category:People from Denver Category:1989 deaths Category:African-American centenarians Category:American centenarians Category:African-American educators Category:20th-century African-American women Category:Arkansas Baptist College Category:Women centenarians ","title":"Lucile Buchanan"},{"id":"56885810","text":"The 1995–96 Combined Counties Football League season was the 18th in the history of the Combined Counties Football League, a football competition in England.

He is known for being one of the core founders and contributors of the Puppetmastaz., as well as releasing a steady flow of collaborative and solo projects in his distinctive style of rhythm & poetry since his debut on Felix Kubin's Gagarin Records in 2001 == Life and career  Career === In 1999 Turner moved to Berlin and founded Puppetmastaz with his cousin Paul Pm, Chilly Gonzales and several others. They were joined by Taylor Savvy to form the short lived rap-quartet The Bench which featured on a Tommy Boy Records release among others. The album Lost Treasures furthermore features early collaborations between the above-mentioned Mc's and producers such as Patric Catani, Bomb20 and Nitro, all of whom are considered the artistic bedrock of the Puppetmastaz crew. Other artists that Turner collaborated with and who influenced him during these formative professional years in Berlin include Peaches and Gina V. D'Orio of Cobrakiller as well as Jamie Lidell with whom he collaborated on the Puppetmastaz single Scandalous. Since leaving Berlin Turner has drifted between musical styles while sticking to his signature lyrics, living a semi-nomadic lifestyle and touring extensively with periods of up to a 100 shows per annum. Working with Producer Marcus Rossknecht he founded the band Meteorites in Barcelona where he lived for a significant period and signed to Cristian Vogel's Rise Robots Rise Records. His first solo album The purple pro, produced in Stockholm, gained some underground recognition that garnered further momentum through a string of collaborative releases with producers such as SchneiderTM for Cityslang, Cristian Vogel for Novamute and Matias Aguayo's De Papel for Kompakt records. He has also contributed vocals to several releases by Japanese sound artist Kouhei Matsunaga on labels such as Important Records, Wordsound and Autechre's Skam label under the alternative moniker Google Premiere;. Another frequent collaborator and long time artistic ally is Canadian director and fellow lyricist Adam Traynor who was also a key figure in later years of the Puppetmastaz. In 2009 Turner left Europe to train in Carnatic singing in India, exploring the subcontinent and founding a live project called The Migrations with several collaborators which contributed to the Boarder movement in Colombo, Sri Lanka, while also performing in metropolitan hubs of India. Turner has worked as an arranger, producer and songwriter for several seasons of runway shows by Vivienne Westwood under the direction of Dominik Emrich. == Discography  Solo / group releases === * Cuckoo clock – Max Turner 2018 (7\\" Vinyl, Fun in the church) * Can you not hear the Music – The Migrations 2018 (7\\" Vinyl, Fun in the church) * Keep yo Animal – Puppetmastaz 2017 (Double 12\\" Vinyl, CD,Verycords / Shitkatapult) * Transform the waves – Meteorites 2014 (CD, Groovescript records) * The Break Up – Puppetmastaz 2009 (CD, Vinyl 12\\", Discograph) * Early reflections – Max Turner 2008 (CD, Metabooty) * Mephistopheles – Puppetmastaz 2008 (12\\" Vinyl, CD, Discograph) * The Takeover – Puppetmastaz 2008 (12\\" Vinyl, CD / Double Vinyl – Discograph) * Reservoir Foxxin / Scandalous – Puppetmastaz 2008 (12\\" Vinyl, Discograph) * Infinite 4x4 – Max Turner 2008 (7\\" Vinyl, Metabooty) * Oranges – Max Turner 2008 (7\\" Vinyl, Metabooty) * Reflections on liquid – Max Turner 2008 (CD, Metabooty) * Clones – Live in Berlin – Puppetmastaz 2007 (12\\" Vinyl, Vicious Circle) *Carousel of Souls – 2006 Various Artists (12\\" Vinyl, Rostron Records) *Creature Shock Radio – Puppetmastaz 2006 (12\\" Vinyl, Vicious Circle / Louisville) * Bigger the better – Puppetmastaz 2005 (12\\" Vinyl, CD Louisville, Vicious Circle) * Do the swamp – Puppetmastaz 2005 (7\\" Vinyl, Def drive) * The purple pro – Max Turner 2005 (CD, Metabooty) * Prosetti's Disco Balls – Puppetmastaz 2004 (12\\" Vinyl, PM01) * Creature Funk – Puppetmastaz 2003 (CD, 12\\" Vinyl, Virgin Labels / EMI) * Zoology – Puppetmastaz 2003 (CD, 12\\" Vinyl, Virgin Labels / EMI) * Dub the mighty dragon – Meteorites 2003 (CD, 12\\" Vinyl, Rise robots rise) records) * Milkman 7\\" – 2003 Meteorites (7\\" Vinyl, Rise robots rise records) * Radianations on the Rise – 2003 Supercollider (12\\" Vinyl, Rise robots rise Records) * Pet Sound – Puppetmastaz – 2002 (CD, 12\\" Vinyl, Virgin Labels / EMI) * Humans get all the credit – Puppetmastaz 2001 (CD/ 12\\" Vinyl, Newnoise records) * Matchbox Jump & Jeepbeats – 2001 (12\\" Vinyl, Gagarin records) === Features / collaborations === * Lost on Earth – Gebrüder Teichmann, 2018 (CD, 12\\" VinylNoland Recs.) * Yx yx aka 1ch aka solo – NHK, 2011 (Cd, Skam Records) * Self VA. – Kouhei Matsunaga, 2010 (Cd, Important Records) * Wear This World Out – Night of the Brain, 2007 (Cd, 12\\" Vinyl, Station 55 records) * Škoda Mluvit – SchneiderTM, 2006 (Cd, 12\\" Vinyl, Cityslang) * De Papel – Matias Aguayo, 2005 (Cd, 12\\" Vinyl Kompakt) * Station 55 – Cristian Vogel, 2005 (CD, 12\\" Vinyl, Novamute) * Voodoo Man Wear This World Out – Electronicat 2005 (Cd 12\\" Vinyl, Disko B) * Big c What's the Sp – Cristian Vogel 2004 (12\\" Vinyl, Mosquito recs.) * Special Gunpowder – DJ Rupture, 2004 (Cd, 12\\" Vinyl, Tigerbeat6) * Dem Nuh Know Me – DJ Rupture / Matt Shadetech, 2004 (12\\" Vinyl Shockout records) * Lost Treasures – Various artist, 2003 (Cd, Audio Chocolate) * Presidential suite – Chilly Gonzales, 2002 (CD, 12\\"Vinyl, Kitty yo) * Zoomer – SchneiderTM, 2002 (CD, 12\\" Vinyl, Cityslang) * Sick – Sneaker Pimps 2002 (CD, 12\\" Vinyl, Tommy Boy Records) * The third armpit – Cobrakiller, 2002 (Cd, Valve records) == References  External links == * * Max Turner at Discogs Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Hamburg ","title":"Max Turner (musician)"},{"id":"56885853","text":"Sam Moyer (born 1983, Chicago, Illinois) is an American artist living and working in Brooklyn, New York.

He sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1857 to 1865 as one of the two Members of Parliament (MPs) for Tipperary. Waldron married Anne White, daughter of Francis White. He had at least one son, Laurence Ambrose Waldron, who was an Irish Parliamentary Party MP for Dublin St Stephen's Green from 1904 to 1910. Waldron first stood for Parliament as a Whig at a by-election in Tipperary, caused by the expulsion of James Sadleir from the House of Commons. Unsuccessful on this occasion, he was elected as a Whig for the same seat just a month later at the 1857 general election, holding the seat — standing as a Liberal in 1859 — until he stood down in 1865. Upon the death of John Blake Dillon in 1866, he stood for the seat again, this time as an Independent Liberal, but was unsuccessful. He was also at some point a Deputy Lieutenant. ==References * Category:1811 births Category:1875 deaths Category:Irish Liberal Party MPs Category:UK MPs 1857–1859 Category:UK MPs 1859–1865 Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Tipperary constituencies (1801–1922) Category:Whig (British political party) MPs for Irish constituencies ","title":"Laurence Waldron"},{"id":"56885899","text":"This is the complete list of Asian Games medalists in sepak takraw from 1990 to 2018. ==MenCircle=== { -

The film stars Aleksandra Bortich, Irina Gorbacheva, Yevgeny Kulik and Roman Kurtsyn. The premiere of the film in Russia took place on March 8, 2018, the gross for the first day of the rental amounted to 1.9 million dollars - as of mid-March this was the best achievement among Russian films of 2018, and for the first four days - up to 5.8 million dollars, which brought the film to the ninth place of the weekly world ranking. ==Plot== The action takes place in Nizhny Novgorod. Anya Kulikova only loves food and her boyfriend - athlete Zhenya. But Zhenya is not pleased with Anya because she has put on a lot of weight and he decides to leave her. But Anya does not give up and sets a goal to get rid of excess weight. And Kolya Barabanov is there to help her, an overweight man obsessed with the healthy way of living. ==Cast== * Aleksandra Bortich as Anna \\"Anya\\" Kulikova * Irina Gorbacheva as Natalia \\"Natasha\\" * Yevgeny Kulik as Nikolai \\"Kolya\\" Barabanov * Roman Kurtsyn as Yevgeny \\"Zhenya \\", coach for swimming * Elena Valyushkina as Olga, Anya's mom * Mikhail Orlov as Semyon, friend of Olga * Sergey Shnurov as Sergey Kulikov, Anya's father * Anna Kotova as Diana, Sergey's wife * Alexander Ptashenchuk as Dimas, Natasha's husband, DJ * Valeria Dergileva as Christina * Andrey Trushin as fitness instructor * Oleg Kassin as Grisha, combine operator * Anna Ichetokina as laughing woman * Alena Ermolaeva as Alena ==Production== Aleksandra Bortich had to gain and lose 20 kg over the course of the making of the film. The authors of the film offered the main role to Irina Gorbacheva, but she more wanted to play the girlfriend of the main character. Producer Ilya Naishuller played a smoked guest at a party - for this, he spent the whole shooting day on the couch with a blurred look and a bong in his hands. Before starting work on the film, director Aleksey Nuzhnyy and screenwriter Nikolay Kulikov lost 28 and 20 kg, respectively. Work on the script went on for two and a half years. During this time, the authors interviewed a large number of girls and women who are concerned about the topic of losing weight, so that everything in the film is as truthful as possible. There were 17 draft scripts in total. ===Filming=== The filming period was divided into two blocks. In the first block - May and June 2017 - Aleksandra Bortich was shot in full. After that, there was a break when Aleksandra Bortich switched to strict nutrition and trained 7 days a week. For a month and a half she lost weight and filming resumed. Aleksandra Bortich herself performed many tricks in the film: she climbed from the balcony to the balcony on the eighth floor, jumped from the pier into the water at a temperature of less than 10 degrees, ran out of the burning bath in a burning sheet. ===Criticism=== According to film critic Anton Dolin (ru), despite the predictable plot, overkill with views of the city to pop music and the not very appropriate role of Sergey Shnurov, all the \\"shortcomings are fully paid for by the merits\\" of the film. == Release == The film was released in the Russian Federation by Universal Pictures International on March 8, 2018. ==Reception== The film received mostly positive reviews, acting of Bortich and the script received praise. === Box office === The fees for the first day of rental amounted to 110 million rubles - as of mid-March this is the best achievement among Russian films in 2018, and for the first four days - up to 331 million rubles ($5.8 million), which brought the film to the ninth place of the weekly world rating. By early August, total fees exceeded 630 million rubles ($10 million). ==ReferencesCategory:2010s sports comedy films Category:Russian sports comedy films Category:Russian films Category:Body image in popular culture Category:2010s feminist films Category:Films about obesity Category:Films set in Nizhny Novgorod Category:Russian romantic comedy films Category:2018 comedy films ","title":"I Am Losing Weight"},{"id":"56885952","text":"Joseph Layton Bishop Jr. (born 1932, Delta, Utah) is a retired administrator of colleges and other post-secondary educational institutions and a Latter-day Saint devotional and motivational author. His books include The Making of a Missionary and Peace be Unto Thy Soul. ==Early life and education== Bishop was born August 23, 1932, in Delta, Utah. He graduated from Delta High School in 1950 and served as a missionary for the LDS Church in Argentina. Bishop and Carolyn Callister married on June 28, 1956 and are the parents of five sons. Bishop earned a B.A. in Spanish in 1955 and an M.A. in Spanish in 1958, both from Brigham Young University (BYU). In 1958, Bishop earned a Ph.D. in university administration from Claremont Graduate School. In 1980 or 1981, Bishop was awarded an honorary doctorate of humanities from Weber State College (WSC), upon his retirement there. ==Career== From 1960 to 1961, Bishop was chairman of the Spanish department at Imperial Valley College. In 1961, he became president of the Haitian-American Institute, before becoming academic dean at Mt. San Jacinto College (1962-1966). Bishop later moved on to Prairie State College, where he served as vice president (1966-1968). From 1968-1972, Bishop was executive director of GT-70, an educational consortia made up of thirty U.S. colleges. In May 1972, Bishop was appointed president of WSC in Utah. Under Bishop's leadership, the Dee Events Center was inaugurated. Some on the WSC staff felt he was condescending in his attitude towards staff. The LDS Church assigned Bishop to serve as president of the Argentina Buenos Aires North Mission from 1978 to 1981. Bishop later served as president of the LDS Church's main site for training its missionaries, the Missionary Training Center (MTC) in Provo, Utah, from 1983 to 1986. After 1986, Bishop was executive director of the BYU-Public School Partnership, where he coordinated the interface between five school districts and BYU's college of education. After his retirement, Bishop and his wife, Carolyn, served as the LDS Church's area welfare agents for Central America, headquartered in Guatemala, 1994-1996. ==Works authored== Bishop has written articles for various academic publications while an educator. He also has authored \\"The Making of a Missionary\\" (1982) and other works for a Mormon audience. ==Defendant in lawsuit alleging sexual abuse== McKenna Denson, a woman alleged to have been sexually assaulted by Bishop in 1984, recorded an interview with him at a hotel conference room in Chandler, Arizona in December 2017, which was leaked to the public in March 2018. In the recording, Denson questions Bishop about their interactions in 1984 while he served as the president of the Provo MTC. In the recording, Bishop describes himself as a predator, a hypocrite, and a sex addict. After Denson spoke with BYU police in January 2018, the police interviewed Bishop. According to the BYU police department report, Bishop said he did not assault Denson; he asked Denson to show him her breasts during an encounter with her in his private preparation room, which she did. Local county prosecutor's office said it likely would have filed charges against Bishop based on Denson's allegations, however, the statute of limitations for rape in Utah in the 1980s was four years. In April 2018, Densen filed suit against Bishop and the LDS Church in federal court in Salt Lake City for redress concerning her mental, physical, and economic hardships as caused by the alleged sexual assault and battery, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud, fraudulent nondisclosure and fraudulent concealment. ==References *Joseph L.

The New Jersey Superior Court had subsumed and replaced county courts in 1983. The office of the county executive is in the Hudson County Courthouse in the county seat, Jersey City. The county executive is elected directly by the voters to a term of four years, which begins on January 1. At the 2010 United States Census, the county's population was 634,266.DP1 - Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data for Hudson County, New Jersey , United States Census Bureau. Accessed January 21, 2013. As of Election Day 2017 there were 348,366 registered voters in Hudson. There have been three elected and one appointed county executives since the establishment of the office in 1977, which replaced the county supervisor. The incumbent, Thomas A. DeGise, took office in 2002 and had been re-elected for 5 consecutive terms; he was again re-elected in 2019. ==History== Prior the creation of the office of executive, the Board of Chosen Freeholders chose a Director from among themselves. In 1972, the State of New Jersey passed the Optional County Charter Law, which provides for four different manners in which a county could be governed: by an executive, an administrator, a board president or a county supervisor. Hudson is one of the five of New Jersey's 21 counties with a popularly-elected county executive, the others being Atlantic, Bergen, Essex, and Mercer.Rinde, Meir. \\"Explainer: What’s a Freeholder?

Design by Ogden Codman. (Photo by Kevin Oldenburg for NPS). Louise Holmes Anthony Vanderbilt (September 4, 1854 – August 21, 1926) was an American heiress and socialite. Her philanthropist causes included educational opportunities and entertainments for the local community near her Hyde Park, New York home, the annual Thanksgiving dinner for the newsboys in Newport, Rhode Island, several New York City based charities, and the Anthony Home which she founded in 1913. ==Early life== Louise was born Louisa Holmes Anthony on September 4, 1854, probably in Brooklyn, New York.1855 New York State Census, Kings County, New York, Brooklyn City, Ward 13. She was the youngest daughter of Catherine (née Holmes) Anthony (1824–1882) and Charles Lee Anthony (d. 1874), both of whom were born in Rhode Island. Louise had two sisters, Rosalie DeWolf (1844–1929), who married William Post, and Catherine \\"Kate\\" Lee (1845–1907), who married Henry Anthon Heiser. Her father was a socially prominent and wealthy dry-goods merchant in New York City under the firm name of Anthony & Hall. Among her extended family members were nieces Rose Post Howard, who married Thomas H. Howard (a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant), and Margaret Van Alen Bruguiére, who married James Laurens Van Alen (a grandson of William Backhouse Astor Jr. and Caroline Schermerhorn Astor). ==Personal life== In 1868, Louise married Alfred Torrance (1852–1887), the son of Daniel Torrance and Sophia Johnson (née Vanderbilt) Torrance. His sisters were Adelaide Torrance, who married Meredith Howland, and Marie Torrance, who married John A. Hadden Jr. Alfred, a grandson of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, was a horseman of some reputation in London, Paris, and New York.\\"Alfred Torrance's Fate,\\" New York Times, April 15, 1887. She divorced Torrance in 1877.New York Times, April 17, 1887. The following year on December 17, 1878, Louise married Torrance's cousin Frederick William Vanderbilt (1856–1938), son of William Henry Vanderbilt and Maria Louisa Kissam Vanderbilt. Apparently wed in secret, the marriage was the subject of some gossip. The New-York Daily Tribune reported her father-in- law's displeasure upon hearing of the secret marriage, noting they were \\"debarred of the parental mansion and deprived of the parental blessing.\\"\\"A Social Sensation,\\" New-York Daily Tribune, February 18, 1879, 5:2. This reaction may have been overstated. Frederick's father later left the couple his home located at 459 Fifth Avenue. Louise died at the Hotel Ritz in Paris on August 21, 1926 following \\"a short illness caused by complications setting in from a slight throat infection.\\"\\"Mrs. F. Vanderbilt Dies in Paris Hotel,\\" New York Times, August 22, 1926. Frederick returned to the United States with Louise's body aboard the White Star Liner Homeric. A section of the baggage room on the lower deck was made into a chapel with wreaths, floral arrangements, and the spiral staircase leading to it draped with black.\\"F.W. Vanderbilt Here with Body of Wife,\\" New York Times, September 23, 1926. She was interred in the Vanderbilt family mausoleum at Moravian Cemetery on Staten Island. ===Residences=== Hyde Park, the Vanderbilt home in the Hudson Valley. Rough Point, the Vanderbilt home in Newport, Rhode Island During their marriage, which lasted nearly fifty years, Louise and Frederick made their New York City home at several locations. They also built \\"Rough Point\\" in Newport, Rhode Island, \\"Pine Tree Point\\" on Upper St. Regis Lake in the Adirondacks, and \\"Hyde Park\\" in Hyde Park, New York. In 1919, Louise purchased \\"Sonogee\\" at Bar Harbor, Maine. ===Legacy=== Record of Louise's generosity is consistently noted by those who knew her. Friends and employees remembered her as generous and kind. Her generosity toward the Village of Hyde Park is documented in oral interviews recorded by the National Park Service. Louise provided educational opportunities and entertainments for the young men and women of the village. She established a reading room, attached to St. James' Chapel, sponsored lectures at the Town Hall, established a young man's club room in the village, and brought the Red Cross to Hyde Park in 1911. In 1917, she was largely responsible for establishing the District Health Nurse in Hyde Park. During World War I, she joined wealthy neighbors to equip, clothe, and arm a Hyde Park Home Defense Company of sixty-five men. Employees reported that Louise knew almost every family in Hyde Park and through her agents often helped families in need, struggling with health or financial difficulties. She provided entertainments for village residents and their children, including ice cream festivals and, on at least one occasion, a steamer cruise on the Hudson River for all 700 residents of the village. She was known to distribute Christmas gifts to the children of Hyde Park.See Peggy Albee, Molly Berger, H. Eliot Foulds, Nina Gray, and Pamela Herrick, Vanderbilt Mansion: A Gilded-Age Country Place (National Park Service, 2008), 52-54. At Newport, she sponsored an annual Thanksgiving dinner for the newsboys and messenger boys from 1891 to 1925. Usually 350 to 400 boys attended the dinner, entering the hall to orchestra music. On occasion, Louise attended the dinner.\\"Dinner Given to Poor Boys. Mrs. F.W. Vanderbilt Makes a Happy Thanksgiving for Children,\\" New York Times, November 29, 1895.

It is a community of Thai Chinese who still maintain the traditional lifestyle similar to Talad Noi in Bangkok. Even though it is located less than 10 kilometers (6.21 mi) from Pattaya, where Pattaya is a world-class tourist destination filled with pubs, bars or liquor stores includes agogo bars and many Western tourists. It has been dubbed \\"Chinatown of the East\\". ==History== Chak Ngaeo has a long history of not less than 200 years. The geography of the community consists of plains surrounded by hills or rolling plains, swamps, canals, and the distance from the seashore is only 8–9 km (4.9–5.5 mi) away, so there are abundant soil, water and forest resources. Thailand's famous poet Sunthorn Phu (สุนทรภู่) wrote about Chak Ngaeo in his \\"Journey to Muang Klaeng\\" (นิราศเมืองแกลง) in the year of 1807 (the end of the reign of King Rama I in the early Rattanakosin) during a visit to his father in Muang Klaeng (now Amphoe Klaeng), Rayong province. When he arrived here in the nightfall and have called \\"Nong Cha Ngaeo\\" (หนองชะแง้ว; Cha Ngaeo Marsh). According to the above literature, it can be assumed that \\"Chak Ngaeo\\" originated \\"Cha Ngae\\" (ชะแง้) which means raising head to look, you must raise your head while looking because the community was located on low plains surrounded by hills. Another assumption is \\"Chak\\" means flood plains or scrub forests, maybe forests which re-grow after being cut, \\"Ngaeo\\" comes from \\"Ngew\\" (งิ้ว; cotton trees) because cotton trees can be widely seen in this area. In the before 1960s, not long ago. Chinese immigrants (mostly Teochew) who came to live in Thailand. They have settled here and have grown cassava roots. There are 13 tapioca flour mills. There are two cinemas, one of which has a chair with 1,000 seats, including there is a bus terminus. The famous singer of that era went from Bangkok for shows in here, such as Suraphol Sombatcharoen or Waiphot Phetsuphan. It is considered that the Chak Ngaeo is prosperous before Pattaya and resulting in a mixture of traditional Thai culture and Chinese culture. Later, Chak Ngaeo has stagnated when Pattaya has prospered respectively. People have migrated to new places. ==Presently== Currently, Chak Ngaeo has been promoted as a cultural attraction since 2012 by organization under the Office of the Prime Minister. It is surrounded by two storey traditional wooden shophouses with balconies in consecutive. The center of community is also the site of the Mazu Shrine or Chaomae Thapthim (เจ้าแม่ทับทิม) in Thai, the goddess of the sea, fishery and seafaring according to the belief of Chinese. It is respected by the people in the congregation as well as in neighbouring communities. Every Saturday from 3 pm until about 9 pm, locals will open the traditional market in the form of pedestrian mall. There are various products available, especially many rare foods both Thai and Chinese food. There is also Chak Ngaeo Rama, the original wooden cinema that remains to the present. Besides, not far from here there is also another old community Takian Tia (ตะเคียนเตี้ย), a community with a traditional Thai lifestyle. ==Festivals and celebrations== *30 Days before Chinese New Year Celebration *Birthday of Mazu Celebration *Mid-Autumn Festival *Ordination of Guan Yin Festival *The Communicate with Mazu and Portor Festival == References * category:Populated places in Chonburi Province category:Chinese-Thai culture category:Retail markets in Thailand ","title":"Chak Ngaeo"},{"id":"56886528","text":"William Green (9 October 1927 – 1996) was an English footballer, who played as a defender. ==Career== Green came up through the Wolverhampton Wanderers youth team, however did not make a senior appearance with the club.

Inghimasi (, \\"become immersed\\"), also called shahid (, \\"martyr\\") and istishhadi (, \\"martyrdom seeker\\"), are forlorn hope or suicide attack shock troops utilized by several jihadist Sunni Islamist militant groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), al-Qaeda, Tahrir al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra), Boko Haram, and al-Shabaab. ==Etymology== The word comes from the Arabic word Inghamasa (انغمس) meaning \\"to plunge\\" or \\"become immersed\\". == Definition == Inghimasi are usually well-trained guerrilla fighters who are organized into teams, and infiltrate enemy positions in order to cause as much damage as possible, generally expecting to be killed while doing so. They often wear explosive belts that are to be detonated when the possibility arises that they could be captured, run out of ammunition, or expect to be overwhelmed. Inghimasi fighters usually wear garbs and clothing resembling that of the target's forces to confuse the enemy's ranks, and use light weapons with the goal of inflicting the maximum amount of damage possible. Inghimasi have to agree to a 'no return' policy, and expect to die in combat. Unlike normal suicide attack forces, however, an Inghimasi can survive their missions and will return to their base until being assigned the next operation. ISIL gives new recruits the option of becoming an Inghimasi when enlisting along with the option of operating a SVBIED or being a regular fighter. ==History== Arabic media outlets first reported of Inghimasis in 2013 however its use on social media originates to 2011, the origin of the Inghimasi concept is attributed to al-Nusra. As the Inghimasi concept is attributed to al-Nusra founded as the Syrian branch of the Islamic State of Iraq in early 2012 this method of attack became prominent during the Syrian Civil War and eventually the 2014-2017 Iraqi Civil War but the usage of Inghimasi tactics have also been used during the Second Libyan Civil War. Notable uses of Inghimasi operations include the Battle of Al-Tabqa airbase, the Siege of al-Fu'ah and Kafriya, the 2016 Battle of Kirkuk, and various times during the 2012-2016 Battle of Aleppo such as during the Aleppo offensive in October and November 2016. The Inghimasi method of attack is not unique to the Middle East, and has been used in terrorist attacks outside the region. Al-Shabaab in Somalia is known to employ Inghimasis, and the Islamic State's branch in Afghanistan uses them as well. Furthermore, the individuals involved in the November 2015 Paris attacks operated in a similar fashion to Inghimasi. == Notable Inghimasi members and operations == * Hudhayfah al- Badri, son of ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, died in combat during an Inghimasi operation against the Syrian Army and Russian troops in Homs Governorate. * 2018 As-Suwayda attacks * A raid by four inghimasi fighters belonging to the Islamic State's West Africa Province against Diffa in Niger on 9 April 2019 during the Chad Basin campaign (2018–2019) * A Taliban attack upon Forward Operating Base Salerno in Khost on June 2012 was technically an inghimasi. ==References Works cited === * Category:Jihadism Category:Irregular units and formations ","title":"Inghimasi"},{"id":"56886678","text":"An Hae-sook (born 1961) is a female former South Korean international table tennis player. ==Table tennis career== She won a bronze medal in the women's doubles with Hwang Nam-sook at the 1981 World Table Tennis Championships and a silver medal in the Corbillon Cup (women's team event) for South Korea. ==See also== * List of table tennis players * List of World Table Tennis Championships medalists ==References== Category:South Korean female table tennis players Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Asian Games medalists in table tennis Category:Table tennis players at the 1982 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 1982 Asian Games Category:Asian Games silver medalists for South Korea Category:World Table Tennis Championships medalists ","title":"An Hae-sook"},{"id":"56886680","text":"The 2018 FINA Marathon Swim World Series, also known as the FINA/HOSA Marathon Swim World Series for sponsorship reasons, took place from 17 March to 9 November 2018.

Sabin (born 1974) is an American architect, designer and artist who draws upon biology and mathematics to design material structures. Sabin is the Arthur L. and Isabel B. Wiesenberger Professor of Architecture in the Department of Architecture at Cornell University. She focuses on design and emerging technologies, with particular emphasis on the areas of computational design, data visualization and digital fabrication. ==Career== Sabin completed both Bachelor of Fine Arts and Bachelor of Arts degrees at the University of Washington in 1998. After working by day (as director of admissions at the Seattle Art Museum) and by night (in the studio) for several years, Sabin returned to school, completing a Masters in Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania in 2005. As of 2005, Sabin became the principal investigator of the Jenny Sabin Studio in Philadelphia. As a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania in 2006, Sabin co-founded the Sabin+Jones LabStudio with Peter Lloyd Jones, a spatial biologist and pathologist. The studio focused on multi- disciplinary research and design, enabling architects, mathematicians, biologists and other scientists to apply ideas from biological systems to the ecological design of architecture. Using the organizational structures of cells as inspiration, Sabin designed networks of sheets, tubes, and larger forms based on simple mathematical rules, to explore the aggregation of parts in greater wholes. As of 2011, Sabin joined the Department of Architecture at Cornell University, and established the Sabin Design Lab at Cornell and the Jenny Sabin Studio in Ithaca. Sabin is the Arthur L. and Isabel B. Wiesenberger Professor and the Director of Graduate Studies in Architecture. Sabin is involved in expanding the degree program to offer a degree in Architectural Science with a focus on Matter Design Computation. “Digital ceramics” classes explore the generative fabrication of a wide variety of materials, and interest students from biology and biomedicine as well as architecture. Students use computers and 3D-printers to \\"sketch\\" their ideas, experimenting with powders for high-firing stoneware, and mixtures of powdered dry clay and organic materials. Students are faced with the experience of productive failure as they test their ideas. One student described it as “terrifying,” because of the “unforgiving nature of clay as a design material.” ==Works== In 2011, Sabin created the Greenhouse and Cabinet Of Future Fossils as part of The Greenhouse Projects at the American Philosophical Society Museum. The structure contained 110 removable and portable cold frames, required no electricity and was built of recyclable materials. In addition to edible and ornamental plants, the installation contained 3D-printed \\"artifacts\\" in its fossil cabinets. Sabin's hanging structure PolyMorph (2013), on permanent installation at the FRAC Centre in France, is made up of 1400 hollow ceramic modules held together with stainless steel cables. The completed piece weighs more than . Contra-molds and two-part plaster molds for each piece were 3D-printed, but the final ceramic pieces were individually slip-cast by two ceramicists, in a process that was \\"very slow and analog, and very much about the hand\\". Modules, molds and drawings from the process and design stages of the work were part of the exhibition A Tipping Point: Technology in Ceramics, at the Northern Clay Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 2016, Sabin created a polythread knitted textile pavilion for the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, as part of the Emergent sector of the “Beauty—Cooper Hewitt Design Triennial”. The temporary structure was lightweight, portable, and photoluminescent. Sabin's design was applauded by the Cooper Hewitt as being at the \\"forefront of a new direction for twenty-first-century architectural practice\\". On June 29, 2017, Sabin's immersive installation Lumen debuted at MoMA PS1 as part of the Young Architects Program. It was commissioned through the Museum of Modern Art and MoMA PS1 and developed by Sabin and members of the Sabin Design Lab at Cornell. The installation consists of a knitted canopy of cells and tubes that respond to changes in sunlight and heat. The knitted structures making up the installation were made of solar active yarns that absorb light during the day and release it at night. The installation includes a misting system to cool visitors. Sean Anderson, one of the international competition's jury, said that the “catalytic immersive environment … captured the jury’s attention for imaginatively merging public and private spaces”. In 2018, Sabin and collaborator Mariana Bertoni received a Frontiers of Engineering grant from the Grainger Foundation to explore the emergent design and fabrication of solar panels.

They were the first streamlined equipment operated in New England and acquired their name from the model trains that their design inspired. American Flyer railcars weighed about 55 tons and were built out of light-weight steel alloys such as Cor-Ten that made them about 15 tons lighter than earlier designs and allowed for the use of two-axle General Steel Castings trucks instead of the previously standard three-axle designs.Holland, p. 5 They were designed by Walter Dorwin Teague, and the first order for 50 coaches, with an 84 passenger capacity, was placed by the New Haven Railroad with Pullman-Standard in March 1934. Built at the former Osgood Bradley Car Company facility in Worcester, Massachusetts, these cars were delivered starting in December 1934, and were followed by 20 more in 1936 and 30 in 1938 in an identical configuration. In 1937 and 1938, 100 more coaches in a 92 passenger configuration for commuter service were delivered. In 1935, the Boston and Maine Railroad ordered ten 84-seat and twenty-one 98-seat coaches, followed in 1937 by twenty 92-seat coaches. The Bangor and Aroostook Railroad acquired nine cars of the American Flyer design in 1937 and 1938--four combination mail and baggage cars, three combination food service and coach cars, and two 84-seat coaches.Holland, p. 6Holland, p. 7 Outside New England, ten American Standard cars were purchased by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, ten by the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, ten by the Lehigh Valley Railroad, and four by the Kansas City Southern Railway.Holland, p. 8 Production ceased by the end of the 1930s. Two examples of the type, both New Haven Railroad coaches, were purchased by the Railroad Museum of New England for preservation. ==ReferencesNotes=Bibliography=== * Category:Pullman Company Category:Rail passenger cars of the United States ","title":"American Flyer (railcar)"},{"id":"56886747","text":"Foster Langsdorf (born December 14, 1995) is an American soccer player who currently plays for Reno 1868 in the USL Championship. == Career  Youth and college === Langsdorf played four years of college soccer for Stanford, winning three NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championships in the process.

He founded the shipping company D/S Norden in Copenhagen in 1861 and Helsingør Dockyard in Helsingør in 1882. He is also remembered for his charitable donations to the church, an orphanage and a school in his home town Nykøbing Mors. ==Early life and education== Holm was born in Nykøbing Mors, the illegitimate son of Maren Nielsdatter (1794–1854). His father is in the church records listed as servant Esper (Esben) Nielsen (1795–1880) but may have been a district bailiff (by- og hjerredsfoged) and justice councilor named Rummelhoff. Either way. Esper Nielsen ended up marrying a well-to-do widow of a farmer, leaving Maren Nielsdatter and her son in very poor circumstances. Mads Christian frequently had to go out begging to get food on the table. He assumed the surname Holm after his mother married ship carpenter Lars Christensen Holm (1812–53) in 1838. After completing an apprenticeship as a ship carpenter in Thisted, following in his step father's footsteps, he worked on shipwarfs in Aalborg and Helsingør. ==Years abroad== Holm enrolled on a barque bound for Boston. He then continued to San Francisco before, in 1854, founding a shipyard in Oakland, California, which specialized in revamping abandoned ships. He left it in the trust of his partner to return to Europe about one year later. His intention at that point was to return to America after visiting the exposition Universelle in Paris and his home country. ==Career in Denmark== D/S Norden's first ship, Norden Back in Denmark, Holm initially visited his home town Nykøbing Mors. After a while he ended up leasing a shipyard in Åbenrå in a business partnership with sea captain Bot Bendixen (1792–1861). In 1862 he moved to Copenhagen to study business at the Business College. In January 1871, he successfully invited interested investors to participate in a share subscription for a steam ship for tramp service, leading to the foundation of D/S Norden on 11 February 1871. Norden, an ironbuilt screw steamer with a load capacity of one thousand tons deadweight, was launched from Aitken & Mansel at Glasgow in February 1872. Holm headed the company until his death in 1892 and its fleet had by then grown to five ships. He established Helsingør Jernskibs- og Maskinbyggeri in Helsingør in 1882. Carl Frederik Tietgen had tried to obstruct the plans. ==Personal life and legacy== Holm had a relationship to a girl named Arlette Lund during his years in Aalborg. In 1851 it resulted in a son, Ferdinand Jorgen Peter Holm, but Arlette Lund's parents, who were wealthy restaurateurs, would not let their daughter marry him. Holm later wrote her many letters but she ended up marrying another man. After his return from America, in 1861, Holm married Emilie Bendixen (30 May 183? - 27 August 1914), a daughter of captain Boy Bendixen, his collaborator in Åbenrå. They lived in Nyhavn after moving to Copenhagen. He made several large donations to the church, a children's asylum and a new school in Nykøving Mors. The school is still named M. C. Holms Skole (\\"M. C. Holm's School\\") after him. The local Free Masons Lodge is also named Lodge No. 67 \\"M. C. Holm\\" after him. Holm died on 23 September 1892 from appendicitis. He is buried in Nykøbing Mors Cemetery. Peter de Nelly Brown took over the management of the company after Holm's death. The company's next new ship was named M.C. Holm in 1894. == References Further reading== * Fog, Henrik: Grosserer M. C.

The Laird Balgonie sits in the centre, surrounded by the first members of the Kensington Club. Above the fireplace is a cameo of St Andrews. The portrait is now in the care of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. The Kensington Club is a private all-male dining club for students of the University of St Andrews. Founded circa 1739 by Alexander the Laird Balgonie as a social club, the Kensington Club flourished predominately in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries as a retreat for aristocratic and moneyed members of the student population. Renewed interest in the club after a period of decline in the second part of the twentieth century has led to a surge in membership since the early 2000s. ==History== Alexander Leslie Laird Balgonie was born around the year 1720, the only son among five children. His father, also named Alexander, lived in the Balgonie Castle, a fortified manor of ancient origin over the bank of the river Leven, east of Glenrothes. The family's claim of descent from the Earls of Leven is disputed. The etymology of the name ‘The Kensington Club’ is unclear. The policies of the labour governments in the early twentieth century were felt with particular acuteness among the Scottish aristocracy, with their limited ability to generate income. Club fortunes took a downturn and membership began to tail off. With the exception of a brief resurgence in the nineteen seventies, the club remained almost dormant. With the turn of the century interest began once more to escalate, and the Kensington Club once again exists as a social institution within St Andrews. In 2001, in honour of this revival, Raymond, the present Laird of Balgonie, was given honorary membership and made the club patron. ==Controversy== In 2018, a series of articles in several newspapers and online publications called into question the legitimacy the majority of the club’s self-reported history, including the above description. The only references to the club’s history seem to have come from unverifiable, self-written publications. Inside sources are quoted as stating that the club was instead founded in the 1970s or more recently, instead of several centuries ago. Further statements claimed that the club’s recent publicity including its annual 'secret garden party' drove it to change its name from Kensington to Jodhpur. ==Activities== Private dinners for club members are held biweekly.

He is best known for coining the term universal design and for his work advocating for people with disabilities. == Early life and education == Ronald L. Mace was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, and grew up in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He was the youngest of 2 children. In 1950, at the age of nine, he contracted polio, which led to him spending a year in the hospital. After contracting polio, he used a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Mace studied architecture at the North Carolina State University's School of Design, where he encountered inaccessible facilities that limited his ability to use campus facilities. He graduated with a degree in architecture in 1966. == Architectural and design career == After his graduation, Mace worked for four years as an architect before becoming involved in advocacy for accessibility in building design. He was instrumental in North Carolina’s March 13, 1973, adoption of Chapter 11X, which was the first accessibility-focused building code to be adopted in the United States. This code served as a model for other states and was one of the foundations of the later movement to pass federal legislation prohibiting disability discrimination, including the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. He also worked on the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Mace was the president and registered agent of Barrier Free Environments, Inc., which was founded in 1974. It was a consulting firm focused on accessibility and universal design. He was also a Principal at BFE Architecture, P.A. In conjunction with his alma mater, North Carolina State University’s School of Design in Raleigh, he founded the Center for Accessible Housing in 1989. It later became the Center for Universal Design. This center, which received federal funding, became “a leading national and international resource for research and information on universal design in housing, products, and the built environment.” He was also a Research Professor in the Architecture Department at the School of Design. == Honors and awards == Mace was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. In 1992, Mace received the Distinguished Service Award of the President of the United States from President Bush “for promoting dignity, equality, independence, and employment of disabled people.” In 1996, Mace received a Presidential Citation from the American Institute of Architects. He also received the 1997 North Carolina State University Distinguished Alumni Award. == Personal life == Mace was married to Lockhart Follin-Mace, who served as the first Executive Director of the Governor’s Advocacy Council for Persons with Disabilities from its creation in 1979. Follin-Mace died in 1991 from cancer. Mace was survived by his nephew William H. Mace, III and his partner Joy Weeber. == Death == Ronald L.

This hypothesis was first proposed by Peter Ward and Israeli biologist Amotz Zahavi (1973). They stated that birds join assemblages in order to gain information about food resources and increase foraging efficiency. Using this strategy would allow unsuccessful birds to return to the population and gain information, often by observing behavioural differences in successful birds. Following the exchange of knowledge, the unsuccessful individuals then follow those deemed successful back to the resource location. The hypothesis has been studied and experimentally supported in many different types of communally roosting birds, notably crows and vultures. This strategy is regarded as evolutionarily adaptive, because it would prevent the unsuccessful bird from having to start the search for food over in a random method. By the early 1980s, the information centre hypothesis was widely accepted and used to explain communal roosting behaviour, however this popularity also led to substantial criticism. One criticism of the theory is the multiple assumptions required to fulfill the criteria to support the hypothesis. Another criticism of the theory is its narrow scope, as it pertains strictly to food information sharing. Additional criticism questions whether the information centre hypothesis is an evolutionarily stable strategy. __TOC__ == Theory == The information centre hypothesis was first described by Peter Ward and Amotz Zahavi in 1973. They theorized that communal roosts evolved and were maintained as a result of the advantage obtained by unsuccessful individuals in locating food resources from information provided by successful individuals. The information centre hypothesis requires that two conditions be met; first, that successful individuals return to the communal roost after feeding, and second, birds without the knowledge of the food source must recognize these individuals as successful and then follow them back to the food source. In their primary work, Ward and Zahavi studied red-billed quelea and cattle egret birds, noting that individuals who were unsuccessful in the morning would return to the communal roost and follow other birds away from the roost in the afternoon. Mock et al. (1988) provide seven requirements which must be fulfilled in a species for the information centre hypothesis to be supported. First, birds who are successful in foraging must return to rewarding locations. Second, while some individuals discover these rewarding locations, others remain unaware of these locations. Third, previously unsuccessful individuals must be able to recognize others as successful or unsuccessful. Fourth, unsuccessful individuals must leave the communal roost when the successful individuals leave the roost. Fifth, the previously unsuccessful individuals must follow the successful individuals to the feeding location. Sixth, previously unsuccessful individuals must be permitted to share the food source by successful individuals. Seventh, the overall net benefit of receiving information and following, must be greater than an individual searching for food on their own. While it may seem counterproductive for a successful individual to share resource knowledge, the information centre hypothesis argues that this behaviour is adaptive. The information centre hypothesis argues this behaviour is a defensive mechanism so that in the event of a sudden resource devaluation which destroys the food source, the bird would be able to obtain new resource information from other roosting individuals. This idea has been supported in studies which show that individuals in areas with a recent heavy snowfall searched longer for a communal roost compared to individuals in non-snowy areas. This is potentially so the bird would be able to upgrade their resource knowledge with others' information. Support for the information centre hypothesis includes the idea that individuals living in groups have more resource information available, at a lower cost than finding it themselves. In addition, multiple studies have made note that food sources for flock-living birds are typically consumed quickly by other predators, such as mammals or decomposers. Therefore, individuals likely do not suffer from sharing knowledge with conspecifics due to the short-lived nature of the resource. Currently, there is only speculation as to how the information is conveyed. It has been suggested that the successful members first convey their knowledge through displays and the unsuccessful members then follow, or that the unsuccessful members circle in the air or slowly fly out and proceed to join the successful members when they take off. Ward and Zahavi approached the explanation for the ICH in several different ways, but each explanation is related to the ability to distribute knowledge of resources. In this case, roosting can be divided into several components: advertisement, synchronized breeding, seasonality, mood, and predation. *Advertisement is simply defined as a behavior that attracts more members to a communal roost. This can either be through aerial displays, such as the zigzag and spiraling of cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis), being conspicuously colored in open places like the white wagtail (Motacilla alba), chirping loudly or acting very noisily in heavily foliaged locations that would be optimal for hiding such as various starling (family Sturnidae) species, or even general behavior like flying towards the roost as a large group – a large group of waders is extremely noticeable as they form a massive cloud several kilometers long. One possible explanation for how this behavior evolved is that advertisement is an advantageous behavior due to how it improves the searching capabilities of the roost by attracting more members, which then allows for more food site information that can be shared. *Synchronized breeding contributes to the ICH in that, as stated previously, more members contribute to a communal roost's ability to search for more food. The red billed quelea (Quelea quelea), for instance, breed synchronously, resulting in large groups of juveniles in the same age. The adult quelea leave the nest when their young are about three weeks old, meaning that the young must learn to communicate as a group, and eventually develop into a communal roost where food site information is exchanged efficiently. This is also made easier due to the large number of members in the group as a result of synchronized breeding. *Roost sizes tend to fluctuate seasonally, with species like the starling, white wagtail, chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs), brambling (Fringilla montifringilla), and the icterids (Icteridea family) forming large groups during the winter. This increased group size is believed to increase the ability to gain and distribute food knowledge as a result of an environmental situation that creates the greatest need for the members to search and share information. Similar to advertisement and synchronized breeding and to reiterate the role of ICH, this behavior also improves food searching capabilities and information exchange and may have been an advantageous behavior that evolved. *Ward and Zahavi stated that when members of the roost are in a “good mood,\\" they behave in a manner that shows other flock members that they are well fed and knowledgeable about food locations. This demonstrates to other members that there are energetic advantages to staying in this roost with members with good moods. In a sense, good mood would serve as a possible method of information transfer. Evolutionarily and with consideration of the ICH, it would be advantageous to have a behavior that maintains the information centre size and keeps members in the communal roost. How mood is displayed can vary with species. Starlings, grackles and queleas for instance chatter throughout the night after assembling in their roosts and chatter again before leaving the roost at dawn. Mood, however, does not seem to be well understood at the moment. *Ward and Zahavi also believed that the purpose of communal roosting was not for predation protection, although it seems that predation plays more of a role in the formation of the ICH. Although communal roosting has some predator defense roles such as better detection capabilities, it did not arise evolutionarily as a response to predation – in many cases, a large group of birds cannot do much against a predator. However, predators play a role in the density of assemblages, as high predation pressure can greatly space apart the roosting of species (some communal breeders can be forced to nest solitarily). Because food source knowledge is a factor of population, predation will weaken the ability to find food and spread knowledge. Thus, predation plays an evolutionary role in the distribution and formation of assemblages as information centres. Ward and Zahavi cited a variety of species that demonstrate behaviors supporting the ICH but no species exhibited all of the behaviors. Red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) exhibit synchronized breeding patterns, as well as have displays to attract birds to join the same nesting site. An observation Ward and Zahavi had done of red-billed queleas and the cattle egrets showed altered behavior after individually failing to find food in the morning and later in the afternoon. However, after resting in a secondary roost, these birds that failed joined other birds and flew off in a completely different direction. White wagtails and cattle egrets are two species proposed to demonstrate advertisement, with their coloring and pattern making them very noticeable and the two species often choosing open places for assemblages. There is also a large variety of finch species that have large, long-term roosting sites as well as large food searching areas. === Critiques of ICH === On an individual basis, there are not many benefits for aiding other unsuccessful and naïve or “clueless” members. For example, it is energetically costly for a successful forager to fly back to the roost and back again to the food source with more foragers. There may even be a risk of disease or parasitism with the clueless foragers accompanying the successful forager. It may be that the successful forager expects reciprocal altruism—where the unsuccessful members could provide food knowledge to the successful forager in the future—but given the size and mobility of roosts, this is unlikely to be the case. There are some questions about the applications of ICH before and after roost members fly out to search for food. It is possible that members that leave the roost at the same time will search for food independently afterwards. In fact, large group movement may be completely unrelated to food, and may be for protection from predators when flying to another location. Prior to flying out, it is difficult to determine how the transfer of information occurs. It may be that rather than at the roost, the transfer occurs locally at the food site. For instance, an individual may notice the large movement of members towards a specific location from afar.Mock, Douglas W., Timothy C. Lamey and Desmond B. A. Thompson. \\"Falsifiability and the Information Centre Hypothesis.\\" Ornis Scandinavica 19.3 (1988): 231-248. The ICH may also not apply to all species, as there are variations in hunting and scavenging behaviors. For instance, some piscivorous herons rely on stealth, which is the opposite of group feeding and movement. Several heron species are also highly territorial and do not allow for conspecific feeding. Some studies of gulls also show that colony members did not follow the knowledgeable gulls. In these cases, gull foraging behavior might be better explained by local transfer of information. == Examples == A Hooded Crow (Corvus cornix) === In hooded crows === The information centre hypothesis has been studied in hooded crows (Corvus cornix). Hooded crows exhibit communal roosting behaviour and often feed in flocks, making them a good candidate species for studies of the information centre hypothesis. A study conducted by Sonerud, Smedshaug, and Brathen (2001) examined the roost and feeding behaviours of 34 hooded crows over three years, with results supporting the information centre hypothesis. Sonerud et al. created an environment with unpredictable and ephemeral food sources, similar to the natural environment in which the crows live. The study differentiated between 'leader' crows who were knowledgeable about the food site from Day 1, as well as 'followers', who roosted overnight with leaders, and 'naive' crows who did not roost overnight with a leader or visit the food site on Day 1. Notably, they found that compared to naive individuals, follower crows which had not visited the food patch on Day 1 were significantly more likely to visit the patch on Day 2 if they roosted overnight with a leader crow familiar with the food patch, but only if the leader crow returned on Day 2 as well. This indicated that the crows who were unfamiliar with the food patch received information from the leader crows regarding their foraging success, and then followed them to the location the following day. This is supported when compared to the naive individuals who did not roost overnight with the leader, and had significantly lower levels of finding the food source on Day 2. === In vultures === A Griffon vulture landing Studies of the information centre hypothesis have been conducted using the Eurasian griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) as a test species, due to their communal roosts which may function primarily as information centres. In a study by Harel et al. (2017), movements and behaviour of approximately 200 Eurasian griffon vultures were recorded over a five-year period. This study categorized individual vultures as either 'uninformed', indicating they had no knowledge of a currently available food source, or 'informed', if they had either been at the food source or flown directly over it in the prior two days. Study results showed that uninformed vultures followed informed vultures to successful food sources and thereby gained access to these resources. In addition, a dyad composed of an informed and an uninformed vulture who departed the roost within two minutes of each other, spent a greater amount of airtime at a spatially closer distance than individuals who left the roost on their own, indicating a follow-the-leader relationship. Further studies have been conducted using other vulture species, such as black vultures (Coragyps atratus) and turkey vultures (Cathartes aura), with results both supporting and refuting the information centre hypothesis. For example, a study by Neil Buckley (1997), black vultures were observed to benefit from communal roosting because they located food by following knowledgeable conspecifics who had previously visited the carcass food source. In the same study, communal benefits as in the black vulture were not observed for the turkey vulture individuals. == Criticism == After its creation in 1973, the information centre hypothesis gained popularity, and with this popularity came criticism. The information centre hypothesis has faced criticism regarding its assumptions and views that the primary purpose of communal roosting is to share information regarding the location of food sources and for unsuccessful individuals to follow successful individuals back to the location. Mock et al., argue that there are other reasons for the communal roosting of birds, such as anti-predator strategies. Multiple studies have found that there was not one primary cause of communal roost development, but that other factors were equally important in the evolution of communal roosting behaviour. A further criticism states that the information centre hypothesis is not valid because it does not represent an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). According to Heinz Richner and Philipp Heeb (1995), the primary issue with the information centre hypothesis is the concept that a successful forager would return to the roost to help other, unsuccessful individuals. They argue that this issue cannot be solved without making assumptions regarding kin benefits, and thus the hypothesis cannot be confirmed to be true. In addition, they note that the information centre hypothesis, as it was originally proposed by Ward and Zahavi, requires the assumption that individuals fluctuate between being leaders and followers, and therefore relies on altruism between individuals. Other literature also criticizes this assumption made in the original hypothesis. Other studies have found that the information centre hypothesis lays a correct framework for the communal roosting of some species, but should be broadened to include aspects beyond resource knowledge sharing, such as information regarding mates and predators. A review paper by Bijleveld et al. (2009) suggests that broadening the hypothesis to include these other information sharing possibilities better explains the phenomenon of communal roosting. For example, Ward and Zahavi argued that a dramatic aerial display by a bird was an advertisement to others regarding their knowledge of a food source. However, there may be broader implications that the original ICH allows for, such as the advertisement acting as an individual signal of quality to increase the advertising individuals chance of obtaining a high quality mate. This example supports the broadening of the hypothesis on the basis that more information than just food resource location is being shared. == References == Category:Ethology ","title":"Information centre hypothesis"},{"id":"56887047","text":"Lee Da-in (born Kim Bo-ram on March 25, 1985) is a South Korean actress.

These miRNAs loci are enriched with epigenetic markers that display enhancer activity like histone H3K27ac, P300/CBP, and DNaseI high-sensitivity loci. These NamiRNAs are able to activate the related enhancers and co-work with them to up-regulate the expression of neighboring genes. NamiRNAs are able to promote global gene transcription by binding their targeted enhancers in whole genome level. Canonically, miRNAs silence gene expression through binding to the complementary sequences of their targeted mRNAs that are often located in the 3’UTR in the cytoplasm since the first miRNA lin-4 has been found by Ambros Victor. As so far, most studies of miRNAs have focused on those in the cytoplasm. Other than the classical theory that miRNAs down-regulate target genes by binding to the 3’UTR of mRNA, it has also been showed that miRNAs could upregulate gene expression in certain cases, just like RNAa phenomenon, which describes a picture that miRNAs can bind to the promoter of the target genes to facilitate gene transcriptions. Moreover, Vasudevan S. et. al held that miRNAs display a pattern of up-regulation on gene transcription together with AGO2 and FXR1. The discovery of NamiRNAs showcases a complementary regulatory mechanism of miRNAs, demonstrating their different roles in the nucleus and cytoplasm. ==Molecular mechanism== The classical theory of miRNAs is that genomic DNA first transcribes into pri-miRNAs. Next, pri-miRNAs were cleaved into pre-miRNAs by Drosha in the nucleus. Then, pre-miRNAs are transported into the cytoplasm via Exportin5, and are cut again by Dicer to form mature miRNAs. However, this theory cannot explain the distribution of miRNAs in the nucleus. One possible explanation is that miRNAs in cytoplasm can be carried back into the nucleus by some transport proteins. However, there is no direct evidence to support it. Another reasonable explanation is that pre-miRNAs could form mature miRNAs directly in the nucleus by Dicer cleavage. This is a simpler and more energy-efficient method. Yet, the molecular mechanism of NamiRNAs is still not fully understood. NamiRNA is overlapped within the enhancer regions and it is also activated when it positively regulates its corresponding enhancers. Thus, the crosstalk between NamiRNA and enhancer will further promote a series of genes transcription. We can say that NamiRNA and enhancer mutually affect each other to form a positive feedback network and together play regulatory functions on gene expression. ==Functions== NamiRNAs could interact with the corresponding enhancer, enhance the enrichment of active enhancer markers like H3K27ac and H3K4me1, and change chromatin status within the enhancer regions, thus promoting the cognate gene transcription at genome-wide scale. == Perspectives on the role == Traditional theory holds that miRNAs play inhibitory functions in the cytoplasm by binding the 3’ UTR of targeted mRNA and downregulate gene transcription. The discovery of NamiRNAs provides a brand-new idea that miRNAs can also play positive roles on gene expression in transcriptional level in the nucleus. To summarize, miRNAs have dual functions in gene regulation in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. That is, miRNAs play an inhibitory function in the cytoplasm and an activating function for the gene expression in the nucleus, respectively. Meanwhile, a functional network between NamiRNAs and enhancers is put forward to illustrate their roles for the positive regulation of their targeted gene transcription. NamiRNA enhancer target gene activation network demonstrates the new function of miRNA located in the nucleus. == References  Further reading == * Category:MicroRNA ","title":"NamiRNAs"},{"id":"56887214","text":"Janeil Engelstad is an American artist and curator. Her work focuses on the role of the arts and design in addressing social and environmental concerns. In addition to working independently, Engelstad produces projects through her organization Make Art with Purpose (MAP). == Projects  AMPL!FY === AMPL!FY grew from the national project Dialogues on Race, a project that Engelstad designed and produced through Make Art with Purpose. Participants including artists, graphic designers, activists, organizations and youth created billboards and posters on racial equality issues, which were then discussed in community forums. After the United States Presidential Election, 2016, Engelstad worked with graphic designer Mark Randall (2017 American Institute of Graphic Arts Gold Medalist) to change Dialogues on Race into a project that aimed to address political divisions in a productive way. Project partners of AMPL!FY included the Museum of Arts and Design, New York City Department of Transportation’s Art Program (NYC DOT) and Harlem Stage. Its goal is to create media content and promotion for grassroots organizations working on social and environmental issues. Operating in New York City in 2017 and 2018, AMPL!FY included posters designed by a graphic designer or artist working in partnership with a non-profit organization, installed in the Financial District in Manhattan and in Harlem, using NYC DOT's exhibition display cases. An accompanying exhibition at MAD included participatory public programs that aimed to \\"amplify\\" social and climate issues. Educational programs were also produced on site where students used the posters to discuss topics such as criminal justice reform, Islamophobia and disability rights, and discussions of the role of activist art in the political and social history of the United States. === Beyond Borders === As a visiting artist at the Center for Creative Connections, Dallas Museum of Art (DMA), Engelstad produced Beyond Borders, a project on the links between works of art, focusing on cultures and traditions that are little known or misunderstood. The project was launched at the time of Executive Order 13769 and Executive Order 13780, which affected on travel to the United States, as well as Executive Order 13767 which ordered a wall to be built on Mexico–United States border. Engelstad created a set of laminated cards featuring six works of art from the DMA's permanent collection. The front of each card includes an image of the selected work of art and a phrase that Engelstad wrote or found. Her interpretation of the work of art is on the back of each card. The set of cards, in Spanish and English, also includes a map of the three floors of this tour. Beyond Borders also included public programs for museum visitors. === Art and the environment in Eastern and Central Europe === Engelstad was guest producer of a special issue of the online edition of the MIT journal ARTMargins, on historical and contemporary environmental art in the former Eastern Bloc countries and their relationship to capitalism, globalization, climate change and the legacy of socialism. Participants included Nina Czlegledy, Maja and Reuben Fowkes, Tamás Kaszás, Marjetica Potrč and Rudolf Sikora. The project included interviews and other forms of interaction with artists and cultural producers concerned with the idea and the material reality of what goes by the name of the \\"natural environment.\\" === Voices From the Center === Voices From the Center was an oral history project on changes in Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary since the demolition of the Berlin Wall. The project stemmed from Engelstad’s experience as a Fulbright Scholar teaching at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design, Bratislava, Slovak Republic. Wanting to understand the impact of socialism on individuals and their outlook towards the USA, in relationship to her own experience growing up in the Western side of The Cold War, Engelstad had conversations with people about their lives before and after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Many of the participants, who ranged in age from 45–85, felt that despite the historical attention paid to life during Eastern bloc communism, the profundity of their experiences was being lost to history. Engelstad created Voices From the Center with the intention of including views on socialism in Central Europe from all of the Visegrad Group countries. The project also included contributions from young adults, who had been children when the wall came down, about their views of life in the post-communist era. People from both groups talked about what freedom meant to them and had the opportunity to express their dreams, fears and hopes for themselves, their country and the world. Material from Voices From the Center was exhibited in museums and galleries, public art, libraries, and public talks in Central Europe and the United States and on the project's website. === Peace Room / Make Room for Peace === Engelstad sent questionnaires to people in living in North America, Europe and the Middle East on their ideas about peace following the September 11 attacks. The material that was sent to Engelstad by the survey participants, including poetry, prose, images and music was collected into a book and was followed by design of a public space with furniture and tableware within the gallery. The exhibition space was used to discuss the many different definitions of peace and the tangibility of peace within individuals and groups. Peace Room / Make Room for Peace was published in the Chicago Tribune newspaper, where readers were asked to contribute their own vision of peace to be designed on their own peace plate. Families, school and church groups, individuals and pairs from the U.S. states of Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana sent in designs. A panel, consisting of Engelstad, a peace policy professional and editors from the Tribune selected the winning designs. === Peace Signs / Visualizing Violence === In partnership with Mark Randall of World Studio, Engelstad created and produced a multi-platform media art project called Peace Signs on youth gun violence in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., New York and Chicago. Each iteration of the project included workshops for high school and college students in design, media literacy and violence prevention. The material and events produced through Peace Signs included billboards, transit posters, exhibitions, public talks and a peace parade. === Identity/Identité === Produced in collaboration with Canadian artist Deborah Bennett in Montréal and Toronto, the year-long project Identity/Identité was on the relationship between language, cultural identity, and nationalism between the citizens of English and French speaking Canada. Work produced through this project was exhibited in galleries and libraries, and projected from storefronts in Toronto and Montréal. Project partners included Toronto Public Library, University of Toronto, Oboro Art Centre, and Concordia University. === Make Art with Purpose === In 2010 Engelstad founded Make Art with Purpose (MAP). Working in collaboration and across disciplines, MAP invites communities in the design and production of work to co-produce work on international social and environmental issues. == References  External links == * Homepage * Make Art with Purpose * Voices From The Center * The MAP Radio Hour, Engelstad's podcast Category:American curators Category:New York University alumni Category:University of Washington alumni Category:Artists from Seattle Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Janeil Engelstad"},{"id":"56887231","text":"Chloe Rollie (born 26 June 1995, Edinburgh) is a Scottish international rugby union footballer who currently plays as a full-back for Harlequins Women in the Premier 15s, as well as the Scottish national team. ==Background== Rollie was raised in Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders.

As mandated by the Commonwealth Games Charter, the proceedings of the ceremony combined the formal opening of the sporting event (including hoisting of the flags, parade of the athletes and welcome speeches) with an artistic performance to showcase the host nation's culture. The 2018 Games were formally opened by Charles, Prince of Wales. Jack Morton Worldwide was given the contract to produce the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. The theme of the opening ceremony was Hello Earth and directed by David Zolkwer. The ceremony began at 20:00 AEST and lasted almost three hours. It was watched by an estimated worldwide television of 1.5 billion. The principal sections of the artistic display represented Australia's Indigenous culture, Gold Coast's Surfers Paradise, wildlife and theme parks. A medley of Australian classics were played live by the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, Queensland Youth Orchestra and Gold Coast Youth Orchestra during the parade of nations. Popular Australian recording artists such as Christine Anu, Delta Goodrem, Katie Noonan and Ricki-Lee Coutler performed at the ceremony. The opening ceremony was seen as a tremendous success and worldwide praised. == Preparations == Three Australian companies: Specktak International, World Events, Dae Global and one American company Jack Morton Worldwide (JMW) submitted bids to the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Corporation (GOLDOC) to produce the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast. On 27 December 2015, the GOLDOC announced they chose Jack Morton Worldwide to produce the ceremonies of the games. This sparked a controversy as the head of all the three Australian Companies Ric Birch, head of Spectak, David Atkins, head of Dae Global and Julie Brooks, head of World Events questioned to GOLDOC that why an American company (JMW) was chosen for the production of ceremonies which was going to happen in Australia. Ric Birch, who co-ordinated the ceremonies of the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, called for a review of the decision to overlook three Australian companies to present the ceremonies at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast. GOLDOC's head of communications Marcus Taylor said that JMW is an international company which have been working in Australia since 1983 and have a range of experiences in producing the ceremonies of events as they have previously done for 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. On 22 November 2017, the GOLDOC revealed some of the key artistic personnel working on the ceremonies of the games. The creative team for the opening and closing ceremonies consisted of a roster of renowned individuals. Leading the ceremonies team as Artistic Director and Project Director was David Zolkwer, Head of Jack Morton Worldwide Public Events. David previously led the teams for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Australian singer Katie Noonan, winner of five ARIA music awards and former lead singer of Brisbane based band George, was given the role of the Music Director of the ceremonies. Katie said \\"I'm a fiercely proud Queensland musician; I think we make some of the best music in the world and indeed some of the best art in the world. There's some truly world class dance and music being made here, so it's a good time to focus on our (cultural) identity and realise that we're really good at what we do.\\" She has served as the Artistic Director of the Queensland Music Festival since 2015. Nathan M. Wright served as the Head of Choreography and Staging Director for the opening ceremony. Nathan is a highly respected choreographer and performer who has worked on large-scale events extensively, including choreography for the opening and closing ceremonies of both the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in London and the opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The role of Executive Producer for the ceremonies was given to Merryn Hughes. Merryn has also served as the Executive Producer for the ceremonies of the 2015 Pacific Games in Papua New Guinea and the closing ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. ==Dignitaries in attendanceProceedings Countdown === The opening ceremony started with a countdown from 65000 years quickly to 10–1 seconds. When the countdown is finished, a very large firework exploded in the middle of the ground of the Carrara Stadium. === Hello Earth === Australian Actor Jack Thompson spoke about the history of Earth along with holding an illuminated globe. When he finished his narration, he then placed the globe in the ground which was covered with beach sand. The image of earth was projected on the ground showcasing the movement of winds, oceans, wind currents and large mass of land. A group of girls stood at the image projection of land and raised their right hands. The large mass of land immediately separated into seven continents. After the separation of land masses, a white humpback whale \\"Migaloo\\" was shown swimming across the oceans and diving into the land of Australia. === Four Winds === World-renowned didgeridoo player William Barton played his instrument at the top of the Q1 tower. Hip-hop artist Mau Power from Thursday Island in the Torres Strait and Australian singer Christine Anu sang the song \\"My Island Home\\" along with Four Winds Didgeridoo Orchestra. A group of dancers holding small glowing spheres danced along with the song. When the song finished, the dancers immediately stood adjacent to each other forming the shape of Australian land boundary. Christine Anu sang the same song at the closing ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics and in the opening ceremonies of the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney. === Welcome of dignitaries === Charles, Prince of Wales, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, President of the Commonwealth Games Federation Louise Martin, Chairman of GOLDOC Peter Beattie and President of Commonwealth Games Australia Sam Coffa entered the stadium and welcomed with a huge applause by the audience. Australia's National Flag along the Australian Aboriginal Flag and the Torres Strait Islander Flag were hoisted in the stadium and Australian national anthem \\"Advance Australia Fair\\" was sung in an unusual way. While the anthem was sung, the image of the Australian coat of arms symbol was projected on the sand stadium's ground. === Totem ceremony === After the history of Earth segment, the traditional totem ceremony was showcased. This part of the ceremony represented the moment of reconnecting and regeneration. It showcased a ritual in which the ceremonial knowledge of the totemic system was passed down from past ancestors and elders, through present elders, to the future elders. Performers from the Bangarra Dance Theatre and performers from the Bangarra's \\"Rekindling\\" programme performed a dance with shields. Rekindling is an intensive dance-based education program for Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander secondary students. After the dance performance, a large firework exploded in the middle of the stadium's ground. === Surfer’s Paradise === After the Totem ceremony segment, the Surfers Paradise scene was shown. A group of people wearing swimsuits gathered into the stadium along with props such as umbrellas, deck chairs, and beach towels. The image of the scenery of beach was projected onto the stadium's ground. Australian singer Ricki-Lee Coulter performed the song \\"Technicolor Love\\" and the people wearing swimsuits danced on the song. ===Parade of Nations=== Following tradition, the host of the previous games, Scotland entered first, followed by the rest of the European countries competing. Following this, all countries paraded in alphabetical order from their respective regions. After the European countries entered, countries from Africa, the Americas, Asia, the Caribbean, and lastly Oceania marched in. The host nation of Australia entered last. The Parade of Nations track, designed by Cairns based Torres Strait Islander visual artist Brian Robinson, was a specially commissioned artwork drawing on indigenous and local culture and mythology, featuring stars, surfboards, sea animals and shells. The young Surf Lifesavers of Australia, popularly called as the \\"Nippers\\", escorted the athletes carrying a surfboard bearing the country name. The image of each nation's flag was projected on the ground of the stadium. Kylie Minogue's famous song \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\", was played at the arrival of England into the stadium. Sia's song \\"Chandelier\\" was played at the arrival of New Zealand team. After the parade of Commonwealth Nations, Australian singer Katie Noonan sang \\"You’re Welcome Here\\" with playing a piano backed by the Gold Coast Choir. She was also the musical director of the opening and closing ceremonies of the games. === Smoking ceremony === Contemporary aboriginal artist Luther Cora performed a traditional smoking ceremony with his family. The smoking ceremony is an ancient and enduring custom still practiced widely among many Indigenous Australians. It involved burning various native plants to produce smoke. It was mentioned in The Guardian that the meaning of the ceremony was to cleanse oneself by bathing in the smoke and connect with each other and with the land. It was also about connecting with good spirits. === Hoisting of the CGF flag === The Commonwealth Games flag was brought into the stadium by six athletes namely Dominican high jumper Brendan Williams, South African para swimmer Natalie Du Toit (para-sport representative), New Zealand professional racing cyclist Alison Shanks, Canadian high jumper Nicole Forrester, retired Scottish rugby union player Colin Gregor and Scottish women's hockey player Rhona Toft. The six athletes were also appointed to the CGF Athlete Advisory Commission on 3 April 2018. Australian singer John Farnham's song \\"You're the Voice\\" was played when the athletes entered into the stadium with the flag. John Farnham performed the same song at the closing ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. === Oath === Australian lawn bowls athlete Karen Murphy took the athlete's oath, while Australian netball coach Lisa Alexander took the coaches oath and athletics official Desmond Johnston took the officials oath. === Speeches === Chairman of GOLDOC The Hon. Peter Beattie AC gave a speech about the games and welcomed the athletes. After him, President of the CGF Dame Louise Martin gave a speech about the games. She started her speech by telling about her own experiences when she was an athlete representing Scotland at the 1962 Commonwealth Games in Perth. She also stated that the 2018 Commonwealth Games were the first International Multi Sport Event to have equal medal opportunities for both men and women and the first Games to include a Reconciliation Action Plan, respecting and recognising the first nation peoples of the entire Commonwealth. Further she added that the games were the largest fully inclusive para-sport medal events programme ever at a Commonwealth Games; the largest at any international sports event. === Queen's Baton and opening of the games === The Queen's baton, which contained the message letter written by Queen Elizabeth II at the Buckingham Palace in London, was brought into the stadium in the kombi van by Australian former swimmer Susie O’Neill AM. She then went to the centre of the stadium. Images and videos of popular Gold Coast attractions were projected on the ground of the stadium such as feeding lorikeets, skydiving, dreaming in the ocean, walking in the treetops, and riding the rollercoaster. After that, she handed over the baton to Australian former cyclist Brad McGee OAM, who took it to Australian wheelchair racer Kurt Fearnley AO. Kurt after parading it around the stadium, handed over to Australian netballer Liz Ellis AO, who then took it to Australian hockey player Brent Livermore OAM. Finally, Brent handed the baton over to Australian hurdler Sally Pearson OAM. She received a large applause from the audience as she lives in Gold Coast. She went to the dais along with the baton and hand it over to Louise Martin. Louise removed the Queen's message from the baton and handed to HRH Prince Charles. Charles read out the message and declared the competition officially open. === In the end === Australian singer-songwriter Delta Goodrem performed her song \\"Welcome to Earth\\". After her performance, a large number of people gathered at the stadium and Sigur-Rossy music was played. A large white whale Migaloo shaped balloon was brought into the stadium. Images of Antarctica and the Great Barrier Reef were projected on the whale shaped balloon. The artwork was designed by Delvene Cockatoo-Collins, the artist who also designed the medals for the Games. Australian singer Ruel sang his song \\"Golden Years\\" and fireworks exploded on the roof of the stadium. Delta Goodrem's \\"Together We Are One\\" remix version single was played after Ruel's performance and a large number of fireworks exploded on the roof of the Carrara stadium and also near The Star Gold Coast hotel. == Music == The opening ceremony of the 2018 Commonwealth Games was featured with the performances of singers, orchestras and songs of Australia in order to give an exposure of Australian music around the world and to showcase the culture of Australia. In the Four Winds segment, Australian singer Christine Anu and Torres Strait rapper Mau Power covered the song \\"My Island Home\\" which was one of the hit songs in Australia in 1995. Australian pop singer Ricki Lee Coutler sang \\"Technicolor Love\\" during the Surfer's Paradise segment in order to showcase the fun thriving beach life of Gold Coast. During the parade of nations, an orchestral medley of Australian classics were played by the members of the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, Queensland Youth Orchestra and Gold Coast Youth Orchestra which were led by conductor John Foreman.

The West Australian said that the \\"Spirits gone high\\" in the Gold Coast after the opening ceremony. The SBS called the ceremony as \\"dazzling\\" and the ABC said that the opening ceremony had \\"signaled great start for the 2018 Commonwealth Games\\". Foreign reaction was overwhelmingly positive. The BBC said the 2018 Commonwealth Games started with a \\"colorful\\" and \\"spectacular\\" opening ceremony. The London Evening Standard said the games began with a \\"spectacular opening ceremony paying tribute to region's Aboriginal history.\\" The Daily Telegraph reported \\"Gold Coast Commonwealth Games began with every symbol of Australiana\\".

As it was raining for few minutes at the beginning of the opening ceremony, the Toronto Star noticed and commented \\"Commonwealth Games begin after rain drenches spectators at Gold Coast opening ceremony\\". == Technical aspects == Norwest productions was the official audio supplier for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games.

She is a member of the Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP) and sits with the Liberal Party in federal parliament. She was appointed to the Senate after the retirement of George Brandis. ==Early life and education== Stoker grew up on the outer-southern suburbs of Sydney in Campbelltown to working-class parents. In her first speech she explained \\"My dad is a plumber, drainer, gas fitter. He had his own small business. My mum worked in a shop as a retail assistant.\\" She completed her HSC at Hurlstone Agricultural High School before studying arts and law at Sydney University, graduating with first-class honours. ==Legal career== Stoker began her career as a clerk and solicitor in Brisbane with Minter Ellison. She went on to serve as a Commonwealth prosecutor, as well as a judge's associate to Philip McMurdo in the Supreme Court of Queensland and to Ian Callinan in the High Court of Australia. Prior to her appointment to the Senate, Stoker was a member of Level 27 Chambers and a sessional academic at Central Queensland University. She was Vice-President of the Women Lawyers Association of Queensland from 2016 to 2018. A member of the Samuel Griffith Society, she is known to have an interest in federalism, federal law and the Australian Constitution. From 2014 to 2018, Stoker was a director at the non- profit, Brisbane-based conservative 'think tank', the Australian Institute for Progress (AIP). According to the Executive Director, the AIP is 'ideologically centre-right', with its criticisms favouring right-wing political parties. During her time there, the AIP was a critic of anti-mining advocacy groups holding charitable status and hosted a visit to Brisbane by climate science denier Patrick Moore. Also during Stoker's time, they opposed tobacco plain packaging and criticised the World Health Organisation's proposed international convention on tobacco. ==Political career== Leading up to the 2009 Queensland state election, Stoker sought pre-selection for the electoral district of Cleveland, which she lost to Mark Robinson who went on to win the seat. She was an unsuccessful LNP Senate candidate at the 2013 federal election. On 10 March 2018, the Queensland LNP chose Stoker to succeed high- profile cabinet member George Brandis as a Senator for Queensland. Endorsed by the LNP State Executive Council, she did not face a vote by rank-and-file members. Prior to Stoker's selection all federal LNP senators were men. The Australian reported that LNP members were threatening to push for gender quotas if the party did not preselect a woman, and the Daily Mercury reported that LNP sources had said Stoker was one of the standouts as she was based in Brisbane and would also increase the LNP's percentage of females. But the LNP president denied gender was a motive saying Stoker was chosen on merit. The Parliament of Queensland appointed Stoker to the casual vacancy left by Brandis on 21 March 2018 and she was sworn in as a Senator the following day. As an appointed Senator, she will face her first election in 2022. In 2020, The Australian named Stoker a \\"free speech champion and rising star of conservative politics\\". She is part of the Liberal Party's conservative faction and is aligned with the LNP's christian right. ===Political positions=== Stoker is a self-described \\"proud conservative\\" Christian who believes Christian values are \\"under attack\\". Her political heroes are former prime minister John Howard and former UK leader Margaret Thatcher. In 2019, Crikey reported that she is a socially and fiscally conservative who had positioned herself as a conservative champion of free speech and religious freedom. She claims conservatives are \\"misunderstood\\". In Senate Estimates, Stoker has complained that the use of the term \\"right-wing extremism\\" by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) is offensive to conservatives. This came after ASIO chief Mike Burgess used the term in the context of combatting terrorism. Labor Senator Murray Watt suggested Stoker was sensitive to the term due her attendance at the Conservative Political Action Conference, a suggestion she denies. Stoker has been a speaker at this and other centre-right pro-liberty events. Stoker is an outspoken Christian. She has spoken out against abortion and opposes the introduction of voluntary euthanasia legislation. Stoker has also spoken out against transgender activism, has said sexuality is a \\"choice\\", and has stated that her political opponents prioritise the human rights of the LGBTIQ community over the \\"rights to freedom of conscience, religion and speech\\". As a Senator, Stoker launched a petition against an alleged transgender activist agenda. In 2018, Stoker opposed a proposed bill to remove an exemption in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 that allows religious schools to discriminate against students on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity. In articulating her opposition to the proposal, she expressed concern that children may want \\"to run a gay club within the school.\\" On the other hand, Stoker is a proponent for the introduction of a 'religious discrimination bill'. Stoker advocates for the repeal of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. In 2018 she said: \\"I think 18C has got to go. I think 18C is a drag on our society.\\" The Opposition responded by saying this would \\"water down protections against racist hate speech.\\" Stoker has said she disapproves of women in politics \\"playing the gender card\\", and has implied that women with children were \\"baggage\\" from an employer's perspective. She has pushed for nannies to be tax-deductible. Stoker blames unions for the casualisation of workplaces, and argues against raising minimum wages and penalty rates because doing so would \\"reduce job opportunities for those most in need\\". She has also described unfair dismissal laws as a \\"block to growth\\". Stoker supports the development of an Australian nuclear energy industry. Stoker opposed the Government ban on the personal import of liquid nicotine used for vaping. While most media reporting covers Stoker's socially conservative views on gender and religious freedom, The Catholic Leader also reported that in her first speech she had made the 'brave observation' that \\"Australians don’t trust politicians. In fact, Australians are losing faith across the four sectors of the economy – government, media, corporate and non-government organisations.\\" ===Controversies=== In June 2020 during a televised interview on Sky News, Stoker criticised Queensland's decision to close its borders during the COVID-19 pandemic saying that Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk \\"knows she is absolutely choking our economy by having these borders shut – she is the knee on the throat of businesses of Queensland, stopping them from breathing\\". Indigenous Labor Senator Malarndirri McCarthy labelled the comments as \\"abhorrent and insensitive\\" for apparently invoking a reference to the killing of George Floyd. Stoker's spokesman had initially said she would not be backing away from her comments, but a day later Stoker apologised to anyone genuinely hurt or offended saying it was not intentional nor premeditated. The Courier-Mail reported that in 2019–2020 Stoker had been using a second and pseudonym social media account on her official Facebook site to defend and argue the Senator's political views on topics including race, family law and religious freedom. Stoker's 'Mandy Jane' profile had referred to Stoker in the third person and had changed the use of pronouns so as to appear as a different person. The Mandy Jane profile photo is that of a storybook character. Stoker's spokesman said the Mandy Jane account was her personal profile but denied she should have disclosed that information before posting on the Senator's official page. ==Personal life== Stoker married husband Adam in 2005 and they have three daughters. She is a Christian and attends an Anglican church in inner city Brisbane. Stoker was born in the Sydney suburb of Liverpool to Mark and Cornelia Ingrid Fell. Her father was born in Australia and her mother in Sweden. She lives with her family in Auchenflower, a suburb of Brisbane. ==References== Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Liberal National Party of Queensland members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Liberal Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Queensland Category:Women members of the Australian Senate Category:21st-century Australian politicians Category:Australian barristers Category:University of Sydney alumni Category:Sydney Law School alumni Category:Griffith University alumni Category:Australian people of German descent ","title":"Amanda Stoker"},{"id":"56887520","text":"Bhillama may refer to any of the following rulers of the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty of India: * Bhillama II (r. c. 985-1005 CE) * Bhillama V (r. c. 1175-1191 CE) ","title":"Bhillama"},{"id":"56887536","text":"Panighatta, or Panighata (English translation: Water mill), is a Tea Estate village on the banks of Balason River and the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains.

It is led by twin brothers, songwriters, singers, and guitarists Amiri and Rahiem Taylor, and backed by Patrick Jones (drums), Josh Lugo (bass), and Justin Jagbir (keyboards). The band has released one self- titled EP. ==History== Around 2013, identical twin brothers Amiri and Rahiem Taylor met Patrick \\"Sticks\\" Jones at an open mic at a Sam Ash Music store in Brooklyn, New York City. All recent high-school graduates, the trio formed Blac Rabbit—they say the name Black Rabbit was already taken. The Taylors are known for covering the Beatles on the New York City Subway, and they left supermarket jobs and put off college to pursue music full-time. Bassist and occasional guitarist Josh Lugo joined later. The band is based in Rockaway Beach, Queens, New York City. It is represented by Jules Urbanski of the APA . Blac Rabbit digitally released the song \\"All Good\\" as a single in June 2016. The song was later included on their six-track debut extended play (EP), self- titled Blac Rabbit, which How Far Music released digitally on December 22, 2017. A CD later became available on Bandcamp. The EP was recorded in the Taylors' and their manager's houses and mixed by Rahiem. As critic Olivia D'Orazio writes, \\"Hazy guitar riffs and rumbling bass are steadfast throughout the EP, and the echoey vocals whisk you from one song to another.\\" A recording of the Taylors playing the Beatles' \\"Eight Days a Week\\" received 3 million views on Twitter and 14 million on Facebook in February 2018. The viral online recognition increased the number of the band's Twitter followers from around 500 to 16,700 in two days. The band had to update its website due to traffic spurred by the 48-second video. With more exposure, the band could perform outside the subway with bookings in music venues, eventually playing festivals in Berlin and Guatemala as well as New York City's Bowery Ballroom and the Knitting Factory. They also covered the Beatles' \\"Michelle\\" for a Gucci advertisement featuring Harry Styles. From June 15 to July 3, 2018, the band went on a 16-date tour of the East Coast. On early tour dates far from New York City, Rahiem later recalled, some audiences who had only seen the Taylors' Ellen appearance thought they were a cover band and asked for Beatles tunes, which they did sometimes use to end sets. Amiri said their toughest crowd was in Montreal, where the audience had put on a \\"game face\\". On September 13, Blac Rabbit was the musical act at an event to promote the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus in New York City recreating the 1969 Bed-In For Peace. The band performed \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" alongside speakers including Yoko Ono, Ringo Starr, actor Jeff Bridges, and New York mayor Bill de Blasio; \\"it was so surreal in person,\\" Amiri said. The Seize the Day Tour, Blac Rabbit's second concert tour of 2018, ran October 23 to November 10. It was followed by a tour of Europe and the United Kingdom, ending on December 3 at the Beatles Story and The Cavern Club in Liverpool. Summarizing their ascent from busking in the subway and \\"playing for audience of barely anyone\\" to booking larger venues and festivals, Amiri said: \\"I was scared ... All of that happened in one rush and it was just overnight.\\" The Taylors have announced a new Blac Rabbit record, titled Interstella. Its first single, \\"Seize the Day\\", was released on November 21, 2018, followed by \\"Windy Cities\\" on May 10, 2019. Justin Jagbir, a keyboardist, joined the band before the release of Intersella, and played during the Interstella Tour of North America, from April 2 to May 18. On the day of the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020, Blac Rabbit played Beatles covers at Charles Finch and Chanel's pre-Oscar party at the Polo Lounge in Beverly Hills. ==Musical style== The Taylors describe their original music as psychedelic rock, influenced by the Beatles, Radiohead, 1980s music, and contemporaries MGMT, Tame Impala, and Toro y Moi. Rahiem has said: \\"We just want to make wholesome, melodic, digestible but also very intelligent, deep, thought-provoking music,\\" and he has noted the difficulty in balancing their love of the Beatles with forming Blac Rabbit's own identity. The band performs both Beatles covers and original songs with a \\"vintage\\" sound. Afropunk contributor Erin White wrote, \\"Their music has all of the positivity and optimism of an LSD trip with none of the existential dread.\\" According to José Heinz of La Voz del Interior, the band is \\"as indebted to the sounds of the '60s as to this era's New York scene\\". The band's EP fuses surf and psychedelic music, with some tracks tinged by funk. The Taylors' vocals, doused with reverb, have drawn comparison to those of Tame Impala. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of studio albums ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:20em;\\"  Album details - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"height:6em;\\"  Interstella  - } ===Extended plays=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" + List of extended plays ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:20em;\\" EP details - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Blac Rabbit * *  * Released: December 22, 2017 * Label: How Far Music * Format: CD, digital download, streaming - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Blac Rabbit on Audiotree Live  * Released: July 12, 2018 * Label: How Far Music * Format: Digital download, streaming - } ===Singles=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" + List of singles as lead artist ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2em;\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" Album - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Seize the Day\\"  2018  rowspan=\\"2\\"  Interstella - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Windy Cities\\"  2019 - } ==References== Works cited * ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:Musical groups established in the 2010s Category:2010s establishments in New York (state) Category:Psychedelic rock music groups from New York (state) Category:African- American rock musical groups ","title":"Blac Rabbit"},{"id":"56887630","text":"Mahara () is a surname found in Nepal and India.

She first considered becoming a nun while she was in third grade. As a student at St. Paul's High School, she played on the girls basketball team. After graduating from high school in 1937, she entered the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary convent in Iowa. In 1941, by then a sister, she returned to teach in California. Sister Jean completed her B.A. at Mount St. Mary's College (now Mount St. Mary's University in Los Angeles in 1949 and M.A. at Loyola University of Los Angeles (now Loyola Marymount University) in 1961. ==Career== Sister Jean moved from California to teach at Mundelein College in Chicago in 1961. During the mid-1960s, she was active in the civil rights movement. She was hired by Loyola in 1991 when Mundelein was merged into Loyola. She has worked as the team chaplain for the Ramblers men's basketball team since 1994. In 2016, she was presented with an honorary doctorate from Loyola. Providing a mix of spiritual and scouting support, Schmidt inspired her own bobblehead doll in 2011 and was honored with a \\"Sister Jean Day\\" on December 1, 2012. Sister Jean gained overnight publicity beyond the Loyola community after the Ramblers' upset of Miami in the 2018 NCAA Tournament. Her fame continued to grow after the team upset Tennessee in the round of 32, sending Loyola to their first Sweet 16 appearance in 33 years. The then-98-year-old nun quickly became a star in the tournament; her bobblehead sold for more than $300 on eBay. Loyola ultimately advanced to the Final Four for the first time since 1963, but they were defeated by Michigan in the semifinal game. Sister Jean maintains an office in the student center on campus and lives in a freshman dorm, offering advice to those who visit her. ==References * Sister Jean: Loyola University Chicago: Features from Loyola University Chicago's official website.

Caner Dagli, Maria Dakake, and Joseph Lumbard prepared the translation, wrote the commentary, and also served as general editors, and Mohammed Rustom contributed as an assistant editor. Alongside a new English translation and extensive commentary, The Study Quran features numerous essays, maps, and other material. == Development == The idea of an English-language Quran for scholars and students was originally proposed to Nasr by HarperOne (then HarperSanFrancisco), who wanted Nasr as the editor-in-chief. Nasr initially declined, but after the publisher told him that the book would not happen without him, he felt obligated to lead the project. Nasr had several conditions for the work: firstly, that it would avoid modernistic and fundamentalist interpretations of the Quran, instead favouring a range of traditional interpretations. He also insisted that all the editors would be Muslim. Nasr chose Dagli, Dakake, and Lumbard, all Americans and former students of his, as General Editors. Sections of the translation and commentary were apportioned to the three editors, who worked under the oversight of Nasr and in consultation with each other to preserve the unity of the project. Nasr recruited Rustom as an assistant editor after the translation and essays had been completed. The Study Quran took ten years to complete. == Content == On The Study Quran’s English translation, Nasr writes: The Study Quran’s commentary references 41 older commentaries which represent a variety of Islamic perspectives, including Sunni and Shiite sources, and linguistic, philosophical, mystical, and historical commentaries. It is the first edition of the Quran to combine commentaries with disparate and often conflicting interpretations in this way. The source commentaries are traditional rather than contemporary, and are dominated by Medieval works; the most recent commentators are Ibn Ashur and Tabataba'i, who both died in the 20th century. The book also includes 15 essays written on related topics, including \\"How to Read the Quran\\", \\"The Quran as Source of Islamic Law\\", and \\"Conquest and Conversion, War and Peace in the Quran\\". The essay topics were selected by Nasr and written by a variety of contributors. == Reception == The Study Quran was reviewed in scholarly journals.Bruce Fudge. (2018).

Appraisal by mainstream American publications focused on The Study Quran's capacity to counter extreme or fundamentalist interpretations of Islam. A report by CNN entitled “Could this Quran curb extremism?” placed the work in the context of the recent Paris attacks, emphasising that the book refutes the extremist interpretations of the Quran by ISIS and other groups. Similarly, an article in The Daily Beast presented The Study Quran as a “challenge” to the ultra-conservative Salafi scholars who “have monopolized English-language Muslim resources”. == Notes  External link == * The Study Quran (Google Books Preview) Category:2015 non-fiction books Category:English translations of the Quran Category:HarperOne books ","title":"The Study Quran"},{"id":"56887924","text":"The 1996 Giro del Trentino was the 20th edition of the Tour of the Alps cycle race and was held on 8 May to 12 May 1996.

With his former skating partner, Laura Barquero, he is the 2018 Toruń Cup champion and 2018 International Challenge Cup champion, and competed for Spain at two World Championships. == Early career  Single skating === Maestu began learning to skate in 2002. As a single skater, he was coached by Jonathan Levers in San Sebastián. He received one ISU Junior Grand Prix (JGP) assignment, in September 2008. === Partnership with Rodríguez === Maestu's first pair skating partner was Alexandra Rodríguez Long. They competed two seasons together, beginning in 2010–2011. At JGP Austria in September 2011, they became the first pair to represent Spain in an international competition. Rodríguez/Maestu skated at the 2012 World Junior Championships in Minsk, Belarus, but were eliminated after placing 12th in the preliminary round. Miguel Alegre and Emma Baxter coached the pair in Jaca, Spain. === Partnership with Grigorieva === In September 2012, Maestu teamed up with Russia's Veronica Grigorieva to represent Spain on the senior level. The pair trained in Toruń (Poland) and Jaca (Spain), coached by Marius Siudek. Their international debut came in September 2013, at the Lombardia Trophy. A week later, they competed at the 2013 Nebelhorn Trophy, the final qualifying opportunity for the 2014 Winter Olympics. Their placement, 18th, was insufficient to qualify a spot at the Olympics. Grigorieva/Maestu's final competition together was the 2014 European Championships, which took place in January in Budapest, Hungary. Ranked 20th in the short program, the pair did not advance to the free skate. === Partnership with Lech === In 2014, Maestu teamed up with Poland's Marcelina Lech to compete for Spain. They made their international debut in February 2015, at the Bavarian Open. Lech/Maestu placed 13th in the short program, 15th in the free skate, and 15th overall at the 2016 European Championships in Bratislava, Slovakia. They were coached by Dorota Siudek and Mariusz Siudek in Toruń, Poland. == Partnership with Barquero  2016–2017 season === Maestu and Laura Barquero announced their partnership on 4 January 2017. They decided to train in Bergamo, Italy, coached by Barbara Luoni and Franca Bianconi. During their first season together, the pair was ineligible for international competitions due to the ISU's age requirements – Barquero was too young for senior events and Maestu too old for juniors. === 2017–2018 season === Making their international debut, Barquero/Maestu placed 7th at the 2017 CS Lombardia Trophy in mid-September. At the end of the month, they placed 13th at the 2017 CS Nebelhorn Trophy, the final qualifying opportunity for the 2018 Winter Olympics. Although their placement was not sufficient to qualify, Spain became the third alternate for a spot in the Olympic pairs' event. In January, Barquero/Maestu placed eleventh at the 2018 European Championships in Moscow, Russia. The following month, they won gold at the Toruń Cup in Toruń, Poland, and at the International Challenge Cup in Den Haag, Netherlands. They concluded the season at the 2018 World Championships, in twentieth place. === 2018–2019 season === Barquero/Maestu began the season with two Challenger assignments, finishing fifth at the 2018 CS Lombardia Trophy and eighth at the 2018 CS Finlandia Trophy. Making their Grand Prix debut with two assignments, they were seventh at the 2018 Grand Prix of Helsinki and sixth at 2018 NHK Trophy. At the 2019 European Championships they were seventh, after taking their second consecutive national title. Their final event together was the 2019 World Championships, where they placed fifteenth. On May 31, 2019, it was announced that Maestu had suffered an injury that would involve a prolonged recovery, and in consequence of this the team had split. == Programs  Pairs with Barquero === {class= style=text-align:center !

It has two linear leaves at its base, up to twelve bright yellow flowers with dark brown markings and grows on sandstone cliffs and ridges. ==Description== Diuris exitela is a tuberous, perennial herb with two linear leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Between seven and twelve bright yellow flowers with dark brown markings, wide and leaning downwards are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal projects forward and is egg-shaped, long and wide and forms a hood over the rest of the flower. The lateral sepals are linear to lance- shaped with the narrower end towards the base, green and purple-brown, long, wide, turned downwards and usually crossed over each other. The petals are held horizontally or droop with an elliptic blade long and wide on a green to purplish stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are linear, purplish-brown, about long and wide. There are two ridge-like calli about long near the base of the mid-line of the base of the labellum. Flowering occurs in September and October. ==Taxonomy and naming== Diuris exitela was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected on Mount Moffat and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (exitela) is derived from the Ancient Greek word exitelos meaning \\"lessening\\", \\"fading\\" or \\"weakening\\", referring to the colour of the flowers which fades quickly from bright yellow to pale yellow as they age. ==Distribution and habitat== The Mount Moffat doubletail grows mainly on sandstone cliffs and ridges but also between sandstone boulders in woodland and is found on Mount Moffat and in Carnarvon Gorge in central western Queensland. ==References== exitela Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of Queensland Category:Plants described in 1991 ","title":"Diuris exitela"},{"id":"56888247","text":"Cody Melphy (born April 5, 1993) is a professional American rugby union player for the United States national rugby sevens team.

The games were released in 1993 and 1994 for Macintosh and Windows PCs. == Development == In 1993, Creative Multimedia Corporation decided to launch a series of police adventure video games onto the market. They sought a collaboration with Shannon Gilligan, who had a successful career as a screenwriter, novel writer, and children's book author. The series aimed to transform the passive experience of reading a murder mystery into an active multimedia gaming experience. They wanted the player experience to be grounded in realism and to be removed from the magic and science fiction of other detective mysteries. Creative Multimedia announced the games in November 1992. On May 30, 1995, Creative Multimedia Corporation signed a deal with GTE Main Street to allow users of their interactive television network to access Creative Multimedia's CD-ROMs through their home television sets. The Virtual Murder series was among the first to be included because the game could be played using a TV remote control. == Titles == * Virtual Murder 1: Who Killed Sam Rupert? (1993) * Virtual Murder 2: Who Killed Elspeth Haskard? The Magic Death (1993) * Virtual Murder 3: Who Killed Brett Penance? The Environmental Surfer (1994) * Virtual Murder 4: Who Killed Taylor French? The Case of the Undressed Reporter (1994) == Gameplay and plot == Virtual Murder is a series of CD-ROM murder mystery adventure games. The player must solve a murder, facing the media at a press conference at the end of the game's time limit. The player determines what items from the crime scene need to be fingerprinted or sent to the lab for examination. They interview the leading candidates for the crime, relying on interviews an assistant has recorded with potential witnesses and suspects. All four games use a standard interface. The player has six hours available to visit the crime scene, perform an autopsy, examine the evidence, and interrogate the suspects. After this, players go to the press conference where they need to get up to 10 questions right to advance to the warrant stage. Here, they can further interrogate three of the suspects, then create a warrant of arrest against one of the suspects. In Who Killed Brett Penance?, there are three different murderers, and the murderer is different in each playthrough. Gilligan (initially portrayed by Shannon Gilligan herself and later by Sheryl Lee) serves as a detective sidekick who summarizes the crime scene, provides thumbnail sketches on suspects, and offers an opinion when queried. A throw- back to earlier narrative forms, the character was one of the few examples in interactive media around 2004 of a device called \\"The Fifth Business\\", a character who solely exists to move the characters and plot toward the conclusion. There is an occasional voiceover from the police superior who reminds the player of the work yet to be completed and the time remaining on the clock. The games contain an in-game notebook that keeps track of what the player has learned and done, a similar device to that used in the Her Interactive Nancy Drew games. == Critical reception == Allgame reviewer Anthony Baize recommended that players take copious notes and only expect to succeed on their fifth or sixth try because of the relentless press conference and warrant application sections. Adventure Classic Gaming felt the technical merits and their boring and repetitive gameplay outweighed good intentions of the games. PixelPacas rated the first game 3 out of 5 and described is as a 1990s version of Her Story. CD-ROM World (quoted in CDaccess.com) wrote that the games succeeded in illustrating the tools and complexities of murder investigation. Four Fat Chicks hoped their review steered away naive gamers from this game, which they considered dull and sub-par. Adventure's Planet deemed the series \\"absolutely mediocre\\". PC Gamer compared the gameplay to that of Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective, though criticized its small video window and grainy footage. In The End of Books – or Books Without End?, J. Yellowlees Douglas noted that the suspects simply answer the questions to a generic detective, rather than injecting their responses with reactions to an investigator with a colorful personality such as Philip Marlowe or Virginia West. Wired] wrote that the series \\"proves the rich potential of the mystery genre in the interactive medium\\", and that \\"sophisticated multimedia entertainment can be put together on a reasonable budget\\". Reconceptualizing the Literacies in Adolescents' Lives noted that the series inspired players to create murder mysteries of their own. Computer Gaming World stated that because of their limited interactivity, the Virtual Murder series \\"is better understood as a work of fiction\\" than games, and would appeal more to mystery fans than gamers. The magazine described the acting as \\"surprisingly good\\", and hoped that \\"future titles will involve more interactivity ... a promising start\\" for CMC. CD-ROM Today felt the games have an intuitive interface a graceful design and thought they offered a refreshingly new standard for multimedia games. Who Killed Sam Rupert? was reviewed in 1993 in Dragon #195 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. MacUser gave Who Killed Brett Penance? and Who Killed Taylor French? scores of 3.5 out of 5, and named them collectively one of 1995's top 50 CD-ROMs. The series sold 900,000 copies in five languages. === Awards and nominations === * New Media Invision Award of Excellence for Who Killed Sam Rubert? * New Media Invision Award of Excellence for Who Killed Elspeth Haskard? * New Media Invision Award of Excellence for Who Killed Taylor French? == References  External links == * Mobygames: VM1, VM2, VM3, VM4 === Non-English reviews === * Joystick review of VM3 * Joystick review of VM4 * PC Player review of VM1 * PC Player review of VM2 * PC Player review of VM4 Category:Adventure games Category:Mystery video games Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1993 Category:Video games about police officers ","title":"Virtual Murder (video game series)"},{"id":"56888280","text":"The 2003 Giro del Trentino was the 27th edition of the Tour of the Alps cycle race and was held on 24 April to 27 April 2003.

The rings are marketed towards active individuals and those with professions that result in their metal band being a safety hazard like athletes, firefighters, police officers, mechanics, electricians and others.

Miranda (14 February 1922 – 27 April 2007) was a noted Puerto Rican singer who was featured on radio and television in the United States during the Golden Age of Radio in the 1940s. As a naturalized Argentinean she was also active as a film actress in South America during the 1950s. ==Early years== Elsa Miranda was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, a city located in the southern region of the island. She moved to New York City with her mother Amelia Miranda (1898-2007) and became a performer who first attained notoriety as a vocalist through her live performances during the Golden Age of Radio in the United States in the 1940s. Included among her most popular songs were Adiós Mariquita Linda as performed with Alfredo Antonini's Viva America Orchestra, Cariñoso as performed with Desi Arnaz and his orchestra, Besos de Fuergo and Sonata Fantasía among others. ==Miss Chiquita Banana== Miranda first appeared on the radio performing the promotional singing commercial Chiquita Banana in 1945. Her interpretation of the tropical tune proved to be immensely popular and was broadcast over 2,700 times per week. These commercial radio broadcasts created widespread notoriety for Miranda. She was also celebrated as one of the most popular models in the \\"Miss Chiquita Banana\\" contest during the 1940s, making several advertising and promotional film appearances on behalf of the Chiquita brand. She subsequently collaborated in various musical events representing the brand with Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra during 1945 and 1946. As a result of this exposure, Miranda soon emerged in a series of performances on radio networks in New York City. By 1946, she appeared on such network broadcasts as The Jack Smith Show on CBS and Leave It To Mike on Mutual. At this time she also engaged in a series of collaborations with noted interpreters of Latin American music in New York including Xavier Cugat on the C-C Spotlight Bands show for WOR radio and Alfredo Antonini on the Viva America show for the Columbia Broadcasting System and Voice of America. While performing on Viva America she also collaborated with several international musicians of that era including: the Mexican tenors Juan Arvizu and Nestor Mesta Chayres, the Argentine composer/arranger Terig Tucci and members of the CBS Pan American Orchestra including John Serry Sr. ==Recording Latin American music in the United States== Before long, Miranda engaged in a series of recordings in collaboration with leading conductors of Latin American music in the United States.

It also adds an App Store which allows users to browse, download, and install a wide variety of applications. In addition, developers can now use their own interface inside of their application rather than only being able to use Apple's interface. Since tvOS is based on iOS, it is easy to port existing iOS apps to the Apple TV with Xcode while making only a few refinements to the app to better suit the larger screen. Apple provides Xcode free of charge to all registered Apple developers. To develop for the new Apple TV, it is necessary to make a parallax image for the application icon. In order to do this, Apple provides a Parallax exporter and previewer in the development tools for the Apple TV. ==References *Apple Developer program Category:Apple Inc. services Category:TvOS software ","title":"App Store (tvOS)"},{"id":"56888358","text":"thumb Gillian Lesley \\"Jill\\" Mann, FBA (born 7 April 1943), is a scholar known for her work on medieval literature, especially on Middle English and Medieval Latin. ==Education and career== Mann was born in York, where her father was engaged in war work, but brought up in Sunderland, Co. Durham, where she was educated at the Bede Grammar School for Girls. In 1961 she won a place at St Anne's College, Oxford, and took her BA (1st Class Hons) in English Language and Literature in 1964. She began research work on the General Prologue to the Canterbury Tales in Oxford, but in 1967 she moved to Cambridge and eventually transferred to a Cambridge PhD, which she completed in 1971. She held a Research Fellowship at Clare Hall, Cambridge, from 1968–1971; from 1971–1972 she taught medieval and some modern literature at the University of Kent at Canterbury. In 1972 she returned to Cambridge as an Official Fellow of Girton College, and in 1974 she was appointed to an Assistant Lectureship in the Faculty of English, upgraded to Lecturer in 1978. In 1988 she was elected Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English (Cambridge), a post which she held until 1998. She was Chair of the Faculty of English from 1993 to 1995, and helped the Faculty prepare for its first ever HEFCE teaching quality assessment. In 1998 she resigned the Cambridge Chair and took up a post as Notre Dame Professor of English at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana; on taking early retirement in 2004, she was made an Emeritus Professor of Notre Dame. She is resident in Cambridge, and is a Life Fellow of Girton College. ==Publications== Mann's work has always had a strongly comparative character, bringing together texts in several medieval languages. Her dominant interests are the literature of fourteenth-century England, especially Chaucer, and medieval beast literature in Latin, French, and English. Her books include Chaucer and Medieval Estates Satire (1973), Feminizing Chaucer (2002), and The Cambridge Companion to Chaucer (edited with Piero Boitani); she also edited the Canterbury Tales for Penguin Classics. She produced an edition and translation of the Latin beast epic Ysengrimus, with a lengthy account of the poem’s relation to its historical context in twelfth-century Flanders; she is currently working on an edition and translation of the Speculum Stultorum, another twelfth-century Latin beast epic, written by a monk of Christ Church, Canterbury. She has published some 60 articles on medieval literature in English, Latin, French, and Italian; fifteen of them are collected in Life in Words: Essays on Chaucer, the Gawain-Poet, and Malory, edited with a lengthy Introduction by Mark David Rasmussen analysing their contribution to medieval literary studies.

In freestyle, he was the 2019 US National champion and a three-time World Champion, once as a cadet and twice as a junior. As a folkstyle wrestler, Lee is a two-time NCAA Division I Champion and Dan Hodge Trophy winner out of the University of Iowa and a three-time PIAA champion as a high schooler. As of May 16, 2020, he is the pound-for-pound top-ranked NCAA wrestler in the country. == Folkstyle career == Lee was born in Denver, Colorado but grew up in Saegertown, Pennsylvania. He would end up moving again to Murrysville, Pennsylvania, where he attended Franklin Regional High School. === High School === In Lee's freshman year he ended the season undefeated with a record of 49-0 and a state title at 113-pounds. As a sophomore, he also ended the season with a similar 48-0 record and a state championship now at 120-pounds. As a junior in high school, he also competed at 120-pounds, posting a perfect 12-0 record and winning state again, making him a three-time PIAA champion. As a senior, he also stayed undefeated during regular-season, competing at 132-pounds and eventually at 126-pounds. Going into the state finals, Lee was the pound for pound top-ranked high school wrestler and was undefeated, posting a 144-0 record in his high school career. At the finals, Lee faced the same wrestler he had beaten by technical fall at last year's state finals and current Iowa teammate, Austin DeSanto. The match was very close and exciting, having the crowd cheering on their feet. With Lee being up 5-4, DeSanto secured a last-second takedown, winning 6-5 and pulling up the biggest upset of the century in high school wrestling. As the top-recruit in the country, Lee had many offers from many Division I colleges, but ended up choosing the University of Iowa. === College ===  2017-18  Freshman; Lee chose not to redshirt in his first year and competed as a true freshman instead. He had immediate success, posting a 14-1 record in regular-season. He placed third at the Big Ten Conference Championships and competed at the NCAA's. At the National tournament, Lee looked absolutely dominant, winning by technical fall by 18 points to 0 in his first two bouts in less than 6 minutes combined. After that, he pinned that year's Big 12 Champion Nick Piccininni and former NCAA Champion Nathan Tomasello, reaching the finals. At the finals, he faced undefeated (in 17'-18') wrestler Nick Suriano, whom he was able to defeat outscoring him 5 points to 1. This result earned him the NCAA championship at 125-pounds as a true freshman.  2018-19  Sophomore; Lee posted an overall record of 23-3, placed second at the Big Ten Championships and competed at the NCAA championships. At the Nationals, Lee was as dominant as last year, winning bytechnical fall (18-0) in his first bout, major decision (10-1) in the second and fall in the third. In his next two bouts, he defeated at the moment's three-time Big 12 Champion Nick Piccininni and that year's ACC runner-up Jack Mueller, winning the NCAA Championship at 125-pounds. Lee outscored opponents 55-7 in five matches at the NCAA Championships.  2019-20  Junior; In this year, Lee had the option to take an Olympic redshirt, but chose not to, stating he wanted to help the Iowa Team to win an NCAA title but he would still compete in freestyle. During regular season, he compiled a record of 15-0 with 14 of those wins bringing bonus points to the team. At the Big Ten tournament, Lee dominated his way to the finals, winning by fall inside 3 minutes in his first bout and by technical superiority (19-3) in the semifinals, making his way to the finale. In the finals, Lee defeated the #2 ranked wrestler at 125-pounds, Devin Schroder of Purdue University, via major decision (16-2) and qualified for the NCAA's. Lee was the #1 seed and a big favorite to win the championship, however, the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making Lee and all the qualifiers unable to compete. After the season, Lee earned All-American honors due to his performance throughout the season. Lee remained undefeated with a record of 18-0 through the season and outscored his opponents 234-18. He also won the prestigious 2020 Dan Hodge Trophy award and was named Big Ten Wrestler of the Year.  2020-21  Junior; In October of 2020, the NCAA granted an extra year of eligibility to winter athletes due to the last season being cut short, giving Lee the possibility of becoming a four-time NCAA champion and retaining his eligibility as a junior. Lee is currently the pound-for-pound top-ranked wrestler in the United States. == Freestyle career  Cadet & Junior === Lee is a highly successful youth level wrestler. As a cadet, he compiled a World Championship in his second appearance at the tournament and two National titles. As a junior, he was never defeated and compiled two World Championships and a US Open gold medal. === Senior ===  2019  Being 21 years old, Lee competed in his first senior level competition on December 20, at the US Nationals. He ran through the 57 kilogram' bracket, beating everyone he faced by technical fall up until the finale, including dominant victories over former NCAA champion Darian Cruz and Cornell's Vito Arujau. In the finals, he faced former NCAA champion Nathan Tomasello, whom he defeated 8 points to 2.  2020  Lee was scheduled to compete at the 20' US Olympic Team Trials on April 4 at State College, Pennsylvania. However, the event was postponed for 2021 along with the Summer Olympics due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving all the qualifiers unable to compete. In his first competition of the year, Lee is now scheduled to wrestle Zach Sanders on November 1 at the HWC Open. ==Freestyle record== ! colspan=\\"7\\" Senior Freestyle Matches - ! Res. ! Record !

According to legend, it lived in the arena of the Roman amphitheater in Metz, France. Legends state that Saint Clement of Metz fought against Graoully and vanquished the beast. == Etymology == It is believed that the word Graoully derives from the French word \\"grouiller\\" meaning \\"swarm\\". This has been attributed to the myth that the dragon and the large serpents were like a swarm in the amphitheater. Other origins suggested for the name include the German word \\"gräulich\\", which can mean \\"grayish\\" or \\"horrible\\". The closest English synonym it has is \\"gruesome\\" or \\"macabre\\". It has been proposed that the word \\"graula\\" may have been the origin of the name. It was commonly used in fourteenth century French as a synonym for raven, especially when used to describe ravens as a bad omen. == Cultural representation == The legend of St. Clement inspired several other legends of dragonslayer Saints. While Graoully became a symbol of Metz and remains one of the major symbols used by a number of major establishments in the city. Graoully was also used in the local Oscan Games from the twelfth century till the start of the French Revolution. === Procession of Graoully === A procession with an effigy of the dragon was held in the city till the nineteenth century. It started in the eleventh century when three banners were carried in the procession of Saint Mark during Rogation days. One of these depicted a dragon's head. During the following century, an effigy of the dragon was constructed and paraded along with the banner. Later on a huge Graoully effigy was used instead of the banners. The French Renaissance writer François Rabelais described the Graoully's effigy during a procession of the sixteenth century: The construction of the effigy continued to evolve and in the 18th century, it was constructed as a canvas figure filled with hay and twelve feet high. The jaws did not move, and the forked tongue ended with points of iron. Every baker in front of whom the procession passed, picked up a half-pound white bun and gave it to the bearer of the dragon. === Symbolic representation === A number of writers have stated that the legend of the Graoully is a symbol of Christianity's victory over paganism, with Saint Clement representing religion and paganism represented by the harmful dragon. The oldest known sculpture to date is located at 10 rue Chêvremont, on the maison du serpent. There is also a representation of Graoully on a house in the rue de la Marne in Sarrebourg and in a room in the Château du Haut- Kœnigsbourg. A depiction of Graoully from the 16th century is in the crypt in the cathedral of the Saint-Etienne. Another sculpture is suspended in mid-air on Taison street, near the cathedral. The name of the Rue Taison is traced back to a warning from the Graoully: \\"Taisons, taisons nous, voilà le Graoully qui passe\\" ( Be silent leave the Graoully alone ). Supposedly Saint Clement had uttered spoken the words \\"taisons-nous\\" on his entry into the city. The Groully is also featured on the coats of arms of FC Metz.

Pullaiah. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao and Krishna Kumari in the lead roles, with K. V. S. Sharma, S. V. Ranga Rao, Kanta Rao, Kalyanam Raghuramaiah, Peketi Sivaram, P. Hemalatha and Mohana in supporting roles. It is a remake of the 1958 Bengali film Jamalaye Jibanta Manush and was simultaneously filmed in Tamil as Naan Kanda Sorgam with a largely different cast. Devanthakudu was released on 7 July 1960 and became a commercial success. == Plot == Sundaram is a stage actor. He falls in love with Meenakshi, the daughter of a miserly rich man Bhadraiah who dislikes Sundaram. Bhadraiah fixes his daughter's marriage with an aged billionaire over his wife's protests. Meenakshi and Sundaram marry in secret with the help of his friends. Bhadraiah enters with his goons and drags his daughter home while his goons brutally assault Sundaram. Meenakshi jumps into a river to commit suicide. Crestfallen, Sundaram repents that he was responsible for her death. While Sundaram sleeps on a veranda, Yama's men, unable to find the address of a dead man, take Sundaram instead with them to hell, the abode of Yama. Sundaram finds his bull there and by unleashing it on Yama, he occupies his throne, promotes Vichitragupta, rewrites Yamaloka's constitution and also takes the opportunity to search for Meenakshi with the help of Narada, who takes him to Vaikuntha, the abode of Vishnu and Lakshmi, and to Indraloka, the heaven where he finds Meenakshi. With Vishnu and Lakshmi's blessings, Meenakshi is brought to life and to Sundar and the two return to Earth. Bhadraiah relents and accepts Sundar as his son-in-law. == Cast == * N. T. Rama Rao as Sundaram * Krishna Kumari as Meenakshi * K. V. S. Sarma as Bhadraiah * S. V. Ranga Rao as Yama * Kanta Rao as Lord Vishnu * Kalyanam Raghuramaiah as Narada * Peketi Sivaram as Vichitragupta * P. Hemalatha as Bhadraiah's wife * Mohana as Goddess Lakshmi == Production  Development === After the success of the Telugu film Pakka Inti Ammayi (1953), which was based on the Bengali film Pasher Bari (1952), its director C. Pullaiah waited for five years to adapt another comical Bengali story for Telugu-speaking audiences. The Bengali fantasy comedy Jamalaye Jibanta Manush (1958) was running successfully in cinemas in Bengal. It's screenplay, written by Gouri Shree, incorporated satirical attacks on contemporary life and social issues. Pullaiah established the production company Bhargavi Films with Ch. Subbarao, a Madras-based building contractor, as managing director and himself as producer, and bought the rights to remake Jamalaye Jibanta Manush in Telugu and Tamil languages. The Telugu version was titled Devanthakudu and the Tamil version was titled Naan Kanda Sorgam. Adurthi Narasimha Murthy was the screenwriter of Devanthakudu, and the dialogues were written by Vempati Sadasivabrahmam. Cinematography was handled by A. Shanmugam and the editing by T. R. Srinivasulu while A. Krishnarao served as art director. === Casting === N. T. Rama Rao was cast as the male lead Sundaram, Krishna Kumari as the female lead Meenakshi and K. V. S. Sharma as her father Bhadraiah. S. V. Ranga Rao, who earlier played Yama in Sati Savitri (1957), reprised his role in Devanthakudu. Kanta Rao played Vishnu, Kalyanam Raghuramaiah played Narada in addition to working as playback singer, Peketi Sivaram played Vichitragupta, P. Hemalatha played Bhadraiah's wife and Mohana played Lakshmi. The Tamil version featured a largely different cast, where only Ranga Rao was retained in the same role. === Filming === Devanthakudu and Naan Kanda Sorgam were filmed simultaneously, with scenes from the Telugu version being filmed first and those from the Tamil version second. Because of a belief that if Rama Rao wore multiple different get-ups the film would succeed, he sported two additional disguises for this film: that of a woman, and that of an elderly dance teacher. After Pullaiah finished filming Raghuramaiah's scene as Narada, it was time to film the same scene in Tamil with P. V. Narasimha Bharathi as the character. Pullaiah noticed one of the assistant directors asking Raghuramaiah to give his garland to Narasimha Bharathi since the scene required Narada to wear one. Pullaiah realised that the production team bought only a single garland instead of two as required, so production resumed only after a new garland was obtained. The final cut of Devanthakudu was 17 reels, longer than the Bengali original which was 13 reels. == Soundtrack == The soundtrack composed by Ashwatthama, and the lyrics were written by Aarudhra. The songs \\"Go Go Gogunra\\" and \\"Entha Madhura\\" attained popularity, as did the various shlokas and poems narrated by Ghantasala and Raghuramaiah. == Release and reception == Devanthakudu was released on 7 July 1960. The film was commercially successful, and became a trendsetter for \\"socio-fantasy films\\" in Telugu cinema. == References  External links == * Category:1960s Telugu- language films Category:Films directed by C.

In October 1947 he was promoted to Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) as ASP Crimes, Colombo (South) and thereafter was appointed ASP, CID in November 1948; ASP, Ambalangoda January 1950; June 1951 ASP, Colombo Crimes; April 1953 ASP, Western Province (North) and in January 1951 ASP, Jaffna. In January 1962 Attygalle, who was then the Superintendent of Police of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), played a major role in stopping the attempted military coup. Attygalle together with Felix Dias Bandaranaike and S. A. Dissanayake (Deputy Inspector General of the CID) informed Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike at her residence about the attempt to take over the Government by a coup by certain army, navy and police personnel, on the eve of the coup, which resulted in its failure to occur and the arrest of the coup organisers. In 1963 following the appointment of Dissanayake as Inspector- General of Police he took on the role of Deputy Inspector General of the CID. In early 1966 Dissanayake was placed on compulsory leave, he was then replaced by Attygalle as Inspector-General in June that year. In July 1966 he arrested Major General Richard Udugama, the Commander of the Ceylon Army, at the Bandaranaike International Airport for his purported involvement in an alleged coup d'état attempt. Udugama was subsequently found not guilty by the Supreme Court and acquitted of all charges. On 1 October 1966 Attygalle established the Police Public Relations Division at Police Headquarters, Colombo. On 1 April 1967, Attygalle arranged for the Police Training School to be shifted from Kalutara to Echen Square Barracks, which were occupied by the Sinha Regiment of the Ceylon Army. The Police Training School was subsequently relocated back to its original premises in Kalutara in December 1970. On 8 July 1967 he retired from his position as Inspector-General of Police. ==Later work== In 1969 Attygalle, who had been appointed as a special security advisor to the Ministry of External Affairs and Defence in July 1967, prepared a report on the potential threat of the communist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) which was presented to the Prime Minister, Dudley Senanayake, for consideration. It is felt that the government's subsequent in actions against the JVP precipitated the JVP insurrection in 1971. Attygalle died on 23 March 1981 at the age of 75. ==References== Category:Sri Lankan Inspectors General of Police Category:Sri Lankan Christians Category:1981 deaths Category:People of British Ceylon Category:1906 births ","title":"John Attygalle"},{"id":"56888742","text":"Katerra is an Japanese funded American technology-driven offsite construction company. It was founded in 2015 by Michael Marks, former CEO of Flextronics and former Tesla interim CEO, along with Fritz Wolff, the executive chairman of The Wolff Co. It has raised $1.2 billion in venture capital in venture capital investments and has more than $3 billion in project backlog. Katerra was listed on LinkedIn's \\"Top Startup Companies\\" to work for in 2017. In May of 2020, it was announced that as a part of an additional $200 million raise, COO and former Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard will take over from Michael Marks as CEO of Katerra in June. ==Operations== The company was founded in 2015. In January 2018, Katerra took an $835 million investment from Softbank. The investment was made from the Vision Fund. The company manufactures large building components off-site, particularly for multi-family housing. For example, the company may fabricate an entire wall (including windows) off-site for final assembly on site at a construction project. The technique allows lower cost and the company claims higher-quality finishes. Katerra is known for its use of mass timber construction and its manufacture of mass timber products such as glued laminated timber and cross-laminated timber. In support of this specialty, Katerra purchased Michael Green Architecture in 2018, the leading architectural firm in the field of tall wood buildings and mass timber construction. In many of its projects, the company serves as an off-site manufacturer, architect, and on-site contractor. It generally contracts directly with owners. The company has projects ongoing in several states; as of the end of 2018 it has 700 projects underway and many in backlog. It plans to build up to 14 distribution centers across the country. ===Restructuring and layoffs=== In December 2019, Katerra reported the company plans to layoff approximately 200 of the workforce and close their factory in Phoenix, Arizona. The manufacturing will be moved to Tracy, California where the costs are lower and highly automated. ==References== Category:Construction and civil engineering companies of the United States Category:Technology companies established in 2015 Category:Companies based in Menlo Park, California Category:Softbank portfolio companies Category:American companies established in 2015 Category:Construction and civil engineering companies established in 2015 ","title":"Katerra"},{"id":"56888752","text":"The 1999 season was Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama's 101st year in existence, the club's 84th season in existence of football, and the club's 29th season playing in the Brasileirão Série A, the top flight of Brazilian football. == Players  Pre-season and friendlies  Trofeo Ramón de Carranza = Competitions == Times from 1 January to 20 February 1999 and from 3 October to 31 December 1999 are UTC–2, from 21 February 1999 to 2 October 1999 UTC–3. === Brasileirão Série A ===  League stage  = League table = = Results summary = = Result round by round = = Matches =  Championship knockout phase   2000 Copa Libertadores play-offs qualifier  === Copa do Brasil = Copa Libertadores === Vasco da Gama joined the competition in the round of 16 of the knockout phase due to be the title holders.

The song was written for the International Brigades but later became a popular standard in Germany and in American communist and folk music communities. The title translates as \\"Freedom\\" in English. == Background == The song was written as an anthem for the German volunteers who made up the Thälmann Battalion of the International Brigades and was originally named \\"The Thaelman Column\\" (\\"Die Thälmann-Kolonne\\" or \\"Spaniens Himmel\\" (Spanish Skies) in German). Composer Dessau and lyricist Kabisch, husband and wife, composed the song while living in exile in Paris and used the pseudonyms Peter Daniels and Paul Ernst, names that still appear on printed versions of the lyrics. Musically a march, the lyrics of the song make reference to the struggle of the anti-Franco fighters and to a more general struggle for the idea of \\"freedom\\". The fight in Spain is put in the context of the universal struggle against fascism, with the chorus making direct reference to the situation in Germany during the period of Nazism. The chorus can be paraphrased as \\"Home is faraway, but we are ready/We fight and win for you: freedom!\\" == Lyrics == English-language lyrics to \\"Freiheit\\" from a 1951 Canadian songbook. Spaniens Himmel breitet seine Sterne Über unsre Schützengraben aus; Und der Morgen grüßt schon aus der Ferne, Bald geht es zum neuen Kampf hinaus. Chorus Die Heimat ist weit, Doch wir sind bereit, Wir kämpfen und siegen für dich: Freiheit! Dem Faschisten werden wir nicht weichen, Schickt er auch die Kugeln hageldicht. Mit uns stehen Kameraden ohne gleichen Und ein Rückwärts gibt es für uns nicht. Chorus Die Heimat ist weit, Doch wir sind bereit, Wir kämpfen und siegen für dich: Freiheit! Rührt die Trommel. Fällt die Bajonette. Vorwärts marsch. Der Sieg ist unser Lohn. Mit der roten Fahne brecht die Kette. Auf zum Kampf das Thälmann Bataillon. Chorus Die Heimat ist weit, Doch wir sind bereit, Wir kämpfen und siegen für dich: Freiheit! The final chorus in the Ernst Busch version alternatively gives the line Wir kämpfen und sterben für dich: Freiheit! in contrast to kämpfen und siegen given in the rest of the song. It also features a closing verse in Spanish: Mi tierra dejé A España juré que ella siempre será ¡Libre! ==Versions== The song was popularized among German fighters in Spain by singer and International Brigades member Ernst Busch and later became something of an unofficial anthem of the GDR.Jochen Voit: Spanienliederbuch. Canciones de las Brigadas Internacionales populär. Auf: Erinnerungsort.de, 29. August 2006. Busch's recording of the song was later popularized in North America after it was released as a track on the three-record set, \\"Six Songs for Democracy\\" by Keynote Records starting in 1938. It was later recorded by Pete Seeger and became part of Seeger's live repertoire. The song was sung as a dirge by the dissident musician Wolf Biermann as a parodic critique of \\"the stagnation of the socialist ideal\\" in the GDR of the 1960s and 1970s. { !Year !Title !Performer !Genre !Label !Catalog # - 1938 Six Songs for Democracy Ernst Busch and chorus Folk Keynote 101 - 1961 Songs Of The Spanish Civil War, Vol. 1: Songs Of The Lincoln Brigade, Six Songs For Democracy Pete Seeger and Group & Ernst Busch and Chorus Folk Folkways FH 5436 - 1968 Wimoweh And Other Songs Of Freedom And Protest Pete Seeger Folk Folkways FTS 31018 - 1976 Es Gibt Ein Leben Vor Dem Tod Wolf Biermann Folk CBS CBS 81 259 - } ==AppearancesIn other media=== *The song is part of the soundtrack of the 1955 film Ernst Thälmann - Führer seiner Klasse, a biopic of communist leader Ernst Thälmann, and plays over a montage of scenes set during the war in Spain. *The song plays as the outro to the February 25, 2018 episode of the podcast Chapo Trap House, \\"Episode 188: Menaker Facts Stated feat.

The rules were eventually printed in Scrye magazine issue #3. An \\"icon explanation\\" card, however, was included in the starter decks, but did not explain all the icons found on the cards.
