Named for the art dealer who commissioned them, Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939), the suite is in a number of museums, and individual etchings from the suite are collectible. More than 300 sets were created, but many were broken up and the prints sold separately. An earlier Vollard Suite was commissioned from Paul Gauguin in 1898–99, a smaller group in woodcut and monotype, which Vollard did not like. ==History== In 1930 Picasso was commissioned to produce the etchings by the art dealer and publisher Ambroise Vollard in exchange for paintings by Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul Cézanne.. Picasso worked extensively on the set in the spring of 1933, and completed the suite in 1937. It took a further two years for the printmaker Roger Lacourière to finish printing the 230 full sets, but the death of Vollard in 1939 and the Second World War meant that the sets only started coming onto the art market in the 1950s. A 1971 exhibition of the suite in Madrid was attacked by a paramilitary group, the Guerrilleros del Christo Rey (Warriors of Christ the King) who tore the pictures and poured acid over the prints. The group attacked things associated with Spanish exiles like Picasso who aligned themselves with the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War. A spinning residential building in Brazil was named Suite Vollard after the suite. A complete set is owned by the National Gallery of Australia and a complete set was acquired by the British Museum in 2011 after a donation of £1 million from financier Hamish Parker, a director of Mondrian Investment Partners. The donation was in memory of Parker's father, Major Horace Parker. It had been the British Museum's ambition to own the set and the acquisition was described by the museum's director, Neil MacGregor, as \\"one of the institution's most important acquisitions of the past 50 years\\". ==The series== The works are not based on a literary source, and are not titled, although according to the Fundación Juan March, \\"Some of the themes have a remote origin in Honoré de Balzac’s short story Le Chef-d’oeuvre inconnu (The Unknown Masterpiece, 1831), which greatly impressed Picasso. It tells the story of a painter’s efforts to capture life itself on canvas through the means of feminine beauty\\".Vollard Suite, Museo de Arte Abstracto Español (Fundación Juan March) The works are inscribed by Picasso with the year month and day that he drew the image. Writing in the Daily Telegraph Richard Dorment claims that as Picasso took such a long time to create the suite, \\"the imagery and the emotional register of the prints constantly shifts to reflect Picasso's erotic and artistic obsessions, marital vicissitudes, and the darkening political situation in Europe...In the years Picasso worked on the series, fascism spread through Europe, and civil war erupted in Spain. These anxieties also found their way into the Vollard Suite, so that by the time you reach the end of the show and the last images of the blind minotaur, you feel that you are in a different emotional universe from the sunlit arcadia you encountered at the show’s beginning\\". The suite begins with prints exploring the theme of the sculptor's studio, Picasso's mistress, Marie-Thérèse Walter, is portrayed as a model lying in the arms of a bearded sculptor. Picasso had recently been inspired by Marie-Thérèse to create a series of monumental bronze heads in the neoclassical style. Picasso had also recently been commissioned by the publisher Albert Skira in 1928 to create original intaglio prints for his translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses, which appeared in 1931. Dorment comments that a minotaur appears, joining in scenes of bacchic excess, but the minotaur is transformed from a gentle lover and bon vivant into a rapist and devourer of women, reflecting Picasso's turbulent relationships with Marie-Thérèse and his wife Olga. In a third transformation, the minotaur becomes pathetic, blind and impotent, he wanders by night, led by a little girl with the features of Marie-Thérèse. The final three prints from the suite are portraits of Vollard. Picasso learned new techniques of etching during the suite, from relatively simple line etchings, through burin, dry point, aquatinting and sugar aquatinting learnt through in his workshop., this enabled him to achieve more painterly effects. Most of the prints were completed to Picasso's satisfaction in a single state, but others, especially the erotic compositions, exist in several states, fourteen in one case. ==Collections with complete sets== * Bibliothèque nationale de France, département des Estampes * British Museum * Colby College Museum of Art, accessed May 9, 2016 * Fundación MAPFRE, MadridMetropolitan Museum of Manila, accessed May 19, 2012 * Harry Ransom Center * Hood Museum of Art, Hanover, New HampshirePrints, Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth College, accessed May 19, 2012 * * Modern Art Museum of Fort WorthModern Art Museum of Fort Worth web page * Museum Ludwig, CologneThe Graphic Collection at Museum Ludwig, accessed May 19, 2012 * (MACC)http://www.ciudadccs.info/?p=247389 * National Gallery of Australia * National Gallery of Canada * Philadelphia Museum of Art ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Bolliger, Hans (1977).

Ya khayl Allah) is 2012 Moroccan drama film about the 2003 Casablanca bombings. It was directed by Nabil Ayouch, and based on the novel The Stars of Sidi Moumen by Moroccan writer Mahi Binebine. The film won several awards, and was Morocco's submission for the 85th Academy Awards (held in February 2013). ==Plot== The film opens in 1994. Yachine (whose real name is Tarek), his violent older brother Hamid, and Yachine's friends Nabil (son of Tamou, a local prostitute and singer), pot-smoking Fouad, and Khalil live in extreme poverty in Sidi Moumen, a shanty town on the edge of Casablanca in Morocco. Hamid earns money by acting as a drug mule. The boys steal liquor from Khalil's father's wedding, and Hamid rapes a drunk Nabil in front of the others. In 1999, the shanty town is significantly larger, and Hassan II of Morocco has just died. Yachine, Nabil, Fouad, and Khalil spend their time smoking pot, and Yachine is in love with Ghislaine, Fouad's sister. Hamid is now a major drug dealer, paying off the policeman known as \\"Pitbull\\" and forcing Yachine to stay out of the drug business. Religious zealots force Tamou to leave town. Hamid is given a two-year prison sentence after throwing a rock at Pitbull's car. Yachine is forced out of the marketplace in the medina, and Nabil gets him a job repairing engines for repairman Ba'Moussa. The day after the September 11 attacks, Hamid is released from prison, having given up drugs and embraced radical Islam. Yachine kills Ba'Moussa after the drunk man attempts to rape Nabil. Nabil gets Hamid, and he and his radical friends hide the body. Hamid gives the two refuge in an Islamic compound hidden within the shanty town, and Yachine and Nabil meet with Abou Zoubeir—who begins to recruit them into radical Islam. Nouceir, a former neighborhood enemy and now one of Hamid's close friends, intimidates Khalil and Fouad into joining the cell also. All four begin learning jujutsu. Yachine, feeling immense guilt over murdering Ba'Moussa, spends the night with Nabil. But he is also drawn to Zoubeir's message of forgiveness through adherence to radical Islam. A year later, in November 2002, Tarek (having given up his nickname), Nabil, and Fouad have fully embraced radical Islam. Zoubeir tells Tarek, Nabil, and Fouad they are being admitted to the innermost councils of the cell, which leaves Hamid jealous and angry. An extensive montage depicts the radicalization of the friends. Tarek learns that Ghislaine is going to marry a cousin. In February 2003, the police raid a public meeting of radical Muslims, beating Tarek. Abou Zoubeir begins to preach martyrdom to the cell. Tamou attempts to see Nabil, but he refuses to see her or accept her gifts. An unidentified emir arrives and reinforces the message of martyrdom, telling Hamid, Tarek, Fouad, Nabil, and Nouceir, \\"Take care, children of Islam, never to become like those who cling to life down here and fear to become martyrs. Fly, horses of God, and the gates of paradise will open for you.\\" He selects the four for a suicide mission, and Hamid's jealousy toward Tarek worsens. 9 May, the day of the attack, approaches. Abou Zoubeir flees as the police close in on the cell, and the attack is moved to 16 May. The five men drive into the foothills near Casablanca, which Tarek, Nabil, and Fouad have never seen before. They are amazed at the city's wealth, and surprised to see vast forests and rivers (unlike the desert they have lived in). They camp in the forest, waiting for the day of attack to arrive. Tarek hopes Ghislaine will think fondly of him, once he becomes a martyr. Hamid unsuccessfully attempts to convince Tarek not to go through with the attack. The men return to the shanty town on 15 May, where they meet with Abou Zoubeir and the 14 others in their cell. They prepare extensively for their mission by shaving, washing, setting watches, and receiving their bombs. Hamid, Fouad, Tarek, and Nabil enter Casablanca on 16 May, spending the day wandering the city. That night, they approach the Casa de España restaurant. Hamid refuses to let Tarek go through with the attack, but Tarek pushes him away. Fouad flees, not wanting to die. Tarek and Nabil stab and kill the doorman, and enter the club. Two minutes later, they see Hamid in the club as well. The three set off their bombs. The film ends with children in Sidi Moumen playing football in the dark, and pausing to listen to the explosions in the city. End titles describe the 2003 Casablanca bombings, where they occurred, and how many people died. ==Cast== * Abdelhakim Rachid as Tarek/Yachine, the bullied younger brother who dreams of being a football goalie but turns to radical Islam after murdering a man * Abdelilah Rachid as Hamid, Yachine's older brother and drug dealer who embraces radical Islam in prison but who fears death * Hamza Souidek as Nabil, Yachine's (possibly homosexual) best friend and the son of a prostitute * Ahmed El Idrissi El Amrani as Fouad, a friend of Yachine and elder brother of Ghislaine (Yachine's love interest) * Badr Chakir as Khalil, Yachine's happy- go-lucky friend who fails to embrace radical Islam * Mohammed Taleb as Abou Zoubeir, the charismatic leader of the Sidi Moumen radical cell * Mohamed Mabrouk as Nouceir, Yachine's former childhood enemy who has embraced radical Islam * Imane Benennia as Ghislaine, Fouad's sister and the girl Tarek loves * Abdallah Ouzzad as Ba'Moussa, the obese and abusive repair shop owner ==Release and awards== The film competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.

It is managed by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. The Common is about 100 acres and is divided roughly in half by 'The Turnpike' B1113 road to Norwich. A stream also crosses the Common. It is said to have remained largely unchanged for 800 years, and was the subject of a dispute when in 1597 the neighboring parish of Carleton Rode claimed part of the common which led to a map which records the settlement. New Buckenham Common map The land belongs to and is managed by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. Much of the North Side is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) with rare plants including Green Winged Orchids. There are also clay pits where marl has been historically dug for building. The Common is also an ancient grazing pasture grazed annually by cattle due to the continued tradition of about 79 'Common Rights' that are actively managed by their owners and pooled for letting to the grazier to continue the tradition. The 'Common Rights' entitle their owners to graze 'a horse, mare or neat beast' (an animal of cloven hoof such as cattle). Historically there was great demand for the annual letting of the Common Rights, which were auctioned for the year's grazing, each Spring, because the grazing of cattle was popular amongst local farmers or householders who might own a beast as a group. Cattle became an important aspect of the region's farming economy after the decline of the wool and sheep trade in the 18th century. Originally the Rights were allocated amongst local houses, in 1770, and are therefore held as whole rights or 14th fractions of rights. By the mid 1960s the demand had fallen and the Rightholders formed a group and have continued to let the rights privately to a grazier direct.

Its range broadly follows the Tennessee River from above Knoxville, Tennessee, to the mouth of the Duck River. Historically the species was found in Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia. The preferred habitat of flame chub is in small flowing streams often associated with springs. ==Anatomy and appearance== The flame chub can be characterized by a deep caudal peduncle, short head and snout, small slightly subterminal mouth, and a barely compressed body. The dorsal fin originates slightly behind the pelvic fin origin. 7 - 8 anal soft rays, incomplete lateral line with 38 - 44 lateral scales, fewer than half of scales pored, pharyngeal teeth 2,5-4,2. Coloration is olive on the upper half of the body with a dark stripe along the back and dark streaks, bordered by a light stripe then black stripe ending at black caudal spot or wedge. White to red below, with bright scarlet along anterior third of body and at base of dorsal fin in large fish (primarily males) and silver peritoneum flecked with black. Males are more colorful than females, and both sexes are more colorful during spawning season. Flame chubs can grow to a maximum of long.Page, L.M. and B.M. Burr, 1991. A field guide to freshwater fishes of North America north of Mexico. Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston. 434 p. ==Geographic distribution== Due to habitat alteration and destruction, the flame chub currently has a patchy range. The species primarily occurs in the Tennessee River Valley from the Knoxville, Tennessee area downstream through Alabama to the mouth of the Duck River in Tennessee. The majority of the population in Alabama resides in the Highland Rim or Cumberland Plateau regions. A single isolated population occurs in north Georgia in the Tiger Creek watershed of Catoosa County. In Alabama (which comprises approximately 50% of the remaining range of this species), only two populations are on public protected land, with the rest of the flame chub's habitat occurring on privately owned land. As such, the survival and further assessment of this species in Alabama is almost totally reliant on cooperation with private land owners. ==Ecology== While often cited by literature that the flame chub inhabits spring-fed streams, shallow seepage waters, and springs, usually over gravel in areas of abundant aquatic vegetation, substrate the species found over can vary from bedrock to rubble to mud and may be found in areas of low flow near the bank of large streams. A study by P. W. Shute notes that although the flame chub is often described as a spring-dwelling species, only 37 of 231 collection localities were springs. Despite this, the species can still be found primarily in association with spring heads, as most collection localities are found within watersheds that are fed by springs. Most documented records of this species are found in small streams. It has been hypothesized that this species is migratory within its range, either travelling from its native stream to headwaters for spawning, or existing in metapopulations with the springs serving as both sources for the stream localities and as refugia. It has also been observed that adult flame chubs may aggregate in flooded fields and pastures for spawning. Due to the fragile nature of springs and their tributaries, human expansion has caused further disjunction in the range of this already narrow endemic species. As of 2014, IUCN considers this species to be Near Threatened due to ongoing threats from introduced non-native fish species and human habitat alteration. The temperature of sampled streams where flame chubs are known to occur ranged from 24 °C (75.2 °F) in July to 8 °C (35.6 °F) in February. TDS varied from 17 to 213 ppm, with a pH ranging from 6.4 to 8.2. In 1990, Sossamon recorded that a flame chub population in east Tennessee was normally found associated with aquatic vegetation such as swamp smartweed, small pondweed, and watercress. The flame chub almost exclusively (77-100% of the contents of the digestive tract) eats dipteran larvae and pupae. Gastropods, aquatic oligochaetes, hemipterans, and cladocerans are also taken occasionally. The occurrence of seeds, sand grains, and detritus in the gut of the flame chub indicates that flame chubs feed on or near the substrate. In observations in aquaria, the flame chub pecks at the substrate. ==Life history== One Tennessee study of flame chub hatching found that hatching began in early May (and possibly earlier) and continued through late May.Bettoli, Phillip W.; Goldsworthy, Cory. 2011. Larval Fish Dynamics in Spring Pools in Middle Tennessee. Southeastern Naturalist: 145-154. Gravel is a very important factor in the breeding patterns of these fish, as it is necessary for filtration of extremely clean water as well as bottom stability for a species that spends a lot of its time in the benthos area of the stream.Lachner, EA. 1950. The Comparative Food Habits of the Cyprinid Fishes Nocomis bigguttatus and Nocomis micropogon in Western New York. Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences 40:229-236.Etnier, D.A. and W.C. Starnes, 1993. The fishes of Tennessee. The University of Tennessee Press, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA. (pls. check date). No data are available pertaining to the species' lifespan. ==Conservation and management== This species is currently listed as near threatened according to the IUCN Red List.(9) A study done near Chattanooga, Tennessee showed that where oxygen levels were high, and where well-forested rocky watersheds were found, that the density of the Flame Chub as well as similar fish were much higher.Long, J; Schorr, MS. 2005. Effects of watershed urban land use on environmental conditions and fish assemblages in Chattanooga area streams (Tennessee-Georgia). Journal of Freshwater Ecology: 527-537. Habitat destruction is one of the main causes of the decline of this species. It is sensitive to alteration of its habitat, and is now extirpated from Kentucky, and close to extirpation in Georgia. A 2007 survey in north Alabama recovered flame chubs at only 19 of 53 localities that in the 1960s still had populations. Many sites were obviously degraded by forms of land use change such as putting a stream in a concrete culvert, or paving over part of a stream. ==References== Category:Chubs (fish) Category:Leuciscinae Category:Fish described in 1870 Category:Freshwater fish of the United States Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Freshwater fish of North America ","title":"Flame chub"},{"id":"35873183","text":"This is a list of listed buildings in the parish of Udny in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. == List == } == Key  See also == * List of listed buildings in Aberdeenshire ==NotesReferences== * All entries, addresses and coordinates are based on data from Historic Scotland.

It is a former railway embankment which is now a nature reserve managed by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. It is 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) south of Narborough, on the A47 going east from King's Lynn to Swaffham, and it can be entered by a car park west of the reserve. It was documented in 1847 as an area with much chalk and flints. ==Geology== The area is made of chalk grassland, which grew when Great Eastern Railways engineers cleared the area. The underlying chalk was only exposed when they dug a borrow pit next to an embankment. ==Railway line== The Lynn and Dereham Railway, which weaved a route to East Dereham via Narborough and Swaffham, was given the Royal Assent on 21 July 1845. It opened in stages between 1846 and 1848.Oppitz 2002, p. 17. This later became part of the Great Eastern Railway. Only the section of line between King's Lynn and Narborough was opened under the L&DR;, on 17 October 1846. The remainder of the line was opened in stages by the L&DR;'s immediate successor, the East Anglian Railway. The East Anglian Line was opened in August 1847, after three and a half years of construction. Narborough joined this, and initially went to Lynn, then expanded to Narborough and to Swaffham. The railway was first used by the post office to deliver post around Norfolk. The railway operated between Dereham and King's Lynn and was closed in 1960. The railway was on the King's Lynn to Norwich line. In 1958, Narborough Railway Line hired their first full-time stationmaster, Rod Lock, who at the time was a relief stationmaster for the whole of Norfolk. He had to deal with the severe 1958 blizzards, which buried some of the trains. ==Wildlife== At Narborough Railway Line there are 26 species of butterfly recorded and there are a large quantity of birds in the summer months. The reserve is closed when there are sheep on the site. The most common birds are blackcap, chiffchaff and common whitethroat. In the summer there are turtle doves and in the winter there are blackbirds, fieldfare and redwing. In the earlier half of the year (spring and summer), these are often popular sights: grizzled skipper, brown argus, purple hairstreak, eyebright, small scabious, kidney vetch, dingy, grayling, large thyme, marjoram autumn gentian and carline thistle. In the later half of the year (autumn and winter), purging buckthorns are popular. ==References== Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Norfolk Category:Norfolk Wildlife Trust Category:Protected areas of Norfolk Category:Railway lines opened in 1843 Category:Railway lines closed in 1960 Category:1843 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Narborough Railway Line"},{"id":"35873244","text":"This is a list of listed buildings in the parish of Monifieth in Angus, Scotland. == List == } == Key  See also == * List of listed buildings in Angus ==NotesReferences== * All entries, addresses and coordinates are based on data from Historic Scotland.

The Norfolk Wildlife Trust, which manages this reserve, bought it in 1998. It is in size. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade 2, and a National Nature Reserve. ==Location and history== Foxley Wood is north-west of Norwich, away from the Fakenham road (the A1067), near Honeypot Wood. The nature reserve is currently the largest ancient woodland and coppice in Norfolk. The woodland is recorded in Domesday Book and parts of it are known to be over 6,000 years old. For the past 1,000 years, it was a source of wood (including hazel), but demand decreased in the 20th century. Because of the drop in demand, Foxley Wood became neglected. In the 1990s it was privately owned and managed by the Forestry Commission, and was acquired by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust in 1998. It is open to the public every day except Thursday. Hyacinthoides non-scripta (common bluebell) ==Flora and fauna== The woodland is rich in flora with over 250 species recorded. These include herb paris, early purple orchid, lily of the valley, common bluebell, dog's mercury, purple hairstreak, meadowsweet, water avens, fleabane (common name for flowering plants in family Asteraceae) and meadow brown. Bluebells are among the main attractions for visitors in spring. Trees growing in the reserve include oak (found in the centre of the wood on sandy ground Conifers were planted throughout as timber, disturbing the original distribution of stand types; they are being removed. Areas have been indiscriminately sprayed with herbicides in the past. Fauna include insects such as dark bush-crickets, white admiral and ringlet butterflies, and bird species such as sparrowhawks, tawny owls, great spotted woodpeckers and European green woodpeckers. Songbirds and sparrowhawks are popular sights. Besides conifer planting, spraying with herbicides, and the cutting of all saleable trees (before the Forestry Commission began managing the wood), the wood is damaged by roads and ditches resulting from timber exploitation: \\"Foxley Wood has been badly damaged by modern forestry.\\" ==References== Category:Forests and woodlands of Norfolk Category:Norfolk Wildlife Trust Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Norfolk ","title":"Foxley Wood"},{"id":"35873287","text":"This is a list of listed buildings in the parish of Inverarity in Angus, Scotland. == List == } == Key  See also == * List of listed buildings in Angus ==NotesReferences== * All entries, addresses and coordinates are based on data from Historic Scotland.

Here he studied the violin with the German violinist Juan Ehiert and in 1933, when Carlos Gardel gave a concert in Campana, Francini and his friend Héctor Stamponi, the same age as him, presented Gardel with a tango which the friends, had composed together. == Musical career == Francini started his musical career when he joined the orchestra of Elhert, which included Héctor Stamponi and Armando Pontier, and performed on a well-known afternoon programme on Radio Prieto. He would later form a trio with Stamponi and Pontier to play on Radio Argentina. Later he joined the orchestra of Miguel Caló which included musicians such as Osmar Maderna, Domingo Federico, Carlos Lazzari and Armando Pontier. In 1945 Francini and Pontier formed the Orquesta Francini-Pontier which played together successfully for the next ten years and made 120 records, 34 of which were instrumentals, starting with the recording of the tango Margot made on 29 January 1946. Inspired by Aníbal Troilo, the orchestra evolved instrumentally with tangos such as Arrabal, La beba, Lo que vendrá, Pa'que se acuerden de mí, Para lucirse, Pichuco, Tigre viejo and A Zárate. During these ten years the singers that accompanied the orchestra alternated between Alberto Podestá, Raúl Berón, Roberto Rufino, Julio Sosa, Pablo Moreno, Roberto Florio, Héctor Montes and Luis Correa. After this he set up a duo with Hector Stamponi, whilst at the same time establishing his own orchestra with the pianist Juan Jose Paz, the bandoneonist Julio Ahumada and the singer Alberto Podestá . Lasting less than one year, the orchestra made various recordings starting with La trilla by Eduardo Arolas, and Petit Salón with music by Vicente Demarco and lyrics by Silvio Marinucci, on 3 November 1955 for the recording company RCA Records. Outstanding within Francini’s repertoire were Tema otoñal and his solos in Inspiración and Sensiblero. In 1954 he took part in a homage to Juan Carlos Cobián in a quintet comprising the tango musicians Aníbal Troilo on bandoneon, Roberto Grela on guitar, Kicho Díaz on double bass and Horacio Salgán on piano. The following year he joined Astor Piazzolla’s Octeto Buenos Aires with the bandoneons of Piazzolla and Roberto Pansera (later replaced by Leopoldo Federico), the violin of Hugo Baralis, the cello of José Bragato, the double bass of Aldo Nicolini (later replaced by Juan Vasallo), the electric guitar of Horacio Malvicino and the piano of Atilio Stampone. The Octeto would pioneer nuevo tango and put Piazzolla on a collision course with the tango establishment. Next he formed the Quinteto Real with Horacio Salgán, Pedro Laurenz and Ubaldo de Lío and also set up an orchestra, Los Astros del Tango, with Elvino Vardaro to record tango compositions of the top tango composers of the time, with arrangements by Argentino Galván. Francini also participated in Los Violines de Oro del Tango, a tango ensemble, which like the previous one, consisted mainly of strings. In 1963 he joined the pianist Orlando Trípodi, together with Armando Pontier, Domingo Federico, Alberto Podestá and Raúl Berón in La Orquesta de las Estrellas, directed by Miguel Caló and later in 1970 he formed a sextet, with the bandoneonist Néstor Marconi in charge of arrangements, which appeared at Caño 14 in Buenos Aires, on television and recorded an album. The Francini-Pontier orchestra was reformed in 1973 and toured Japan with the singer Alba Solís and musicians including Omar Murtgh, Néstor Marconi and Omar Valente. In 1977 the orchestra went on another tour there, this time staging a show with more than 20 musicians and tango dancers. On his return, Francini organised a symphony orchestra which staged the show Tangos por el mundo in the Teatro Alvear in Avenida Corrientes. He was musician who, in parallel with his activities in the world of tango, played as a first violin in the Buenos Aires Philharmonic until his death. He was also active in the Argentine Society of Authors and Music Composers (SADAIC). He died of a heart attack on 27 August 1978 in the middle of a performance of Nostagias in Caño 14. ==Tango compositions== Francini composed the music for the following tangos: *Mañana iré tempranohttps://tango.info/T0370203169 *Bajo un cielo de estrellashttps://tango.info/T0370159606 *La vi llegar (lyrics by Julian Centeya, 1944).https://tango.info/T0370211667 *Junto a tu corazónhttps://tango.info/T0370179580 *Inquietudhttps://tango.info/T0370015294 *Ese muchacho Troilohttps://tango.info/T0372171260 *Tema otoñalhttps://tango.info/T0370400626 ==Discography== Francini made recordings with various orchestras and for a number of different record labels including: *Mañana iré temprano and Sans Souci, Miguel Caló Orchestra, Odeón. *Delirio, Pecado and A los amigos, Francini-Pontier Orchestra, Víctor. *Mi refugio, Tema otoñal and Marrón y azul, Octeto Buenos Aires, Allegro and Disc-Jockey. *Milonguita, Copacabana and Tiernamente, Los Astros del Tango, Music-Hall. *Organito de la tarde, El arranque and Ya no cantas chingolo, Quinteto Real, Columbia, == Filmography == *La sombra de Safo (1957) *Cuidado con las imitaciones *La diosa impura (1963) ==References== *Gobello, José, Mujeres y hombres que hicieron el tango, Centro Editor de Cultura Argentina, Buenos Aires, 2002. *Piazzolla, Ástor.

Pelusios castaneus is a freshwater species and is endemic to West and Central Africa. ==Taxonomy== Pelusios seychellensis lectotype The so-called Seychelles black terrapin, Seychelles mud turtle, or Seychelles terrapin was considered a species of turtle (Pelusios seychellensis) in the family Pelomedusidae, endemic to Seychelles. Genetic analysis of the lectotype has shown, however, that this turtle was never a separate species, and is in fact Pelusios castaneus. It is possible that specimens were confused in a private collection before being acquired by the Zoological Museum Hamburg in 1901, or else mislabeled there. ==Distribution== The West African mud turtle is found in the following countries of West and Central Africa: Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Príncipe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo. Additionally, it has been introduced to Guadeloupe. ==Ecology== The West African mud turtle is carnivorous and feeds on aquatic prey. There are five phases to feeding; preliminary head fixation on the prey, fine-tuning the head fixation, final approach by the head, grasping of the prey followed by manipulation and transportation, and suction, resulting in ingestion after which the prey is swallowed. The final phase varies according to whether the prey is fast-moving, like a fish, or slow-moving like a gastropod mollusc. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * ==External links== * Pelusios castaneus West African mud turtle.

It was led by the Turkish National Movement, as opposed to the crumbling Constantinople Government, which was led by the Ottoman Sultan. During the War of Independence, the Government of the Grand National Assembly commanded the army known as Kuva-yi Milliye (\\"National Forces\\"). After the war and victory over the monarchist Constantinople Government, the republican Ankara Government declared the end of the Ottoman Empire and the creation of the Republic of Turkey from its ashes in 1923. The Grand National Assembly is today the parliamentary body of Turkey. ==Background== At the time the Ankara Government was proclaimed, there existed another Turkish government in the Allied-occupied Constantinople (now Istanbul), namely the Imperial Ottoman Government, often known as the \\"Constantinople Government\\" (as opposed to the nationalist Ankara Government). Once the Grand National Assembly was established, on 23 April 1920, without rejecting at first the legitimacy of the Ottoman Sultanate, the new parliament in Ankara formed its own government within the Assembly. The Ministers were called \\"Vekil\\" (Acting) instead of the conventional \\"Nazır\\", to keep with the provisional nature of the government. The Ankara Government was founded to represent Turkey because the de jure capital, Constantinople, was under occupation. President of the GNA (renamed the Grand National Assembly of Turkey after 8 February 1921) and later of the Republic of Turkey, was Mustafa Kemal. Once the Armistice of Mudanya was signed, replacing the Armistice of Mundros (signed by the Ottoman Empire in 1918 at the end of World War I) and ending the Turkish War of Independence, the GNA abolished the imperial Sultanate, which was accused of collaborating with the Allies during the occupation of Turkey. The Sphere on 1–5 March 1921: The Angora Government and its Claims The Kemalists or Nationalists control more or less effectively the area shaded. They have been driven away from the Aegean by the Greeks, but claim Thrace, Smyrna, Armenia, and all Mesopotamia down to the Persian Gulf The Constantinople Government, representing the Ottoman sultanate and the old imperial and monarchical order, initially refused to recognize the Turkish national movement and the Government of the Grand National Assembly in Ankara, holding that it alone was the legitimate government of the Ottoman Empire. It attempted to militarily defeat the Ankara Government using its Kuva-yi Inzibatiye, commonly known as the \\"Army of the Caliphate\\" (as opposed to the GNA's forces, the Kuva-yi Milliye, \\"Army of the Nation\\"), but failed to do so. In 1921, diplomatic teams from both the monarchist Constantinople Government and the republican Ankara Government appeared at the Conference of London. In a surprising move, however, the Ottoman diplomatic team led by Ahmet Tevfik Pasha gave in and allowed the Turkish diplomatic team led by Bekir Sami Kunduh to be the sole representatives of the country at the conference. The Treaty of Lausanne was signed on 24 July 1923, between the representatives of the Allies and of Ankara, thus officially recognizing the government of Ankara as the legitimate Turkish government. On 29 October, the Republic of Turkey was proclaimed by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. ==The governments== The governments prior to the Republic were used to be called \\"Executive ministers of Turkey.\\" They were: *1st cabinet of the Executive Ministers of Turkey *2nd cabinet of the Executive Ministers of Turkey *3rd cabinet of the Executive Ministers of Turkey *4th cabinet of the Executive Ministers of Turkey *5th cabinet of the Executive Ministers of Turkey ==See also== * Turkish National Movement * Armistice of Mudanya * Turkish War of Independence * Abolition of the Ottoman sultanate ==References * History of the Grand National Assembly Category:States and territories established in 1920 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1923 Category:Angora Vilayet Category:Turkish War of Independence Category:1920 in the Ottoman Empire Category:1921 in the Ottoman Empire Category:1922 in the Ottoman Empire Category:1923 in Turkey Category:Provisional governments ","title":"Government of the Grand National Assembly"},{"id":"35873487","text":"This is a list of listed buildings in the parish of Kilchoman on Islay in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. == List == } == Key  See also == * List of listed buildings in Argyll and Bute ==NotesReferences== * All entries, addresses and coordinates are based on data from Historic Scotland.

Around 1437, she translated and edited four French romances () by Odo Arpin of Bourges, Sibille, Loher & Maller and Hug Chapler. == Life == Elizabeth was the daughter of Frederick of Lorraine (1368-1415) and Margaret of Joinville ( - 1418). In 1412, she became the second wife of Count Philip I of Nassau-Weilburg- Saarbrücken (1368-1429). After his death in 1429 to 1438 she took over the regency for her infant son, Philip II (1418-1492) of the Nassau-Saarbrücken territory, the areas along the middle Saar, along the Blies, in eastern Lorraine, in today's Donnersbergkreis, around the city of Kirchheimbolanden, in the Taunus area, along the Lahn as well as Commercy in Lorraine on the Meuse. She managed to keep her possessions together and to avoid disputes with her many neighbours. During her rule, Saarbrücken was developed into a residence town. She resided at Saarbrücken Castle on the Castle Rock with its steep slope towards the Saar. Until then, the territory had had no centralized administration, and its rulers had travelled constantly between their scattered possessions, in order to maintain their claim to power by being physically present some of the time in each and every possession (\\"rule by travelling around\\"). Elisabeth died on 17 January 1456. Contrary to the customs of the ancient Counts of Saarbrücken, who were buried in Wadgassen, Elisabeth chose to be buried in the Collegiate Church in Sankt Arnual, which is now part of Saarbrücken. For the next 200 years, all Counts of Nassau- Saarbrücken would be buried here. == Legacy == Elisabeth took care of her inheritance during her lifetime. In 1439, she divided her possessions among her two sons. The elder son, Philip II received the territories on the right bank of the Rhine; the younger son, John II received the territories on the left bank. Apparently John II, unlike his brother, was interested in his mother's literary activities. Among other things, he had magnificent manuscripts made of the novels his mother had translated These manuscripts and early printed copies are now held by the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel and the State and University Library in Hamburg. In April 2007, a large poster exhibition of Elisabeth's novels was held in Saarbrücken, in the framework of the city's participation in the activities of Luxembourg as Cultural Capital of Europe. A European Writers' Congress in Saarbrücken on 16 October 2007 had as its motto , with which Elisabeth began her translations. == Marriage and issue == Elisabeth was the second wife of Count Philip I of Nassau-Weilburg- Saarbrücken (1368-1429) and had the following children with him: # Philip II of Nassau-Weilburg # John II of Nassau-Saarbrücken # Johannetta (d. 1 February 1481, Römhild), married on 22 June 1422 to Count George I of Henneberg # Margarete (26 April 1426 - 5 May 1490), married in 1441 to Gerhard of Rodemachern == References == * * * Bernhard Burchert: Die Anfänge des Prosaromans in Deutschland.

His works are usually literary fiction, speculative fiction or science fiction. Born in 1972 in Sapporo. He graduated from the physics department of Tohoku University, then went on to the graduate school at University of Tokyo and received Ph.D. for a mathematical physical study on the natural languages. He worked as a post-doc researcher at several research institutes for seven years, then abandoned the academic career in 2007 and found a programmer job at a software firm (resigns in 2008 to become a full-time writer). In 2006, he submitted Self-Reference ENGINE to a science-fiction novel contest Komatsu Sakyō Award. Although it did not win the award (none did in this year), it was published from Hayakawa Shobō in 2007. At almost same time, his short story \\"Obu za bēsbōru\\" (\\"Of The Baseball\\") won the contest of literary magazine Bungakukai, which became his debut in literary fiction. His literary fictions are often dense with allusions. Labyrinthine annotations were added to \\"Uyūshitan\\" when it was published in book form in 2009, where there were none when published initially in literary magazine. Often, his science fiction works take motif from mathematics. The narrator of \\"Boy's Surface\\" (2007) is a morphism, and the title is a reference to a geometrical notion. In \\"Moonshine\\" (2009), natural numbers are sentient through a savant's mind's eye in a field of the monster group. Project Itoh's Genocidal Organ was also a finalist of Komatsu Sakyō Award contest and published from Hayakawa Shobō in 2007, along with Enjoe's Self-Reference ENGINE. Since then they often appeared together at science fiction conventions and interviews, and collaborated in a few works, until Itoh's death of cancer in 2009. At the press conference after the announcement of Enjoe's Akutagawa Prize in January 2012, he revealed the plan to complete Itoh's unfinished novel Shisha no teikoku. It was published in August 2012, and received the Special Award of Nihon SF Taisho. == Awards == ;Japanese Awards * 2010: Noma Prize for New Writers for Uyūshitan * 2012: Akutagawa Prize for \\"Dōkeshi no chō (Harlequin's Butterfly)\\" * 2012: Nihon SF Taisho Special Award for Shisha no teikoku (The Empire of Corpses) (with Project Itoh) * 2013: Seiun Award Japanese Long Form for Shisha no teikoku (with Project Itoh) * 2017: for \\"Mojika\\" * 2018: Nihon SF Taisho for Mojika (The Disaster of Characters) ;U.S. Award * 2014: Philip K.

Swamp tupelo grows chiefly in the coastal plains from Delaware, eastern Maryland, and southeastern Virginia, south to southern Florida and west to eastern Texas. Its range extends north up the Mississippi Valley to southern Arkansas and west and south Tennessee. The swamp tupelo grows in humid warm climates. It not only tolerates flooding but actually thrives under those conditions. It is seldom found on sites that are not inundated much of the growing season. Swamp tupelo grows in headwater swamps, strands, ponds, river bottoms, bays, estuaries, and low coves. Normally it does not grow in the deeper parts of swamps or overflow river bottoms. The type of water regime is more important to growth of swamp tupelo than the soil type. Best growth is achieved on sites where the soil is continuously saturated with very shallow moving water. Growth can be reduced as much as 50 percent when the water is stagnant, as in ponds. Intermittent flooding, with periodic drying cycles, or continuous deep flooding even by moving water, also reduces growth. Trees and shrubs commonly associated with swamp tupelo are red maple (Acer rubrum), buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), buckwheat-tree (Cliftonia monophylla), dogwood (Cornus spp.), swamp cyrilla (Cyrilla racemiflora), swamp-privet (Forestiera acuminata), Carolina ash (Fraxinus caroliniana), loblolly-bay (Gordonia lasianthus), dahoon (Ilex cassine), inkberry (I. glabra), yaupon (I. vomitoria), fetterbush lyonia (Lyonia lucida), and bayberry (Myrica spp.). The swamp tupelo has minute greenish-white flowers that appear in the spring with the leaves, usually in late April. Insects, primarily bees, are the major pollinating vector, but pollen is also spread by wind. The fruit, a drupe, changes from green to a dark blue as it ripens, usually in early November. The seeds normally overwinter and germinate the following spring. Germination does not take place under water, but submerged seeds germinate once the water subsides below the soil surface. Germination is rapid in moist, drained conditions at and higher. After germination, seedlings must grow rapidly to keep the apex and leaves above water, because prolonged submergence during active growth will kill them. Submergence during the dormant season, however, has no adverse effect. Swamp tupelo normally develops a taproot and has a swollen base to the mean height of the growing season water level. Water roots, which develop under flooded conditions, help support the tree and capture nutrients. These specialized roots tolerate high carbon dioxide concentrations, oxidize the rhizosphere, and carry on anaerobic respiration. Thus, they are the key to the species ability to thrive under flooded conditions. ==References== biflora Category:Plants described in 1788 Category:Trees of the Eastern United States Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States ","title":"Nyssa biflora"},{"id":"35873744","text":"This is a list of listed buildings in the civil parish of Old Luce in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. == List == } == Key NotesReferences== * All entries, addresses and coordinates are based on data from Historic Scotland.

In 1967 Princeton University president Robert F. Goheen announced in The Daily Princetonian that \\"It is inevitable that, at some point in the future, Princeton is going to move into the education of women.\\"\\"Goheen: 'Coeducation Is Inevitable'\\", The Daily Princetonian, 17 May 1967. Retrieved 14 June 2012. Women were first accepted in 1969: 40 members of the class of 1973 and 90 transfer students. In 1887, the university actually maintained and staffed a sister college, Evelyn College for Women, in the town of Princeton on Evelyn and Nassau streets. It was closed after roughly a decade of operation. After abortive discussions with Sarah Lawrence College to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the University in 1967, the administration decided to admit women and turned to the issue of transforming the school's operations and facilities into a female-friendly campus. The administration had barely finished these plans in April 1969 when the admissions office began mailing out its acceptance letters. Its five-year coeducation plan provided $7.8 million for the development of new facilities that would eventually house and educate 650 women students at Princeton by 1974. Ultimately, 148 women, consisting of 100 freshmen and transfer students of other years, entered Princeton on September 6, 1969 amidst much media attention. Princeton enrolled its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meservey, as a PhD candidate in Turkish history in 1961. A handful of undergraduate women had studied at Princeton from 1963 on, spending their junior year there to study \\"critical languages\\" in which Princeton's offerings surpassed those of their home institutions. They were considered regular students for their year on campus, but were not candidates for a Princeton degree. As a result of a 1979 lawsuit by Sally Frank, Princeton's eating clubs were required to go coeducational in 1991, after Tiger Inn's appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied. In 1987, the university changed the gendered lyrics of “Old Nassau” to reflect the school's co-educational student body. In 2009-11, Professor Nannerl O. Keohane chaired a committee on undergraduate women's leadership at Princeton, appointed by President Shirley M. Tilghman.https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S30/05/88Q71/index.xml ==Women in World War II Defense Courses== In 1942, Princeton started allowing women in some US-government funded defense courses on topics such as photogrammetry and map-making. According to the student newspaper, the reason for this change was a great need by the government for map-makers and other \\"sub-professional engineering\\" positions, which were open to women. The course was offered free of charge but required multiple years of college training or equivalent experience as a pre-requisite and everyone who completed the program was eligible for immediate employment with the National Defense Mapping program. There were 23 women in the very first class. 87 classes followed, with a total of 482 women out of 3619 students overall in the courses in the Engineering, Science, and Management War Training program sponsored by the US Department of Education. ==Cooperative Program in Critical Languages== In 1963 Princeton began hosting the Cooperative Program in Critical Languages, which was a project to admit students from 32 participating schools for 2-4 semesters starting after their sophomore year at their home university.She Flourishes - Chapters in the History of Princeton Women, an exhibit at Princeton University with content taken from Historical Subject Files, Campus Life. 2012. The students in the program were expected to return to graduate at their home universities after completion of the program. The project was supported with a Ford Foundation grant. The program offered language and cultural studies in Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Russian, Persian, and Turkish. In the first year 35 students applied and 10 were female. Of those, 14 were admitted to the program and 5 were women. Soon after the program started girls began making requests to transfer into the program as seniors rather than after their sophomore year. The girls \\"requested, begged, and pleaded\\" to be able to transfer during senior years, and \\"after discussing among themselves plans for a nude-in in Nassau Hall the administrators decided to reverse decisions\\" to disallow this practice. ==Female Faculty during Early Coeducation== A number of female faculty were hired during the coeducation period. * Joan S.

He was the oldest of five siblings. He studied art in Germany and England from 1881 to 1883. In 1883, he founded the bookstore Olaf Huseby & Olaf Olsen Boghandel jointly with Olaf Norli in Kristiania (now Oslo). The collaboration eventually failed and two split in 1890. Olaf Norlis started Olaf Norlis Bokhandel and Olaf Norlis Forlag which combined a bookstore with a publishing house. Huseby next ran his own firm Huseby & Co in cooperation with Johan Sørensen. The company published books such as Skram's novel Constance Ring, Krohg's confiscated novel Albertine, and the periodicals Nyt Tidsskrift and Kringsjaa. In 1903, Huseby emigrated to America with his family. He established the Olaf Huseby Publishing House in Minneapolis, Minnesota which remained active from 1904-1935. In retirement, Olaf Huseby and his wife Ingeborg Skjegstad Huseby (1861-1945), established their home in Hillsdale, Michigan.

For points moving in a plane, the kinetic convex hull data structure can be used as a basis for a responsive, compact and efficient kinetic minimum box data structure. ==2D case== The 2D kinetic minimum box builds on the 2D kinetic convex hull in a manner similar to the kinetic width data structure which maintains the pair of minimum-distance parallel lines that have the entire point set between them. In this case, since a box consists of two pairs of parallel lines (that are perpendicular to each other), analogy can be made with running two perpendicular kinetic width problems, and the data-structure needs to maintain sets of four points two antipodal pairs which have perpendicular supporting lines. In the dual view where a point maps to a line , four envelopes (left, right, upper, lower) are computed. The range in x-values of a line segment in one of these envelopes corresponds to the range in the supporting slopes of the corresponding convex hull vertex in the primal view. Thus, an interval where the x-values of the four envelopes lists overlap (which can be obtained by merging the lists) corresponds, in the primal view, to a slope range where all lines parallel and perpendicular to the slopes support the same four convex hull vertices. The minimum box (in terms of area or perimeter) can be easily computed for each slope range and the four vertices thus supported, and then the global minimum box can be found by minimizing over these intervals. This algorithm can be kinetized by maintaining the convex hull in a kinetic convex hull data structure, the merge of the four envelope lists in a kinetic sorted list and the boxes in a kinetic priority queue. ==Analysis== The responsiveness and compactness of this data structure follow from those of the kinetic convex hull, kinetic sorted list and kinetic priority queue data structures. This is also efficient since the number of combinatorially different minimum boxes for points is O(n^{2+\\\\epsilon}). The existence of a local data structure for this problem is an open problem. ==References== Category:Kinetic data structures Category:Geometric data structures ","title":"Kinetic minimum box"},{"id":"35873896","text":"This is a list of listed buildings in the former burgh of Milngavie in East Dunbartonshire, Scotland.

Bales was born in Florida in and raised in Georgia. After leaving school, she worked as a seamstress and dance instructor, and in 1926 bought her first motorcycle, a new Harley-Davidson Model B. She taught herself to ride on this motorcycle, and took her first long tour of 300 miles with a female friend from her home in Albany, Georgia to St. Petersburg, Florida, Florida. The Model B was a 350 cc, single cylinder, side-valve, with a manually shifted three speed engine with a battery, and not a magneto ignition, and a fully floating seat. It was brought out to compete with the successful Indian Prince model and was called \\"the peashooter\\" for the sound of its exhaust.The Complete Harley Davidson: A Model–By–Model History of the American Motorcycle. Tod Rafferty. Crestline Imprints, 23 Mar 1997 One of the first 'streamline' models, it sold for around $235.Illustrated Directory of Harley-Davidson Motorcycles, Tod Rafferty, MotorBooks International, 1 Dec 2001 A Florida Harley-Davidson dealer heard the adventure, leading to a feature about it in the St. Petersburg, Florida newspaper, and then in the Atlanta Journal. Bales, planning longer journeys, traded in her Model B for a 1929 flathead engine D-series, Harley-Davidson's first ' motorcycle. She wrote to Hap Jameson, then editor of The Harley- Davidson Enthusiast magazine, telling him about her plans to make a longer solo trip. The Enthusiast motorcycle magazine was first published in 1916, 13 years after the first Harley-Davidson motorcycles built. Despite Bales only being 5 feet 2 inches and 95 pounds and unable to kickstart the bike on her own, Jameson appointed Bales as the official goodwill \\"Enthusiast Girl\\" and while Harley-Davidson did not finance her journey, arrangements were made for Harley-Davidson dealers, Rotary Clubs and others on the route to provide accommodation, fuel, and maintenance. Having only been riding for 3 years and aged 20 years old, Bales started on 1 June 1929, taking 78 days to cover about 5,000 miles alone from Albany, Georgia to the Harley-Davidson factory in Milwaukee. On the way back, she traveled through Canada, Manhattan, the Carolinas and Washington, D.C. In Washington, Senator William J. Harris arranged for her to meet President Herbert Hoover wearing her trademark all white riding breeches, shirt, helmet, socks and sweater with \\"The Enthusiast Girl\\" across its chest. On the way, as a goodwill ambassador, she met many local dignitaries. Bales became the first motorcycle magazine cover girl on the May and November 1929 editions, and her journeys were well documented in the December 1929 issue and by local papers all over the USA. She later became a stunt rider at motorcycle races in Tallahassee, Florida. At her 23 December 2001 funeral, aged 92, she was honored by a procession of Harley-Davidsons. To Arthur Davidson she was \\"The Georgia Peach\\". For Bales, the motorcycle was a \\"key to the whole United States\\". Her adventurous spirit reacted against the received wisdom of the day that no woman should ride one. She married William Faison and adopted 3 children. Her last ride was at the age of 86. ==NotesReferences== * * The Harley-Davidson Enthusiast, May, November and December 1929 * * Pioneers on Two Wheels, Harley-Davidson * * * Category:Women motorcyclists Category:Motorcycle stunt performers Category:Women stunt performers Category:1909 births Category:2001 deaths ","title":"Vivian Bales"},{"id":"35873900","text":"This is a list of listed buildings in the parish of Bearsden in East Dunbartonshire, Scotland. == List == } == Key  See also == * List of listed buildings in East Dunbartonshire ==NotesReferences== * All entries, addresses and coordinates are based on data from Historic Scotland.

Its two components are separated at angular distance 9.81 arcsec, corresponding to a projected separation 89.3 ± 1.5 a. u. The system's orbit semi-major axis estimate is 104 a. u. ===Component A=== The primary (brighter) component (SDSS J141624.08+134826.7 is mainly its designation; also known as SDSS J1416+13A) is a brown dwarf of spectral type sdL7, or L6, or L5, or d/sdL7. It has unusually blue near-infrared J−KS color. According to Cushing et al. 2010, its peculiar spectrum is primarily a result of thin condensate clouds, and also vertical mixing occurs in its atmosphere. However, in Burgasser et al., 2010 it was suggested that its (as well as component's B) peculiarities arise from age or metallicity, rather than cloud properties alone (since both A and B components have common peculiarities). ===Component B=== The secondary (fainter) component (ULAS J141623.94+134836.3, abbreviated to ULAS J1416+1348, also known as SDSS J1416+13B) is a brown dwarf of spectral type T7.5, or T7.5p. It has unusually extremely blue near-infrared color H−K, very red optical-to-near-infrared color (z−Y > +2.3 and z−J > +3.1), and extremely red color H−[4.5] = 4.86 ± 0.04 (it was suggested, that the latter may be explained by presence of a cooler unresolved companion to SDSS J1416+13B). Also, its spectrum indicates high surface gravity and/or subsolar metallicity. ==See also== * List of star systems within 25–30 light-years * 2M1101AB * UScoCTIO 108 * Oph 162225-240515 * Binary brown dwarfs ==NotesReferences== Category:Brown dwarfs Category:L-type stars Category:T-type stars Category:Binary stars Category:Boötes Category:SDSS objects Category:ULAS objects Category:WISE objects ","title":"SDSS J1416+1348"},{"id":"35873940","text":"This is a list of listed buildings in the parish of Whittingehame in East Lothian, Scotland. == List == } == Key  See also == * List of listed buildings in East Lothian ==NotesReferences== * All entries, addresses and coordinates are based on data from Historic Scotland.

It consists of a diverse landscape that extends from north Alabama across central Tennessee and Kentucky into southern Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Its natural communities are a matrix of temperate forests, woodlands, and prairies. ==Setting== This is a region of rolling plains and eroded plateaus, with a Humid subtropical climate in the south and Hot-summer Humid continental climate in the north. It is notable for its extensive karst limestone, which comprise the caves at Mammoth Cave National Park. This region includes a portion of what the U.S. Forest service calls the \\"Central Hardwood Forest\\". (cites definition by Braun 1950) The region extends from southern Ohio, Indiana and Illinois through Tennessee and central Kentucky and into northern Alabama. Nearly 65% of Kentucky's territory is within the Interior Low Pleateaus region, which encompasses an area from the western Appalachian Plateaus to the Tennessee River. It includes the Kentucky Bluegrass and Knobs regions, the Highland Rim and the Shawnee Hills. ==Geology== The underlying bedrock of the Interior Low Plateaus consists of sedimentary rocks such as limestone, sandstone, and shale. These date from the Ordovician period in the Nashville Basin and Bluegrass region, up to the Carboniferous Period in the Shawnee Hills. The Interior Low Plateaus lie at the southern edge of the glacial boundary. Unlike the till plain to the north, the underlying bedrock is generally close to the surface, and the topography of an area depends on how resistant the underlying bedrock is to erosion. More resistant sandstones have resulted in hillier areas such as the Norman Upland and Crawford Upland in Southern Indiana, while softer limestones have already eroded down to gently rolling plains, like the Scottsburg Lowlands and Wabash Lowlands of southeast and southwest Indiana. The hillier parts of the Interior Low Plateaus are not mountain ranges, but dissected plateaus. ==Natural Communities== The natural communities in this region are a matrix of forest, woodlands, and prairie. Today, much of the open prairie and savanna communities have been lost due to fire suppression and agriculture. However, oak-hickory woodlands remain relatively common, and mesic forest is abundant along riparian areas. ===Woodlands=== Oak-hickory woodland is the most common natural community in the Interior Low Plateaus. It is the dominant natural community for many areas of rolling hills, including the Western Highland Rim, Shawnee Hills, and Outer Bluegrass. These woodlands represent an intermediate state between a forest and a savanna. Common trees in this community include post oak (Quercus stellata), white oak (Quercus alba), southern red oak (Quercus falcata), black oak (Quercus velutina), and pignut hickory (Carya glabra). In more calcareous areas, common woodland trees include Shumard oak (Quercus shumardii), Chinquapin oak (Quercus muhlenbergii), and Carolina shagbark (Carya carolinae-septentrionalis). In more acidic dry woodlands there are stands of chestnut oak (Quercus montana) and Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana). In swampy fragipan flats, woodlands consist of willow oak (Quercus phellos), overcup oak (Quercus lyrata), pin oak (Quercus palustris), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica). The woodlands in this region contain a rich sun-loving herbaceous layer, with many species of goldenrod (Solidago), sunflower (Helianthus), and aster (Symphyotrichum). Image:Oak woodland Hoosier National Forest.jpgOak-hickory woodland in the Hoosier National Forest, Indiana Image:Pennyroyal Plain Flatwoods (montgomery co).JPGWet oak flatwoods in the Pennyroyal Plain, Tennessee ===Prairie and Savanna=== The flat surfaces of the Interior Low Plateaus historically contained extensive areas of open prairie. This community was concentrated in the areas of the Mitchell Plain and Pennyroyal Plain with smaller areas of prairie in the Nashville Basin and Highland Rim. Early settlers describe these areas as nearly treeless expanses, containing Greater prairie chicken and herds of Bison.Pennyroyal Plain Prairies, by Dwayne Estes, Botanical Research Institute of Texas Today, some prairie remains in areas that are managed by controlled burns, or other forms of tree removal such as powerline and roadside clearings. Dry prairies are the most common remnant in this region, due to their unsuitability for agriculture and resistance to succession. They are dominated by Schizachyrium scoparium (little bluestem) and Aristida purpurascens (three-awn grass). Mesic prairies are rarer, and are dominated by very tall grasses such as Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), and plume grass (Erianthus alopecuroides). Wet prairies are the rarest and most poorly- documented grassland type in this region. The few existing remnants have species such as gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides), prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata), and many rushes (Juncus) and sedges (Carex). Significant prairie remnants now remain at Ft. Campbell and Arnold Air Force Base, as well as in a few small nature preserves.The Barrens, Cultural Resources Program of Fort Campbell Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica) was reportedly one of the few trees that could occasionally survive the annual wildfires in the prairies. Image:Pennyroyal Plain mesic priaire at clarksville, November.jpgMesic prairie remnant in the Pennyroyal Plain, Tennessee Image:Inner Nashville Basin savanna with Ast bibulatus.jpgDry oak savanna in the Inner Nashville Basin, Tennessee ===Forests=== Closed-canopy forests in this region are also naturally found in many areas, such as riparian zones, river bottoms, and dissected terrain. Mesic forests are often found in narrow stream gorges. These forests have a particularly rich diversity in spring wildflowers. They are dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum), beech (Fagus grandifolia), basswood (Tilia americana), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), and tuliptree (Liriodendron tulipifera). In the Eastern Highland Rim, at the edge of the Cumberland Plateau, these forests develop a more Appalachian character, and contain species such as eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), yellow buckeye (Aesculus flava), and cucumber magnolia (Magnolia tripetala). Acidic sandstone cove forests in the Shawnee Hills also contain more typically Appalachian species such as yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) and umbrella magnolia (Magnolia tripetala). Floodplain forests in the Interior Low Plateau remain relatively common, although many areas have been converted to agriculture. These forests are dominated by sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), boxelder (Acer negundo), silver maple (Acer saccharinum), and sycamore (Platanus occidentalis). Forests were particularly common in the uplands of the Inner Bluegrass region of Kentucky, which has naturally mesic conditions. These forests were dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum), bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis), Ohio buckleye (Aesculus glabra), blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata), and chinquapin oak (Quercus muhlenbergii). This community is now quite rare in the Inner Bluegrass due to logging by early European settlers. Its destruction was so rapid and complete, that mid-20th century ecologists mistook the successional state of the Bluegrass as its natural condition. Sun-loving species such as hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), black cherry (Prunus serotina), black walnut (Juglans nigra), and white ash (Fraxinus americana) now dominate much of the Bluegrass region. Image:Pennyroyal Plain riparian forest (Christian co).JPGBottomland forest in the Pennyroyal Plain, Kentucky Image:TN calcareous riparian forest.jpgCalcareous riparian forest in the Western Highland Rim, Tennessee ===Barrens and Glades=== Barrens are open treeless areas on slopes, often with shallow soil. These are found sporadically in the Outer Bluegrass, Inner Nashville Basin, Shawnee Hills, and in parts of the Highland Rim. It is unclear whether these communities rely on fire for their openness, or are maintained by soil conditions alone. They are usually dominated by short grasses such as little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and large showy forbs such as prairie dock (Silphium terebinthinaceum) and blazing star (Liatris). Barrens are particularity abundant and well-preserved in the area of Adams County, Ohio, which includes Adams Lake Prairie, Lynx Prairie, Chaparral Prairie, and others. Glades are areas of flat rock exposures of bedrock. In the Nashville Basin, glades are most often found in areas that were a matrix of barren and woodland communities.The Cedar Glade Ecosystems of Middle Tennessee Although historically with a more open grassland border, many are now surrounded by dense thickets of redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) and redbud (Cercis canadensis). Glades are most common the Nashville Basin, although there are rare examples found in the Mitchell Plain, Pennyroyal Plain and Outer Bluegrass. Glades have a flora adapted to extreme dry conditions in the summer, and standing water in the spring. The glades of the Nashville Basin and Moulton Valley are considered a center endemism due to their large number of restricted species. Characteristic species of the Nashville Basin glades include Nashville glade cress (Leavenworthia stylosa), limestone fame- flower (Phemeranthus calcaricus), Nashville breadroot (Pediomelum subacaule), Gattinger's prairie clover (Dalea gattingeri), and Tennessee milk-vetch (Astragalus tennesseensis). Glades in other regions contain less endemism, and are characterized by species such as widow's-cross stonecrop (Sedum pulchellum), limestone skullcap (Scutellaria parvula), glade violet (Viola egglestonii), one-flower gladecress (Leavenworthia uniflora), and poverty dropseed (Sporobolus vaginiflorus). Glade remnants are common and well- preserved due to their undesirability for agriculture, and their largely edaphic nature. Many examples exist in Cedars of Lebanon State Park, as well as numerous other natural areas. Image:Couchville glade.jpgLimestone glade in the Inner Nashville Basin, Tennessee Image:Outer Bluegrass dolomite barren (Lewis co).JPGDolomite barren in the Outer Bluegrass, Kentucky ===Wetlands=== The Interior Low Plateau has an abundance of sinkhole ponds in the karst regions of the Mitchell Plain, Pennyroyal Plain, and Highland Rim. These isolated communities were historically found within a matrix of wet prairie. These communities are often covered in swamp forest, and are dominated by swamp cottonwood (Populus heterophylla) and red maple (Acer rubrum). High-quality herbaceous examples have species with coastal plain affinities.Morrison Meadow, Tennessee Natural Heritage Program Many of these communities have been destroyed due to drainage for agriculture. Emergent shrub sloughs are found along the bottoms of major rivers, such as the Cumberland River and Tennessee River. These are dominated by buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), and along the Tennessee River contain bald- cypress (Taxodium distichum). These sloughs were historically widespread, but dam construction and agricultural activity have destroyed most of them. A rare wetland type in this region is the calcareous seepage fen. These are found sparingly in the Highland Rim, and are dominated by grass of Parnassus (Parnassia grandifolia) and contain the federally-endangered Tennessee yellow- eyed grass (Xyris tennesseensis).Interior Low Plateau Seepage Fen, NatureServe Calcareous seeps are also found near glades in the Inner Nashville Basin. These communities often have extensive stands of sunnybells (Schoenolirion croceum) and other rare species.Sunnybell Cedar Glade State Natural Area, Tennessee Natural Heritage Program Calcareous seeps and swamp forest are also found sparingly in the Bluegrass region. These contain trees such as green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) and swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor), along with many herbaceous plants that are considered regionally rare.Native Wetlands of the Central Bluegrass Region: from seeps to streamheads to swamps to ponds, By Julian Campbell Image:Nashville Basin fen.jpgCalcareous seepage fen in the Inner Nashville Basin, Tennessee Image:Western Highland Rim- Bottomland Emergent Marsh, (Marks Slough).jpgEmergent slough along the Cumberland River, Tennessee ==Fauna== This region contains the richest diversity of freshwater animals in North America. In particular, the Duck River in Tennessee is considered one of the top three most biologically rich rivers in the world, containing over 150 species of fish, 60 species of freshwater mussels, and 22 species of aquatic snails. The Nature Conservancy The Green River in this region also harbors diversity of a similar scale.https://www.wku.edu/greenriver/ WKU Green River Preserve This high amount of freshwater mussel diversity is due to the limestone bedrock underlying much of the region. The limestone creates calcareous water that acts as a buffer against acidity, which helps the mussels in shell-building. Birds of the woodlands include vireos and tanagers while mammals include Eastern gray squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons and opossums. == Threats == The dominance of oak in this part of the pre-Columbian savannas of North America was due to frequent fires. The fire suppression policies since the 1930s have been a significant forest disturbance. Today there is very little intact habitat in this ecoregion, with a reduction of bottomland hardwood forests by 70–95%, and only 0.02 percent of the original oak savannas remain. Although much of the area is forested, these forests tend to be highly fragmented and significantly altered by development, agriculture, and fire suppression. The forests are dominated primarily by oak and hickory species, but succession has filled the understory with maples and yellow poplar and blocking oak regeneration. In some areas, habitat is threatened by urbanization and invasive species such as non-native privet, honeysuckle, garlic mustard and kudzu. ==Protected Land== Significant natural areas in the ecoregion include: Mammoth Cave National Park; the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area of Tennessee and Kentucky; Hoosier National Forest and Yellowwood State Forest in southern Indiana; the Edge of Appalachia Preserve in Ohio; and the Shawnee Hills in southern Illinois. ==See also== *Physiographic regions of the world *List of ecoregions in the United States (EPA) the USEPA uses the designation, and assigns to it, number 71 *List of ecoregions in the United States (WWF), the WWF provides an alternate classification and includes this region in primarily its Central U.S. hardwood forests designation ==References* Central U.S. hardwood forests images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu Category:Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the United States Category:Ecoregions of the United States Category:Plant communities of Alabama Category:Plant communities of Indiana Category:Plant communities of Kentucky Category:Plant communities of Ohio Category:Plant communities of Tennessee Category:Forests of the United States Category:Geomorphology ","title":"Interior Low Plateaus"},{"id":"35873983","text":"This is a list of listed buildings in the parish of Inveresk in East Lothian, Scotland. == List == } == Key  See also == * List of listed buildings in East Lothian ==NotesReferences== * All entries, addresses and coordinates are based on data from Historic Scotland.

It was created in 1885 and won for the Liberals in that year’s general election by Henry Bret Ince. But Ince lost to the Conservatives in 1886 and the Tories held it until Radford’s victory in 1906.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1885-1918; Macmillan Press, 1974, 23 However during the First World War there was an electoral truce between the main political parties by which it was agreed that all by-election vacancies would be filled unopposed. The Liberal Party could therefore expect their chosen candidate to face no Conservative or Labour opponent. ==Candidates Liberals === Three names were put to the Islington East Liberals for consideration as candidate; Sir J Benn who was leader of the Progressives on the London County Council and a former Liberal MP,Marc Brodie, Sir John Williams Benn; \\"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\\" online; 2004-12 D S Waterlow, who was Liberal MP for Islington North from 1906-December 1910 and Edward Smallwood a coal manufacturer who represented the area on the London County Council and who was the successful applicant.The Times, 12 October 1917 p4 === Conservatives === The local Conservatives voted to honour to electoral truce and support Smallwood, albeit reluctantly as in normal times they would have hopes of re-capturing the seat, as long as he pledged to fight the election as a supporter of the prime minister and government in all measures necessary for the victorious prosecution of the war.The Times, 17 October 1917 p5 Smallwood gave this pledge and the Tories, including two former candidates for the seat, campaigned for his return.The Times, 18 October 1917 p3 === Labour === Neither the Labour Party, nor indeed any candidate representing organised labour, had contested Islington East since its creation in 1885 and no Labour candidate was nominated.The Times, 22 October 1917 p3 ===Others=== However Smallwood was to face a contested election as two other candidates came forward. The newly formed National Party announced it would nominate E B Barnard, the former Liberal MP for Kidderminster. At the time of the by-election Barnard was the Chairman of the Metropolitan Water Board. The National Party announced their intention to campaign in the election against the government practice of ‘peerage-mongering’ and ‘seat-selling’ and urged electors to join their crusade against the scandal of the sale of honours.The Times, 15 October 1917 p5 The other candidate nominated was Alfred Baker, the Town Clerk and former Mayor of Hertford who stood as an Independent but was backed by the organisation known as the ‘Vigilantes’ led by the extreme right-winger Noel Pemberton Billing, who was MP for Hertford. Two other possible ‘patriotic’ candidates, Allen Clark and Robert Forsyth decided not to seek nomination once they knew that a ‘Vigilante’ was in the field and supported Baker’s campaign.The Times, 16 October 1917 p3 ==Zeppelin attack== A noteworthy feature of the by-election was a raid on the area by a German airship on the Friday before polling day. A number of Zeppelins dropped bombs on England killing 27 and injuring 53. The ships then seem to have got lost in the fog and drifted over France where eight of the eleven airships were reported to have been brought down or so disabled they were forced to land. The news that it had been left to French airmen to destroy the fleet which had attacked London caused resentment in England and was said to have given a considerable impetus to Baker’s campaign. It was reported on the day before polling that questions relating to air operations, both defensive and offensive, were now dominating the East Islington contest.The Times, 22 October 1917 p9 ==The result== The result was a hold for the government party with Smallwood taking 57% of the poll. The election was held using the old register of electors and many voters were absent from the area.The Times, 23 October 1917 p5 As a result the turnout was only 36.9% as compared with 79.9% at the previous general election in December 1910. The result was entirely satisfactory from the point of view of the government and showed it retained the confidence of the electorate to prosecute the war effectively and remained representative of people’s patriotic emotions during the war. But Baker’s showing, with 32.2% of the poll, put heart into the ‘Vigilante’ camp. The National Party was not deterred by Barnard’s 10.8% of the poll. They quickly re-stated their aim to be the ‘patriotic’ party of the nation and to cooperate with Labour, as the party of the future, best able to promote reform, union and defence – the National Party watchwords.The Times, 26 October 1917 p3 ==The votes== Edward Smallwood ==See also== *1931 Islington East by-election * List of United Kingdom by-elections * United Kingdom by-election records ==References== Category:1917 elections in the United Kingdom Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in London constituencies Category:1917 in London Category:Elections in the London Borough of Islington ","title":"1917 Islington East by-election"},{"id":"35873986","text":"This is a list of listed buildings in the parish of Pencaitland in East Lothian, Scotland. == List == } == Key  See also == * List of listed buildings in East Lothian ==NotesReferences== * All entries, addresses and coordinates are based on data from Historic Scotland.

This storm brought on all kinds of emotional strife and death that truly tests the seasoned doctors and pushes them to their element. They bond together, guiding each other through the dark and as the dust settles from this mayhem, there are casualties of all kinds.

Sweeney and Luke Grimes. It follows Bryan Mills taking his family to Istanbul, only to be kidnapped, along with his ex-wife, by the father of one of the men he killed while saving his daughter two years prior. It is the sequel to the 2008 film Taken and the second installment in the Taken trilogy. Released on October 3, 2012 in France by EuropaCorp and October 5, 2012 in the United States by 20th Century Fox, the film grossed over $376 million at the box office, but received mostly negative reviews from critics. A third film, Taken 3, was released on 9 January 2015. ==Plot== At the funeral of his son Marko and associates in Tropojë, Albanian mafia head and freelance terrorist Murad Hoxha vows to seek vengeance on his son's killer. Travelling to Paris with his men, he interrogates and tortures former intelligence agent Jean-Claude Pitrel, whose business card was found at the scene of Marko's death, but finds no information. He then bribes a corrupt police official for Pitrel's files and deduces that Pitrel's old friend, Bryan Mills, was responsible and is vacationing in Istanbul. Meanwhile, Bryan has just finished his three-day security job for a wealthy Arabian sheikh in Istanbul and is surprised by his former wife, Lenore, and daughter, Kim, turning up to visit him. While going out for lunch with Lenore the next day, Bryan spots Murad's men following them. He tells Lenore to run and tries to outrun the Albanians but finally surrenders when they capture Lenore. Realising that Kim is also a target, Bryan calls her at the hotel and tells her to hide but then is captured and knocked unconscious. She narrowly avoids capture when the kidnappers are forced to flee after they shoot two security guards. Regaining consciousness, Bryan finds himself zip tied to a pipe over his head in an empty basement. He uses a concealed miniature cellphone hidden in his sock to contact Kim and instructs her to alert the American embassy; instead, she convinces him to let her help. Opening her father's equipment case, Kim takes a grenade and detonates it on a nearby rooftop; the resulting sound allows Bryan to instruct her on triangulating his location. The mobsters bring in Lenore, make a small incision in her neck, and hang her upside down to bleed out. As soon as they leave, Bryan frees himself and then her. He next has Kim detonate two more grenades and releases some steam through a chimney to guide her to his location. Kim tosses a gun down the chimney, which Bryan uses to kill the guards holding him captive. He rescues Kim but watches Lenore get recaptured. Stealing a taxi, Bryan and Kim pursue the kidnappers' van, and an SUV, driven by one of the kidnappers' henchmen, arrives to distract them. A chase and shootout ensue, alerting Turkish police, and ends when Bryan manages to lure the SUV into the path of an oncoming train, taking it out. Leaving Kim at the American embassy, Bryan uses his memory to find Murad's hideout. He rescues Lenore and pursues the surviving mobsters to a bathhouse, where he kills them. Confronting Murad, Bryan offers to let him walk if he agrees to return home and cease his desire for revenge. Murad agrees, and Bryan drops his gun, but Murad tries to kill Bryan, only to find the gun unloaded. Realizing that Murad will never drop his vendetta against him, Bryan kills him by impaling him with a sharp towel hook. Three weeks later, the Mills family, at a diner back in Los Angeles, has milkshakes to celebrate Kim passing her driving test. They are joined, much to Bryan's surprise, by Kim's boyfriend, Jamie, and she jokingly tells her father not to \\"shoot this one.\\" ==Alternative version== In an alternative version, Bryan rescues Lenore after she is recaptured. The taxi chase then takes place with Bryan, Kim and Lenore eventually making it to the American embassy. He then leaves them both at the Embassy to \\"finish it.\\" Olivier Megaton decided against that version since questions arose over Bryan's motivation for pursuing Murad. It is included as an extra on the DVD and Blu-ray releases. ==Cast== * Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills * Maggie Grace as Kim Mills * Famke Janssen as Lenore \\"Lennie\\" Mills-St. John * Rade Šerbedžija as Murad Hoxha * Leland Orser as Sam Gilroy * Jon Gries as Mark Casey * D.

The site's consensus reads: \\"Taken 2 is largely bereft of the kinetic thrills—and surprises—that made the original a hit.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 45 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Roger Ebert, of the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film 3 stars out of 4, writing, \\"' is slick, professional action\\" and concluding, \\"The cast is uniformly capable and dead serious, and if you're buying what [co-writer and producer] Luc Besson is selling, he's not short-changing you.\\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"At a beefy 6-foot-4, Liam Neeson certainly looks physically imposing, but it was the notion of casting someone who can actually act in an action hero role that was the counter-intuitive concept that made both films—' is more a remake than a sequel—so successful.\\" Bernard Besserglik of The Hollywood Reporter reviewed the film after its screening at Deauville, concluding, \\"There's a touch of vigilante advocacy in the movie that will displease some, with Liam Neeson as a more gentlemanly version of the Charles Bronson of the Death Wish series, but clearly there's still a market for such fantasies. Moviegoers who liked Taken and want more of the same will get precisely that.\\" John Anderson of The Wall Street Journal wrote that there is a \\"blind adherence to formula evident in most of '. As they might say in the advertising department, it's an adrenaline-fuelled thrill ride. But it could have been much more.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C grade, writing, \\"You know what happens in ', don't you? The same thing that happened four years ago in Taken, but different. (But the same.)\\" and that ' \\"is simultaneously silly, nasty, a lazy festival of stereotypes, and a cleverly made piece of merchandise—i.e., it's the devil we know.\\" Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote that much of ' \\"seems like a nonstop car and foot chase, with Albanian after Albanian falling victim to Bryan's remarkable aim and hand-fighting skills. Foreigners bad, Americans good, box office busy.\\" Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the film a C grade, writing, \\"What begins as a family outing, with a hint of rekindled romance between the parents, devolves into kidnapping (the word 'taken' gets thrown about liberally), torture, high-speed chases, and other misadventures probably not smiled upon by the Turkish Board of Tourism. None of it is particularly novel or exciting.\\" Scott Bowles of USA Today gave the film 2 1/2 stars out of 4, writing, \\"The first half of ' is a serviceable action flick, but the second half descends into cliches\\" and \\"[a]t times, ' even steps from the shadows of the original with some terrifying imagery and an improved relationship between father and daughter. Alas, the movie can't help but descend into a pat part two, bereft of much suspense or tension.\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film 2 stars out of 5, concluding, \\"In the first movie, from the tailend of the Bush era, Liam was not shy about using Jack Bauerish torture techniques, wiring up evil-doers to the mains and zapping them with righteous volts. None of that now. That was a 15; this is a 12A, a bit tamer, just as ridiculous, but the premise is looking pretty tired.\\" Joe Neumaier of the Daily News also gave the film 2 stars out of 5, writing, \\"' has a plot that could have been written by a GPS program, and contains all the technical charm that conjures up. Yet somehow, Liam Neeson growls through this just-acceptable action sequel with his dignity intact, his wallet bigger and his movie family oblivious to all that occurred in 2009's Taken.\\" Neil Smith of Total Film gave the film 2 stars out of 5, concluding, \\"Yet while it's fun to watch him take out the Eurotrash, we've seen him do it better.\\" Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film 1 star out of 4, writing, \\"You can't blame Liam Neeson, or the Taken producers, for trying to catch lightning in a bottle again. What you can blame them for is ', a sequel every bit as clumsy, ham- handed, outlandish and laughable as the original was sleek, tough and efficient.\\" Audiences polled by the market research firm CinemaScore gave the film a B+ grade on average, lower than the \\"A\\" earned by its predecessor. === Accolades === {  !Award !Category !Recipient(s) and nominee(s) !Result - 39th Saturn Awards Best Action/Adventure Film Taken 2  rowspan=\\"2\\" Nominated - 39th People's Choice Awards Favorite Dramatic Movie Actor Liam Neeson } ===Home media=== Taken 2 was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 16 January 2013.

Segregation in concrete ==Definition== It is described by American Society for Testing and Materials as follows: \\"Segregation in concrete is commonly thought of as separation of some size groups of aggregates from cement mortar in isolated locations with corresponding deficiencies of these materials in other locations. Segregation results in proportions of the laid concrete being in variation with those designed. Segregation could result from internal factors such as concrete that is not proportioned properly and not mixed adequately, or too workable a mix. It also could result from external factors such as too much vibration, improper transportation, placement, or adverse weather conditions. The corresponding increase in proportion of cement paste in upper areas would tend to make them susceptible to increased shrinkage and formation of cracks. These cracks could be 10 µm to 500 µm wide, formed perpendicular to the surface, and be in the form of map patterns.\\" The effect of aggregate segregation on the mechanical and transport behavior of concrete has been the focus of both modeling as well as experimental investigation ==See also== * Properties of concrete ==Notes== The concrete should be free form segregation.

He served as president only for a few weeks, before his German successor from the NSDAP took over by the order of SS-Obergruppenführer, Hans Frank. Klimecki saved the city from being shelled by the invading Wehrmacht troops on his own initiative. Klimecki was arrested and then released numerous times during the occupation of Kraków, before his death at the hands of the Nazis. The first time, he was taken hostage by the Wehrmacht on September 6, 1939, when he approached them with the call to stop shooting because the city was defenseless: \\"Feuer einstellen!\\" The second time, if only briefly – on September 11, 1939 for interrogation; and then once more on September 20, 1939 (with ten-day detention), when he was dismissed as President. On November 6, 1939, Klimecki was arrested again, during the notorious Sonderaktion Krakau, and sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. He returned to Kraków upon his release, and was apprehended for the last time of his life on November 29, 1942. A few days later, on December 11, 1942, he was executed, along with some 40 hostages at a remote killing ground in the Niepołomice Forest. ==Biography== Klimecki was born in Wola Przemykowska near Brzesko, the son of Edmund Klimecki and Rozalia née Wróblewska. He went to school first in Złoczów, then in Wadowice, Bochnia, and graduated from high school in the Podgórze district of Kraków in 1904. He studied law at the University of Vienna, and after his return he earned a doctorate at Jagiellonian University (UJ) in 1913. During World War I, Klimecki fought with the Second Brigade of the Polish Legions. In 1918, he took part in the disarming of Austrian soldiers in Kraków; he left the army in June 1919, with the rank of Reserve Captain. The 1931 art opening at the Palace of Fine Arts, Kraków. From right to left: Stanisław Klimecki, Witold Ostrowski (then vice- president of Kraków), President Władysław Belina-Prażmowski, and the Governor Mikołaj Kwaśniewski. From 1919, Klimecki ran a law firm in Podgórze in sovereign Poland. In 1926, he was elected as member of the Kraków City Council; and on July 9, 1931, became vice-president of the city. He was involved in social services, health care, public parks, as well as the distribution of the city's gas. Following the resignation of President Mieczysław Kaplicki in February 1939, Klimecki served as interim president until the appointment of Bolesław Czuchajowski in May 1939, by the minister of internal affairs. ==World War II== Three days after the German invasion of Poland, on September 3, 1939, President Czuchajowski hastily departed Kraków. The City Council gave his vacant position to Klimecki. On his own initiative, Klimecki went to meet the invading Wehrmacht troops on September 6, 1939, and offered himself as a hostage. In this way, he protected the residents of the city from German attack. After the German takeover of Kraków, Stanisław Klimecki – as the sole representative of the Polish authorities – decided to create an emergency Committee that would launch the new school year at all levels. He entrusted the task of organizing the new board to the Rector of Jagiellonian University, Tadeusz Lehr-Spławiński, who set it up by September 9, 1939. The new office headquarters were located at the administrative centre of the Collegium Novum building, where the registration of teachers and students took place in the following weeks. By September 20, 1939, nearly 20,000 students of all types and about 650 teachers and educators signed up. By the end of September, most schools began teaching. However, on September 20, 1939, Klimecki was arrested by the Gestapo again for the second time in two weeks (after his first brief arrest on September 11), and fired as President, along with the entire City Council. He was replaced as head of the municipal government by Ernst Emil Zörner from the NSDAP, who arrived from Dresden. Klimecki was released from prison at Montelupich street ten days later. ===Sonderaktion Krakau=== A little over two months after the invasion, SS-Obersturmbannführer Bruno Müller, the newly appointed chief of the Gestapo in Kraków, called a meeting of all university professors and academics at the Collegium Novum. He informed them that the Poles did not have permission from the German authorities to start a new school year. They were arrested on the spot, as part of an integrated action plan known as Sonderaktion Krakau. Klimecki was apprehended at his home at 5 pm the same evening. Within days, they were deported in one rail car – 184 persons in all – to Reichsgau Wartheland and soon imprisoned at Sachsenhausen concentration camp near Berlin. Klimecki spent over three months there during the winter. Thanks to an international protest by prominent Italians, including Benito Mussolini and the Vatican, 101 professors from Kraków universities who were older than 40 were released from the camp on February 8, 1940. Klimecki was released with them. The German authorities allowed only the operation of elementary schools during the occupation. After his return to Kraków in February 1940, Stanisław Klimecki worked for two years as a lawyer, and witnessed the German looting of the city. He was again arrested by the Gestapo, for the last time in his life, on the night of November 28–29, 1942. Two weeks later, on December 11, 1942 he was executed and his body thrown into a mass grave along with some 40 Polish hostages in the remote Niepołomice Forest. A street in Podgórze District of Kraków is named after him. ==Notes and references== Category:1883 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Mayors of Kraków Category:Polish civilians killed in World War II Category:Polish legionnaires (World War I) Category:Sachsenhausen concentration camp prisoners ","title":"Stanisław Klimecki"},{"id":"35874130","text":"Won't Back Down (previously titled Still I Rise, Learning To Fly and Steel Town) is a drama film directed by Daniel Barnz and starring Maggie Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis and Holly Hunter. It was released on September 28, 2012. == Premise == Two determined mothers, a car dealer/bartender (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and a teacher (Viola Davis), look to transform their children's failing inner city school in Pittsburgh. Facing a powerful and entrenched bureaucracy and corruption from the teachers' union president (Holly Hunter) and the school's principal (Bill Nunn), they risk everything to make a difference in the education and future of their children. == Cast == * Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jaime Fitzpatrick * Viola Davis as Nona Alberts * Holly Hunter as Evelyn Riske * Oscar Isaac as Michael Perry * Rosie Perez as Brenna Harper * Ving Rhames as Principal Thompson * Lance Reddick as Charles Alberts * Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Olivia Lopez * Bill Nunn as Principal Holland * Emily Alyn Lind as Malia Fitzpatrick * Dante Brown as Cody Alberts * Liza Colón-Zayas as Yvonne * Ned Eisenberg as Arthur Gould == Production  Background === New York. The film is loosely based on the events surrounding the use of the parent trigger law in Sunland-Tujunga, Los Angeles, California in 2010, where several groups of parents attempted to take over several failing public schools. The Parent Trigger law, which was passed in California and other states in 2010, allowed parents to enforce administrative overhaul and overrule administrators in under-performing public schools if petitioned. If successful, petitions allow parents to direct changes such as dismissal of staff and potential conversion of a school to a charter school. === Release === Walden Media, a film studio which released a 2010 documentary film Waiting for \\"Superman\\" with Paramount Pictures and Participant Media about the American educational system, produced the film, with 20th Century Fox releasing it on September 28, 2012. American actresses Maggie Gyllenhaal and Viola Davis were among the first to be cast, with Academy award-winning actress Holly Hunter being cast later on. The film marked Hunter's first film appearance in seven years since The Incredibles and The Big White. The film's trailer was released on May 17, 2012. The film's budget was $25 million, not counting the undisclosed amount for marketing the film. ===Promotional campaign=== Private foundations and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce contributed more than $2 million for a publicity campaign for the film. Television ads, bookmarks, websites and private screenings a six-month cross-country tour promoted the film. Promoters scheduled private screenings in states from New York to Georgia and Utah, to promote the movie and its parent trigger message. Michelle Rhee presented the film at separate events near both the Republican and Democratic Party 2012 national conventions several weeks before its theatrical release. == Reception Box office=== The film grossed just $5.3 million at the box office domestically, and, according to Box Office Mojo, had the worst opening-weekend performance of any film to open in more than 2,500 theatres - collecting just $1,035 per screen, until the record was broken by Victor Frankenstein in 2015.WORST WIDE OPENINGS - Saturated 2,500+ theatres, Box Office Mojo ===Critical response=== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 35% based on 106 reviews with an average rating of 5.06 out of 10.

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \\"A-\\" on scale of A to F.

After his father, who had taken part on the side of the church in battles in Denmark between the Danish royal house and the Archbishopric of Lund. When his father was stabbed to death by a woman in 1260 out of revenge, Vitslav became the reigning Prince of Rügen. Vitslav's seal From the beginning of his reign Vitslav II maintained good relations with the Hanseatic town of Lübeck, whose merchants he exempted from customs duties within his principality and with whom, in 1266, he renewed the existing trade agreements. In 1269, he supported the town of Stralsund, located within his territory, by withdrawing rights from the Schadegard, built in the immediate vicinity of Stralsund, and gave up the town founded in order to compete with Stralsund. Probably over claims to the dowry of his mother, a daughter of Prince Swietopelk of East Pomerania, he succeeded in 1270 in gaining possession of the enfeoffment of Schlawe. Possibly in the same year, but no later than 1271, he founded Rügenwalde, but sold his enfeoffments in 1277, after he had been driven out of the area in 1275 by Mestwin II. The territory of Schlawe (Schlawer Land) with its town and Rügenwalde went to Margrave John II, Otto IV and Conrad of Brandenburg. In 1282, he joined the Livonian Crusade, leaving his brother Jaromar III behind as regent. On 13 June 1283, the Treaty of Rostock alliance (Rostocker Landfriedensbündnis) was agreed between the cities and towns of Lübeck, Wismar Rostock, Stralsund, Greifswald, Stettin, Demmin and Anklam with Duke John I of Saxe-Lauenburg, the Mecklenburg prince, Bogislaw IV of Pomerania and Vitslav II of Rügen. This alliance was clearly directed against Brandenburg. In 1283, Vitslav II was given his territory as German fiefdom by the German king, Rudolf I of Habsburg, although the document probably referred only to the mainland element. The Rügen-Danish fief relationship continued, as the regular participation of Vitslav II at the Danish court and his nomination as a witness in Danish royal charters indicates. Among other things, he was present at the investigation of the murder of the King of Denmark Erik Klipping. In 1285, he granted town rights to Tribsees. In 1290 the town of Stralsund was given the right of herring fishing on the Wittow and commercial monopoly on the island of Rügen, which severely hampered, the development of trade and commerce, including the grain trade, in the next few centuries. In 1288 Greifswald was given the Greifswald Saltworks and, in 1297, the right to build a port in Wieck by the mouth of the Ryck. He extended the possessions of the monasteries located in the principality: Eldena and Neuenkamp Abbeys. == Descendants == Vitslav II married between 1263 and 1269 Agnes of Brunswick- Lüneburg, the daughter of Duke Otto I, the Child of Brunswick and Matilda of Brandenburg. The names of four sons and four daughters are known from the Vitslav's testament dated 27 December 1302: # Vitslav III of Rügen, co-regent from 1286 # Jaromar (born around 1267 – died 1294), rector at Stralsund St. Nicholas', later Bishop of Cammin from 1288 to 1294 # Euphemia of RügenThe assumption that Euphemia was a daughter of Count Günter of Arnstein-Lindow- Ruppin is based, according to Ursula Scheil, on a misunderstanding and was disproved by her in 1945 in the Genealogie der Fürsten von Rügen (\\"Genealogy of the Princes of Rügen\\"); (1164 1325), Greifswald, but the story is now widespread. (born around 1280 – died 1321), married King Hakon V of Norway # Sambor (born around 1267 – died 4 June 1304), from 1302 co-regent with Vitslav III, probably died in battles in Farther Pomerania (Hinterpommern) # Margaret (born around 1270/71 – died 1318), married 1284 Duke Bogislaw IV of Pomerania- Wolgast # Swantepolk (born around 1273 – died after 1285) # Helena (born around 1271 – died 9 August 1315), married: ## 1288 Prince John III of Mecklenburg, ## 1299 Prince Bernard II of Anhalt-Bernburg # Sophia (born around 1281 – died after 1302), only mentioned in the testament, lived with Euphemia in Norway == Literature == * *Joachim Wächter: Das Fürstentum Rügen - Ein Überblick.

At 18 Sibley became a teacher at Clifton Grammar School in Warwickshire, where he was also the organist. To avoid making a noise, he practiced on a small harmonium. without using the bellows and eventually gained his Doctor of Music degree in 1894. ==Director of Music== Later he was appointed to the position of Director of the Queen's Music and became well known as a composer of both sacred and secular music. He continued to work both as a conductor and composer but after the First World War began to take a greater interest in spiritual matters and a common bond through music led to him accepting ordination as a priest from F.E.J. Lloyd in 1924. ==Archbishop== When he retired in 1929, he determined to devote his declining years to the service of God, and after his consecration by Lloyd in 1929, returned to England as Archbishop Metropolitan of the Orthodox Catholic Church in the British Empire. Unfortunately in this new role he rapidly attracted enemies in the established Church who often employed agent provocateurs and the gutter press against him. Despite this persecution he was always the perfect gentleman, and there was a firm chin under his George V beard. ==Persecutions== Yet he was often deceived by people who appealed to his kindly nature and both he and his wife suffered greatly from treachery by those they sought to help. Eventually he was to admit, ‘One can be too easily accessible.’ One such attack came from a young woman reporter from the gutter press, who first sought his help and then launched a vicious attack through “John Bull” a gutter press magazine. The same woman later tried a similar trick with the Rev. Father, John Ward, but warned by the Archbishop, he was less easily duped. In his ecclesiastical capacity Sibley wore a black suit, black spats, purple stock, and a wide-brimmed hat with a rosette. He was a likeable old man with steady blue eyes behind his gold-rimmed glasses, very upright in stance and courteous in the extreme, yet underneath was a will of iron. Sibley himself suffered great pain from an enlarged prostate, and many persecutions but struggled on. ==A Religious Community== Wishing to establish a religious community he sought to purchase Minster Abbey on the Isle of Thanet in the River Thames, where once St Sexburga had been in charge, but he was attacked so vehemently in John Bull that the whole scheme fell through. Nevertheless, it was through this contact that some of the bones of St Sexburga came into the possession of John Ward and the Abbey of Christ the King. They are still preserved at St Michael's in Caboolture. Sibley also established an Intercollegiate University, which offered degrees to clergymen from various denominations after appropriate studies. Lloyd had already set up a similar facility in America, supported by his wealthy wife, but Sibley had no such financial backer and eventually the British university, which never made a profit, died out. Eventually through his meeting with the Ward and the subsequent admission of the Confraternity to the Orthodox Catholic Church, Sibley found some success even in this life, but the pressure of constant persecution told on his wife, who predeceased him. ==Death and Beatification== Just after his 80th birthday, on 15 December 1938 John Churchill Sibley went to his well earned rest, and was buried in High Barnet cemetery during a raging snowstorm in a funeral arranged by John Ward and the Community. Soon afterwards, the Archbishop John Churchill Sibley was recognised as having been raised to the ranks of the Blessed Saints of God. ==External links== * The John Sebastian Marlow Ward Website Category:1858 births Category:1938 deaths Category:20th-century English clergy Category:English composers Category:Metropolitan bishops Category:People from Crewkerne ","title":"John Churchill Sibley"},{"id":"35874182","text":"This is a list of listed buildings in the parish of St Andrews in Fife, Scotland. == List == } == Key  See also == * List of listed buildings in Fife ==NotesReferences== * All entries, addresses and coordinates are based on data from Historic Scotland.

According to Bill Roggio of the Long War Journal, Dadullah had joined the Taliban in 1994 but was held in disfavor by some in that organization for his brutality during the Afghan civil war. Following the American-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 Dadullah led Taliban forces in southern Afghanistan. U.S. Military officials stated that Dadullah made use of suicide bombings in the Taliban's fight against American, NATO and Afghan government forces, and embraced the radical ideology of al-Qaeda rejected by many other Taliban leaders.Special Operations Interrogator's Report, \\"State of the Taliban,\\" published by The New York Times, drafted 6 January 2012. Dadullah was killed by British special forces in Helmand Province in 2007. The Dadullah Front, apparently named in his honor, began operating in Southern Afghanistan, including Kandahar, Helmand, and Uruzgan Provinces, under the leadership of Dadullah's younger brother, Mansoor Dadullah. The group's level of independence from the Taliban was unclear. ==Operations== U.S. Military and intelligence officials at one stage claimed that the Dadullah Front was led by Mullah Adbul Qayoum Zakir, also known as Abdullah Gulam Rasoul, a former detainee of Guantanamo Bay who was released in 2007. The Dadullah Front claimed responsibility for 14 May 2012 assassination of Afghan High Peace Minister Mullah Arsala Rahmani, who was shot in traffic within Kabul.Roggio, Bill, \\"Mullah Dadullah Front claims assassination of Afghan High Peace Council member\\", The Long War Journal, 14 May 2012.

Rahmani was the second Peace minister to be killed within the year, following the assassination of Burhanuddin Rabbani by a suicide bomber on 20 September 2011. The Dadullah Front also claimed responsibility for that assassination. Both Rahmani and Rabbani had been responsible for organizing ongoing peace talks between the Taliban and the Karzai's government in Afghanistan. American and Afghan officials have stated that the Dadullah Front was attempting to derail peace negotiations then underway with the Taliban. Callers claiming to represent the group contacted several Afghan officials in May 2012, including Zabul Province representative Dawood Hasas, and threatened retaliation should they vote in favor of a \\"strategic partnership\\" negotiated between Hamid Karzai and U.S. President Barack Obama. ==Relations with the Taliban== Afghan intelligence officials have described the Dadullah Front as affiliated with the Taliban. Taliban spokesmen denied any relationship with the Front, and claimed that the group was a creation of the Afghan intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Intelligence. Following the August 2015 announcement that Akhtar Mansour had succeeded the deceased Mullah Omar as leader of the Taliban, Dadullah refused to support him, leading to months of clashes between their forces in Zabul Province, resulting in the killing of Dadullah and many of his supporters in November 2015. In August 2016, the Dadullah Front announced Dadullah's nephew Mullah Emdadullah Mansoor as its new leader, and threatened to take revenge on the Taliban. The group has been linked to another Taliban splinter group, Fidai Mahaz, but the groups are believed to be separate. ==References== Category:Taliban Category:Afghan Islamists Category:War in Afghanistan (2001–present) Category:Military history of Afghanistan Category:Rebel groups in Afghanistan Category:2010 in Afghanistan Category:2011 in Afghanistan Category:2012 in Afghanistan ","title":"Mullah Dadullah Front"},{"id":"35874325","text":"Tickner may refer to: * Blair Tickner (born 1993), cricketer * Charles Tickner (born 1953), figure skater * Frank Tickner (born 1983), British cross country runner * French Tickner (born 1930), American-Canadian voice actor * George Tickner (born 1946), musician * J.

He held the title Bishop of Brooklyn from 1917 to April 1933. He founded and led the American Orthodox Catholic Church for six years and is perhaps best known as being the source of various lines of succession of episcopi vagantes. ==Career== Following the untimely death of St. Raphael of Brooklyn in 1915, Archimandrite Aftimios (Ofiesh) was elected to serve as his replacement in caring for the Arab Orthodox faithful in North America under the Russian Orthodox Church's canonical authority. He was consecrated by Archbishop Evdokim (Meschersky) as an auxiliary bishop in 1917 with the title of Bishop of Brooklyn. In 1923, in recognition for his work in the United States, he was elevated by Metropolitan Platon (Rozhdestvensky) of New York to the rank of archbishop. In 1924, in the canonical disputes of American Orthodoxy following the onset of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, the Arab Orthodox faithful split into two factions, one which wished to go under the canonical authority of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch and another which wished to stay faithful to the Russian Orthodox Church. The former group was organized by Bishop Victor (Abu Assaly) of New York, thus beginning the official presence of the Antiochian Orthodox Church on American soil (today the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America). In 1927, Aftimios was commissioned by the Russian diocese in America to form an English-speaking jurisdiction (the American Orthodox Catholic Church). The purpose of the diocese was to establish a new tradition in North America that was separate from any other particular ethnic or cultural traditions. The diocese in its original form only lasted for six years. During this time, Aftimios consecrated four bishops for his new jurisdiction. Additionally, in 1931 the Society of Clerks Secular of St. Basil, a Western Rite Orthodox group, was established under the auspices of this diocese and subsequently led by Bishop Nichols. In 1932, Archbishop Aftimios was invited to come to St. Mary's Syrian Orthodox Church in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, to arbitrate a dispute regarding the transfer of its priest, Fr. Constantine Abou-Adal. When Fr. Constantine left St. Mary's in November 1932, the parish was without a pastor, and so Archbishop Aftimios served in that capacity until February 1933, organizing a choir and Sunday School at the parish. During this time, he met and became involved with one of St. Mary's parishioners, Mariam Namey, then subsequently married her in a civil ceremony in April 1933. Reports vary at this point as to what happened regarding Aftimios' episcopacy. According to the parish records of St. Mary's, he \\"was retired\\" and lived in nearby Kingston until his death in 1966. With the subsequent withdrawal of support for the American Orthodox Catholic Church, it lost its canonical status. According to the book Orthodox Christians in North America (1794–1994), however, Aftimios \\"resigned his episcopacy and married.\\" A newspaper article states he received a private revelation to abolish clerical celibacy. One of the groups which traces itself to Aftimios characterizes the situation differently: \\"We are not under and do not have a patriarch as head of this Church since the ethnic patriarchal orthodox bodies all turned their backs on this Church and use the marriage of Abp. Aftimios as the reason, although most had already refused to recognize this Church and its authority in the New World.\\" The biography by Ofiesh's widow Mariam claims that Aftimios fully intended to function as a married bishop, having that intent even before he met Mariam. Relations between the small jurisdiction created by Aftimios and the mainstream Eastern Orthodox Church were not regularized following his marriage and de facto deposition from the episcopacy. Since that time, numerous and still multiplying lines of succession of episcopi vagantes continue to persist which all trace their roots to Aftimios (mainly through Ignatius Nichols), many of whom regard him as a saint. Some of those bishops are married men, as well, which is a continual stumbling block to their unity with the mainstream Orthodox Church, which has for centuries maintained a celibate episcopacy. Following his death in 1966, Aftimios was buried in Maple Hill Cemetery across from St. Mary's Orthodox Cemetery in Wilkes-Barre. His widow Mariam subsequently wrote his biography, published in 1999. ==Book== The book by Aftimios's widow, while including a great deal of historical information, is not mainly a scholarly work but is rather a biography aimed toward the exoneration of her late husband. One of its primary themes throughout is that Aftimios's marriage to Mariam was justified and that the canonical tradition of celibacy for Orthodox bishops is \\"man-made\\" and should be abolished. ==Writings== *A Basis for Orthodox Consideration of Unity ==Claimed successors== Various independent Orthodox churches and jurisdictions have claimed apostolic succession through Aftimios Ofiesh. Most of the groups have merged or disbanded. The largest notable continuation is the American Orthodox Catholic Church (American Patriarchate). Others include the Byleorussian Orthodox Catholic Church (today the American World Patriarchs), the American Orthodox Church established in 1972 by Bishop Joseph Thaddeus (Alan Sanford), the THEOCACNA-Vladimir Synod, and American Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church (previously the Russian Orthodox Church in America). ==See also== *American Orthodox Catholic Church *Episcopi vagantes == References Sources== *Orthodox Christians in North America (1794-1994), chapters 4 and 5 *History of St. Mary Orthodox Church (Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania) *History of the American Orthodox Church (one of the groups which traces its roots to Aftimios) *The Quest for Orthodox Church Unity in America, by Archim.

He served twice as praetorian prefect of the East, supervised some of Anastasius's tax reforms, supported the Emperor's pro-Monophysite policies and led the Roman navy in a crucial battle that ended for good the rebellion of general Vitalian in Thrace. He survived into the regime of Justin I (r. 518–527), when he held his second tenure as praetorian prefect, but was soon sidelined from power. ==Biography== Semissis of Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491–518). Marinus was a native of Apamea in Syria,. and, like most Syrians, a Monophysite.. Nothing is known of his early life, but in 498 he was appointed by Anastasius as the senior financial official (tractator, and later chartularius) of the fiscal department of the praetorian prefecture of the East responsible for the Diocese of Oriens, which encompassed his native Syria. His predecessor in the post, John the Paphlagonian, went on to supervise Anastasius's reform of Byzantine coinage.. From this position, Marinus became one of the Emperor's chief financial advisers, especially on matters of taxation; he was also responsible for the institution of the vindices, officials tasked with collecting the annona tax, which hitherto had been the responsibility of the provincial city councils. The details of the reform are obscure, and contemporary opinion on its effects is divided: John Lydus, whose stance is hostile to Marinus, blames it for impoverishing the provinces, while a panegyric by Priscian claims that it was a great relief to the farmers. Although the new system seems to have been successful in increasing state revenue, it was extensively modified and ultimately mostly abandoned in subsequent reigns.. By the 500s, Marinus had emerged as \\"the most trusted adviser\\" (John B. Bury) of Anastasius, and was rewarded with his nomination to the praetorian prefecture of the East, probably in early 512. He seems to have held the post until early 515.; . In autumn 512, Marinus encouraged Anastasius to openly support the Monophysite version of the Trisagion, which the Patriarch Timothy had inserted into liturgy even in the Hagia Sophia. As a result, the mostly Chalcedonian population of Constantinople launched a major riot on 4 November against the \\"heretical\\" version, forcing Marinus and Plato, the urban prefect, to respond with force in an attempt to quell the disturbance. The clashes continued, however, and on 6 November the Chalcedonian populace gathered in the Forum of Constantine and launched a riot that nearly cost Anastasius his throne: Anastasius's statues were thrown down, the aged general Areobindus, related by marriage to the Theodosian dynasty, was proclaimed emperor, and Marinus's house was torched. It took a personal appearance by Anastasius in the Hippodrome of Constantinople to calm the crowds, who demanded that Marinus and Plato be thrown to the beasts.; . In 515, Marinus was entrusted by Anastasius with leading the campaign against Vitalian, the magister militum per Thracias who had rebelled against Anastasius's pro-Monophysite policies and was marching on the imperial capital, Constantinople. This unusual appointment of a civil official to command an army was due to the reluctance of the two generals commanding the imperial armies around Constantinople, Patricius and John, to confront Vitalian, whom they had known personally. Despite his lack of military experience, Marinus defeated the rebel fleet in a battle at the entrance of the Golden Horn; according to the report of John Malalas, this was achieved through the use of a sulfur-based chemical substance invented by a certain Proclus of Athens, similar to the later Greek fire. Marinus then landed with his men on the shore of Sycae and defeated the rebels he found there. Disheartened by the losses suffered, Vitalian and his army fled north under cover of night.; . Although he is recorded to have joined with the praepositus sacri cubiculi Amantius in instigating disturbances in the Hagia Sophia shortly after the elevation of Justin I (r. 518–527) to the throne, Marinus managed to survive the transition to the new regime: he was named praetorian prefect for a second time in 519, and was even said to have decorated a public bath with scenes from the life of Justin, including his arrival to Constantinople as a poor peasant.; . He died sometime before 539. Of his family it is only known that he had a daughter, and that her son was named governor in Libya (either Marmarica or Cyrenaica), where he proved particularly rapacious.. ==ReferencesCitations=Sources=== * * Category:5th-century births Category:6th-century deaths Category:6th-century Byzantine people Category:Praetorian prefects of the East Category:Byzantine admirals ","title":"Marinus (praetorian prefect)"},{"id":"35874396","text":"FC NBU Asia () is Uzbekistani football club based in Tashkent.

The Diamond Jubilee Armed Forces Parade and Muster was a military parade held at Windsor Castle and Home Park in Windsor, Berkshire, England, organised as part of the Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Performed as a tribute to the Queen on behalf of all three branches of the British Armed Forces, it featured a review of members of all three services by the monarch (known as a muster), a military parade through the town, and flypasts by current and historic military aircraft. == Background == The event followed the long-standing tradition of having an armed forces tribute to the monarch during a jubilee year, although this event was the first time all three services, the Royal Navy, the British Army and the Royal Air Force, had visited Elizabeth II for such an event at the same time. According to military historian Peter Craddick-Adams, a muster is an opportunity to show the monarch what they do and what they look like at a point in history, dating back to reviews of the preparedness of local militia in Tudor times. He ascribed an extra significance to this event as a thank you from the monarch to the military for their recent combat missions, given the actions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya pre-dated the previous jubilee, the Golden Jubilee of 2002. == Preparation and organisation == In charge of the event was Air Vice-Marshal David Murray. Planning for it began 18 months beforehand, after the Queen accepted the request for a muster to be brought to her for the first time. With the venue chosen, 2,500 servicemen and women were selected to take part in the parade, including personnel who had recently served in the NATO operation in Afghanistan and on board HMS Liverpool during the Libyan Civil War. With a high standard of drill required for the event, refresher training for the participants began two weeks beforehand. Massed personnel of the Navy prepared at Longmoor Training Camp, Hampshire, while the RAF practiced at RAF Halton. The guard of honour practiced at Wellington Barracks in London. == Date, location and ceremony order == The Armed Forces Diamond Jubilee Parade and Muster took place on Saturday, 19 May 2012. It was the first major national event of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations for Queen Elizabeth II taking place in 2012. It preceded the programme of Spring & Summer celebrations in the UK which will culminate in an extended bank holiday weekend in June. The event started inside Windsor Castle and ending in the private grounds of Home Park, part of the royal Windsor estate. It was opened with an initial flypast of Typhoon aircraft, followed by a march-past in front of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh through the castle quadrangle. From there, the various parading formations proceeded to march through the town in order to form up at a second location in Home Park. The Royal party then followed by car along the parade route to the park. After the parade in the park, finishing the event was a main flypast of various aircraft, ending with the Red Arrows to close the ceremony. Following the ceremony, the Queen attended a marquee reception alongside 200 guests. == Parade elements  Marchpast and parade to Home Park === The Castle Quadrangle was selected for the march past to provide a close proximity between the Queen and the parading service personnel. As the senior service, the Royal Navy were the first to march past the Queen. From the castle, the parade proceeded down Castle Hill, along Thames Street and Datchet Road, to enter Home Park via the Town Gate. An estimated 20,000 members of the public watched the parade go through the town. For the Queen's subsequent car journey from the castle to the park, a tri-service guard of honour was formed along the parade route, drawn from personnel of the RAF Regiment, Coldstream Guards and Royal Navy. Mounted escorts of both The Blues and Royals and The Life Guards of The Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment provided a cavalry escort for the car journey, accompanied by music from the Mounted Band of the Life Guards with drum horse Achilles. === Parade in Home Park === The parade in Home Park took place in an arena with a grandstand looking over a parade ground, faced on the opposite side by a stage designed to look like Buckingham Palace (erected for the earlier Diamond Jubilee Pageant). A private arena, this parade took place in front of 3,800 invited guests, including 3,000 military personnel, their families and veterans and the monarchs of Brunei, Denmark, Lesotho, Luxembourg, Norway, Swaziland, Sweden, Thailand and Tonga (the Queen having hosted a luncheon for foreign monarchs in the castle the day before). The parade opened with a drumhead service. The Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir David Richards then made a speech to the Queen, to which the Queen responded. She was then given three cheers by the assembled ranks. === Flypasts === Eurofighter Typhoons in diamond formation Hawk trainers in \\"E II R\\" formation The flypast route was up the Long Walk and over the Castle. The initial flypast over the castle was by nine Royal Air Force Typhoons flying in diamond formation. The main flypast over Home Park featured 78 current and historic aircraft. The main flypast formation was as follows: 13 helicopters from all three services led by a Merlin and including Chinook transports and Apache gunships, all flying from RAF Odiham; the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight historic aircraft with Lancaster bomber PA474 leading 4 Spitfires, all flying from RAF Coningsby; 20 Short Tucano RAF trainers flying from RAF Linton-on-Ouse in a '60' formation reflecting the Queen's 60-year reign; two Hercules RAF transports flying one behind the other and a VC10 RAF tanker (with fuel hoses deployed) flanked by two Tornado bombers, all flying from RAF Brize Norton; 27 Hawk RAF/Navy trainers flying from RAF Valley in an 'E II R' formation reflecting the Royal cypher, and finally 9 Hawks of the Red Arrows RAF display team flying in a three-dimensional diamond formation arranged especially for the Diamond Jubilee. === Music === The parade included six military bands. It featured both traditional music including performances of Rule Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory, as well as three new pieces written especially for the event. These were performed for the Queen prior to the main flypast. ==GuestsThe Royal Family=== * The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh * The Duke of York * The Earl of Wessex * The Princess Royal * The Duke of Gloucester * The Duke of Kent * The Prince Michael of Kent ===Foreign royalty=== * The Queen of Denmark and the Prince-Consort * The King of Sweden and the Queen of Sweden * The King of Swaziland and queen/inkhosikati lambikiza * The King of Norway and the Queen of Norway * The King of Lesotho and the Queen of Lesotho * The King of Romania and The Crown Princess of Romania * The King of Bulgaria and the Queen of Bulgaria * The King of the Hellenes and the Queen of the Hellenes * The Grand Duke of Luxembourg and the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg == Broadcasting == The event was broadcast live on BBC One.

En vänlig grönskas rika dräkt is one of Sweden's best loved summer hymns, whether sung in unison or in parts. For example, Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden chose the hymn for her wedding to Daniel Westling in June 2010. In 2002 the hymn reached the Swedish pop music charts in a recording by The Real Group on the 2002 album ', scoring a Svensktoppen hit for six weeks between 15 June and 13 July 2002. The first Swedish hymnbook to include the hymn was ', where it was number 644. The melody was composed by S. Gastorius in 1675. Koralbok till Nya psalmer, av konungen medgivna att användas tillsammans med 1819 års psalmbok. Nordisk Nodestik- og Tryckkeri, Copenhagen, 1921. The melody used in most later hymnbooks is from a 1933 choral composition by Waldemar Åhlén (1894–1982).En vänlig grönskas rika dräkt (Sommarpsalm)(#201). Retrieved 22 May 2012.Evangelisk-lutherska kyrkan i Finland: Psalmbok (1986). (All five verses) Retrieved 22 May 2012. In 2016-2017 the melody was used in a Länsförsäkringar TV commercial film. ==Reception== Cordelia Edvardson, writing in Svenska Dagbladet, identifies the hymn as a beloved example of popular poetry, part of the Swedish people's cultural heritage. So for example, she writes, in verse two \\"the dizzy birds\\" (de yra fåglarna) express the joy of summertime. Carlhåkan Larsén, reviewing Per Rydén's book about Carl David af Wirsén in Sydsvenskan, describes Wirsén as a loser on the dark side of literary history, only one of whose poems still survives: the summer hymn, En vänlig grönskas rika dräkt. Hans Holmberg, writing in Kristianstadsbladet, notes that the hymn is part of Sweden's summer repertoire, and that people usually sing \\"only the first three verses, which are a hymn of praise to summer.\\" But, observes Holmberg, the remaining verses are quite different: they give a feeling of decay, with the biblical phrase \\"All flesh is grass\\". The hymn, writes Holmberg, switches repeatedly between life and praise on the one hand, and death and decay on the other. En vänlig grönskas rika dräkt can be and is used both as a summer hymn and for funerals: but, remarks Holmberg, \\"I find it hard to imagine an occasion when the hymn is sung in its entirety\\". In fact, Holmberg concludes, while Wirsén is now derided as a dusty permanent secretary to the Swedish Academy, he was actually too bold for us to follow nowadays. ==Publication history== * ' as no. 408 under heading Kärleken (Love) with melodies by Georg Stolpe and August Elfåker, neither of which are used in the Swedish hymnal. * ' as no. 644 under headings Tidens skiften: Årets tider: Sommaren (Changing times: Seasons: Summer). * ' as no. 476 under heading Sommaren (Summer). * ' as no. 23. * ' as no. 201 (copied into several other hymnals). * ' as no. 789 under heading Årets tider (Seasons). * ' as no. 22. ==ReferencesSources== *Libris *Den svenska sångboken (The Swedish songbook) ==External links== *Sommarpsalm at Project Runeberg. *Sommarpsalm at Lingonberrie web site.

Box splines are considered as a multivariate generalization of basis splines (B-splines) and are generally used for multivariate approximation/interpolation. Geometrically, a box spline is the shadow (X-ray) of a hypercube projected down to a lower-dimensional space. Box splines and simplex splines are well studied special cases of polyhedral splines which are defined as shadows of general polytopes. ==Definition== A box spline is a multivariate function (\\\\mathbb{R}^d \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} ) defined for a set of vectors, \\\\xi \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d, usually gathered in a matrix \\\\mathbf{\\\\Xi} := \\\\left[\\\\xi_1 \\\\dots \\\\xi_N\\\\right] . When the number of vectors is the same as the dimension of the domain (i.e., N = d ) then the box spline is simply the (normalized) indicator function of the parallelepiped formed by the vectors in \\\\mathbf{\\\\Xi}: : M_{\\\\mathbf{\\\\Xi}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) := \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mid{\\\\det{\\\\Xi}}\\\\mid}\\\\chi_{\\\\mathbf{\\\\Xi}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mid{\\\\det{\\\\Xi}}\\\\mid} &\\\\text{if } \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\sum_{n=1}^d{t_n \\\\xi_n} \\\\text{ for some } 0 \\\\le t_n < 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise}.\\\\end{cases} Adding a new direction, \\\\xi, to \\\\mathbf{\\\\Xi}, or generally when N > d, the box spline is defined recursively: : M_{\\\\mathbf{\\\\Xi} \\\\cup \\\\xi}(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\int_0^1 M_{\\\\mathbf{\\\\Xi}}(\\\\mathbf{x}- t \\\\xi) \\\\, {\\\\rm d}t. Examples of bivariate box splines corresponding to 1, 2, 3 and 4 vectors in 2-D. The box spline M_{\\\\mathbf{\\\\Xi}} can be interpreted as the shadow of the indicator function of the unit hypercube in \\\\mathbb{R}^N when projected down into \\\\mathbb{R}^d. In this view, the vectors \\\\xi \\\\in \\\\mathbf{\\\\Xi} are the geometric projection of the standard basis in \\\\mathbb{R}^N (i.e., the edges of the hypercube) to \\\\mathbb{R}^d. Considering tempered distributions a box spline associated with a single direction vector is a Dirac-like generalized function supported on t\\\\xi for 0 \\\\le t < 1. Then the general box spline is defined as the convolution of distributions associated the single-vector box splines: :M_{\\\\mathbf{\\\\Xi}} = M_{\\\\xi_1} \\\\ast M_{\\\\xi_2} \\\\ast \\\\dots \\\\ast M_{\\\\xi_N}. ==Properties== * Let \\\\kappa be the minimum number of directions whose removal from \\\\Xi makes the remaining directions not span \\\\mathbb{R}^d. Then the box spline has \\\\kappa-2 degrees of continuity: M_{\\\\mathbf{\\\\Xi}} \\\\in C^{\\\\kappa-2}(\\\\mathbb{R}^d). * When N\\\\ge d (and vectors in \\\\Xi span \\\\mathbb{R}^d) the box spline is a compactly supported function whose support is a zonotope in \\\\mathbb{R}^d formed by the Minkowski sum of the direction vectors \\\\xi \\\\in \\\\mathbf{\\\\Xi}. * Since zonotopes are centrally symmetric, the support of the box spline is symmetric with respect to its center: \\\\mathbf{c}_\\\\Xi := \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\xi_n . * Fourier transform of the box spline, in d dimensions, is given by :: \\\\hat{M}_\\\\Xi(\\\\omega) = \\\\exp(-j\\\\mathbf{c}_{\\\\Xi}\\\\cdot\\\\omega) \\\\prod_{n=1}^N \\\\operatorname{sinc}(\\\\xi_n\\\\cdot\\\\omega). ==Applications== For applications, linear combinations of shifts of one or more box splines on a lattice are used. Such splines are efficient, more so than linear combinations of simplex splines, because they are refinable and, by definition, shift invariant. They therefore form the starting point for many subdivision surface constructions. Box splines have been useful in characterization of hyperplane arrangements. Also, box splines can be used to compute the volume of polytopes. In the context of multidimensional signal processing, box splines can provide multivariate interpolation kernels (reconstruction filters) tailored to non- Cartesian sampling lattices,Entezari, Alireza. Optimal sampling lattices and trivariate box splines. [Vancouver, BC.]: Simon Fraser University, 2007. . and crystallographic lattices (root lattices) that include many information- theoretically optimal sampling lattices. Generally, optimal sphere packing and sphere covering latticesJ. H. Conway, N. J. A. Sloane. Sphere packings, lattices and groups. Springer, 1999. are useful for sampling multivariate functions in 2-D, 3-D and higher dimensions. In the 2-D setting the three- direction box spline is used for interpolation of hexagonally sampled images. In the 3-D setting, four-direction and six-direction box splines are used for interpolation of data sampled on the (optimal) body-centered cubic and face- centered cubic lattices respectively. The seven-direction box spline has been used for modelling surfaces and can be used for interpolation of data on the Cartesian lattice as well as the body centered cubic lattice. Generalization of the four- and six-direction box splines to higher dimensionsKim, Minho. Symmetric Box-Splines on Root Lattices. [Gainesville, Fla.]: University of Florida, 2008. . can be used to build splines on root lattices. Box splines are key ingredients of hex-splines and Voronoi splines that, however, are not refinable. Box splines have found applications in high-dimensional filtering, specifically for fast bilateral filtering and non-local means algorithms. Moreover, box splines are used for designing efficient space-variant (i.e., non-convolutional) filters. Box splines are useful basis functions for image representation in the context of tomographic reconstruction problems as the spline spaces generated by box splines spaces are closed under X-ray and Radon transforms. In this application while the signal is represented in shift- invariant spaces, the projections are obtained, in closed-form, by non-uniform translates of box splines. In the context of image processing, box spline frames have been shown to be effective in edge detection. ==References== Category:Splines (mathematics) ","title":"Box spline"},{"id":"35874457","text":"Portrait of Cornelis Ploos van Amstel, by George van der Mijn, c.1758 Cornelis Ploos van Amstel (1726, in Weesp - 1798, in Amsterdam), was an eighteenth- century Dutch painter and art collector. ==Biography== Etching by Ploos van Amstel, with colored pencil after Adriaen van Ostade, ca. 1765-1782, collection Teylers Museum According to the RKD, he was a pupil of Norbert van Bloemen and Jacobus Buys, and later became a member of the Amsterdam artist society Arte et Amicitia (De Kunstkrans).Cornelis Ploos van Amstel in the RKD He is mostly known as a collector and copyist of 17th-century artists.

The band members are Samuel Hancock on vocals, Cody Clark on guitar, Dustin DeLong on keys and vocals, Dusty Jakubik on bass, and Aaron Matthew on drums. The band released their debut studio album under the Sparrow Records label on January 25, 2011 called Come Home. The album Come Home was nominated for the Rock/Contemporary Album of the Year at the 43rd GMA Dove Awards. The bands' second album is Welcome to Daylight, which was released under the Sparrow label on August 28, 2012, and has seen chart success. The first single from the album \\"Banner of Love\\" has seen success on the charts, as well, and was released on July 24, 2012. ==Background== Luminate frontman Samuel Hancock is from Washington, Indiana. Deciding between business school or music, he chose music. Hancock went to Visible School of Music in Memphis, Tennessee, where he met Dusty Jakubik, who is from Tyler, Texas. At the time, Jakubik \\"was looking for a fresh start after his current band fell apart after signing a major label deal.\\" Jakubik's first thought was that he \\"liked the music Hancock was writing, and while he wanted to start a band, he was wary of working with someone who still had some growing up to do. Sam was coming out of a period of rebellion in high school\\". Jakubik went to consult his hometown friend Cody Clark. \\"I already knew I wanted to work with Cody. We both shared the idea that we wanted a band that was a brotherhood. We wanted to be close and for the Lord’s hand to be in everything we did. I told Cody, 'I don't know about this kid, Sam, but he's incredibly talented.'\\" Eventually, those concerns were put to rest, and they sought out two more members for the band, adding Dustin DeLong and Aaron Matthew, who performed with By the Tree and Kari Jobe. The band was finally formed in the Fall of 2005. ==Music== The band released three independent EPs that were called Luminate EP in 2006, Bright and Beautiful EP in 2007, Miracle EP in 2008. They were signed to the Sparrow Records label in 2010 and released another EP called Luminate in 2010 to introduce themselves to a wider audience. Their first full-length studio album was released on January 25, 2011 -- Come Home, after their hit song on the record \\"Come Home\\". The album was produced by Ed Cash, Paul Moak and Ben Glover. Lastly, the album Come Home was nominated for the Rock/Contemporary Album of the Year at the 43rd GMA Dove Awards. Their second full-length studio album was released on August 28, 2012 called Welcome to Daylight, and the first single from the album was \\"Banner of Love\\", which both have been chart successes. == Members == * Samuel Hancock - vocals * Cody Clark - guitar * Dustin DeLong - keyboards, vocals * Dusty Jakubik - bass * Aaron Mathew - drums ==DiscographyAlbums=== {  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Album ! colspan=\\"3\\" Peak chart positions - style=\\"font-size:smaller;\\" ! width=\\"40\\" Top Christian ! width=\\"40\\" Top Heatseekers -  2011  align=\\"left\\" Come Home * Released: January 25, 2011 * Label: Sparrow * Format: CD, Digital download  18  16 -  2012  align=\\"left\\" Welcome to Daylight * Released: August 28, 2012 * Label: Sparrow * Format: CD, Digital download  30  23 } ===Singles=== {  - !rowspan=\\"2\\" Year !rowspan=\\"2\\" Title !colspan=\\"3\\" Chart peaks !rowspan=\\"2\\" Album - style=\\"font-size:75%;line-height:1.3;vertical- align:top\\" !style=\\"width:3em\\"US Christian Songs !style=\\"width:3em\\"US Christian CHR !style=\\"width:3em\\"US Christian AC -  rowspan=\\"3\\"2011  \\"Come Home\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 18  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 30  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 23  rowspan=\\"3\\" Come Home -  \\"Healing in Your Arms\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 49  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 19  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" — -  \\"Innocent\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" —  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 29  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" — -  rowspan=\\"1\\"2012  \\"Banner of Love\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 16  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 8  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 19  rowspan=\\"1\\" Welcome to Daylight } ==References * Category:Christian rock groups from Texas Category:Musical groups established in 2005 Category:Sparrow Records artists ","title":"Luminate"},{"id":"35874626","text":"Tofenacin is an antidepressant drug with a tricyclic-like structure which was developed and marketed in the United Kingdom and Italy in 1971 and 1981, respectively, by Brocades-Stheeman & Pharmacia (now part of Astellas Pharma).

He appears for the first time in 528, when along with Narses he was sent to Italy with 7,000 men as reinforcements for Belisarius, who had just successfully survived siege of Rome by the Ostrogoths. At the time, he held the position of magister militum per Illyricum, a post he may have been appointed to already in 536, after the death of general Mundus.Martindale (1992), p. 748Bury (1958), p. 197 In the dissension that broke out in the Byzantine army between Belisarius and Narses, Justin sided with the latter, and accompanied him to the relief of the Gothic siege of Ariminum, defended by the general John. After the successful outcome of the operation, along with John, Justin proceeded to occupy the region of Aemilia against little Gothic resistance during the winter of 538/539.Bury (1958), pp. 197–201 The rift in the imperial army had by this time deepened to the point that Justin and John outright refused to obey orders from Belisarius to march to the aid of the city of Mediolanum, which was being besieged by the Goths with their Frankish allies, instead waiting for relevant orders from Narses. The delay proved fatal, and the great city was captured and razed by the Franko-Gothic army.Bury (1958), pp. 202–204 In the aftermath of this disaster, Narses was recalled, and Belisarius confirmed as supreme commander with absolute authority for Italy. Belisarius, for his part, resolved to conclude the war by taking the Ostrogothic capital, Ravenna. Prior to this, he had to deal with the two Gothic strongholds of Auximum and Faesulae. While a part of the Byzantine army under Martin and John hindered the Gothic army under Uraias to cross the River Po, some Isaurians and regular infantrymen under Justin and Cyprian besieged Faesulae, and Belisarius himself undertook the siege of Auximum. As Faesulae was well fortified and impossible to storm, the siege dragged from April into mid-autumn of 539. The Byzantine troops repelled several sorties by the besieged Goths, eventually forcing them to capitulate through lack of food.Martindale (1992), pp. 748–749Bury (1958), pp. 205–207 Justin is not heard of again until 542, but he probably remained in Italy during this time. In that year, he was the commander of Florence, when he learned that the Gothic king Totila had assembled a large army and was heading towards the city. Lacking supplies to withstand a Gothic siege, Justin urgently sent for aid to the Byzantine commanders in Ravenna. John, Bessas and Cyprian led a relief force towards Florence, forcing the Goths to raise their siege. After leaving a small detachment to guard Florence, Justin with his own men joined the other three generals and marched north in pursuit of the Goths. The two armies met at Mucellium, and the subsequent battle was a rout for the Byzantines. The Byzantine generals dispersed to fortified places across central Italy and henceforth failed to cooperate; Justin himself returned to the safety of Florence.Martindale (1992), pp. 656, 749Bury (1958), pp. 230–231 In late 545, he was placed by Belisarius, prior to the latter's departure for the Balkans, as commander of Ravenna. He is mentioned again as being left in command of the city garrison by Narses in 552, so he may have remained its governor, untroubled by the Goths, throughout this time. Nothing further is known of him.Martindale (1992), p. 749 ==ReferencesSources== * * Category:6th-century deaths Category:6th-century Byzantine people Category:Byzantine generals Category:Generals of Justinian I Justin (Illyricum) Category:People of the Gothic War (535–554) Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Justin (magister militum per Illyricum)"},{"id":"35874874","text":"This is a list of listed buildings in Dundee, Scotland. == List == } == Key  See also == * List of listed buildings in Dundee ==NotesReferences== * All entries, addresses and coordinates are based on data from Historic Scotland.

Founded in 1912, it is the oldest football club of Uzbekistan and Central Asia. It plays in the Uzbekistan Super League. ==History== For the first time football entered the territory of modern Uzbekistan at the beginning of the 20th century. For the first time the soldiers of the Russian Empire began to play football in their free time, which were based in various cities of Central Asia, and the region of Central Asia was part of the Russian Empire as Russian Turkestan. The inhabitants of the surrounding military fortifications of the Russian Empire, cities, and villages have expressed an interest to a new sport. Matches between soldiers watched a large number of onlookers. Special popularity of football is starting to happen among the local youth. The real goals at that time was only for soldiers. Gradually they began to imitate the playing fields as soldiers, and were able to make a homemade ball. The first ball for them was created by a local shoemaker, who used leather for the material, and inside the ball was stuffed with different fabrics. Shortly afterwards a few locals gathering together the necessary money, bought the Russian soldiers real ball. After the residents had a real ball, the popularity of football has grown even more. In 1912, in Kokand formed the first football team consisting of local residents. It was the first football team in the history of Central Asia and Uzbekistan. First, this team plays matches with each other, and then begins to play with the teams of Russian soldiers. Gradually Kokand team is beginning to win team Russian soldiers, and sometimes with big bills. Soon after the success, opponent becomes a team of Kokand Ferghana military garrison. Match in Skobelev (now Ferghana) extends until in favor of team military of the garrison with minimal-sum game. After defeat, Kokand offer to play a return match, and a month later the match between the teams is repeated. The return match took place in Kokand, and ended with the victory of the Kokand team with a minimum score. A distinctive feature of this match was that the match was watched by a large number of spectators. Soon after a series of successes Kokand team, in football are beginning to pay attention intelligentsia and wealthy people and merchants not only Kokand, but and the entire Ferghana Valley.

The problem with the balls decided by the members of the \\"Muskomanda\\" – brother Ruzimat and Ismail Niyazov's, who by profession was a shoemaker. They set up the production of homemade balls. Due to the high demand of balls among the teams of a large region, the brothers decide to expand production, and at the same time expand their workshop. The brothers, together with their employees, establish the production of not only balls, but also homemade shoes for football. After some time, the balls produced in Kokand are widely known throughout Central Asia, and even abroad. To brothers comes surprise made to order from Central Russia, and they send there ordered 400 (four hundred) balls. The most famous players \\"Muskomanda\\" in 1910s were brothers Ruzimat and Ismail Niyazov's, Hasanjan Muhiddinov, brothers Akhunjan, Akbarjan and Muminjan Baymatov's. In the 1920s and in 1930s the main players \\"Muskomanda\\" was the work of the Kokand plant for the production of oil. Some of the most famous players of the period: M. Akhmedov, M. Abdullayev, A.

The species is endemic to north-central Africa. ==Taxonomy and etymology== August Friedrich Schweigger first described the turtle in 1812, based on remnants found in Senegal by French botanist Michel Adanson, for whom Schweigger named the new species as Emys andansonii.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Pelusios adansonii, pp. 1-2). ==Geographic range== P. adansonii is found in Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Sudan, and Sudan. There are at least three distinct populations within the turtle's distribution. ==Conservation status== Although Adanson's mud turtle does not seem to be at risk of becoming an endangered species, destruction of its habitat (largely due to farming) and hunting by humans have both reduced its population. Hunting by humans persists despite local laws forbidding the activity in some of the countries in which the turtle is found. ==Characteristics== Adanson's mud turtle is a medium- sized turtle that lives in freshwater. The turtle's shell can grow up to (straight carapace length) and is known to be sharp and rigid, with dark brown spots and dashes. The ventral part of the shell (plastron) is yellow. ==Diet== Adanson's mud turtle is carnivorous. It eats mollusks, fish, and small amphibians. ==Reserve== A refuge for Adanson's mud turtle has taken place in the wetland area on the northwest side of Guiers Lake in northern Senegal and it covers about . It is the first refuge of its kind that is dedicated to the conservation of Adanson's mud turtle and its nesting and foraging habits. It was created with the help of the Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA Africa) and the Ministry of Environment and Nature Protection of Senegal. ==References * Pelusios adansonii (Schweigger 1812) – Adanson's mud turtle * ==Further reading== *Schweigger [AF] (1812). \\"Prodromus Monographia Cheloniorum \\".

In the early 2000s, structural analysis determined the bridge did not provide adequate clearance for trucks driving below, concrete girders were damaged from collisions, and suitable bike lines and sidewalks were not available. In 2004 the bridge was partially rebuilt by Capital Concrete Construction Inc., closing in February and re-opening in November ahead of schedule. 80 percent of the $3–4 million renovation project came from federal funds; 10 percent each was paid by the city of Portland and the Oregon Department of Transportation. By April 2005 cracks had already started to appear in the concrete. According to the supervising bridge engineer, the cracks \\"did not pose any threat to the integrity of the bridge.\\" SE Bybee Blvd. MAX station, on the bridge, with a bus passing During construction of the Southeast Bybee Boulevard MAX Station on the MAX Orange Line, the bridge was widened and elevators and bus pullouts were installed. The station is an island platform located underneath the overpass, with a cupola on the bridge serving as an entrance. ==Bybee Bridge Bioswale== According to The Conservation Registry the Bybee Bridge Bioswale, located at the northwest side of the bridge to treat stormwater, was also completed in November 2004. The bioswale contains mostly mowed grass which drains water from the bridge to Crystral Springs. A September 2011 survey of the project showed low invasive species activity but noted the presence of blackberry, morning glory and other weeds. Native plants such as alder, ash, cattail, cottonwood, Douglas-fir, rushes and sedges were also present. ==See also== * Bybee–Howell House, the Sauvie Island house built by James Francis Bybee * Transportation in Portland, Oregon ==References * Image: Bybee Bridge Bioswale, The Conservation Registry Category:1911 establishments in Oregon Category:Bridges in Portland, Oregon Category:Concrete bridges in the United States Category:Eastmoreland, Portland, Oregon Category:Road bridges in Oregon Category:Sellwood, Portland, Oregon ","title":"Bybee Bridge"},{"id":"35875012","text":"This is a list of listed buildings in Edinburgh, Scotland. == List == } == Key  See also == * List of listed buildings in Edinburgh ==NotesReferences== * All entries, addresses and coordinates are based on data from Historic Scotland.

Nature Preservation Fund of Ukraine official website. == Mariyinsky park == Entrance to the park The park is around 130 years old. It received its name from the nearby Mariyinsky Palace. Mariinsky Park was founded in 1874 near central entrance of the Palace and the money for its foundation were budgeted by the wife of the Alexander II of Russia Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse). Appearance of the park changed a lot since that time. For example, in the end of 19th century marble busts and sculptures were erected along the alley. In 1900 cast iron fountain was established and it is still there. At first the park was called \\"Tsarsky\\" (imperial), but after the revolution this name was inappropriate and it was changed into Mariyinsky. But park had other names as well. In different periods of its history it was called Park of the victims of the revolution, Proletarian park and Soviet park. In 1970's – 1980's children's railway was functioning in the park. The last great reconstruction of Mariyinsky park took place in 2000. ==Location== Fountain in Mariinsky park Park is located in the Pechersk Raion of Kyiv next to important government institutions such as the Parliament's building which is separated from the park by ploshcha Konstytutsii (Constitution Square).

The carapace is oval and elongated, with a pronounced dome, and is evenly rounded at the edges which allows the turtle to appear as a smooth rock. The carapace is very dark, often almost black, and lightens up to yellow or orange only at the sides. The plastron is well developed and can close the shell completely, with a rounded front lobe that comes together to form the hinge that is characteristic of the genus. ==Biology== The turtle is observed most often in clear, deep, calm waters, in rivers, and in vegetation-choked swamps. It is a semi-aquatic animal that remains in the water most of the year. It is observed outside of the water habitat only when seeking temporary aquatic refuge during the dry season. The breeding season occurs during the southern summer and nests are quite large, between 20 and 50 eggs. The turtle is most frequent prey to the shoe-billed stork and it is characteristically a carnivore, feeding on fish and invertebrates. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Okavango mud turtle Category:Reptiles of Angola Category:Reptiles of Botswana Category:Reptiles of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Reptiles of Namibia Category:Reptiles of Zambia Category:Reptiles of Zimbabwe Okavango mud turtle Category:Taxa named by Vivian Frederick Maynard FitzSimons ","title":"Okavango mud turtle"},{"id":"35875360","text":"This is a list of listed buildings in Edinburgh, Scotland. == List == } == Key  See also == * List of listed buildings in Edinburgh ==NotesReferences== * All entries, addresses and coordinates are based on data from Historic Scotland.

He was married to Justina, the daughter of Justinian's cousin Germanus. ==BiographyOrigins and family=== John was the nephew of Vitalian, consul for 520 and magister militum praesentalis of Emperor Justin I, who was assassinated, probably at the instigation of Justinian, the powerful nephew and later successor of Justin.Procopio attribuisce la tempestiva morte di Vitaliano, il più forte rivale di Giustiniano per la porpora imperiale, a un ordine di Giustiniano stesso (Procopio, Storia segreta, VI.xxvi-xxviii). ===Gothic War=== In 537 John sailed from Constantinople to Italy with 8,000 Thracian troops to reinforce the army of Belisarius who engaged in the Gothic War against the Ostrogoths of King Witiges. Aftering landing in Taranto, he reached Rome and was besieged by the Goths in December 537. He had brought with him men and supplies essential to continue to resist the siege for a long time.Procopio, DBG, II,5-7. In the winter of 537/538, Belisarius ordered John, quartered for the winter in Picenum, to attack the Gothic territory in order to push Witiges to lift the siege of Rome. John quickly reached Rimini, just one day's march from the Gothic capital of Ravenna. Witiges was forced to leave Rome to return to defend his capital. John was supposed to leave Rimini and head to Rome before the arrival of the Gothic army, but he remained in the city. The Goths, coming from Rome, put it under siege inside Rimini. Belisarius did not move to help John. It was the arrival of Justinian's eunuch Narsete praepositus sacri cubiculi and a personal friend of John who saved him from the siege (mid-538).Evans. When the rivalry between Narses and Belisarius and their disagreement on how to wage the war generated divisions in the army, John sided with Narses, following him in Emilia, which the eunuch general intended to conquer even without Belisarius's authorization. John contributed to the conquest of Emilia along with other general supporters of the court eunuch, but the divisions of the army that had formed due to the discord between Belisarius and Narses contributed to the fall of Milan by the Goths, persuading Justinian to recall Narses giving back the unitary command to Belisarius (539). After the conquest of Ravenna and the recall of Belisarius to Constantinople (540), John remained in Italy. Due to a unitary command after the recall of Belisarius, the Goths were able to recover under the leadership of their new king Totila. When the latter arrived to besiege Florence, the general at the head of the garrison of Florence, Justinus, asked for help from the imperial commanders in Ravenna, who intervened in force forcing Totila to lift the siege by retreating in the direction of Mugello, where he routed the imperial army due to the false news of the killing by one of its bodyguards of John, which panicked the Byzantine army. John fled to Rome, where he took refuge and remained for the next two years, until 544, when he was replaced by Bessa by order of Belisario, who in the meantime had returned to Italy. While in Rome, John expelled the Aryan priests, fearing that they might conspire something for the benefit of the Goths. In 545 he was sent by Belisarius to Constantinople to ask for reinforcements, but John lingered a long time, marrying Justina, the daughter of Germanus. According to the Secret History of Procopius, Theodora did not want Justina to marry and therefore John, by marrying her, would have attracted the hatred of the empress, to the point that John, fearing that Theodora could order Antonina (Belisarius's wife) to kill him, when he returned to Italy he was careful not to reach Belisarius and his wife in Rome.Procopio, Storia Segreta, V. On the other hand, John managed to recover Lucania and Bruzio for the Empire. In 550, when Narses obtained the command of the Roman troops, John joined him to balance the elderly eunuch's lack of experience. Narses reached Ravenna in the summer of 552, and within a year was able to break the resistance of the last Ostrogothic king, Totila, and to put an end to the war (552). ==In fiction== John appears as a character in the time travel novel Lest Darkness Fall, by L.

Perforce integrated the software with its Helix ALM product. ==Architecture== Surround SCM has a client–server architecture. The server manages a central database of file versions and branches. Users work on files on their local hard drive and submit changed files together in changelists. The client and server communicate via a TCP/IP connection using 512-bit encryption. ===Server=== Surround SCM stores data in an industry-standard relational database management system. The database contains both the file contents and metadata (file state, file attributes, branching and merging history, changelists, filters, users, groups, labels, etc.). A proxy server can optionally be installed to improve performance of file retrievals for distributed teams. ===Clients=== There are several different categories of Surround SCM clients: GUI, CLI, API, Web UI, and plugin. The cross-platform GUI client is developed with Qt and available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It fully supports all end-user operations and administration operations. The command line interface (CLI) is also available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. The CLI can be used in any command shell or script. Build scripts generally access Surround SCM files via the CLI.

The aircraft is supplied as a kit for amateur construction or as a complete ready-to-fly- aircraft. ==Design and development== A CLASS R-80 Bush Caddy under construction at the CLASS factory in Les Cedres, Quebec, Canada. The aircraft was designed to comply with the Canadian advanced ultralight rules and is also an approved US light-sport aircraft. It features a strut-braced high-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit, fixed tricycle landing gear or conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. The aircraft is made from 6061-T6 aluminum sheet over a cage of welded aluminum square 6061-T6 aluminum tube. The tail boom is conventional semi-monocoque construction. The non-tapered planform wings have 6061-T6 ribs and spars and employ a NACA 4413 (mod) airfoil. The airfoil modification removes the undercamber on the bottom of the wing, which makes construction easier, without giving up low speed performance. The aircraft's structure uses 2024-T3 aluminium for critical parts where extra strength is required, such as the spar, float and strut attachments as well as other critical components like the rudder horns. The R-80's structure is covered with 6061-T6 sheet of varying thicknesses; wing bottom skins are inches thick while the top is inches. The wings are supported by conventional \\"V\\" struts. 6061-T6 is predominantly used for its lower cost and also its better corrosion resistance, since many R-80s are flown on floats. Its span wing has an area of and does not fit flaps. Standard engines used on the R-80 include the Rotax 912UL and the Rotax 912ULS four-stroke powerplants. The turbocharged Rotax 914 has also been fitted. The aircraft can also be mounted on floats and skis. Controls include a central \\"Y\\" control stick. Construction time for the R-80 from the factory kit is 1,200 hours. ==Variants== CLASS R-80 BushCaddy on floats CLASS R-80 BushCaddy on wheels ;CADI R-80 :Original production version built by CADI, about 60 produced. ;CLASS R-80 BushCaddy :Version produced by CLASS of Saint-Lazare, Quebec, after buying the rights from Potvin in 1998.

Reuben Midmer founded his own organ building company in Brooklyn, New York in 1860. His son Reed started working at the shop at age 14 and eventually took charge of the shop. Around 1875, the name of the company was changed to \\"Reuben Midmer & Son.\\" When Reuben died, Reed purchased the business from his father's estate; and in 1906, he moved the shop to Merrick. Seibert and George Losh acquired the Midmer & Son firm in 1920 and changed the name of the firm to \\"Midmer-Losh Organ Company\\" in 1924. Grand Ophicleide Issue 27, page 6. Among the many instruments built, the company made 42 theatre organs during the age of silent films. It also built what is currently the world's largest pipe organ: the Boardwalk Hall Auditorium Organ in the Boardwalk Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey; inaugurated in 1932, it has over 33,000 pipes controlled from a seven-manual console. However, due to flooding, neglect and building renovations, some parts of the organ are currently inoperable and undergoing renovation. ==References== Category:Manufacturing companies based in New York (state) Category:Pipe organ building companies Category:Defunct companies based in New York (state) Category:Musical instrument manufacturing companies of the United States ","title":"Midmer-Losh Organ Company"},{"id":"35875558","text":"Leslie Harpold (January 8, 1966 – December 7, 2006) was a Web publishing pioneer, humorist, and designer, whose early and unexpected death raised the issue of the vulnerability of a digital legacy. == Writing == Harpold was the publisher of Smug.com, an online culture and lifestyle magazine. Contributor Heidi Pollock described Smug as part of the \\"cultural migration from independent 'zine publishing to collaborative websites releasing curated content on a monthly basis\\". Harpold's work there included a very early critical piece on blogging, \\"Logrolling\\". Her personal blog Hoopla 500, with posts describing her experience of the 911 attacks and its aftermath, was archived by the Library of Congress in its September 11 Web Archive Collection. She was an early victim of domain hijacking in 2001, with her website hoopla.com getting transferred because of a forged fax request, which resulted in a high-profile protest against Verisign. In 2002, her short piece \\"How to Make Things Easier for Everyone\\" appeared in Manual, an early experiment in non-traditional anthology publishing. Harpold was noted for her work to expand the boundaries of writing and to build more connections between writers and readers, online and off. In May 1998 she participated in a three- week series of in-person readings by online writers called Web Writers in the Flesh. Many readers since her death have become familiar with her through the work she did for sites such as The Morning News and pieces like \\"How to Write a Thank-You Note\\". Her writing on her now-defunct personal sites was also widely acclaimed, with \\"Possible Scenarios for Heaven\\" being one of the most notable. == Design == Leslie Harpold illustration by Jeffrey Zeldman (1998) She founded and led New York City design firm Fearless Media as Creative Director from 1996 to 2001. For her work with Jones Soda she won a silver medal in identity design from Print Magazine. She designed Metababy, a website somewhere between an early wiki-like community and a piece of participatory performance art open to anyone.Metababy – About She participated as an artist in the Banner Project, the Web element of Day Without Art, from its inception. She was also known for innovative work using Powerpoint such as Lorem Ipsum Dolor, her piece mixing the Latin text often used as filler (lorem ipsum) in unfinished documents with animation and graphics, and Click To Add Title, her 2002 competition versus Michael Sippey in the style of a Photoshop contest. Her design work was often deeply intertwined with her work as a writer. Harpold was a strong advocate of the need for \\"a personal, direct, and conversational\\" voice on the Web in order to make sites effective. Note: Access date for Internet Archive version of page is 1997-10-15. == Death == In December 2006, Harpold died unexpectedly. Her death was quickly noted as it took place during her annual online Advent calendar; Day 7 was the last one posted. At the time of her death, \\"Leslie Harpold\\" passed \\"Britney Spears\\" and \\"Christmas\\" to become the third-most searched term on Technorati. After her death her family chose not to maintain her websites or allow others to make her work available. This loss to the Web of her work raised the issue of digital estate planning for online creators. == Influence == Author and editor Choire Sicha and blogger Heather Armstrong both have cited her as an influence, as have designer Jeffrey Zeldman, author Maggie Mason, writer and podcaster Merlin Mann, and engineer Chris Wetherell. Like Harpold's work, recognitions of her influence often bridge multiple aspects of life, such as Wetherell's statement: \\"Her writing beat personal ploughshares into community ploughshares that cut through my personal and professional development like a sword\\". Harpold's influence on the personal Web was discussed by Christian Crumlish at the \\"Identity and Attention\\" panel at South by Southwest Interactive 2007, and it has been noted by many others including blogging software company Six Apart in an official post praising \\"her unique role in the history of social media\\". Many reference her piece \\"The Thread that Runs So True\\" as an important representation of the personal Web she helped form and of their own experiences with the early years of the Web. == References Bibliography== * Burton, Bonnie and Alan Graham (2004) Never Threaten to Eat Your Co-Workers: Best of Blogs Apress. * Carroll, Evan and John Romano (2010) Your Digital Afterlife: When Facebook, Flickr and Twitter Are Your Estate, What's Your Legacy?

It was designed in France in the 1970s; though three were built and more than twenty sets of plans sold for home building, no AS-37s are active in 2012. ==Design and development== The AS-37 is conventionally constructed from wood, with a spruce structure covered with acajou plywood. The small gap, high stagger wing arrangement first proposed by Nenadovitch is the aircraft's most unusual feature, though one that its designer André Starck had used in two of his earlier aircraft, the AS-20 from 1942 and the AS-27 from the early 1970s. The wings have low aspect ratios; the upper one is mounted on the fuselage a little above mid-position and the lower at the bottom of the fuselage, making the gap unusually small. The stagger is sufficient to place the upper trailing edge a little ahead of the lower leading edge. Together, the two wings were intended to have some of the desirable characteristics of a single, slotted wing. The AS-37 has wings of unequal span and chord, the lower one smaller, joined not by conventional interplane struts but by wing tip \\"curtains\\". These aerodynamic surfaces, as broad in chord as the lower wings, lean outwards at 45° with ailerons attached to their trailing edges. As well as stiffening the wing structure, these curtains were said to improve lateral control and stall behaviour. The earlier AS-27 was powered by a conventionally nose-mounted engine but, though the AS-37 is also single engined, it originally had two propellers in pusher configuration, one on each upper wing. The propellers turned in the narrow gap between the two wings, with the intention that the propeller slipstream should enhance the slot effect of the wing pair. The propellers were timing belt driven, with a gear reduction of 2:1, by a 49 kW (65 hp) Citröen GS 1220 engine placed near mid-fuselage, behind the cabin. The fuselage of the AS-37 is deep and flat sided. The constant chord tailplane, placed on top of the fuselage, and the fin, which has a straight, swept leading edge, both carry balanced control surfaces. The cabin is forward of the upper wing, enclosed by a single curvature canopy which follows the straight sloping nose. Dual controls are provided for the side-by-side seating. The As-37 had a fixed tricycle undercarriage with the mainwheels on side V-struts and half-axles and the wheels have disc brakes. The first AS-37 first flew in this form, later referred to as the AS-37A, on 15 January 1977 and by October it had logged 100 hours flying. It was built by Rudy Nickel. A second AS-37A was built by Léon Knoepfli but was modified after a short test programme into the first AS-37B. The curtains were removed and their stiffening role taken by conventional wide chord cantilever interplane struts and the ailerons moved to the upper wing. Flaps were added to the lower wings. The undercarriage V-struts were replaced with glass fibre faired cantilever legs, with fairings enclosing all three wheels. These changes increased the empty weight to 451 kg (995 lb). By about 1979 the Citröen engines of both the AS-37A and AS-37B had been replaced with more powerful 75 kW (100 hp) Porsche 2 flat-fours. The first AS-37B was then heavily modified by its builder into the Knoepfli VSTOL. The wings, empennage, forward fuselage and undercarriage of the AS-37B were retained but the rear fuselage was replaced with a slim, low set, flat sided, slightly upward curved beam, allowing a new and more conventional pusher engine and propeller combination to be placed immediately behind the cabin, just above the original fuselage line. These alterations were made before the end of summer 1980 and may have included another engine change to a Renault 343. Between 1980 and 1998 the AS-37A had undergone further modifications with the installation of tractor, rather than pusher, propellers, belt driven as before. The undercarriage was altered into a similar form to that of the AS-37B though without the wheel fairings. This version was renamed the Starck-Nickel SN.01. The SN.01 was active until at least 1998 but is now (2012) a museum display item, see below; the third airframe (the second AS-37B) also survives in a museum (Muséum Régional de l'Air, Angers) but is not on public display. Though plans for 23 aircraft had been sold by 1980, it seems only one more, the second AS-37B, was completed. ==Variants== ;Starck AS-37A: Original version. ;Starck AS-37B: Second aircraft after curtain and undercarriage modifications; third aircraft. ;Starck-Nickel SN.01: First aircraft, tractor propellers. ;Knoepfli VSTOL: Second aircraft with new low set boom fuselage permitting a direct drive pusher engine installation behind cabin. ==Aircraft on display== The Starck-Nickel SN.01 is on display in the Musée Aéronautique Presqu'île Côte d'Amour at la Baule aerodrome. ==Specifications (AS-37A)References== Category:1970s French sport aircraft Category:Biplanes Category:Aircraft first flown in 1977 ","title":"Starck AS-37"},{"id":"35875598","text":"==Events== *March 22 – Daniel Barenboim is awarded the Otto Hahn Peace Medal for his work with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra. *March 29 – Protesters interrupt a concert by the Jerusalem Quartet at London's Wigmore Hall. *June 8 – The Gregynog Music Festival opens; performers include Emma Kirkby, Catrin Finch and The Academy of Ancient Music.2010 Festival *July 11 – Rachel Barton Pine gives a three-part performance at Chicago's Millennium Park as part of the \\"Great Performers of Illinois\\" celebration. *August – Frank Huang leaves the Ying Quartet. *August 13 – The Three Choirs Festival Youth Choir give their first concert, at Tewkesbury Abbey, performing Handel’s \\"Zadok the Priest\\", \\"Water Music (Suite No 2 in D)\\" and \\"My Heart is Inditing\\", and Bach’s \\"Magnificat\\", accompanied by the Corelli Chamber Orchestra. ==New works== *Steven Bryant – Concerto for Wind Ensemble *Mehdi Hosseini **Taleshi Hava, for solo violin and bassoon **An Unfinished Draft, for flute, clarinet, piano, violin, violoncello and baritone **Pause, for flute, clarinet, piano, violin, violoncello and tubular bells *Wojciech Kilar – The Solemn Overture, for symphony orchestra *Fred Lerdahl – Arches *Bruno Mantovani – Concerto de chambre nos 1 and 2 *Krzysztof Penderecki **Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott for mixed choir, brass, percussion and string orchestra ** (A sea of dreams did breathe on me...

He taught Latin and German at the public high school in Earlsboro, Oklahoma, in 1912. He married Christine Agnes Dienhart, an Episcopalian, on May 1, 1912, who bore him two children. The first child died in Earlsboro, but the second child, Frederick Sylvester, born December 31, 1913, lived to become an Episcopal priest and served in a parish in Kingman, Arizona. Resch published a newspaper in Earlsboro and later moved it to Shawnee, Oklahoma, in 1913. He was superintendent of schools at Leadville, Arkansas, from 1930 to 1962, later moving to Kansas City, Missouri, where he qualified for the priesthood under Bishop Paul Francis Cope who ordained him on March 5, 1939. Bishop Cope was consecrated by Archbishop James Bartholomew Ranks of London who came specifically for that purpose to America and thus the Old Catholic Church of America was officially launched in May 1925. As an Old Catholic priest, Resch was anxious to promote the growth and impact of the church. Bishop Cope was, in the new priest's opinion, too conservative and deliberate, so yielding to the influences brought to bear upon him by Carforian clergy, withdrew from Cope's jurisdiction to that of Carfora. He describes this in a letter dated August 19, 1942 to Father Charles Bauer of Chicago: > The growth of the church was very slow because of the Archbishop's great > care and solicitude against taking in men who were not worthy of the trust. > He hesitated taking men into the church until I came along . . . but because > his hesitancy to expand and reach out, I withdrew and went over to the North > American Old Roman Catholic Church. I was consecrated a bishop in that > church by Carfora. I soon learned that I had made a great mistake in joining > that church. I went back to Archbishop Cope, to bask again in the sunshine > of a saintly man, a man of whom anyone could be proud, After coming back, he > told me that he had intended to consecrate me to the bishopric and prevailed > upon me to accept the office of auxiliary bishop, which I did. The > Archbishop is very conscientious, and he has kept the church free from all > evil influences. Accepting Carfora's consecration of Resch as valid, Cope appointed Resch his auxiliary on June 15, 1941. He was insistent that the church distinguish itself as legitimately and theologically Old Catholic: > There are at the present time so many of the independent churches that it is > hard to distinguish one from the other. There is only one way to know the > Old Catholic Church of America and to distinguish it from the others, and > that is by its purity of purpose, it honesty and its upright Christian > polity.\\" And again \\"We want to guard against Carforism. Our Church is clean > and pure. Every man is a gentleman. Every man is a priest, a shepherd of > souls. The Church is young and small but it is holy and without spot. The > size of the church is less important than the nature and kind of clergy it > possesses. We teach and believe all that ancient and historic Catholic > Christendom teaches. Resch served the church well in Missouri and in Mississippi later coming to Illinois where as an Old Catholic priest he served in Episcopal parishes. He served for a while in St. Margaret parish, Park Fall, Diocese of Eau Claire, Wisconsin and then in Good Shepherd parish, Momence, Illinois as listed in the 1953 Episcopal Church directory. Resch succeeded Cope as Archbishop of the church and established the headquarters in Illinois. He was a man of education and breeding fitting Newman's definition of a gentleman in all respects. He struggled to fulfill his charge as Archbishop, keeping the church solvent by committing his financial resources as well as his talents to the mission of the church. He consecrated Walter Xavier Brown as bishop August 25, 1963, who succeeded him as Archbishop upon his retirement. He died in 1976. ==References== Category:1878 births Category:1976 deaths Category:American Old Catholic bishops Category:Southern Illinois University Carbondale alumni ","title":"Francis Xavier Resch"},{"id":"35875622","text":"C.C. Smith (b. 3 May 1860? - 1 October 1924), a.k.a. Charles C. Smith, Charles A.C. Smith, and Charlie Smith, was an African American boxer who claimed the status of being the World Colored Heavyweight Champ and was the first boxer recognized as such. ==Biography== Smith was born in Macon, Georgia, likely into slavery, and he and his mother moved north in 1865. His birth date is given as 3 May 1860, but since he supposedly did not begin boxing until he was 19 and claimed the title in 1876, the birth year likely is spurious. Some sources cite 1869 as the year his boxing career began, and others 1879, which would have been three years after he claimed the championship. He began fighting as a bareknuckle boxer. The 5'11\\" Smith, whose moniker was \\"The Black Thunderbolt\\", fought as a heavyweight out of Buffalo, New York. Bill Muldoon, his manager, said he was a great pugilist possessed of cunning and a terrific punch. He reportedly fought 225 bouts. In 1891, he traveled with Muldoon's traveling carnival, where he boxed with future lightweight champ Joe Gans, who was beginning his career. Gans would become the first African American to hold a world's championship boxing title. Smith killed a man in the ring. On October 24, 1894, Amos Theis died of injuries inflicted by Smith during a bout in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1903, when he was in his forties or fifties, he fought and defeated the former British Heavyweight champ, 40-year-old Jem Smith,in Manchester, Lancashire, England via a knockout. He reportedly fought Colored Heavyweight Champ (and future world heavyweight champ) Jack Johnson in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1906, but it was likely an exhibition or never occurred due to Smith's age. Smith's official record is 39 wins (33 by knockout) against 14 losses (he was KO-ed nine times) and five draws. He also recorded one newspaper decision win. He died on 1 October 1924. ==Legacy== In 2020 award-winning author Mark Allen Baker published the first comprehensive account of The World Colored Heavyweight Championship, 1876-1937, with McFarland & Company, a leading independent publisher of academic & nonfiction books. This history traces the advent and demise of the Championship, the stories of the talented professional athletes who won it, and the demarcation of the color line both in and out of the ring. For decades the World Colored Heavyweight Championship was a useful tool to combat racial oppression-the existence of the title a leverage mechanism, or tool, used as a technique to counter a social element, “drawing the color line.” ==References== Category:Boxers from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Heavyweight boxers Category:African-American boxers Category:World colored heavyweight boxing champions Category:Sportspeople from Macon, Georgia Category:1860 births Category:1924 deaths Category:American male boxers ","title":"Charles C.

The law was passed in response to a student strike opposing tuition increases, associated with large student protests, and states that its purpose is to ensure that no student be denied the right to receive education at the school they attend, and that no one may impede the school's ability to provide it. The law restricts protest or picketing on or near university grounds. The law further requires that organizers of a protest, consisting of 50 or more people in a public venue anywhere in Quebec, submit their proposed venue and/or route to the relevant police for approval. Bill 78 was drafted by members of the Quebec Liberal Party, introduced by Education Minister Michelle Courchesne, and passed with the support of the Coalition Avenir Québec party. The planned tuition increases were subsequently repealed in September 2012, by a decree from Pauline Marois's newly elected Parti Québécois government.\\"Tuition hikes scrapped at first Parti Quebecois cabinet meeting,\\" CTV.ca, 20 September 2012; retrieved 6 January 2012. == Background  Early events in the protest === In March 2011, Jean Charest's Quebec Liberal Party announced plans in their 2011–2012 budget to increase Quebec university fees by $325 per year over five years (or $1,625),\\"Budget at a Glance (Budget 2011–2012),\\" Government of Quebec, 2011, p.12. an increase of 75% over current rates. In April 2012, the government proposed a solution that would have seen tuition rise $254 per year over 7 years, including an inflation index after the first two years (or $1,779), an increase of 82% over current rates. Student protests in Montreal against the government's planned tuition increases, 14 April 2012 Beginning 13 February 2012, students associated with one of Quebec's student unions walked out of their classes to protest the proposed tuition increases and,Statement of the International Students for Social Equality, \\"Quebec’s striking students must turn to the working class!,\\" World Socialist Web Site, 29 February 2012. by mid March, 250,000 people had joined.Marquis, Eric, \\"Quebec government escalates campaign to break student strike,\\" World Socialist Web Site, 1 March 2012. Protesting students from colleges and universities held a vote, demanding that the government rescind the planned fee increases and place a freeze on fees before returning to class. Clashes between student protesters and police began soon after the demonstrations began. Between 13 February and 15 May, groups of protesters, varying in population from hundreds to thousands, on multiple occasions blocked or attempted to block both the Jacques Cartier and Champlain Bridges, causing disruption to vehicular traffic; they were either dispersed or arrested by police. Students protesting at the Montreal Exchange were dispersed by riot police.Marquis, Eric, \\"Support for Quebec student strike swells,\\" World Socialist Web Site, 1 March 2012. Montreal merchants and businesspeople complained that the protests were causing a negative impact on the city's commerce and on tourism. Students who did not participate in the strike were blocked by protesters from attending classes at several institutions, including Valleyfield CEGEP, Université de Montréal, Concordia University,Seidman, Karen, \\"Striking students block classmates entry to Valleyfield CEGEP,\\" Montreal Gazette, 13 April 2012. and Université du Québec à Montreal.Dolphin, Myles, \\"Masked protesters hunt for scabs in Montreal university classes,\\" The National Post, 16 May 2012. The Quebec Superior Court issued injunctions against students who were demonstrating and blocking other students' access to classes at the Université de Montréal, the Université du Québec à Montréal, Laval University, and at the Collège d'Alma, threatening fines or arrest for picketing, assembly, and protest on university or college grounds. Judge Jean Lemelin explained the court's decision, stating \\"[t]he legality of the strike appears dubious considering Quebec's labour law, which only gives the right to strike to certain people and under very strict conditions.\\" Still, groups of protesting students on 16 May walked through the corridors of Université du Québec à Montreal buildings and entered classrooms to disrupt ongoing classes and vandalize, leading the administration to suspend teaching. Students whose classes had been cancelled were, as they spoke to the media, heckled by protesters. === Failure to reach an agreement === A deal reached between Quebec Liberal Party representatives and student representatives was rejected by striking students on 10 May.WSWS reporting team, \\"Quebec students reject union-promoted sellout of their fight for accessible education,\\" World Socialist Web Site, 11 May 2012. The deal had been supported by student unions and major Quebec labor unions including the Quebec Federation of Labour, the Confédération des syndicats nationaux and by the Centrale des syndicats du Québec. On 14 May 2012, Education Minister Line Beauchamp resigned, saying she was \\"no longer part of the solution,\\" and was replaced by Michelle Courchesne.\\"Education Minister Line Beauchamp resigns, replaced by Michelle Courchesne,\\" CTV.ca, 14 May 2012. Retrieved 26 May 2012. === Processes leading to Bill 78's adoption === On 16 May 2012 Quebec Premier Jean Charest and Michelle Courchesne announced their plan to introduce Bill 78, which would suspend the winter semester at the remaining 14 public colleges and 11 universities where Québécois students remained on strike. The bill would also restrict assembly, picket and protest rights on campuses and throughout Quebec. The bill was introduced by Michelle Courchesne on 17 May, and debated that day in Quebec's National Assembly. It was formally adopted on 18 May following a vote with 68 in favor and 48 opposed (with no abstentions).Bill page from the National Assembly: Bill n°78 : An Act to enable students to receive instruction from the postsecondary institutions they attend. == Provisions == Bill 78, which expires on 1 July 2013, suspends winter semester classes at 11 universities and 14 colleges where over 150,000 students were demonstrating or continue to demonstrate; classes for the fall and winter semesters at those locations will be completed by 30 September 2012 at the latest, without penalization to enrolled students. The Minister of Education, Recreation, and Sports is granted the ability to deem as not applicable certain other regulations or laws or to \\"[prescribe] any other necessary modification to\\" Bill 78 so as to provide for any dispositions deemed necessary to ensure the continuation of classes throughout the duration specified by the act. The law makes it illegal to deny a person access to any place if that person has a right or duty to be there and further restricts \\"any form of gathering\\" that might cause such denial from assembling inside any educational building, on the grounds of such a building, and within 50 meters of the limits of those grounds. Employees of the colleges and universities may strike with accordance to the Labour Code, but they are still required to work their normal scheduled hours and carry out their usual duties. Article 16 of the bill furthermore declares illegal any demonstration of more than 50 people, at any location in Quebec, unless the dates, times, starting point, and routes of those locations and also the duration of the venue and the means of transportation that will be used by participants, if applicable, have been submitted to and approved by Quebec police. It is then possible, at the police authority's discretion, to modify the location and date of the protest if it judges that the protest would pose a serious threat to the order and security of the public. The City of Montreal Bylaw P-6 has a similar provision.Ville de Montreal, \\" By-law concerning the prevention of breaches of the peace, public order and safety, and the use of public property,\\" Ville de Montreal Web Site, 25 May 2012. According to the provisions of the bill, any infraction against its prohibitions require offenders to pay fines, which are paid for each day of infraction. Those fines amount to $1,000–$5,000 for individuals, $7,000–$35,000 for student or union leaders, and $25,000–$125,000 per day for student or labor organizations. Fines are doubled for second and subsequent offences. Universities or institutions which do not comply with the provisions of Bill 78 are subject to the daily fees paid by student or labor organizations. The bill establishes a date after which all education employees must return to work, and prohibits them from striking should this, \\"by act or omission\\", prevent students from receiving instruction, or indirectly impede services. == Reactions  Support for Bill 78 === Bill 78 has received support from Quebec Council of Employers.Jones, Keith, \\"Quebec law criminalizing student strike threatens basic rights of all,\\" World Socialist Web Site, 19 May 2012. Its president, Yves-Thomas Dorval, stated that because of \\"the failure to comply with court orders issued in the past few weeks, the bill will have to include measures strong enough to achieve this objective in order to serve as a deterrent. This is especially true since certain cells will persist in a strategy designed to create and sustain chaos and intimidation despite the potential good intentions of the parties involved.\\" Michel Leblanc, president and chief executive of the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal has welcomed the new law as a way to protect downtown businesses, and André Poulin of Destination Centre-Ville has been supportive. Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier has stated that the intent of the law is to return calm to Quebec society, and show respect to the rights and education of non-striking students. === Criticism of Bill 78 === Protester displaying an anti Bill 78 sign on 22 May 2012 in Montreal Thousands of Montreal citizens protesting Bill 78, the Charest government, and tuition hikes on Saturday, 2 June 2012 The Canadian Association of University Teachers has condemned the law for \\"violating fundamental freedoms of association, assembly, and expression\\", its president calling it \\"a terrible act of mass repression\\". The Quebec Human Rights Commission has also condemned the legislation. Louis Masson, head of the Bar of Quebec has questioned the constitutionality of the law, though the Canadian Press has stated that some members are upset with this position. A Laval law professor stated, \\"Read it. Stunned. Can't believe that a democratic government can adopt such a law.\\" Professor Lucie Lemonde of Université de Montréal's law department stated the law was the second worst on record next to the War Measures Act. Student Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, co-spokesperson for the student association CLASSE (Coalition large de l'association pour une solidarite syndicale etudiante), has urged the population to consider disobeying the law.Montgomery, Sue, \\"Groups see red over ‘cynical’ Bill 78 ,\\" The Montreal Gazette, 19 May 2012. Université de Montréal philosophy professor Daniel Weinstock has stated that the bill is a scare tactic to frighten students and student leaders. == Subsequent events == Passage of the bill on Friday, 18 May was followed by major weekend protests in Montreal and breakdown of law and order at night, which continued daily for over a month. News outlets reported the throwing of at least one and possibly more molotov cocktails,Thousands march in defiance of new law, CTV Montreal, 18 May 2012. and the response of police with rubber bullets, tear gas and percussion bombs against protesters.Harrold, Max and Christopher Curtis, \\"After Bill 78, two nights of violence in Montreal streets,\\" The Montreal Gazette, 20 May 2012. Most other times protests were wholly peaceful. Several protesters wore masks in protest of Montreal's recent bylaw criminalizing their use in protests; the Harper government is seeking to make their use during unlawful assembly an offense punishable by up to 10 years' imprisonment. Police declared the weekend protests to be illegal from Montreal Bylaw P-6, arresting 69 persons on the night of the bill's passage, and 308 on the following night. Members of CLASSE voted on 20 May to call for continued protests and civil disobedience to oppose the new law, in addition to any increase in tuition.Shingler, Benjamin, \\"Quebec's largest student group vows to defy new emergency law,\\" Global Montreal, 22 May 2012. Protests on the same day included an effort to march to the home of Quebec Premier Jean Charest. CLASSE spokesperson Nadeau- Dubois has stated that over 2,000 persons have been fined by police under the new law, which students have vowed to challenge. Responding to student calls for civil disobedience, Quebec Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier declared that the practice \\"is a nice word for vandalism.\\" Over 100,000 people marched in Montreal on 22 May, marking the 100th day of student protests.Jones, Keith, \\"Quebec: Huge protest supports striking students, denounces Bill 78,\\" The World Socialist Web Site, 23 May 2012. A Leger Marketing poll showed that 73% of Quebecers believe that Bill 78 will fail to halt protests; a spokesperson for the polling agency stated that for students, protests were not only about tuition increases but also \\"about the capitalist system.\\" One third of Quebec college and university students, or approximately 155,000 people, remain on strike. Protests continued daily in the following days, with citizens now banging on pots and pans (cacerolazo) to express their opposition to Bill 78, first in Montreal and then in other cities and then to small towns across the province. Medias reported that many groups primarily concerned with the special law, and not necessarily sympathetic to students' demands, joined the gatherings across Quebec. After mass arrests on the nights of 22 and 23 May, daily protests where galvanized. On 28 May 2012, a group of lawyers demonstrated in Montreal against Bill 78. == References  External links == * Quebec National Assembly Page for Bill 78 * Bill 78 Text in English, as originally introduced Category:Quebec provincial legislation Category:2012 in Canadian politics Category:2012 in Canadian law Category:2012 in education Category:2012 in Quebec ","title":"Bill 78"},{"id":"35875677","text":"Kosmos 2001 ( meaning Cosmos 2001) is a Soviet US-K missile early warning satellite which was launched in 1989 as part of the Soviet military's Oko programme.

The main battle in which the train became involved was the siege of Bihać. The train's crew also performed in combat in the role of infantry. ==Operational history== The improvisation of weapons was a common feature of all parties involved in the conflict during the breakdown of Yugoslavia in 1991. As a result, both Serbs and Croats assembled a number of armored trains. The Army of Republika Srpska operated a train that was ambushed and destroyed in October 1992 near the town of Gradačac by Bosnian Muslim forces that included a T-55 tank. The wreckage was later converted into a monument. The Croatian Army deployed a two-wagon armored train built in Split with a shield composed of two plates, one 8mm and the other 6mm thick, with a 30–50mm gap filled with sand between them. The vehicle was armed with 12.7mm machine guns. The first wagon train was made of a General Motors diesel locomotive (JŽ 664-013) and two cars by local railroad workers at Knin. The cars were initially protected with sandbags. The first operational mission took place in the area between Gračac and Stikada.Radic, p. 51 The usual tactic was to appear suddenly in a pre-established point of the railway, fire its guns and withdraw quickly. The 20-member crew was occasionally re-supplied by small trucks.Express\\" enhances Serb Firepower near Bihac Associated Press, 4 December 1994 Following the improvement of the protection with the addition of armor plates, the train provided fire support on the railroad between Knin and Drniš. It was later sent to Lika, where the wagon formation became involved in the battles around Sveti Rok. It is believed that at this time, near the end of 1991, the train was dubbed \\"Krajina Express\\". In 1992 \\"Krajina Express\\" joined the fighting for the airport of Zemunik, near Zadar. When the train was not suitable for combat operations, the crew fought in the infantry role, like in the course of Operation Corridor. By the end of 1992, the unit became incorporated to the 75 Motorized Brigade, part of the 7th Army Corps of Serb Krajina. Two members of the crew were killed by Croatian artillery while fighting on foot during Operation Maslenica, in January 1993.Radic, p. 52 The train provided support during the struggle for Škabrnja, where the unit was involved in an attempt to destroy an ammunition dump in Zadar by pushing a wagon loaded with 3,650 kg of explosives and five tons of shrapnel through the Benkovac to Zadar railway line. The detonator would be a land mine attached to the wagon's bumper. The plan was to let the wagon roll down from the village of Nadin towards the target in the outskirts of Zadar. The results of this mission, if any, remain unknown. In the last days of May 1993, the train was to be involved in Operation маслинова гранчица (Olive branch), a Serb attempt to break into the Croatian defenses along the Adriatic coast south of Zadar that was eventually called off.Radic, p. 53 In September, \\"Krajina Express\\" was part of the Serb counterattack in the battle of Medak pocket.Taylor, Scott (2009).

The unit was attacked with antitank rocket- propelled grenades and 76mm guns and returned fire with its own 76mm weapon and with a barrage of 57mm rockets. Later on the day, one wagon was hit by a 9K11 Malyutka missile, which pierced the armor shield, but the rubber protection deflected or absorbed the blast. One crew member was wounded by shrapnel. A second missile missed the wagons by 200 yards and hit a derelict building. One source claims that the missile struck the wagon mounting the rocket launcher,Radic, p. 54 while another says that the hit disabled one of the antiaircraft cannons. In the last months of war, the train activity was hampered by the deteriorating military situation in Krajina. At the time of Operation Storm \\"Krajina Express\\" was sent to Lika. When its crew realised that the collapse of the Republic of Krajina was unavoidable, they destroyed the train by derailing it into a ravine. ==Armament and armor== The two-wagon train was originally armed with a WWII German 20mm gun and two 9K11 Malyutka missile launchers; a Bofors 40mm gun was added later. A pair of M-53 7.9mm light machine guns were mounted to defend the blind spots. The 40mm cannon was removed in 1992 and replaced by a Soviet-designed 76mm gun mounted on the rear wagon. The convoy was enlarged with a third wagon mounting two 20mm cannons. Two Zastava M84 machine guns and a twin 57mm multiple rocket were also added in 1992. The following year marked the definitive configuration of the armored train, when the 76mm gun was supplanted by an American M18 Hellcat tank destroyer. There was an open wagon with two 120mm mortars, but their operational use was limited. The end of the war in Croatia frustrated plans of mounting an 88mm flak gun. The sandbags which provided the first shield to the wagons were replaced by a 25mm thick armor plate. The roofs remained open and were covered with tarpaulins. On the sides the wagons were wrapped in canvas and rubber sheets, the in between space filled with gravel. This improvised laminated protection proved effective in combat when it dissipated the blast of an antitank missile. During the siege of Bihac three additional wagons were hooked ahead of the formation, in order to trigger any mines planted on the railway. One of the wagons carried tools and materials for railroad repairs if needed. ==Specifications (1994)== *One armored JŽ 664 diesel locomotive *Three armored wagons *Three additional wagons to detonate mines ahead of the main formation *Tools and materials for railroad repairs *One M18 Hellcat tank destroyer with a 76 mm gun *Three 20 mm anti-aircraft cannons *One 57 mm rocket launcher *Two 12.7 mm heavy machine guns *Two 7.9 mm machine guns *Two 7.62 mm machine guns ==In popular culture== Borislav Zorić Ličanin, the famous Serbian singer from Lika, included the song \\"Krajinom juri ekspres\\" (\\"Express Rushes through Krajina\\") on his 1994 album Ameriko ne diraj Srbiju, singing about the Krajina Express.Borislav Zorić Ličanin - Krajinom juri ekspres ==NotesSources== * Radic, Aleksandar (2008).

His identity was subsequently established as that of Anthony de Lucy, 3rd Baron Lucy, who died in 1368, probably killed on crusade at New Kaunas, in what is now Lithuania. ==Discovery== St Bees Priory from the south west The late 12th-century monastic chancel, showing the ruined east end of the chancel aisle on the left. Top effigy is thought to be Anthony de Lucy, and in the middle, Maud de Lucy. St Bees Man was discovered during an archaeological dig by the University of Leicester on the site of St Bees Priory. The 1981 dig examined two areas of the ruined chancel aisle at the west end of the priory. The aisle was built in about 1300 in the Decorated style, and is thought to have fallen into ruin before the Dissolution of the priory in 1539 due to structural failure caused by poor foundations. The body was found buried in a wooden coffin, wrapped in lead sheet. Despite the lead sheet being damaged at the foot end, the body was in a remarkable state of preservation. The body was wrapped in two shrouds, which are on display in the priory. Since the body's identity was unknown, he was dubbed \\"St Bees Man\\". The coffin and contents were examined forensically over the following week. The body was reported to exhibit pink skin and visible irises immediately after being exhumed. An autopsy performed on the body shortly after its discovery indicated that the cause of death was most likely a haemothorax caused by a direct blow to the torso. Although the body was about 600 years old, his nails, skin and stomach contents were found to be in near-perfect condition.Text of lecture given by John M Todd at the Post Graduate Seminar on Medieval history, Lancaster University, Sept, 1987, and later at Oxford, Copenhagen and St Andrews universities. The lead sheet in which the body was wrapped excluded moisture whilst the pine pitch coating of the shroud excluded air. ==Identity== The identity of St Bees Man is now almost certain to have been that of Anthony de Lucy, who may have been born in 1332/1333 and was probably killed in 1368, fighting for the Teutonic Knights in the Northern Crusades against the Lithuanians.Grant, 2014, p. 188C J Knusel et al - The identity of the St Bees lady, Cumbria: An osteobiographical approach. Medieval Archaeology - vol 54, 2010. This was established in 2010 after an osteobiographical approach was taken in identifying the skeleton of the woman who was buried with him, which was still available for analysis using modern methods developed since the remains were found in 1981. It is now evident that after his death the vault was enlarged to take the body of his sister, Maud de Lucy, who died in 1398. It is possible that Anthony de Lucy was sent on crusade in Lithuania by Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick , who had been appointed to a supervisory role over the Wardens of the Marches in 1367, after Lucy had caused trouble on the English-Scottish border (raiding Annandale, for example). Warwick had been on crusade to Lithuania previously and probably saw a way to re-direct the troublesome energies of Lucy away from the Scottish Marches. (Warwick's three sons also went with Lucy).Grant, 2014, p.186 A letter written by John De Moulton of Frampton to his wife in 1367, confirms that; \\"Anthony de Lucy and I and all our company make our way towards the parts of Spruz [i.e. Prussia]...\\" along with Richard de Welby \\"my companion.\\" It seems that John De Moulton also died at New Kaunas, along with a Sir Roger Felbrigg, a Norfolk knight.Grant, 2014, p.187 The Moultons had close family and tenurial ties with the Lucy family. Anthony was the last of the male line and the de Lucy estates passed to Maud on his death. Maud also inherited considerable estates after the death of her first husband Gilbert de Umfraville in 1380/81, and probably in a move to ally herself politically with the Percy family, Henry Percy purchased the licence fee on Gilbert’s lands and, therefore, the hand of Maud in 1381. Maud's connection with St Bees is proven by an existing stone in the belfry which carries the quartered arms of the de Lucy and Percy families. Maud insisted on this quartering as part of the marriage agreement, probably so that the de Lucy arms should be perpetuated.Grant, 2014, p.196 ==Exhibition== There is an extensive history display in the priory in which the shrouds are exhibited. Effigies thought to be of both Maud and Anthony can also be seen. ==See also== *Tollund Man *Lindow Man *Ötzi the Iceman *Bocksten Man ==ReferencesFurther sources *Articles about St Bees Man on the St Bees Website Category:History of Cumbria Category:Archaeology of England Category:Human remains (archaeological) Category:1368 deaths Category:1981 archaeological discoveries Lucy, Anthony de Lucy, 3rd Baron Category:Mummies Category:St Bees ","title":"St Bees Man"},{"id":"35875733","text":"The Ivory Coast mud turtle (Pelusios cupulatta) is a species of turtle in the family Pelomedusidae.

These included the Vietnamese Sûreté, the Saigon Municipal Police, elements of the colonial National Guard of South Vietnam ( – GNVS, or VBNV in Vietnamese), a rural Gendarmerie force or 'Civil Guard' (), the combat police () and various provincial militia forces made of irregular auxiliaries (). Transferred to South Vietnamese control in 1955, all the aforementioned security units were integrated in the early 1960s into a new national police force with the exception of the Civil Guard, which was placed under the Ministry of Defence. The CSQG had an initial strength of only 16,000 uniformed and plainclothes agents, being essentially an urban constabulary with no rural Gendarmerie component to counter the threat posed by the increasing Viet Cong (VC) insurgency in the countryside.Sir Robert Thompson et al, Report on the Republic of Vietnam National Police (1971), p. 3. ===The National Police under Diệm=== Even before the official creation of the National Police, President Diệm was quick to employ the security forces inherited from the French in repressing both internal political dissent and organized crime. Throughout the late 1950s and into 1960, they helped the Vietnamese National Army (VNA) in suppressing the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài militant religious and political sects, with approximately 25,000 armed militiamen, and the smaller but better organized Bình Xuyên Saigon-based gangster group.Rottman and Bujeiro, Army of the Republic of Vietnam 1955-75 (2010), p. 8. ===The final years 1971-75=== The CSQG strength peaked in February 1971 at 103,859 personnel – including 3,144 female agents, mostly engaged in clerical workSir Robert Thompson et al, Report on the Republic of Vietnam National Police (1971), p. 75. –, 4,450 vehicles and some 830 motorcycles of various types. However, out of this total only 27,565 officers and enlisted men were of career status, the remainder being on contract, daily paid or floating assimilated.Sir Robert Thompson et al, Report on the Republic of Vietnam National Police (1971), Appendix H, p. 3. Plans were drawn late that year to further expand the Police to 124,050 and later to 160,000, though the actual authorized strength in 1973 stood at about 130,000 men and women. ==Structure== The CSQG was organized at national level with logistical and administrative support from Saigon, but individual police departments were under the operational control of the provincial police chiefs. All components of the Police system were administered directly by the Directorate General of National Police (TCCSQG) at the National Police Headquarters in Saigon, which also provided technical or combat support for law-enforcement and other internal security duties throughout the Country. The Directorate General was headed by Sub-Brigadier general Nguyễn Ngọc Loan, who lead a staff comprising a deputy director and six assistant directors for administration, personnel and training, intelligence, operations, Field Forces and scientific police. By the late 1960s, the Vietnamese National Police was organized into nine major specialized departments or 'branches', which were: * River and Coastal Police * Traffic Control Police * Judiciary Police * Special Police * Scientific Police * Police Medical Service * Administration Service * VIP Protection Service * Field Police ==Training facilities== All instruction and management of training facilities fell upon the Personnel and Training Directorate (Vietnamese: Ban nhân sự và đào tạo) at National Police headquarters in Saigon. Recruits first underwent the basic 12-week course, which consisted primarily of weapons handling, tactics, Taekwondo and drill, ministered at the main CSQG Training Centre (Vietnamese: Trung tâm đào tạo CSQG) located at Rach Dua, near Vũng Tàu. After finishing the course, the best-qualified students were selected to be sent for officer training to the National Police Academy (Vietnamese: Học viện cảnh sát quốc gia) at Hoc Viên, where they attended advanced instruction programs at all levels, which comprised: * Officer promotion courses up to and including the rank of Lieutenant colonel; * Administrative and staff training; * Senior officer seminars; * Judicial Police training for officers and NCOs; * Instructors' courses at both officer and lower rank levels. Those recruits with lower qualifications went instead to the Non-commissioned Officer (NCO) School run by the ARVN at its Combat Training Centre (Vietnamese: Trung tâm huấn luyện chiến đấu) in Da Lat, co-located to the namesake South Vietnamese Armed Forces Military Academy, where they received special training that would enable them to graduate as Police NCOs. Specialists such as field policemen, patrol boat crewmen, vehicle drivers (this category included squad car, armoured car and Jeep drivers, and motorcyclists), radio operators, medics, mechanics, and clerks were trained in various other National Police and Armed Forces' schools. More specialized training was also provided to selected male and female personnel assigned to the other CSQG branches. River and Coastal Police boat crews were trained at the Marine Police Training Centre (Vietnamese: Trung tâm huấn luyện cảnh sát biển) co-located at their Phú Xuân HQ, near Huế.Sir Robert Thompson et al, Report on the Republic of Vietnam National Police, (1971), Appendix H, p. 1. Field Police personnel – including officers and NCOs – underwent eight weeks' of training in paramilitary skills at the Mã Lai Á and Phi Luât Tân CSQG training Centres. Instruction covered subjects such as jungle warfare, intelligence-gathering operations, law-enforcement and riot control techniques. To upgrade their capabilities, squads and platoons were returned periodically to these training centers for six weeks of unit refresher training, but for most CSDC companies and battalions posted in the provinces their refresher course actually took place at the regional training centers. ===Foreign assistance=== Additional military \\"on the job\\" training was provided to Field Police units in the field by U.S. Mobile Training Teamsde Lee, Guerrilla Warfare (1985), p. 56. or by Australian advisors from the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV).Lyles, Vietnam ANZACs: Australian & New Zealand Troops in Vietnam (2004), p. 7.

It is used to quantify the difference in energy between the π-system of the original molecule and the intermediate having the incoming electrophile or nucleophile attached. It can be used to study important transformations such as the nitration of conjugated systems from a theoretical perspective. The change in energy during the reaction can be derived by allowing the orbitals nearby the site i of attack to interact with the incoming molecule. A secular determinant can be formulated resulting in the equation: \\\\Delta E=2\\\\beta (a_{r}+a_{s})=\\\\beta N_i where β is the Huckel interaction parameter and ar and as are the coefficients of the highest energy molecular orbital at nearby sites r and s respectively. Dewar's reactivity number is then defined as N_i=2(a_{r}+a_{s}). Clearly, the smaller the value of Ni, the less the destabilization energy in going towards the transition state and the more reactive the site. Thus, by computation of the molecular orbital coefficients it is possible to evaluate Dewar's number for all the sites and establish which one will be the most reactive. This has been shown to correlate well with experimental results. The method is particularly efficient for alternant hydrocarbons in which the coefficients of the non-bonding orbitals involved are very easy to calculate. == References == Category:Molecular physics Category:Theoretical chemistry ","title":"Dewar reactivity number"},{"id":"35875791","text":"Nicholas C. Creede (1843 – July 12, 1897) was an American prospector famous for discovering the Holy Moses Amethyst vein and other mining properties near Creede, Colorado in the late 1880s and early 1890s. ==Early life== Nicholas C. Creede was born William \\"Billy\\" Harvey in 1843 near Fort Wayne, Indiana. At the age of two, the family moved to what would later become Jasper County in Iowa Territory. There, the family took up farming. Siblings included older brothers McConnell, Jerome L. who later became a postmaster,and John W. who later became a judge. He also had at least one sister, Clara. ===Army life=== In his teens, Creede worked in the U.S. Army Quartermaster's Department but grew weary of the routine work. In 1862, at the age of 19, he volunteered with the United States Army and served seven years as a scout with the Pawnee in campaigns against the Sioux. During this time, he received the pay of a first lieutenant although he held no rank. As part of these duties, he traveled in Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and the Badlands of the Dakotas. He was present in the Black Hills when gold was discovered there, which led to his interest in prospecting.New York Times, July 14, 1897Lake Providence Banner- Democrat, November 6, 1897 ===Name change=== In 1870, Creede left the army and returned to Iowa intending to woo and wed a local girl who had caught his eye before he began his travels as a scout. Upon his return, though, he found that she had wed Creede's brother, with whom she had had a child. Although the family eventually reconciled some years later, this event so agitated young Billy Harvey that he changed his name to Nicholas \\"Nic\\" C. Creede. The event also strengthened his resolve to become a prospector. ==Life as a prospector, discovery of the Creede mines== For the next 20 years, Creede drifted up and down the Rocky Mountains. Occasionally he would strike it rich enough to sell out and obtain a year's grubstake, but more often he was broke and forced to work at whatever he could to get enough money to resume prospecting. He usually traveled with one or more partners.San Francisco Call, July 13, 1897 ===The Monarch and Bonanza strikes=== Creede's first significant strike was in 1878 in Chaffee County, Colorado, when he discovered the Monarch located near present-day Monarch Pass.New York Sun, July 14, 1897 As was common during that time as most prospectors rarely had the capital, the knowledge and/or the will to develop the strike themselves, he sold the Monarch for a small sum. He then struck a vein he called the Bonanza which he sold for US$20,000 (~$454,500 US 2011). Creede used this money to tour the mining districts and learn more about mining, minerals and prospecting. ===The Mammoth and Ethel strikes=== Creede's next major discovery was the Mammoth mine on Campbell Mountain, Colorado in May 1890. Although the Mammoth had some very rich ore, it was not considered a big strike. Creede discovered the Ethel mine associated with the same vein a month later. Once developed, the Ethel shipped a little ore, but it was of a comparatively low grade. ===The Holy Moses and Amethyst strikes=== In June 1891, Creede discovered his biggest strike to date, the Holy Moses, near what was known at the time as the Jimtown camp. This strike was rich enough to attract the attention of David H. Moffat of Denver, who, along with Moffat's colleagues, leased the Holy Moses from Creede. Convinced of Creede's prospecting skill, the Moffat-led consortium reached a further agreement with Creede to continue his prospecting activities while the consortium developed the Holy Moses into a producing mine. In addition to a US$100 per month stipend ($2,500 US 2011), Creede was to receive a one-third share of all future finds. Creede cottage in Creede, CO This arrangement proved extremely lucrative for Creede when, shortly after discovering the Holy Moses, Creede located the rich Amethyst vein on a claim that had been abandoned by miner \\"Dutch\\" Fritz. The mines subsequently developed on the Amethyst vein included the Bachelor, the Annie Rooney, the Sunnyside, and the Commodore. Creede's share of the Amethyst mining operation was well over a million dollars, with some sources placing his daily income from the Amethyst and related properties at US$1,000 ($27,000 US 2011) per day in 1892. Shortly after discovery of the Amethyst vein, the name of the Jimtown camp was changed to Creede in honor of the find. Upon interviewing Creede in March 1892 after discovery of the Amethyst, Scientific American described him as reserved, modest, unassuming, taciturn, pure-minded, courageous and generous to a fault, but with a commanding air of a person whose few words were characterized by \\"great good sense\\". He was also said not to \\"know the taste of whisky\\" or \\"to know nought of gambling\\". ==Life after the Amethyst strikeMarriage=== Mrs. Creede c. 1898 During his time prospecting near the Jimtown camp, Creede met Nancy Louisa Kyles (née White) of Birmingham, Alabama. Mrs. Kyles ran a boarding house in Del Norte, Colorado, and had already had three husbands before she met Creede. She was also as familiar with the hardships of frontier and mining camp life as Creede himself. When Creede struck it rich, he built a \\"neat but plain\\" log cabin at Creede, and Mrs. Kyles served as his housekeeper while she obtained a divorce from her current husband. She also was said to have often accompanied Creede, and his young nephew Sherman Phifer, on many of Creede's prospecting journeys.Los Angeles Herald, January 12, 1898 They married in Las Vegas, New Mexico on May 25, 1893 and purchased a small cottage for $5,000 in Pueblo, Colorado where Creede's tastes were \\"simple and his habit economical\\". In due course, the Creedes bought a lavish residence in Los Angeles and relocated permanently from Colorado to California, where they lived a life of comfort and ease. ===Blackmail attempt=== In 1893, Creede received anonymous letters which accused him of having murdered a man who once held a mortgage on his father's farm in Iowa. One of his accusers was said to be the son of Creede's half brother. Creede did not believe an uncle-nephew relationship existed and believed the accusation was a blackmail attempt. The accusing \\"nephew\\" was later found dead, an apparent suicide, in a Pullman sleeping car in Wilson, Kansas in February 1894.San Francisco Call, July 14, 1897 ===Adoption of Edith Dorothy Walker=== In August 1895, the childless Creedes adopted six-month-old Edith Dorothy Hitt Walker. Young Dorothy's history was equal in color and drama to either of the Creedes. Dorothy's mother Dorothy was the daughter of Edith Waters Walker. Edith claimed to have been born in San Francisco in 1875 in poverty, hardship and neglect. However, young Edith was removed from poverty when she was adopted by a Mrs. Scott, the widow of a wealthy warehouse owner. Mrs. Scott then married William G. Waters, the foreman of the printing department of a San Francisco daily newspaper. When Mrs. Waters (Scott) became ill, the family moved to southern California for her health. There, \\"Captain\\" Waters acquired possession of San Miguel Island and established a home there. Mrs. Waters died during Edith's youth, leaving Edith on the island with only a housekeeper and hired men for company since Captain Waters was often on the mainland. This lonely existence apparently did not suit Edith, who wished to pursue a career as an actress. So, when a sailboat landed on the island, Edith persuaded the captain of the vessel to take her to the mainland. Dorothy's father Dorothy's father, John Mackay Walters, had his own colorful and dramatic history as the relatively impoverished son of well-to-do California businessman J. B. Walker, who was a partner of \\"Bonanza King\\" John William Mackay. Shortly after reaching the mainland, Edith met John Walters. Two weeks later, she performed her first role on stage under the stage name Ynez (Inez) Dean. Four weeks later, Edith and John Walters were wed. The adoption The Walters marriage was stormy and short-lived with Edith Walters leaving the marriage to pursue her acting career. Edith later entered the Los Angeles County Infirmary as a charity inmate. In the early spring of 1895, she gave birth to Dorothy. For nine months, the young mother tried to support them with her acting career. In the summer, she filed suit against her husband seeking divorce, and suit against her step-father to reclaim the inheritance she said was due her from her adopted mother Mrs. Scott. These legal actions garnered the attention of the press as well as Mr. Creede. Creede, moved by the accounts of the young lady's hardships, offered to adopt young Dorothy. The adoption was completed in late summer. According to some reports, Edith wished to give Dorothy a good home because of Edith was concerned that her ill health would soon leave Dorothy an orphan. ===Dissolution of the Creede marriage=== Mrs. Creede, who had begun taking morphine in 1876 after \\"having been kicked by a cow\\" and who was by now a heavy morphine user, was unwilling or unable to care for young Dorothy. So nurses were hired to care for the baby.Los Angeles Herald, January 13, 1898 In February 1896, Miss Maggie Kearny entered the household to serve as a nurse to Dorothy Creede. Although denied by Miss Kearny, Mrs. Creede alleged that in the summer of 1897 Creede began a liaison with Miss Kearny. Separation agreement Creede residence in Los Angeles In the winter of 1897-98, while Creede was out of town, Nancy Creede dismissed Miss Kearny and had her removed from the Creede's Los Angeles home. This infuriated Creede, who had previously promised to take steps to dissolve the marriage should Mrs. Creede take such an action. Following this incident, on January 4, 1897 Creede asked his wife to accept US$20,000 (~$540,500, US 2011) in cash, surrender all claims, leave their Los Angeles home and return to her home in Alabama. Creede and his attorney had prepared a document which Mrs. Creede signed in the presence of witnesses including a notary.Los Angeles Herald, January 19, 1898Los Angeles Herald, January 20, 1898 It was understood that after the necessary waiting period, Creede would institute divorce proceedings. Miss Kearny returned to the Creede residence on January 14. Divorce proceedings In the spring, Creede was said to have begun divorce proceedings on the ground of cruelty, alleging that she was addicted to the use of morphine.Los Angeles Herald, July 15, 1897 Mrs. Creede filed a cross complaint asking for half the property, and her attorney advised her to return to Los Angeles to pursue the case. She did so in June, engaging lodgings with her niece at the Clarendon Hotel. Creede was aware that his wife was in town and was said to have been distressed by her proximity, going so far as to have her monitored and her movements reported back to him. Although she did not meet personally with Creede, her niece visited the Creede residence and proposed, on her aunt's behalf, a reconciliation. ==Death== On the afternoon of July 12, 1897, Creede swallowed a large dose of morphine at his home in Los Angeles. Creede then went to the garden and reclined on a couch in the summer house. His gardener and confidant, F. L. Maas, noted an unusual feebleness in his movements and later noted that Creede's breathing was labored. He did not bring this to anyone's attention, however, until Creede's brother-in-law William M. Phifer, who was married to Creede's sister Clara, arrived at the home at about 6:30 pm. Mr. Phifer carried Creede into the house and summoned medical aid. Despite the medical intervention, Creede died some three hours later. Although widely reported in the press as a suicide, Creede's friends noted that he was in the habit of using morphine in moderate quantities \\"to quiet the pain caused by neuralgia of the stomach\\" and assumed he had taken an overdose by mistake. A coroner's jury subsequently ruled the death \\"accidental self-poisoning by an overdose of morphine taken to relieve pain\\". ==The Creede will and estate== Creede's will left the bulk of the estate to the adopted daughter Dorothy to be made available to her upon reaching age 25 \\"should she faithfully demean herself and grow to be a good, virtuous woman\\". The will also contained other, much smaller but nevertheless substantial bequests to his sister, his nephew Sherman Phifer, and his brothers. There were no provisions in the will for Mrs. Creede.Sacramento Record-Union, July 21, 1897 His sister Clara's husband, William Phifer, was to serve as executor and as guardian to Dorothy. Creede's estate was subsequently appraised at a value of US$153,716 (~$4,155,000 in US 2011) with US$105,000 (~$2,838,000 in US 2011) in real and the remainder in personal property although this only represented Creede's California holdings. Some estimates placed the total Creede estate at upwards of US$3,000,000 (~$81,000,000 in US 2011). ===Distribution of the estate=== A spate of legal proceedings followed Creede's death, culminating in a highly publicized trial which decided the distribution of the estate. The primary issues at this trial, held in early 1898 in Los Angeles, were: * Was Mrs. Creede the legal wife of Mr. Creede, * Was the deed of separation in effect at the time of Creede's death a valid instrument, and * Was the will a forgery. Legitimacy of the Creede marriage Nancy White (later Mrs. Nancy Creede) eloped with her first husband, George S. Vandever, in about 1858 when she was a girl of roughly 13 to 16 years of age. They eventually settled in Kentucky where Mr. Vandever enlisted in the army and served in the Civil War. She later learned that her husband had been stabbed, and had died from his wounds. In 1868, she married Jerome Davis in Cape Girardeau, Missouri although he died a short time later in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1886, she married Frank Kyles in Colorado, whom she divorced before marrying Creede. George Vandever, however, was not dead. Rather, he was still very much alive at the time of her marriage to Creede, thus potentially rendering Nancy Kyle's marriage to Creede invalid. According to some sources, she was aware of this potential when she accepted the $20,000 separation settlement in January. Unknown to Mrs. Creede, however, Vandever had obtained a divorce prior to her marriage to Creede. After he was released from the army, he returned home to find that his wife had disappeared—it being said that she had taken up with another man. According to Vandever, she entered a house of prostitution at Paducah, Kentucky and so, in October 1865, Vandever applied for a divorce on the grounds of adultery rather than simple desertion. The divorce decree was granted in April 1866. So although Mrs. Creede had not sought a divorce from Vandever before marrying Creede, Vandever had obtained a divorce before Nancy Vandever's marriage to Creede. =Bribery attempt by Mrs. Creede's brother- in-law= During the legal proceedings, evidence came to light that Mr. Mark L. White, who was married to Mrs. Creede's sister Elvira, solicited bribes from the attorneys of various claimants either to bring Mr. Vandever forward or, alternately, to keep him from testifying. White also asserted that he had been negotiating with Creede prior to Creede's death to furnish evidence that Mrs. Creede had never obtained a divorce from Vandever. White also claimed that Vandever was in partnership with White in White's blackmailing schemes (although many sources thought this was unlikely, given Mr. Vandever's good character).Los Angeles Herald, January 10, 1897 Legitimacy of the deed of separation Mrs. Creede claimed that the deed of separation was invalid as she was coerced and bullied, and was ill and was under the influence of morphine at the time of signing. Testimony associated with this issue confirmed that Mrs. Creede was a heavy morphine user. However, others involved with the events of January 4 testified that she was vigorous and appeared mentally alert on the day she signed the document of separation. =Business partnership with Mrs. Creede= Mrs. Creede also claimed that, in addition to a husband-wife relationship, she and Creede were business partners and that she was entitled to some parts of the estate as a business partner. For example, she claimed that Creede had agreed to give her a percentage of all strikes made during their joint prospecting travels and further claimed to have been present when Creede discovered the Amethyst vein. Legitimacy of the will Mrs. Creede also asserted that Nicholas Creede's signature on the will was invalid and that \\"the name of N. C. Creede had first been stamped … with a glycerin stamp after which it had been written in ink, or rather, painted over with a pen\\". Resolution of the case A verdict was reached in August 1898 which determined that, given the divorce decree granted to George Vandever, Nancy Louise Creede was Nicholas C. Creede's true and lawful wife. However, the court also ruled that the deed of separation Mrs. Creede had signed in January 1897 was valid and applied not only to community property but any business partnerships (should any have existed). She was, therefore, not entitled to any portion of the estate other than the $20,000 she had previously received. ===Guardianship of Dorothy Creede=== Guardianship of Dorothy Creede was claimed by William Phifer as defined by the will, by Mrs. Creede, and by the child's mother Edith Waters Walder who had subsequently recovered from her illness, married a San Franciscan hardware dealer and was now known as Edith Bashford. Regarding William Phifer's claim, concern was expressed that a man should have guardianship of such a young girl.Los Angeles Herald, November 23, 1897 Mr. Phifer died before the case was settled leaving claims for guardianship split among his son, Sherman Phifer, and three others. Regarding Mrs. Creede's claim, it was established that in legal terms, only Mr. Creede had adopted the little girl. The papers Mrs. Creede had signed at the time of adoption were simply agreements to the adoption by Mr. Creede.Los Angeles Herald, January 15, 1898 The court ultimately decided, in 1898, that Mrs. Bashford would be granted guardianship of Dorothy until she came of age. With that decision, Dorothy was relocated to Mrs. Bashford's home in San Francisco. Dorothy Creede's later life and death In 1901, young Miss Creede, under the guardianship of her mother, succeeded in overthrowing the restriction on inheritance at age 25 and received a substantial portion of the estate at that time. She graduated from Tamalpais High School in the Mill Valley area of Sausalito, California in 1914, married William Lloyd Ritchie and bore one daughter, Edith Romer Ritchie in the late summer of 1918. Mrs. Ritchie (Creede) died at the age of 23 in November 1918 at the St. Francis Hospital only a few months after the birth of her daughter when a case of bronchitis developed into the Spanish flu. The bulk of the Creede estate then passed to her daughter with the remainder passing to her mother Mrs. Bashford. ===Related lawsuits=== The legal wrangling associated with Creede's death did not end with the ruling on Dorothy Creede's guardianship. John T. Jones, as administrator of the estate on Miss Creede's behalf, filed suit in 1899 claiming that David H. Moffat and other members of the Moffat-led consortium conspired to induce Creede, who is said to have been mentally unbalanced, to give them his stock in the Amethyst Mining Company free of charge. The suit claimed that a one-third interest in the Amethyst mines was worth over US$5,000,000 (~$135,000,000 US 2011). ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * Category:1843 births Category:1897 deaths Category:American prospectors Category:Colorado Mining Boom Category:American city founders Category:Drug-related deaths in California Category:People from Jasper County, Iowa Category:People from Mineral County, Colorado Category:Dakota War of 1862 Category:Mineral County, Colorado ","title":"Nicholas C.

The first competitive venture in Europe came about as a result of Burnley's 1959–60 First Division title win under their manager Harry Potts. The team qualified for the 1960–61 European Cup where they faced French champions Stade de Reims in the first round before being sent out of the contest by West German champions Hamburger SV in the quarter-final. Burnley's following European campaign came six years later, in the 1966–67 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, where they were again knocked out by a West German side, this time by Eintracht Frankfurt. Burnley had to wait 51 years for their third appearance in a European football competition, when the team qualified for the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League, in which they were eliminated in the play-off round by Greek club Olympiacos. The team have also competed in non-UEFA- sanctioned European football tournaments in the 1970s and early 1980s. They participated twice in the Texaco Cup, a competition involving sides from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland that had not qualified for UEFA-sanctioned European competitions or the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Burnley reached the 1974 final but lost against Newcastle United after extra time. The team competed in the Texaco Cup's successor, the Anglo- Scottish Cup, on five occasions. Burnley won the tournament in 1979, after they defeated Oldham Athletic 4–2 on aggregate. ==History1960–61 European Cup=== The alt=A black and white image of a stadium Burnley's first appearance in European football came in the 1960–61 season. The club had won its second First Division title under the management of Harry Potts and as such qualified for the 1960–61 European Cup. Burnley was the third club to represent England in the competition, preceded by Manchester United and Wolverhampton Wanderers. The club's squad consisted of mostly players who came through the Burnley youth academy; a transfer fee was paid for only two players — for Jimmy McIlroy in 1950 and for Alex Elder in 1959. Potts often employed the at the time unfashionable 4–4–2 formation and he implemented a Total Football playing style, as his team mainly revolved around the duo of captain Jimmy Adamson and playmaker McIlroy. Burnley received a bye in the preliminary round of the competition and were drawn against French club Stade de Reims in the first round. Reims were the 1959–60 French Division 1 champions,Simpson (2007), p. 296 and were runners-up in the European Cup in 1956 and 1959. The Reims team mainly revolved around striker Just Fontaine and playmaker Raymond Kopa; Fontaine had scored a record 13 goals during the 1958 FIFA World Cup and Kopa had been awarded the 1958 Ballon d'Or, an annual award given to the best European footballer. The first leg was played at Turf Moor and was won 2–0: Jimmy Robson scored in the first minute and McIlroy netted a second in the 22nd minute.Simpson (2007), p. 504 The return leg, two weeks later at Parc des Princes, Paris, ended in a 3–2 loss. Robson put Burnley ahead in the 33rd minute but Reims scored two in the second half via Roger Piantoni and Bruno Rodzik. John Connelly equalised after he dribbled past several Reims players to score, only for Rodzik to net his second a minute later. During the game, Potts ran on the pitch to put the ball back to its correct place during a Reims free-kick, having become exasperated by their constant attempts to steal a few yards, after which he was taken off the field by the police. Despite the loss and crowd disturbances during the match, Burnley won 4–3 on aggregate and qualified for the quarter-final. The draw saw the club face West German champions Hamburger SV, the first leg to be played at Turf Moor.Simpson (2007), p. 297 Brian Pilkington scored twice to put Burnley 2–0 up and Robson added a third, before Hamburg pulled one back in the last minutes of the game. The second leg was played two months later at the Volksparkstadion and was broadcast live on the BBC. Klaus Stürmer and star striker Uwe Seeler scored for Hamburg, only for Gordon Harris to put Burnley back ahead on aggregate in the 55th minute. Hamburg were in front again inside six minutes as both Gert Dörfel and Seeler scored. McIlroy hit the post in the last minute and Burnley were eliminated. ===1966–67 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup=== alt=A coloured image of a man posing for a photograph It was six years before Burnley ventured back into European football competition. They qualified for the 1966–67 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup due to a third-place finish in the 1965–66 First Division. Their fortunes had declined, however, as McIlroy was sold to Stoke City in 1963 and Adamson retired a year later.Simpson (2007), pp. 304–312Simpson (2007), pp. 497–498 Even more damaging was the impact of the abolition of the maximum wage in 1961, which meant clubs from small towns, like Burnley, could no longer compete financially with sides from bigger towns and cities. The Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was a European competition contested between 1955 and 1971. The tournament was set up to promote international trade fairs and was initially only open to clubs or selected squads from cities that hosted those; where teams finished in their national league had no relevance. This later changed, with teams qualifying based on league position in their domestic leagues. The competition was organised by the Fairs Cup committee, who were backed by FIFA executive committee members Ottorino Barassi, Stanley Rous and . In 1971, the tournament came under the auspices of UEFA and was replaced by the UEFA Cup. UEFA does not consider teams' records in the Fairs Cup to be part of their European record. However, FIFA does view the competition as a major honour. * * The club entered the competition along with fellow English clubs West Bromwich Albion and eventual beaten finalists Leeds United. The first round draw saw Burnley face another West German team: VfB Stuttgart, who replaced Hannover 96, whose entry was later disallowed by the competition committee as Stuttgart finished in a higher league position.Simpson (2007), p. 320 The first leg was played at their Neckarstadion and ended in a 1–1 draw, after Willie Irvine scored the first goal.Simpson (2007), p. 505 Burnley ended the match with 10 players as Brian O'Neil was sent off in the 85th minute. The team won the return leg a week later with a score of 2–0, Ralph Coates and Andy Lochhead both on the scoresheet. Swiss side Lausanne-Sport were the opponents in the second round; Burnley won the first leg 3–1 at Lausanne's ground with goals from Coates, Harris and Lochhead. The second leg was a rather one-sided contest as the team ran out 5–0 winners, after Lochhead scored a hat-trick and O'Neil and Irvine added further goals. Burnley were drawn against Italian club Napoli in the following round. The first leg at Turf Moor ended in a 3–0 victory with goals from Coates, Les Latcham and Lochhead, who scored his sixth goal in the competition. Napoli ended the match with 10 men after defender was sent off for kicking Lochhead in the head. The return leg three weeks later proved to be much more difficult for Burnley. The Italian press previewed the match in a belligerent manner: \\"From Lancashire where studs are made out of rose petals ... to Naples where visiting players are put through a mincing machine at the end of the game and their remains are roasted on a spit\\". A crowd of 60,000 saw Burnley goalkeeper Harry Thomson making 13 saves, including a penalty kick from José Altafini, as the match ended in a 0–0 draw. The game was again not without controversy: Dave Merrington was elbowed in the stomach by a frustrated Omar Sivori in the closing stages of the match and after the match ended, Thomson was spat in his face by Alberto Orlando, who also refused his handshake. The team, the Burnley fans and the English press were escorted to the airport by a convoy to escape the Napoli fans, who hurled missiles during the match. After the game, Thomson was hailed by the Italian press as a \\"God in a Green Jersey\\". The quarter-final draw paired Burnley with Eintracht Frankfurt, the first leg being held at the Waldstadion. Jürgen Friedrich scored for Eintracht, before Brian Miller netted the away goal. The second leg was played two weeks later at Turf Moor in front of more than 25,000 supporters.Simpson (2007), p. 515 Eintracht took a 2–0 lead, only for Miller to score again; the team could not find two more goals and were again eliminated by a West German side. ===2018–19 UEFA Europa League=== Manager alt=A football manager is sitting behind a microphone, while his hands are cupped Burnley had to wait 51 years for their third appearance in a European football competition. During that period, the club played in all four professional divisions and only escaped relegation to the non-league fifth- tier Football Conference on the last matchday in 1987. Burnley climbed back up the divisions and were promoted to the first tier in 2009 after a 33-year absence. After yo-yoing between the first and second tiers, Burnley were promoted to the Premier League again in 2016. The team finished in seventh position in the 2017–18 Premier League, which ensured qualification for the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League second qualifying round. Burnley were drawn against Scottish side Aberdeen to set up an all-British tie. The first leg at Aberdeen's Pittodrie Stadium ended in a 1–1 draw: Sam Vokes cancelled out Aberdeen's Gary Mackay-Steven's converted penalty kick. The second leg saw the club's striker Chris Wood open the score, before Lewis Ferguson equalised with a bicycle kick. The game went into extra time, with Jack Cork and an Ashley Barnes penalty sealing the tie for Burnley. They were drawn against Turkish club İstanbul Başakşehir in the third qualifying round, with the first match being held in Istanbul, which resulted in a 0–0 draw. Başakşehir decided to not sell tickets to their fans for the return leg at Turf Moor and left the away end empty. After another goalless 90 minutes, the second leg went again into extra time. Jack Cork scored the only goal in the 97th minute to set up a tie with Greek club Olympiacos in the play-off round, the last round before the group stage. Five Burnley supporters were injured in incidents of football hooliganism several hours before the first leg started in Piraeus. The team wore black armbands in memory of Jimmy McIlroy, who had died three days earlier. Kostas Fortounis put the home side in front, before Wood scored a penalty kick to level the score, although Andreas Bouchalakis restored their lead in the 48th minute. Ten minutes later, Burnley defender Ben Gibson was sent off after he collected his second yellow card for handball and Fortounis scored his second from the resulting penalty. Olympiacos owner Evangelos Marinakis had reportedly entered the referee's room at half-time to vent his frustration at his performance; Burnley manager Sean Dyche later accused their staff of intimidating the officials. In the return leg, Burnley missed multiple chances to score, before Daniel Podence put the away side ahead in the 83rd minute, although substitute Matěj Vydra equalised on his debut three minutes later. The team lost 4–2 on aggregate and went out of the competition. == Records  By season === {  width=70% +Burnley's record in UEFA-sanctioned European competitions and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup ! scope=col Season ! scope=col Competition ! scope=col Round ! scope=col Club ! scope=col Country ! scope=col Home result ! scope=col Away result ! scope=col Notes - rowspan=\\"3\\"1960–61 rowspan=\\"3\\"European Cup align=centerPR align=center colspan=\\"4\\"Received a bye align=center - align=center1R Stade de Reims France align=center2–0 align=center2–3  - align=centerQF Hamburger SV West Germany align=center3–1 align=center1–4  - rowspan=\\"4\\"1966–67 rowspan=\\"4\\"Inter-Cities Fairs Cup align=center1R VfB Stuttgart West Germany align=center2–0 align=center1–1 align=center - align=center2R Lausanne-Sport Switzerland align=center5–0 align=center3–1  - align=center3R Napoli Italy align=center3–0 align=center0–0  - align=centerQF Eintracht Frankfurt West Germany align=center1–2 align=center1–1 align=center - rowspan=\\"3\\"2018–19 rowspan=\\"3\\"UEFA Europa League align=center2QR Aberdeen Scotland align=center3–1 align=center1–1 align=center - align=center3QR İstanbul Başakşehir Turkey align=center1–0 align=center0–0  - align=centerPOR Olympiacos Greece align=center1–1 align=center1–3 align=center } ;Key * 2QR = Second qualifying round * 3QR = Third qualifying round * POR = Play-off round * PR = Preliminary round * 1R = First round * 2R = Second round * 3R = Third round * QF = Quarter-final === By competition === { class=\\"sortable \\" width=70% ! width=30%Competition ! width=10%Played ! width=10%Won ! width=10%Drawn ! width=10%Lost ! width=10%Goals for ! width=10%Goals against -  European Cup  align=center4  align=center2  align=center0  align=center2  align=center8  align=center8 -  Inter-Cities Fairs Cup  align=center8  align=center4  align=center3  align=center1  align=center16  align=center5 -  UEFA Europa League  align=center6  align=center2  align=center3  align=center1  align=center7  align=center6 -class=\\"sortbottom\\"  Total  align=center18  align=center8  align=center6  align=center4  align=center31  align=center19 } === By location === { class=\\"sortable \\" width=70% ! width=30%Location ! width=10%Played ! width=10%Won ! width=10%Drawn ! width=10%Lost ! width=10%Goals for ! width=10%Goals against -  Turf Moor  align=center9  align=center7  align=center1  align=center1  align=center21  align=center5 -  Away venues  align=center9  align=center1  align=center5  align=center3  align=center10  align=center14 -class=\\"sortbottom\\"  Total  align=center18  align=center8  align=center6  align=center4  align=center31  align=center19 } === Club and players === *Most appearances in UEFA-sanctioned European competitions and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup: Brian Miller, 12Simpson (2007), pp. 514–515 *Most goals in UEFA- sanctioned European competitions and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup: Andy Lochhead, 6 *Most goals in a season: Andy Lochhead, 6, 1966–67 *First European match: Burnley 2–0 Stade de Reims, European Cup, first round, 16 November 1960 *First goal scored in Europe: Jimmy Robson (in the first minute), against Stade de Reims, 16 November 1960 *Biggest win: Burnley 5–0 Lausanne-Sport, in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, 25 October 1966 *Biggest defeat: Hamburger SV 4–1 Burnley, in the European Cup, 15 March 1961 *Highest home attendance: 47,000 against Hamburger SV, European Cup, 18 January 1961Simpson (2007), p. 514 *Lowest home attendance: 15,234 against Olympiacos, UEFA Europa League, 30 August 2018 *Highest away attendance: 74,000 against Hamburger SV, European Cup, 15 March 1961 *Lowest away attendance: 4,000 against Lausanne-Sport, Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, 19 October 1966 == Non-UEFA sanctioned European football == Burnley participated in the non-UEFA-sanctioned Texaco Cup for two seasons: in the inaugural 1970–71 season and in the 1973–74 competition, where they lost the final against Newcastle United. The team also competed in the non-UEFA-sanctioned Anglo-Scottish Cup on five occasions and won the tournament in 1978–79. The Texaco Cup was a competition involving sides from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland that had not qualified for UEFA-sanctioned European competitions or the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.Simpson (2007), p. 336 It was sponsored by petrol company Texaco until 1975, after which the tournament was replaced by the Anglo-Scottish Cup. It had a similar format to its predecessor but only English and Scottish clubs participated in the tournament. In 1981, the Scottish clubs withdrew from the competition as the attendances were low and the English teams were increasingly drawn from the lower leagues. The tournament continued with English entrants only as the Football League Group Cup, which was replaced by the Associate Members' Cup in 1983. {  width=70% +Burnley's record in the Texaco Cup and the Anglo-Scottish CupSimpson (2007), pp. 506–507 ! scope=col Season ! scope=col Competition ! scope=col Round ! scope=col Club ! scope=col Country ! scope=col Home result ! scope=col Away result ! scope=col Notes - 1970–71  rowspan=\\"5\\" Texaco Cup align=center1R Hearts  rowspan=\\"3\\" Scotland align=center3–1 align=center1–4  - rowspan=\\"4\\"1973–74 align=center1R East Fife align=center7–0 align=center3–2  - align=centerQF Hearts align=center5–0 align=center3–0  - align=centerSF Norwich City  rowspan=\\"11\\" England align=center2–0 align=center3–2  - align=centerF Newcastle United align=center—  bgcolor=silver align=center1–2  - rowspan=\\"3\\"1976–77  rowspan=\\"18\\" Anglo-Scottish Cup align=center rowspan=\\"3\\"GS Blackburn Rovers align=center— align=center1–1  - Blackpool align=center— align=center1–2  - Bolton Wanderers align=center1–0 align=center—  - rowspan=\\"3\\"1977–78 align=center rowspan=\\"3\\"GS Blackburn Rovers align=center2–1 align=center—  - Bolton Wanderers align=center— align=center0–1  - Blackpool align=center0–4 align=center—  - rowspan=\\"6\\"1978–79 align=center rowspan=\\"3\\"GS Preston North End align=center3–2 align=center—  - Blackpool align=center3–1 align=center—  - Blackburn Rovers align=center— align=center1–1  - align=centerQF Celtic Scotland align=center1–0 align=center2–1  - align=centerSF Mansfield Town  rowspan=\\"8\\" England align=center0–1 align=center2–1  - align=centerF Oldham Athletic  bgcolor=gold align=center0–1  bgcolor=gold align=center4–1 align=center - rowspan=\\"3\\"1979–80 align=center rowspan=\\"3\\"GS Blackburn Rovers align=center— align=center2–2  - Blackpool align=center— align=center2–3  - Preston North End align=center1–2 align=center—  - rowspan=\\"3\\"1980–81 align=center rowspan=\\"3\\"GS Bury align=center— align=center1–2  - Oldham Athletic align=center3–1 align=center—  - Shrewsbury Town align=center1–1 align=center—  } ;Key * GS = Group stage * 1R = First round * QF = Quarter-final * SF = Semi-final * F = Final ;Key to colours {   - style=background:gold Gold Winners - style=background:silver Silver Runners-up } === Record by competition === { class=\\"sortable \\" width=70% ! width=30%Competition ! width=10%Played ! width=10%Won ! width=10%Drawn ! width=10%Lost ! width=10%Goals for ! width=10%Goals against -  Texaco Cup  align=center9  align=center7  align=center0  align=center2  align=center28  align=center11 -  Anglo-Scottish Cup  align=center21  align=center9  align=center4  align=center8  align=center31  align=center29 -class=\\"sortbottom\\"  Total  align=center30  align=center16  align=center4  align=center10  align=center59  align=center40 } === Record by location === { class=\\"sortable \\" width=70% ! width=30%Location ! width=10%Played ! width=10%Won ! width=10%Drawn ! width=10%Lost ! width=10%Goals for ! width=10%Goals against -  Turf Moor  align=center15  align=center10  align=center1  align=center4  align=center32  align=center15 -  Away venues  align=center15  align=center6  align=center3  align=center6  align=center27  align=center25 -class=\\"sortbottom\\"  Total  align=center30  align=center16  align=center4  align=center10  align=center59  align=center40 } === Club records === *Most appearances in non-UEFA sanctioned European football: Alan Stevenson, 26Simpson (2007), pp. 519–522 *Most goals in non-UEFA sanctioned European football: Steve Kindon and Peter Noble, 8 *Most goals in a season: 6, Paul Fletcher (1973–74) and Steve Kindon (1978–79) *First match in non-UEFA sanctioned European football: Burnley 3–1 Hearts, Texaco Cup, first round, 15 September 1970Simpson (2007), p. 519 *First goal scored in non-UEFA sanctioned European football: Mick Docherty (in the second minute), against Hearts, 15 September 1970Simpson (2007), p. 506 *Biggest win: Burnley 7–0 East Fife, in the Texaco Cup, 18 September 1973 *Biggest defeat: Burnley 0–4 Blackpool, in the Anglo-Scottish Cup, 9 August 1977 *Highest home attendance: 30,000 against Celtic, Anglo- Scottish Cup, 12 September 1978 *Lowest home attendance: 3,354 against Shrewsbury Town, Anglo-Scottish Cup, 5 August 1980 *Highest away attendance: 34,540 against Newcastle United, Texaco Cup final, 24 April 1974 *Lowest away attendance: 2,000 against East Fife, Texaco Cup, 3 October 1973 ==NotesReferences== ;General * ;Specific ==External links== * Clarets in Europe – Clarets Mad Europe Burnley ","title":"Burnley F.C. in European football"},{"id":"35875851","text":"Murder Collection V.1 is a 2009 American horror anthology film written and directed by Fred Vogel, and co-written by Don Moore, Shelby Vogel and Jerami Cruise. == Plot == The film's opening explains that in 1994 a web series called Murder, which broadcast footage of actual deaths and acts of violence, appeared. After being active for four months, Murder was shut down by the authorities and had all of its content confiscated, though the website's host, a man known only as Balan, evaded capture. Now, years later, Balan has reemerged to share more clips that he has unearthed, while also offering commentary on people's obsession with death, the effect it has on them, and how accessible new media has made it. The series of videos is kicked off by Balan querying, \\"I ask you all... Why are you watching? Are you trying to find reality? Do you feel the need to be shocked? To witness something that human eyes shouldn't see? Murder is reality. Death comes when you least expect it. With what you are about to observe, you may question your own integrity. You will ask, could this happen to me? My answer to you is... Yes it can.\\" * Bludgeoning: A drunk Russian man accidentally beats his teenage son to death in front of the son's webcam. * The Heist: A restaurant's security system records a robbery committed by four gunmen, who shoot a cashier in the head and a fleeing customer in the back. * The Cheat: In front of a stationary camera a man, Greg reminisces about how he met his wife, and about all of the good times that they shared, while a monitor in the background shows his wife having sex with someone else. The man leaves the room, and the monitor shows him barging in on his wife and her lover, hacking the former to death with an ax before cutting out her heart, which the wife had once said would always belong to him. * S&G;: A parking lot security camera catches two people attacking a couple, beating the man with a baseball bat, and abducting the woman. * Broadway Rob: The distorted home movie of a pedophile, Broadway Rob who forces two gagged boys, Shawn and Ben clad in only their socks and underwear to dance with him. Shawn tackles Rob, fatally strangling and stabbing him. Shawn and Ben flee, leaving Rob's dead body behind. * Execution: A muffled black-and-white camcorder video of a hooded and masked group (possibly a cult or a gang) executing a man via decapitation in front of a woman, whom they taunt with the severed head before shooting her. * ATM: A man is mugged and killed at an ATM. * Autopsy: Japanese autopsy footage of a woman who was shot in the mouth, with the bullet exiting the top of her skull. The coroner eventually kicks the cameraman out due to his unprofessional antics and inattentiveness. * Bullied: A trio of drunks use a camcorder to record themselves taking a man out into the woods under the pretense of initiating him into their group. The three bully and humiliate the man and, during a scuffle, one of them accidentally knocks him onto the knife another was holding. The trio panic and bicker, and the camera is dropped when a fight breaks out over whether they should go for help. * Homecoming: A building security camera records two figures garroting a man. * Ransom: A deteriorated series of ransom videos depict three men brutalizing a senator's daughter, who eventually dies due to the severity of her injuries. After the last clip, Balan delivers the closing statement, \\"You realize now it's everywhere. Death casts a shadow on all our faces. The new media shines light on dank crevasses, revealing moral decay and broken experiences that are better left beyond the pale. Goosebumps explode on my skin with every clip we watch. I feel it now more than ever. How do you feel?\\" == Reception == Ryan Doom of Arrow in the Head gave Murder Collection V.1 a 2/4 and wrote, \\"In the end, I think it's an interesting exercise, but I don't know if it makes it a good movie. This isn't the type of film that I suspect most viewers would revisit often, if at all.

This rhizomatous perennial grass produces stems up to 1.2 metres tall. The leaves are mostly located around the base of the stems. The stiff, waxy-texured leaf blades are up to 20 cm long. They are light green to blue in color. The inflorescence is a spike up to 25 cm long by 1 wide. Each spikelet is one or two centimetres long and contains 2 or 3 flowers. In its native habitat this grass grows in alkaline meadows and on sandy and gravelly valleys. It is tolerant of some salinity and it can be planted on saline substrates. The grass is cultivated as a forage for livestock. It grows for a long time, from spring to fall, and it provides forage into the winter. It is difficult to make into hay, however. It establishes slowly but it competes well with weeds once established.

He had a regular show on the prominent pirate radio station Rinse FM in the early 2000s, before bringing dubstep to a wider audience with his regular show on mainstream radio station Kiss FM. ==Biography== Leonard was the head buyer of the Big Apple record shop in Croydon, South London, which he ran alongside Arthur Smith (a.k.a. Artwork of Magnetic Man) and John Kennedy. A movement within the 2-step garage scene by the name of \\"dark garage\\" was taking place at the start of the 2000s, and producers at the forefront of it such as El-B and Horsepower Productions were regulars at the shop, which had become a meeting point within the scene. At the time Leonard was an influential DJ on various pirate radio stations and a resident at the club FWD>>, where a strain of dark garage that was more stripped down and bass heavy was gaining popularity. Oliver Jones (Skream), got in touch with Leonard through his brother (producer Hijak), and started working in the shop during the weekends. Leonard played him dark garage sounds, which sparked Jones's interest in producing music. Through working in the shop he met Adegbenga Adejumo (Benga), another young producer who was making tunes using his PlayStation gaming console. The two exchanged music and were developing their style under the mentor-ship of Leonard, who had also started to bring dubplates of the tunes Jones and Adejumo were making into his DJ-sets. His sets at FWD>> and on Rinse FM were very influential in forming dubstep, partially thanks to the exclusive music he got from the young producers, as well as that provided by shop regulars Mala, Coki and Loefah (the former two known as duo Digital Mystikz). ==DiscographySelected singles/EPs=== * Bashment (Self released, 2001) * Dub Express (Tempa, 2003) * Special 4 track EP w/ Benny Ill (Tempa, 2003) * 10 Tons Heavy w/ Benga (Planet Mu, 2006) * Just A Rift / Chillz (Eight:FX, 2008) * Dirtee Tek / Dark Claps (Special Branch, 2010) ===Compilations/mixes=== * Dubstep Allstars Vol. 1 (Tempa, 2004) * Dubstep Allstars Vol. 4 w/ Youngsta (Tempa, 2006) ==References * Category:Dubstep musicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Musicians from London ","title":"DJ Hatcha"},{"id":"35876070","text":"Eastern Orthodox cross December 4 - Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar - December 6 All fixed commemorations below celebrated on December 18 by Orthodox Churches on the Old Calendar.

A video game console port, , was released on the Xbox 360 on May 26, 2011 in Japan. Rising Star Games released the game in North America and Europe on May 15, 2012. It is the fourth horizontal shoot 'em up game from the company, the prior three being Progear, Deathsmiles, and Deathsmiles II. The game's soundtrack was composed by Ryu Umemoto. ==GameplayPlot== Set in a parallel world resembling Japan's Taishō period, the people have discovered the powerful Blood Swords, the titular Akai Katana. Requiring human sacrifices to unleash their immense destructive power, these swords have been used by the empire to crush neighbouring countries. However, all the bloodshed and power gained through sacrificing close family members has made some of the swordsmen reconsider. With new fighter planes and the powered up swords at their disposal, this small band of rebels now fight back against the tyrannical empire. ==Reception== Famitsu gave the game scores of 8, 8, 8 and 9 from four reviewers, adding up to a total score of 33 out of 40. As Rising Star's inaugural U.S. title, Tech-Gaming found the game a \\"promising offering, offering stateside shoot ‘em up fans an exceptional entry into an increasingly niche genre.\\", and praised the title's depth of play mechanics.Allen, R., Tech-Gaming, Akai Katana Review, Retrieved June 2nd, 2012 GameSpot gave the game a score of 8 out of 10, describing it as \\"a well- crafted dose of over-the-top bullet-hell action.\\" Destructoid gave the game a score of 9 out of 10, concluding that \\"you may just find yourself ascending to bullet hell heaven if you dedicate some time to learning the game’s obscure but absolutely thrilling mechanics.\\" Mean Machines described it as a \\"must- have blaster\\" for the Xbox 360, praising the gameplay, the \\"masterpiece\\" 2D graphics, and the \\"fantastic\\" hard rock soundtrack.

The final was played at the Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany, with Spanish side Barcelona defeating Italian side Juventus 3–1 to win their fifth title and complete an unprecedented second continental treble. Real Madrid were the title holders, but they were eliminated by Juventus in the semi-finals. This season was the first where clubs must comply with UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations in order to participate. Moreover, this season was the first where a club from Gibraltar competed in the tournament, after the Gibraltar Football Association was accepted as the 54th UEFA member at the UEFA Congress in May 2013. They were granted one spot in the Champions League, which was taken by Lincoln Red Imps, the champions of the 2013–14 Gibraltar Premier Division. On 17 July 2014, the UEFA emergency panel ruled that Ukrainian and Russian clubs would not be drawn against each other \\"until further notice\\" due to the political unrest between the countries. Another ruling centred in regional instability was also made where Israeli teams were prohibited from hosting any UEFA competitions due to the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. The rules regarding suspension due to yellow card accumulation were also changed such that all bookings expired on completion of the quarter-finals and were not carried forward to the semi-finals. Moreover, this was the first season in which vanishing spray was used. ==Association team allocation== A total of 77 teams from 53 of the 54 UEFA member associations participated in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League (the exception being Liechtenstein, which do not organise a domestic league). The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association: *Associations 1–3 each have four teams qualify. *Associations 4–6 each have three teams qualify. *Associations 7–15 each have two teams qualify. *Associations 16–54 (except Liechtenstein) each have one team qualify. The winners of the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League were given an additional entry as title holders if they would not qualify for the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League through their domestic league (because of the restriction that no association can have more than four teams playing in the Champions League, if the title holders are from the top three associations and finish outside the top four in their domestic league, the title holders' entry comes at the expense of the fourth-placed team of their association). However, this additional entry was not necessary for this season since the title holders qualified for the tournament through their domestic league. ===Association ranking=== For the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League, the associations are allocated places according to their 2013 UEFA country coefficients, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 2008–09 to 2012–13. { -valign=top  {  -

FIFA international rules require clubs to release players 14 days prior to the start of an international tournament, which means the players would have to miss the Champions League final if the rules were enforced. If the players were allowed to play in the Champions League final, that would leave them as few as five days to travel and train prior to playing in the Copa América. ==Qualifying rounds== In the qualifying rounds and the play-off round, teams were divided into seeded and unseeded teams based on their 2014 UEFA club coefficients, and then drawn into two- legged home-and-away ties. Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. ===First qualifying round=== The draw for the first and second qualifying rounds was held on 23 June 2014. The first legs were played on 1 and 2 July, and the second legs were played on 8 July 2014. ===Second qualifying round=== The first legs were played on 15 and 16 July, and the second legs were played on 22 and 23 July 2014. ===Third qualifying round=== The third qualifying round was split into two separate sections: one for champions (Champions Route) and one for non-champions (League Route). The losing teams in both sections entered the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League play-off round. The draw for the third qualifying round was held on 18 July 2014. The first legs were played on 29 and 30 July, and the second legs were played on 5 and 6 August 2014. ==Play-off round== The play-off round was split into two separate sections: one for champions (Champions Route) and one for non- champions (League Route). The losing teams in both sections entered the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League group stage. The draw for the play-off round was held on 8 August 2014. The first legs were played on 19 and 20 August, and the second legs were played on 26 and 27 August 2014. ==Group stage== The draw for the group stage was held in Monaco on 28 August 2014. The 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on their 2014 UEFA club coefficients, with the title holders being placed in Pot 1 automatically. They were drawn into eight groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. In each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The matchdays were 16–17 September, 30 September–1 October, 21–22 October, 4–5 November, 25–26 November, and 9–10 December 2014. A total of 18 national associations were represented in the group stage. Ludogorets Razgrad and Malmö FF made their debut appearances in the group stage. Teams that qualified for the group stage also participated in the 2014–15 UEFA Youth League, a competition available to players aged 19 or under. The group winners and runners-up advanced to the round of 16, while the third-placed teams entered the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League round of 32. See 2014–15 UEFA Champions League group stage#Tiebreakers for tiebreakers if two or more teams are equal on points. ===Group A=Group B=Group C=Group D=Group E=Group F=Group G=Group H=Knockout phase== In the knockout phase, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one- match final. The mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows: *In the draw for the round of 16, the eight group winners were seeded, and the eight group runners-up were unseeded. The seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group or the same association could not be drawn against each other. *In the draws for the quarter-finals onwards, there were no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association could be drawn against each other. ===Bracket=Round of 16=== The draw for the round of 16 was held on 15 December 2014. The first legs were played on 17, 18, 24 and 25 February, and the second legs were played on 10, 11, 17 and 18 March 2015. } ===Quarter- finals=== The draw for the quarter-finals was held on 20 March 2015.

He was known as Prince Pan before his accession to the throne. ==Accession to the throne== Duke Zhao's father was Duke Huan of Qi, who was the first of the Five Hegemons, the most powerful rulers of the Spring and Autumn period. Duke Huan had at least three main wives who bore no sons, six favoured concubines, and more than ten sons. Duke Zhao was then known as Prince Pan, and his mother was Ge Ying, a princess of the minor state of Ge (葛). Five other sons of Duke Huan also contended for the throne: Prince Wukui, Crown Prince Zhao (later Duke Xiao), Prince Shangren (later Duke Yi), Prince Yuan (later Duke Hui), and Prince Yong. When Duke Huan died in the tenth month of 643 BC, the six princes fought one another for the throne. Wukui prevailed at first, but he sat on the throne for only three months before being killed by supporters of Crown Prince Zhao. Prince Zhao ascended the throne with the help of Duke Xiang of Song and was known as Duke Xiao of Qi. Duke Xiao reigned for ten years. After he died in 633 BC, Prince Kaifang of Wey, who had been a trusted official of Duke Huan, killed Duke Xiao's son and helped Prince Pan usurp the throne. Prince Pan is posthumously known as Duke Zhao of Qi. ==Reign and succession== In 632 BC, Duke Wen of Jin defeated the State of Chu at the Battle of Chengpu, and was declared the Hegemon of China, a title that was previously held by Duke Zhao's father Duke Huan. In 627 BC, the sixth year of Duke Zhao's reign, the Di tribes invaded Qi. In the fifth month of 613 BC, Duke Zhao died and was succeeded by his son She. However, just two months later She was murdered by Duke Zhao's younger brother Shangren, who usurped the throne and was posthumously known as Duke Yì of Qi. ==Family== * Parents: ** Prince Xiaobai (; d. 643 BC), ruled as Duke Huan of Qi from 684–643 BC ** Ge Ying, of the Ying clan of Ge () * Wives: ** Zi Shu Ji, of the Ji clan (), the mother of Prince She * Sons: ** Prince She (; d. 613 BC), ruled as the Duke of Qi in 613 BC ==References== Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Monarchs of Qi (state) Category:7th-century BC Chinese monarchs Category:613 BC deaths ","title":"Duke Zhao of Qi"},{"id":"35876229","text":"Nhuwala is a possibly extinct Pama–Nyungan language of Western Australia.

Its primary goal was to train the future leaders of Italy's National Fascist Party. The school curriculum promoted Fascist mysticism based on the philosophy of Fideism,Luigi Emilio Longo, I vincitori della guerra perduta (sezione su Niccolò Giani), Edizioni Settimo sigillo, Roma, 2003, pag.81Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930–1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.130Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930–1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.123 the belief that faith and reason were incompatible; Fascist mythology was to be accepted as a \\"metareality\\". In 1932, Mussolini described Fascism as \\"a religious concept of life\\", saying that Fascists formed a \\"spiritual community\\". ==SchoolFounding=== The school was founded through the efforts of Niccolò Giani and the Milan Gruppo Universitario Fascista, a youth wing of the National Fascist Party for university students. It was formed on April 10, 1930, at the Casa del Fascio (Fascist House) at piazza Belgioioso (Belgioioso Square), part of the Istituto Fascista di Cultura (Fascist Institute of Culture).Aldo Grandi, Gli eroi di Mussolini. Niccolò Giani e la Scuola di mistica fascista, Milano, Rizzoli (Edizioni BUR), 2004, pp. 32-3 Leo Pollini presided at the meeting. These two organizations had the right to choose the nominal director. Giani anticipated the opening on April 4, in an article in the GUF newspaper \\"Libro e moschetto\\" (Book and Musket)Giacomo De Antonellis, Come doveva essere il perfetto giovane fascista, su storia illustrata n° 243 del febbraio 1978, pag 50 The School of Fascist Mysticism was founded that same Spring in Milan, under the patronage of Benito Mussolini's brother, Arnaldo Mussolini, and in the presence of Catholic Cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster.Attilio Tamaro, Venti anni di storia 1922–1943, Editrice Tiber, Roma, pag.430 The Milanese institution was first located in San Francesco d'Assisi Street to gather its first staff members, and held its first directors' meeting on April 10, in the casa del fascio (Fascist House) in piazza Belgioioso (Belgioioso Square). Several active Fascist Party members participated, including the Secretary of the GUF, Andrea Ippoliti. Giani explained the objectives of the creation of the school were not to create a duplicate of one of the many organizations of the regime, but to achieve a complete education for students enrolled in GUF. ===Headquarters at via Pellico=== Following its relocation via Silvio Pellico (Pellico Street), the school was named Sandro Italico Mussolini, on November 29, 1931. On the same day, Arnaldo Mussolini gave the speech \\"Coscienza e dovere\\" (Conscience and Duty), launching the school year, and providing the blueprint for the fundamental principles, or rules, of the school,Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930–1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.33 expanded by Giani later. From October 9 to October 15, 1932, Niccolò Giani wrote a type of program manifesto, establishing the founding principles of the School: The school proposed the goal of reviving the spirit of Fascism, the battlefield trench (recalling Italy's role in World War I) and the first years of the movement, delivered ideally through a new generation. proposed in particular to be the center of political education for future leaders of Italian Fascism. The key principles on which the teaching was based were: voluntary activism; faith in Italy, from which it was believed faither in Benito Mussolini and Fascism derived; anti-rationalism; a mixture of religion and politics ; teachings against liberal democracy (constitutional democracy) and socialism; and a cult of Ancient Rome (romanità). Giani was made the school's first director, and the school's first president was Vito Mussolini, Benito Mussolini's nephew. Ferdinando Mezzasoma was made vice-president. Luigi Stefanini acted as an official \\"consultant\\" to the school for many years. In via Pellico, they had several offices, where it was easier to organize their work space, and inside they kept around five thousand volumes, mainly about Fascism but also other publications, such as a collection of issues by the socialist newspaper L'Avanti published by the Confederazione Generale del Lavoro (General Labour Confederation).Giacomo De Antonellis, Come doveva essere il perfetto giovane fascista, su storia illustrata n° 243 del febbraio 1978, pag 51 Numerous courses were given on a variety of subjects. The School's main activity was organizing conventions and conferences on issues related to Fascism. Courses covered a range of topics, but mainly focused on Fascism. The school became the editor of a series of books dealing with different issues. From 1937, under the initiative of Giani, the school published a magazine, Dottrina fascista (Fascist Doctrine), and in 1939 published the \\"Decalogo dell'italiano nuovo\\", (New Italian Decalogue (Ten Commandments)), written and delivered as a speech by Arnaldo Mussolini, brother of Benito Mussolini.Aldo Grandi, Gli eroi di Mussolini. Niccolò Giani e la Scuola di mistica fascista, cit., pag.34 ===Acquisition of the \\"Covo\\" (Cave)=== In 1939, during a ceremony presided over by Achille Starace, secretary of the National Fascist Party, the official headquarters moved to the offices that housed Mussolini's newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia during its infancy, called \\"il Covo\\" (the Cave). The \\"Covo\\" over the years had been transformed into a permanent museum of the Fascist Revolution, and since November 15, 1939 the entire building had been declared a \\"national monument\\" with an \\"honour guard\\" made of fighters from the squadrismo (squadristi) and veterans.Giacomo De Antonellis, Come doveva essere il perfetto giovane fascista, su storia illustrata n° 243 del febbraio 1978, pag 52 On November 20, by an explicit decision by Mussolini, it was officially handed over to the students of the school, at an event that was conducted as a consecration of Giani's students, reunited around him. In reality the transition had been ordered on October 18, 1939, as shown on the sheet of orders of the National Fascist Party from that date, at which time the Board had been received in Rome by Mussolini. Mussolini had encouraged them to continue their activities. The School of Fascist Mysticism's directors intended to use the old location of \\"Il Popolo d'Italia\\" to turn it into a \\"Shrine of the Fascist Revolution\\", by creating displays with Fasci italiani di combattimento and early years of Fascism memorabilia on the first floor. On the second and third floors, memorabilia and documents relating to the years leading up to the 1922 March on Rome were to be displayed, and finally the most recent years were to be exhibited on the fourth floor. ==Conflict with the Catholic Church== In 1929, Mussolini signed a Lateran Pact with the Roman Catholic Church. Intended to set down the rights of the Catholic Church in Italy, it was signed one year before the founding of the School of Fascist Mysticism. The religious component recalls the experiments in government-created religions during the French Revolution: Joseph Fouché's attempts to install a Cult of Reason, and Maximilien Robespierre's attempts to install a Cult of the Supreme Being, during the Reign of Terror. Fouché and Robespierre had the goal of eliminating the Roman Catholic Church in France and replacing it with a secular, state- organized religion. Mussolini denied that this was the goal of Fascist mysticism, or that it in any way represented a conflict with Roman Catholicism. At the time, nearly all Italians belonged to Roman Catholic Church, and the Pope was Italian and Bishop of Rome. The Catholic Church ran nearly all schools, hospitals, and many other institutions in Italy, and was powerful around the world. Shortly after the founding of the School of Fascist Mysticism, Mussolini began suppression of Catholic organizations, including the laypersons' Azione Cattolica organization, deemed to be interfering in the cultural and social activities under the control of the state. In 1931, the Pope was compelled to issue a public, formal papal encyclical, Non abbiamo bisogno, denouncing the \\"pagan idolatry of the state\\" being introduced to Italy by Mussolini. In a 1934 interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, Mussolini stated, \\"In the Fascist concept of the totalitarian state, religion is absolutely free, and, in its own sphere, independent. The crazy idea of founding a new religion of the state or of subordinating to the state the religion of all Italians has never entered our minds\\". On the other hand, Mussolini also stated in the same interview that \\"the Fascist state could ... intervene in religious affairs ... only when the latter touch the political and moral order of the state\\". Fascist philosopher Giovanni Gentile had maintained that Fascism could contradict Catholicism. ==10th anniversary of the School== During February 19 to 20 in Milan, to mark the 10th anniversary of the founding of the School, the \\"First National Conference of Mystical Fascists\\" was held in a room at the palazzo Marino (Marino Palace), with the intention that it would be the first in a series of such conferences. This objective failed with the start of World War II. Ferdinando Mezzasoma presided at the Conference, as the Deputy Secretary of the School and the National Fascist Party. The theme of the Conference was, \\"Why are we Mystics?\\" Aldo Grandi, Gli eroi di Mussolini. Niccolò Giani e la Scuola di mistica fascista, pag. 90 The meeting saw some 500 participants, among them most Italian intellectuals of the time, including deans and professors. Julius Evola was among the supporters of this initiative for the possibilities it could offer in the creation of an elite inspired by the traditional values he espoused. Numerous discussions were reported and published as \\"Notebooks\\" under the initiative of Giani. ==The \\"Mystics\\" volunteer for the war front== After the entry of Italy into World War II on June 10, 1940, the School was entrusted to the regency of Salvatore Atzeni,Aldo Grandi, Gli eroi di Mussolini. Niccolò Giani e la Scuola di mistica fascista, cit. pag. 129 and classes were suspended, in large part because most directors had left voluntarily under the instigation of Niccolò Giani. Giani was killed during the war in 1941, as were many other instructors from the School, including Guido Pallotta and Berto Ricci. In 1943, having lost most of its instructors in the war, the School's activities ceased.Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930–1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.43 By the time Italy's participation in World War II was ended by the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces, 14 members of the school were killed, four of whom were decorated with Italy's Silver Medal of Military Valor.Luigi Emilio Longo, Gli eroi della guerra perduta, edizioni settimo sigillo, 2003, Roma, pag.94-95 ==Instructors== Among the teachers at the school, there were: *Vito Mussolini (presidente della scuola) *Ferdinando Mezzasoma (vicepresidente della scuola) *Niccolò Giani (direttore della scuola) *Guido Pallotta *Berto Ricci *Emilio Bodrero *Eugenio Coselschi *Asvero Gravelli *Umberto Padovani *Enzo Paci *Giorgio Pini *Nino Tripodi *Cornelio di Marzio *Giuseppe Pagano Pogatschnig *Gastone Silvano Spinetti *Pasquale Pennisi *Michele Federico Sciacca *Enzo Leoni *Julius Evola *Luigi Stefanini *Amintore Fanfani ==Curriculum== The School of Fascist Mysticism has been the subject of limited research.

He likely was born into slavery in South Carolina, either on James Island or in an area of Charlestown at the site of the now-defunct town of St. James. ==Fights with Charles Hadley== Grant fought his successor as the colored heavyweight champion Charles \\"The Professor\\" Hadley twelve times between 1881 and 1883. Their first recorded match was January 14, 1881, when he lost on points in a three-rounder. Hadley claimed the Grant's title after the victory. Despite fighting Hadley ten more times while he was the colored champ, Grant failed to wrest the title from him. In their seventh fight, held on 4 May 1882 in New York City, Grant did not lose for the first time, when the four-rounder was declared a no-contest. Their next fight, on June 20 of the same year, saw Morris finally beat the undefeated Hadley (whose \\"official\\" record was 12-0-2 at the time), besting the champ on points in a four rounder. Hadley apparently did not put his belt at stake for the fight, for he continued as champion until 1883, when he was finally bested by George \\"Old Chocolate\\" Godfrey. Morris lost three more fights to Hadley during his championship reign and one after Hadley lost the title to Godfrey. The last time they battled while Hadley was the colored champ was on 7 December 1882, when they fought in New York City for the Police Gazette Medal Championship of America. Morris was KO-ed in the third round. Their last fight was on 8 December 1883, exactly one year and one day after they had last met in the ring. Morris apparently was outpointed by the ex- champ. It was his last recorded pro bout. ==Requiem for a Heavyweight== Morris Grant remained in New York City for the rest of his life. Although census records and city directories list his occupation as a \\"waiter,\\" 1880 Federal Census for City of New York it appears that he worked primarily as a bouncer in bars in the Tenderloin section of Manhattan, as well as being employed by Tammany Hall as a political operative .

He also recorded one newspaper decision win. ==Legacy & Honors== In 2020 award-winning author Mark Allen Baker published the first comprehensive account of The World Colored Heavyweight Championship, 1876-1937, with McFarland & Company, a leading independent publisher of academic & nonfiction books. This history traces the advent and demise of the Championship, the stories of the talented professional athletes who won it, and the demarcation of the color line both in and out of the ring. For decades the World Colored Heavyweight Championship was a useful tool to combat racial oppression-the existence of the title a leverage mechanism, or tool, used as a technique to counter a social element, “drawing the color line.” ==References== Category:Boxers from South Carolina Category:Heavyweight boxers Category:African-American boxers Category:World colored heavyweight boxing champions Category:1845 births Category:1915 deaths Category:American male boxers ","title":"Morris Grant"},{"id":"35876485","text":"Kosmos 1903 ( meaning Cosmos 1903) is a Soviet US-K missile early warning satellite which was launched in 1987 as part of the Soviet military's Oko programme.

The book is a historical fiction exploring China's development during the latter half of the 20th century through the eyes of a noble and generous landowner who is killed and reincarnated as various farm animals in rural China.Barnes and Noble, Overview, Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out: A Novel. It has drawn praise from critics, and was the recipient of the inaugural Newman Prize for Chinese Literature in 2009.University of Oklahoma, MO YAN WINS NEWMAN PRIZE FOR CHINESE LITERATURE. An English translation was published in 2008. ==Plot== The story's protagonist is Ximen Nao, a benevolent and noble landowner in Gaomi county, Shandong province.Jonathan Spence, Born Again, New York Times, Sunday Review of Books, 4 May 2008. Although known for his kindness to peasants, Nao is targeted during Mao Zedong's land reform movement in 1948 and executed so that his land could be redistributed. Upon his death, Nao finds himself in the underworld, where Lord Yama tortures him in an attempt to elicit an admission of guilt. Nao retains that he is innocent, and as punishment, Lord Yama sends him back to earth where he is reborn as a donkey in his village on January 1, 1950. In subsequent reincarnations, he goes through life as a donkey, an ox, a pig, a dog, and a monkey, until finally being born again as a man. Through the lens of various animals, the protagonist experiences the political movements that swept China under Communist Party rule, including the Great Chinese Famine and Cultural Revolution, all the way through to New Year's Eve in 2000.Steven Moore, Animal Farm, Washington Post, 25 May 2008. The author, Mo Yan, uses self-reference and by the end of the novel introduces himself as one of the main characters. ==Reviews== Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out garnered highly favorable reviews, though some critics suggested the narrative style was at times difficult to follow. Jonathan Spence described it as \\"a wildly visionary and creative novel, constantly mocking and rearranging itself and jolting the reader with its own internal commentary. This is politics as pathology...a vast, cruel and complex story.\\" Steven Moore of the Washington Post writes it is \\"a grimly entertaining overview of recent Chinese history...Mo Yan offers insights into communist ideology and predatory capitalism that we ignore at our peril. This 'lumbering animal of a story,' as he calls it, combines the appeal of a family saga set against tumultuous events with the technical bravura of innovative fiction.\\" The book's translator, Howard Goldblatt, nominated it for the 2009 Newman Prize for Chinese Literature, writing \\"it puts a human (and frequently bestial) face on the revolution, and is replete with the dark humor, metafictional insertions, and fantasies that Mo Yan’s readers have come to expect and enjoy.\\"Howard Goldblatt, Statement nominating Mo Yan for the Newman Prize for Chinese Literature Kirkus Book Reviews called the novel \\"epic black comedy...This long story never slackens; the author deploys parallel and recollected narratives expertly, and makes broadly comic use of himself as a meddlesome, career-oriented hack whose versions of important events are, we are assured, not to be trusted.

He was the brother of Italy's Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, and a Fascist himself. Arnaldo Mussolini. ==Biography== Arnaldo Mussolini was born at Dovia di Predappio. A graduate of the agricultural school at Cesena in 1909, he married Augusta Bondanini who bore him three children: Sandro Italico Mussolini, Vito Mussolini and Rosina Mussolini. He was a teacher and commune secretary with the Italian Socialist Party in Predappio until 1914. Before devoting himself to teaching in his hometown, Arnaldo Mussolini was a professor of agriculture from 1908 to 1909 at the Institute of Falcon-Vial in San Vito al Tagliamento. He had a great affection for the region, and devoted many years to it, teaching at the aforementioned institution, as well as at elementary schools Carbona, in the municipality of San Vito. The town appointed him city clerk. As a tribute to this country that had welcomed him with affection, he called his eldest son Vito, after which the town reciprocated by placing, on behalf of Sanvitesi a plaque in the courtyard of the Falcon-Vial in memory of the beloved teacher. Arnaldo Mussolini, like his brother Benito Mussolini, took part in World War I, attaining the rank of lieutenant, and in 1919 after the war's end, he moved to Milan. ==Fascism== In Milan, Arnaldo became managing director of the newspaper founded by his brother, Il Popolo d'Italia, succeeding Manlio Morgagni, who worked in advertising. In 1922, when Benito became prime minister, Arnaldo took over leadership of the newspaper, staying faithful to the policies of his brother, who while mitigating some of the excesses indulged in by Benito, with his own style of a meek tone and adhering to confidentiality. Benito Mussolini blindly trusted his brother Arnaldo, who also had the task of proofreading Benito's speeches. Arnaldo was Benito's closest advisor; the brothers called each other on the telephone almost every night. Between 1923 and 1927, Arnaldo dedicated himself to journalism and to various publishing ventures, creating a journal for the Opera Nazionale Balilla, the Domenica dell'Agricoltore (Sunday Farmer), Rivista Illustrata (Illustrated Review), which he co-founded with Manlio Morgagni, Illustrazione Fascista (Illustrated Fascism), Bosco e Historia (Forest and History), while continuing to lead Il Popolo d'Italia. His interest in nature led him also to dedicate himself to environmentalist causes, such as forest revival, the agriculture organization, to drainage projects, and becoming the first president of the Comitato Nazionale Forestale (National Forest Committee). On November 27, 1928, he was awarded the degree \\"honoris causa\\" in agricultural sciences. In 1930, Arnaldo assisted with the founding of the School of Fascist Mysticism in Milan, supporting Niccolò Giani.La Scuola di mistica fascista - Una pagina poco nota del Fascismo - PDF The School's object was the training of the future leaders of the National Fascist Party. The School's president was Arnaldo's son Vito Mussolini. Arnaldo Mussolini had an important part in defusing the cooled relations between the Fascist regime and the Catholic Church during the crisis of 1931, especially regarding the education of youth. Mussolini had signed a Concordat with the Catholic Church in 1929, but by 1931, after Fascist authority came into conflict with the superior organizational skills of Catholic groups, Mussolini retracted part of the concessions that he had made. Catholic groups were critical of the violence of Fascist extremists; the bulletin of the women's Catholic organization Gioventù Femminile denounced the Fascists, and banned Fascist members from Gioventù Femminile. Fascist attacks on Catholic groups, such as the large 'Azione Cattolica Italiana', and Church property followed. On June 4, 1931, the Catholic Church issued the call for a protest against new laws and violence suffered by Catholic organizations, such as a government prohibition against explaining the Gospel during Mass (priests delivering sermons). In September, thanks to Arnaldo Mussolini, a compromise was reached, whereby the young Catholics could organize just inside the Azione Cattolica Italiana, without performing any political activities. The ACI, for its part, was limited to local activities under the control of the bishops. The agreements with the Holy See were sent by the Ministry of Interior to all prefectures with a circular telegram of September 16, 1931. According to Marco Zeni, Arnaldo Mussolini was assigned to manage the interests of Ida Dalser, Benito's \\"secret mistress\\" and of their son Benito Albino Dalser. While Ida Dalser was interned in a mental hospital, Arnaldo – whether because of orders he received, or through personal affection, it is not clear – treated his nephew Benito Albino in the best possible way. After the death of his uncle Arnaldo, Albino was committed, like his mother, to a mental hospital, where he died in 1942.Marco Zeni, La moglie di Mussolini, Erre Effe edizioni, 2000. Arnaldo Mussolini died suddenly of a heart attack in Milan on December 21, 1931, at only 46 years. He was buried in the small cemetery in Paderno di Mercato Saraceno, birthplace of his wife Augusta Bondanini. In the family home, his private studio with furnishings and memorabilia of the time were kept on exhibit. At Forlì, the Casa del Balilla, then the GIL, opened a votive chapel dedicated to him. In the church of Santa Maria Nuova, at Mercato Saraceno, a plaque was installed under orders of Benito Mussolini to mark the burial ground. The little cemetery of Paderno has become inaccessible. The journalists' organization, \\"Istituto Nazionale di Previdenza dei Giornalisti Italiani Arnaldo Mussolini\\", was dedicated to him after his death while Benito Mussolini was in power. After the end of World War II, it was renamed the \\"INPGI G.

It was written by Erin Levy and directed by Scott Hornbacher and originally aired on the AMC channel in the United States on May 13, 2012. In the episode, set in the weeks approaching Thanksgiving 1966, Betty's bitterness over her weight gain and Megan's youth, beauty, lifestyle, and adoration from Don lead Betty to tell Sally about Anna Draper, in an attempt to cause turmoil amongst Sally, Don, and Megan. Don and Peggy are both irritated by Michael Ginsberg's rising star, and Don takes a devious approach to clip the wings of the cheeky young copywriter. Roger gets handed a new client (Manischewitz) by Bert Cooper, but Roger's decision that he needs more Jewish input to help him prompts him to involve his estranged wife Jane Siegel, with unfortunate results. Pete continues to resent the ending of his brief affair with Beth, the wife of his commuter-acquaintance Howard. \\"Dark Shadows\\" received a polarizing reception from television journalists, with some criticizing its treatment of symbols and themes as being too heavy-handed. The episode's themes were pinpointed by many critics as insecurity and jealousy. \\"Dark Shadows\\" was viewed by 2.125 million viewers on the night of its original airing and drew 0.7 million viewers in the 18-49 demographic. The episode is titled after the gothic soap opera Dark Shadows, and features a scene of Megan helping her best friend Julia (Meghan Bradley) prepare to audition for a role on the show. The episode aired the same weekend that a film adaptation of the same name opened. ==Plot== Betty is making steady progress in her new Weight Watchers program as Thanksgiving approaches. When she visits the Draper home, however, she accidentally and covertly sees the youthful Megan getting dressed. Later, while helping Sally on a family tree project, Betty finds a love note Don had written to Megan. The note reawakens feelings of bitterness and discontent, and Betty passive-aggressively tells Sally to include Don's first wife (Anna Draper) on the family tree. Sally is taken aback, as she was unaware of her father's secret wife. When Sally questions Betty about Anna, Betty snippily tells her to ask Megan. While staying with Megan and Don, Sally scolds Megan for lying to her. Later that night, Megan tells Don about Sally's knowledge of the late Anna Draper. Don becomes furious at Betty, but Megan tells him to let it go—Betty wants to ruin the marriage and Sally's relationships with Don and Megan from afar. Sally overhears this conversation, and to get back at her mother, she acts as if the revelation meant nothing. Don becomes competitive with Ginsberg on the Sno Ball account after covertly looking through Ginsberg's private work. The creatives agree to pitch both Don's and Ginsberg's ideas to the Sno Ball executives. When it comes time to pitch the two ideas at the Sno Ball office, Don commits an act of sabotage by leaving Ginsberg's idea in the taxi cab. After Don's idea wins the account, Ginsberg confronts Don in the elevator and tells Don that he feels sorry for him. Don replies that he doesn't think about Ginsberg at all. Bert enlists Roger to dine with the Manischewitz executives and tells him to bring his wife, Jane Siegel. When Roger protests that Jane is now his ex-wife, Bert feigns surprise. Roger agrees to Jane's request that he buy her a new apartment, free of old memories, in exchange for her help wooing the client. The client dinner goes well, and the client's son (who is the decision maker in the client's firm) is smitten with Jane. Afterward, Jane and Roger have sex in Jane's new apartment. Jane wakes up the next day, despondent over what she perceives as Roger's \\"poisoning\\" of the new apartment by creating new memories there associated with their love. Megan and Don prepare their Thanksgiving meal, as a toxic cloud of smog hangs over New York City. At the Francis household dinner, Betty gives thanks for having \\"everything I want\\". ==ReceptionRatings=== \\"Dark Shadows\\" was viewed by 2.125 million viewers on the night of its original airing. It drew 0.7 million viewers in the 18-49 demographic. ===Critical reception=== The episode received polarized reactions from television journalists and bloggers, ranging from positive to negative. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave it a \\"B\\" rating, calling it the fifth season's most \\"scattered\\" episode. VanDerWerff argued that \\"the [camera] cut from the hovering smog to the Francis Thanksgiving is not exactly subtle, and I tire of when the show presents Betty as this bruised monster who’s not in control of her own impulses [...] the show has always been at its best when it can harness some degree of sympathy for the woman.\\" IGN writer Eric Goldman gave the episode an 8 out of 10, and pinpointed the episode's theme as \\"insecurity\\". Paste Magazine writer Bonnie Stiernberg criticized the episode, saying: \\"It’s not that 'Dark Shadows' wasn’t a good episode—it was. But this week’s theme felt a little heavy-handed; nearly every character’s storyline was dominated by it in an obvious manner.\\" Maureen Ryan of the Huffington Post called \\"Dark Shadows\\" the worst episode of the season, saying: \\"It was a bad episode of TV. And it was not in a special class of mediocrity that allows it to still somehow remain elevated above the fray. It made the mistakes that much less brilliant shows make. It repeated a lot of themes that we're already very familiar with, it didn't add to them in compelling or imaginative ways, and it featured a character [Betty] that just doesn't work.\\" Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter was more forgiving towards the episode, noting: \\"I’m sure that some of the elements in 'Dark Shadows' will be table-setters for future storylines. It was an episode that seemed to gather itself, make a point while setting up plotlines, then end on time. That's all. There’s no harm in that; such episodes come along at least twice in the season run of very good shows. But there was a heavy-handedness to the thematic illustration of self-interest in the episode – like the writers backed up a truck full of references to selfish behavior and dumped them into the room for ease of use. Mad Men can do better than this, of course. It has, and it will again. Just put the anvil down. We get it.\\" ===Accolades=== Ben Feldman who plays Michael Ginsberg received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards. ==References *\\"Dark Shadows\\" at AMC * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Mad Men (season 5) episodes ","title":"Dark Shadows (Mad Men)"},{"id":"35876777","text":"WGXC is a community radio station licensed to Acra, New York, USA, and owned by Wave Farm.

In 1806 the Admiralty purchased her and took her into service as the Sir Andrew Mitchell in 1807. ==First contract== Admiral Mitchells first contract ran from 22 January 1800 to 26 October 1801. An item in the London Chronicle indicates that a Lieutenant Shirley commanded her in May.London Chronicle (1800: 8 May), p.437. However, items in the Naval Chronicle suggest that Admiral Mitchell was thereafter under the command of Lieutenant John Derby (or Darby). Her duties were to carry dispatches to and from the British fleet off the coast of France, and escort convoys. On 3 June 1801, Admiral Mitchell arrived in Portsmouth from a cruise, having recaptured, off Boulogne, two vessels, laden with iron and timber, and sent them into Dover.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.82. On 29 June 1801, Admiral Mitchell, recaptured three vessels: the brigs Supply and Favorite, and the sloop Prince of Wales. On 25 August letters reached Plymouth that Derby had brought into Dartmouth a large American ship that had been sailing from New York to Havre de Grace. She had a cargo of \\"India goods of various descriptions, valued per manifest at £50,000, supposed French property as a French merchant, supercargo, and family on board going to Old Prance\\". The cutter Alert was in company at the time.Naval Chronicle, Vol.6, p.252. On 28 October, Derby sailed Admiral Mitchell into Catwater. There she and all the hired craft turned in their stores and guns to the yard and gunwharf.Naval Chronicle, Vol.6, p.428. ==Second contract== Admiral Mitchells second contract ran from 26 August 1803 to 6 April 1805. Lieutenant Alexander Shippard assumed command, apparently before the contract took effect.Shippard had been commander of when she wrecked in 1794. Admiral Mitchell was attached to the fleet under Lord Keith for the guard of the Narrow Seas, that is, the English Channel. On 21 August 1803 Shippard landed Georges Cadoudal, the Chouan chief, at Biville, between Dieppe and Tréport, and on 16 January in the following year he landed General Pichegru at the same place. In between, on 21 October 1803 Captain Robert Honyman of sighted a convoy off Boulogne of six French sloops, some armed, under the escort of a gun-brig. He sent and to pursue them but the winds were uncooperative and the squadron was unable to engage. Instead, Shippard brought up Admiral Mitchell and attacked the convoy. After two and a half hours of cannonading, Admiral Mitchell succeeded in driving one sloop and the brig, which was armed with twelve 32-pounder guns, on the rocks. Admiral Mitchell had one gun dismounted, suffered damage to her mast and rigging, and had five men wounded, two seriously. Lloyd's Patriotic Fund awarded Shippard a presentation sword worth 50 guineas.Lloyd's Patriotic Fund Shippard also received promotion to the rank of commander on 3 March 1804. Head money for the brig was paid 24 years later, in December 1827. Lieutenant John Harper also commanded Admiral Mitchell briefly, possibly in late 1803 or early 1804. Rear-Admiral Bartholomew S. Rowley, for whom Harper had been flag lieutenant, placed him on Admiral Mitchell, and sent him on a confidential mission to the coast of France.Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, pp.327-8. Harper then transferred briefly to the hired armed cutter Duke of Clarence, which was also on the Guernsey station. By 12 February 1804 Admiral Mitchell was under the command of Lieutenant Alexander Shippard. On that day he was in command when Admiral Mitchell and the revenue cutter Hound recaptured Perseverance. At some point thereafter, Lieutenant Richard Williams assumed command of Admiral Mitchell. At 4 P.M. on 23 October 1804, a French flotilla of two prams and eighteen armed schuyts left Ostend for the westward. A British squadron consisting of , Commander John Hancock, the gun-brigs , Lieutenant John Hinton, , Lieutenant Charles Cutts Ormsby, , Lieutenant Edward Nathaniel Greensword, and , Lieutenant Joseph Gulstone Garland, and the hired armed cutters Admiral Mitchell and Griffin, gave chase. They succeeded in bringing the leading pram to action by 5:18, and in a little over an hour silencing her. However, the tide was falling, darkness was coming on, and the vessels were in shoal water and in unfamiliar sands and currents. Cruizer hauled off and anchored but Conflict had already grounded, due to the fault of her pilot. When they found that they could not free her, Lieutenant Ormsby and his crew abandoned her and rowed her boats to Cruiser. Hancock sent Ormsby back with Admiral Mitchell providing cover in an attempt to recover or destroy Conflict, but they discovered that she was already high and dry on a sandbank, and in French hands. At high tide Hancock sent in boats to try and bring her off, or destroy her, with Admiral Mitchell and Griffin, reinforced for the purpose, providing support. However, by that time the French had hauled Conflict further onshore and brought up field pieces and howitzers. The boat party was forced to withdraw after having suffered three men wounded. In all, the British lost one man killed and 11 wounded, none from Admiral Mitchell. ==Sir Andrew Mitchell== The Admiralty purchased Admiral Mitchell in 1806 and took her into service on 19 February 1807 as the schooner Sir Andrew Mitchell.

It has 1,138 slot machines, 204 hotel rooms, and 4 restaurants. ==History== The city began a downtown revitalization effort called Joliet City Center in 1990. The plan called for a greater emphasis on the Des Plaines riverfront, including the construction of a slip for riverboat gambling, which had been legalized by the state earlier that year. Early discussions were held between Joliet and Harrah's, operator of casinos in Nevada and Atlantic City, but it was Missouri hotel developer John Q. Hammons who moved forward and was awarded the gaming license. Hammons then brought Harrah's on board to operate the business and own an 80 percent share. Hammons' stake was initially to be financed by Harrah's, but this led to concern from the Illinois Gaming Board that Hammons was \\"selling\\" the license, so Hammons used his own money and outside funding sources instead. Harrah's Joliet launched its first boat on May 4, 1993, a 210-foot yacht named the Northern Star, with 500 slot machines and 40 table games. A second vessel with a more traditional paddleboat look, the Southern Star, was added the following January. A $29-million hotel was added in 1999, with 204 rooms on 11 floors. After state law was changed to allow riverboat casinos to remain permanently docked, instead of cruising every two hours, Harrah's replaced its boats in 2001 with two joined barges, with 40,000 square feet of gaming space with 1,138 slot machines and 31 table games. In October 2017, Caesars Entertainment (formerly Harrah's) transferred its 80 percent ownership stake in the property to Vici Properties as part of a corporate spin-off; Caesars continued to operate Harrah's Joliet under a lease agreement. ==See also== *List of Caesars Entertainment properties *List of casinos in Illinois ==References * Category:Casinos in Illinois Category:1993 establishments in Illinois Category:Caesars Entertainment Corporation Category:Riverboat casinos Category:Buildings and structures in Joliet, Illinois ","title":"Harrah's Joliet"},{"id":"35876820","text":"Kosmos 1793 ( meaning Cosmos 1793) is a Soviet US-K missile early warning satellite which was launched in 1986 as part of the Soviet military's Oko programme.

A School of Fascist Mysticism was founded in Milan on April 10, 1930 and active until 1943, and its main objective was the training of future Fascist leaders, indoctrinated in the study of various Fascist intellectuals who tried to abandon the purely political to create a spiritual understanding of Fascism. Fascist mysticism in Italy developed through the work of Niccolò Giani with the decisive support of Arnaldo Mussolini. ==Definition== Niccolò Giani took the definition of mysticism from the writing of French philosopher Louis Rougier: In line with Rougier, Giani stressed in his manifesto for the School of Fascist Mysticism, \\"that fascism has its 'mystical' aspect, as it postulates a complex of moral, social and political, categorical and dogmatic beliefs, accepted and not questioned by the masses and minorities ... [A Fascist] puts his belief in the infallible Duce Benito Mussolini, the fascist and creator of civilization; [a Fascist] denies that anything outside of the Duce has spiritual or putative antecedents.Aldo Grandi, Gli eroi di Mussolini. Niccolò Giani e la Scuola di mistica fascista, Milano, Rizzoli (Edizioni BUR), 2004, pag.32 The establishment of the School was made to allow his followers to devote themselves fully to the worship of Mussolini, meditating on the writings and speeches of Mussolini,Cfr. a tale proposito Emilio Gentile, Il culto del littorio, la sacralizzazione della politica nell'Italia fascista, Bari-Roma, Laterza, 1993, p. 243 and living according to his words, in a spirit of absolute loyalty and unquestioningly, as specified in the article \\"Fascist mysticism\\" in the Political Dictionary edited by the National Fascist Party in 1940: The use of the term \\"mysticism\\" provoked hostility from the Roman Catholic Church, which used the term in the sense of being strictly limited to the spiritual sphere, without any political influence.Giacomo De Antonellis, Come doveva essere il perfetto giovane fascista, su storia illustrata n° 243 del febbraio 1978, pag 50 But in Giani's conception of mysticism, he claimed it was in the political sphere without fear of overlap between the two worlds. Giani stated: \\"Neither the Church should make policy, nor the State must make religion. Fascist Catholics, therefore, Catholics, or fascists, whichever is more like it, but Fascists: let us remember.\\"Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930-1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.129 The Bishop Onofrio Buonocore stated that he viewed Fascist mysticism as \\"the testimony of an Italy no longer divided, but renewed and reconciled under the papal insignia and littoriali\\".Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930-1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.145 In February 1937, the Cardinal of Milan, Ildefonso Schuster, gave a speech at the School of Fascist Mysticism.Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930-1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.144 Many years of friction took place between the Catholic Church and the Fascist Regime, erupting into open conflict in 1931, after Mussolini's withdrawal of several concessions his regime made to the Catholic Church in a 1929 Concordat. ==The protagonists== While considering the Fascist mysticism a \\"trend of thought\\" there are only contributions made by Italian thinkers, although they quoted Rougier, Albert Sorel and Henri Bergson, cited by Nino Tripodi even if they were important in predetermining a state of mind in young mystics rather than provide guidance. According to the philosopher Enzo Paci, Fascist mysticism was influenced by Nietzsche and Sorel, as was much of the culture of the period: The principles of mystical fascism were largely formulated by Niccolo Giani and a small group of young Fascists bound to the teachers at the School of Fascist Mysticism (including Guido Pallotta and Berto Ricci), some high-ranking (including Ferdinand Mezzasoma, Giuseppe Bottai), by writers and journalists of proven Fascist faith (Telesio Interlandi, Virginio Gayda) and Benito Mussolini.Cfr. Benito Mussolini in Giornale della gioventù fascista, 10 luglio 1932 It ultimately traced the cultural lines that were followed in the development of \\"Fascist\\" disciplines and guidelines pertaining to the policies of the School of Fascist Mysticism. Around this core of \\"hard\\" high-profile intellectuals revolved others, including Paolo Orano, Luigi Stefanini (who was an official consultant to the School of Fascist Mysticism) and Julius Evola, and Giovanni Gentile and his student and friend Armando Carlini, but Carlini seems to have had a rather marginal role in Fascist \\"mysticism\\". ==See also== *Occultism and the far right *Esoteric Nazism ==References== Category:Italian Fascism Category:Mysticism Category:Syncretic political movements Category:Fascism Category:National mysticism ","title":"Fascist mysticism"},{"id":"35876860","text":"Harold Gunness (February 6, 1899 – March 11, 2003) was the last surviving American veteran of the Polar Bear Expedition, part of the intervention by the allied forces in the Russian Civil War. ==Biography== After graduating from a high school in Barnesville, Minnesota, in 1917, Gunness enlisted in the Navy.

When Durand starts teaching at the school she is immediately popular with her students but also excites Hartill's attention — not just because the young mistress is as enthusiastic about teaching as herself, but also because Hartill is always on the lookout for companionship.We learn that Hartill does not \\"encourage the re-entry of old friends into her life\\". A basic flaw in her nature compels her to suck each of her female companions dry, then drop her and look for a new one: \\"She could neither keep a friend nor live without one.\\" (Regiment, p.126). The two women become close friends, and Durand spends more and more of her spare time in Hartill's flat, occasionally not returning to her aunt's for days. The couple also travel abroad together during the summer holidays. Although Loveday and Hartill hardly ever meet, a strange kind of antagonism develops between them, each woman fighting to spend more time than they do with Alwynne Durand and to be the dominant person in Alwynne's life. In the course of the schoolyear one of Hartill's protégées, an unfortunate fourteen- year-old called Louise who has disappointed Hartill by failing an important exam, commits suicide by jumping from an upper floor window of the school building. The suicide is successfully hushed up, pronounced a case of accidental death, and quickly forgotten. What Hartill deliberately fails to mention, however, is that Louise's death, which happened on the night of the school play, was apparently triggered by her harsh criticism of Louise's excellent performance in the play. In the months that follow, Hartill even manages to shift the burden of guilt onto Durand's shoulders, persuading the young mistress that she ought to have detected any suicidal tendencies in Louise while giving her extra lessons. Hartill's increasingly bizarre and offensive behaviour and her naive niece's growing dependence on her older friend call Elsbeth Loveday to action. When, on top of her shattered nerves, Alwynne Durand comes down with the flu, Loveday insists on her not returning to school for the rest of the term and on recuperating from her illness in the country instead. Alwynne agrees, if reluctantly at first, to spend some time with distant relatives she has never met before. The idyllic spring landscape she encounters after leaving town actually soothes her nerves, and Alwynne grows more and more fond of country life and the people she meets in her new surroundings. But Elsbeth Loveday's scheme includes more than her niece's mere convalescence. As planned by her aunt, Alwynne Durand finds a confidant, and secret admirer, in thirty-year-old Roger Lumsden, a good-hearted, intelligent and handsome man who runs his own gardening business. Completely inexperienced with men except for what she has read in novels, Alwynne does not recognise her feelings for Lumsden as love, and she still looks forward to her reunion with Hartill. When she eventually returns to her home town, Lumsden follows her, proposes to her, and, naturally, is rejected. Only when Hartill, too sure of her seemingly inseparable bond with Alwynne, continues treating her badly does Alwynne wake up to reality. She sends Hartill a telegram telling her she has taken the train to the country in order to get married. ==See also== * See also the list of works with a school setting at School and university in literature. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Dolan, Jill: \\"Notes on a Scandal\\", The Feminist Spectator (14 January 2007). * Donoghue, Emma: Inseparable: Desire Between Women in Literature (Alfred A.

The first earthquake, registering magnitude 6.1, struck in the Emilia-Romagna region, about 36 kilometres (22 mi) north of the city of Bologna, on at 04:03 local time (02:03 UTC). The epicentre was between Finale Emilia, Bondeno and Sermide. Two aftershocks of magnitude 5.2 occurred, one approximately an hour after the main event and another approximately eleven hours after the main event. Seven people were killed. A magnitude 5.8 earthquake struck the same area nine days later, on 29 May, causing an additional twenty deaths and widespread damage, particularly to buildings already weakened by the 20 May earthquake. The epicentre was in Medolla: the quake itself occurred at a depth of about ==Tectonic setting== The Po Plain, a foreland basin formed by the downflexing of the crust by the loading of the Apennine thrust sheets, overlies and mainly conceals the active front of the Northern Apennines fold and thrust belt, across which there is about one millimeter (0.04 in) per year of active shortening at present. Information from hydrocarbon exploration demonstrates that the area is underlain by a series of active thrust faults and related folds, some of which have been detected from anomalous drainage patterns. These blind thrust faults are roughly WNW-ESE trending, parallel to the mountain front, and dip shallowly towards the south-southwest. Several damaging historical earthquakes, such as the 1570 Ferrara earthquake, have occurred in the area. ==Earthquake sequence== The 20 May earthquake sequence began with a magnitude 4.0 foreshock at 01:13 local time (23:13 UTC 19 May). Less than three hours later, at 04:04 local time (02:04 UTC) the biggest of these earthquakes occurred with magnitude 6.1 between Finale Emilia (province of Modena) and Sant'Agostino (province of Ferrara). This strong quake destroyed all the churches and many of the factories in the area. Seven people were killed. In San Carlo more than 350 families lost their houses. Within the next nine days, there were six aftershocks exceeding magnitude 5, 28 of magnitude 4–5 and 139 of magnitude 3–4. The mainshock could be felt as far away as Switzerland. The focal mechanism indicates that the earthquake was a result of thrust faulting, with a north-south direction of compression, on a fault plane trending west-east. This type of faulting is consistent with the regional tectonic setting. On 29 May (about 09:00 CEST, 07:00 UTC), a magnitude 5.8 earthquake hit the same area. The hypocentre has been estimated at 5–10 kilometres (3–6 mi) below Mirandola. A series of two or three, according to different sources, strong aftershocks with magnitudes larger than 5 occurred at between 12:55 and 13:02 local time. The 09:00 shock and the 13:00 shocks were felt throughout Northern Italy, up to the Aosta province. The 09:00 earthquake could be felt in Austria, Switzerland, and Croatia, with reports of swaying buildings in Austria. The two large aftershocks at 12:55 and 13:02 could also be felt in Austria. This earthquake had a similar mechanism to the 20 May shock. This earthquake, like the previous earthquake of 20 May, was distinctly felt in Trentino Alto Adige. It was especially felt on the upper floors of buildings both in Trento and Bolzano, and created some concern among residents. {  style=\\"font-size:90%;float:left; clear:left; margin- right:1em;\\" - ! colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  Sequence of shocks - !class=\\"unsortable\\" Date !class=\\"unsortable\\" CEST !Mw !I !Depth (km) !Region -  20 May  04:03:53  6.1  VII  10  Finale Emilia -  29 May  09:00:03  5.8  VII  5  Medolla–Cavezzo -  29 May  12:55:56  5.5  VI  2  San Possidonio–Mirandola -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre } On 6 June at 06:08 local time, a magnitude 4.5 earthquake hit 50 km further east with an epicenter off the coast of Ravenna in Romagna at a depth 25.6 km. The earthquake was felt strongly and distinctly in Ravenna and Rimini, then less in Pesaro and Ancona, and very slightly in the province of Modena, in areas already affected by earthquakes in recent days. This earthquake was generated by a fault other than that responsible for the earthquakes of 20 and 29 May in Emilia, although part of the same group of geological structures. ==Damage== A destroyed house in Cento. Initial reports after the 20 May shock listed seven dead, including four workers at a factory in Ferrara, and about 5,000 people left homeless. At least 100 structures of historical significance have been damaged or destroyed. Many churches in towns around the epicentre suffered damage. One of the towers of Castello Estense, a moated medieval structure in the centre of Ferrara, was damaged in the earthquake. Half of a clock tower in Finale Emilia dating from the 13th century (known as the torre dei modenesi) fell down in the mainshock and the remaining part collapsed completely during an aftershock later that day. There was also significant damage to factories and agricultural land in the region.TG5. Canale 5. Mediaset. 22 May 2012. 13.00 Production of Grana Padano and Parmigiano-Reggiano hard cheeses was badly affected; approximately 300,000 wheels, with an estimated value of €200 million, were destroyed. The damaged town hall of Sant'Agostino. Five of the deaths were caused by the collapse of recently constructed factory buildings. Stefano Gresta, president of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, deemed it \\"unacceptable that modern constructions such as warehouses and industrial sheds have collapsed in an earthquake which was strong, but not exceptional\\". The area was not included in seismic hazard maps until 2003, when, after a reassessment, it was classified as \\"medium risk\\", with a 10% likelihood of such an earthquake in the next 450 years. A law introduced in 2006 imposed building standards appropriate for the seismic hazard classification, but few of the older buildings have been upgraded to meet these requirements. The 29 May magnitude 5.8 earthquake left 18 people dead, more than 350 injured, and more than 15,000 homeless. The 15th-century cathedral of Mirandola, already damaged on 20 May, collapsed after the 29 May shock. The earthquake was felt in most of Northern Italy, triggering evacuation of schools and other buildings. Some buildings in the Modena province and neighbouring areas, already damaged in the first earthquake, collapsed. The damaged church of Saint Martin of Tours in Cento, Ferrara. After the main shock of 20 May, inspections were underway to determine which buildings were safe to reenter. The 29 May earthquake occurred during the daytime, when many people were working. As in the mainshock of 20 May, many of the dead in the 29 May earthquake were workers inside huge warehouses and factories. A local union representative has demanded an investigation to determine who was responsible for permitting the companies to resume operations.

It mainly caters to a younger demographic, with programmes consisting of drama, entertainment shows and live sports coverage. KBS2 is a result of the forced merger of the Tongyang Broadcasting Corporation with KBS in 1980. == History  Programming == KBS2 is the home of predominantly entertainment and drama programmes produced by KBS such as Music Bank and You Hee-Yeol's Sketchbook, the network's main musical programs, Happy Together, Let's Go Dream Team!, 2 Days & 1 Night, The Return of Superman and Immortal Songs, the network's well known variety shows. Apart from drama and entertainment, the channel also shows films, popular talkshows, less news bulletins and more sporting events; this is in contrast to KBS1, which focuses more on news, current affairs, documentaries and cultural programming. As the target audience of KBS2 is younger than that of KBS1, they also broadcast a significant amount of children's programming in the mornings and afternoons. == Controversies  Carriage dispute === On 16 January 2010, a dispute broke out between KBS and the Korea Cable TV Association (KCTA) over carriage fees. KCTA sought to reduce fees from major national networks for carrying their feeds through subscription providers. KBS had demanded to charge 280 won per subscriber, while the TV providers limited their offer to 100 won per subscription. Negotiations reached a standstill, and so the providers decided to stop carrying KBS 2 nationwide starting from 3:00 p.m. (KST) on that same day. Due to loss in viewership, KBS2 experience major decline in their ratings. Following the blackout, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) has ordered the TV providers to resume distributing the channel or face a hefty fine. They initially refused, but on 17 January, they agreed to resume the channel's carriage after 28 hours. ==Logos== File:KBS 1961년 제작.png1964–1973 File:KBS logo (1973-1984).svg1973–1984 File:Kbs2.png1984–2018 File:KBS 2 logo.svg2018–present == See also == * KBS1 * EBS2 == References == * *http://www.kbs.co.kr/advertise/2tv_prog_fee.html *https://web.archive.org/web/20120806013907/http://k.kbs.co.kr/Home/ChannelSchedule *http://www.misodacom.com/bbs/board.php?bo_table=3_3≀_id=10 Category:Korean Broadcasting System television networks Category:Korean-language television stations Category:Television channels and stations established in 1965 ","title":"KBS2"},{"id":"35877500","text":"Solar panels on a house in Terrytown, Louisiana Solar power in Louisiana is ranked 34th for installed solar PV capacity as of 2017 by the Solar Energy Industry Association.

Plaz Slano Blato nad Lokavcem pri Ajdovščini. UJMA 14–15: 122–129.

The landslide is located on the southern edge of the Trnovo Plateau of the Dinaric Alps, below Mount Čaven and Little Mountain () next to the Platna mountain pasture.Platna Pasture at Geopedia It is moving along Grajšček Creek (which also originates in the landslide itselfSavnik, Roman, ed. 1968.

Ljubljana: Založba ZRC, p. 39. Its maximum flow rate was recorded at /day. ==Name== The name of the landslide area was recorded as Blatna ('muddy') in 1881. The origin of the designation 'salt(y)' (Slovene slan) is uncertain. A local folk belief states that the high cleanup cost of the landslide resulted in an exorbitant cost (cf. Slovene zasoliti 'to over- salt'; metaphorically, 'to charge excessively'). However, the landslide bore the designation 'salt(y)' before any cleanup efforts were ever made.Rosana Rijavec. 2009. \\"Plaz Slano blato kljub sanaciji ne miruje\\". Večer (30 January). Other locals state that sheep used to wander down to the area from nearby pastures, where they would lick the mud as a natural salt lick. This basis for the name's origin is supported by the fact that chemical analysis of the water at the landslide has shown it to have a very high mineral content, including sodium sulfate, also known as Glauber's salt.Benko, Igor. 2011. Zgodovinski pregled intervencij na plazu Slano blato. Paper presented at the conference Šukljetovi dnevi, Ajdovščina, 30 September 2011. (with photos, map) ==History and activity== Oral tradition regarding the landslide goes back four centuries, connecting it to the construction of a small church dedicated to Saint Urban on the slope of Mount Čaven above Lokavec and below the landslide. Saint Urban was invoked as a protector against natural disasters, and particularly with regard to a lake that people believed was hidden inside Mount Čaven that threatened to flood the valley.Slokar, Boris. \\"Sprehod do sv. Urbana\\" (with photos, map) A 1789 source by Belsazar Hacquet mentioned the landslide, describing its debris flow in 1786.

Cleanup efforts and landslide mitigation measures were carried out by Austrian authorities in 1903.Medvešček, Peter. 1904. Opis Sv. Križa. Gorica. In November 2000, heavy rain and warm weather triggered the Slano Blato Landslide, which buried about of grassland and forest. A secondary flow was triggered in September 2001. The landslide stopped moving after this and is currently considered stable. Following these events, an access road was built and of material was removed from the lower part of the landslide and deposited north of the Ajdovščina Airport. == References  External links == *Platna Pasture at Geopedia, showing the adjacent (unlabeled) Slano Blato Landslide Category:Landslides in Slovenia Category:Dinaric Alps Category:Geology of Slovenia ","title":"Slano Blato Landslide"},{"id":"35877803","text":"This is a list of electoral results for the electoral district of Yeronga in Queensland state elections. ==Members for Yeronga== {  - !colspan=\\"2\\"Member!!Party!!Term -    Winston Noble  Liberal  1950–1964 -    Norm Lee  Liberal  1964–1989 -    Matt Foley  Labor  1989–2001 - } ==Election resultsElections in the 1990s=Elections in the 1980s= Elections in the 1970s = Elections in the 1960s = Elections in the 1950s =References== Category:Queensland state electoral results by district ","title":"Electoral results for the district of Yeronga"},{"id":"35877843","text":"A by-election was held for the Australian House of Representatives seat of Corio on 2 March 1940.

The song was written by Aguilera, M.I.A., John Hill and Switch, while production was handled by the latter two. Originally, \\"Elastic Love\\" was recorded by M.I.A., but later it was given to Aguilera. However, M.I.A. was disappointed when Aguilera didn't want to do her \\"trademark warbling\\" in the studio. \\"Elastic Love\\" is an electro and electropop song with strong elements from 1980s new wave music. Lyrically, Aguilera compares her love to office supplies, from paperclips to rubber-bands. Upon its release, \\"Elastic Love\\" received favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the track's composition, its musical style and M.I.A.'s appearance on the song. Most of them praised it as the stand-out track on Bionic, while some of whom compared Aguilera's vocals on \\"Elastic Love\\" to those of M.I.A. and Gwen Stefani. The track was listed as the twelfth best song of 2010 by Amazon.com. Following the release of Bionic, \\"Elastic Love\\" peaked on the Gaon International Digital Chart and the Gaon International Download Chart at number 78 and 59 on June 6, 2010, respectively. == Background and development == British-Tamil recording artist M.I.A. (photo) wrote \\"Elastic Love\\" On the Asian leg of Aguilera's Back to Basics Tour during the summer of 2007, Aguilera revealed that her upcoming album would be \\"short, sweet and completely different\\" from her previous long- play Back to Basics (2006). After the birth of her son, Aguilera stated in an interview with Ryan Seacrest that her forthcoming album would include a totally new aspect of herself as an artist, because of the pregnancy with her son. During an interview with People in 2008, Aguilera stated that she was going to start recording new material for her forthcoming album at her home in Beverly Hills. On the album, which was titled Bionic, Aguilera was inspired by electronica music, which she heard a lot during her pregnancy. British-Tamil recording artist M.I.A. was one of the songwriters of \\"Elastic Love\\". According to her, \\"Elastic Love\\" was the first track that she recorded, even before she started working on her debut album. She added, \\"It's the one I made in-between taking time out and having a baby and starting mine\\". When was asked about why she agreed to work with Aguilera, M.I.A. revealed, \\"Other people were involved who I respect like Peaches and it was like a sea of women coming together to write this new thing. Christina had also had a baby, you know, so it was kind of an interesting situation\\". Aguilera's decision not to perform her \\"trademark warbling\\" while recording the song disappointed M.I.A., as she detailed in an interview with MTV News UK: > I really thought I was going to be able to go in there and get her vocals on > to the next level and she didn't want to do it. She was like 'You might > think that's great because it's not what you do, but to me I'm really bored > of it'. It's interesting getting to work with people who can do things > vocally that you can't... but yeah I only heard the song for the first time > when everyone else did. == Recording and composition == \\"Elastic Love\\" was written by Christina Aguilera, M.I.A., John Hill and Switch. Production of the song was handled by the two latter, who also played all musical instruments in it. The track was recorded at Dubsided in Los Angeles, California. Aguilera's vocals were recorded at The Red Lips Room in Beverly Hills, California. \\"Elastic Love\\" lasts for a duration of (three minutes and 33 seconds). It is an electro and electropop song which incorporates strong elements from 1980s new wave music. Its rhymes was described as \\"swapping sing-song-y\\" with \\"playground\\" chants. The track features \\"pulsating synth ping-backs\\" and an \\"808-esque backbeat\\" and Aguilera's \\"robotic\\" vocals. The melody of the track has been described as a \\"darker\\" tune and \\"unique\\". Aguilera's vocals on the track received comparisons to those of M.I.A. and Gwen Stefani. Lyrically, Aguilera compares her love to office equipment, from paperclips to rubber-bands, as a metaphor for a relationship. The lyric \\"A rubber band is what I call your love for me, cause it comes and goes and pins me like a trampoline\\" was spoken by Aguilera at the beginning. The part \\"If I was a ruler I'd try to set you straight, but your love is like a sharpener, it really grates\\" was praised by several critics, while the lines \\"A rubber band was an analogy, you can even say it's a metaphor\\" were described by others as unnecessary, with Becky Bain for Idolator calling it \\"dumber-than-dumb\\". Toward the closing moments, she sings, \\"Paper clips they couldn't even hold us together... when your love hits, it sticks me like a stapler.\\" ==Critical reception== Aguilera's vocals on \\"Elastic Love\\" were compared to those of Gwen Stefani (photo) by Becky Bain for Idolator. Upon its release, \\"Elastic Love\\" received positive reviews from most music critics. Becky Bain of Idolator provided a positive review, writing it \\"fresh\\", \\"bouncy\\" and \\"interestingly bereft of Aguilera's power notes\\". Ray Roa for Consequence of Sound wrote that \\"it sounds like a something that could make the stiffest indie-wallflowers bob their heads\\", while labeling it as \\"another forbearer of what looks to be one of the summer's best pop releases\\". HitFix's Melinda Newman wrote that the track is hypnotic with \\"adorably inane\\" lyrics, like \\"a nursery rhyme for adults set to the most infectious, trance track you can imagine\\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine for AllMusic picked \\"Elastic Love\\" as one of the four best tracks on Bionic and commented that the song has a \\"glassy chill\\". UK newspaper The Scotsman called it \\"eccentric\\", while Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly named it a \\"squiggly, hypnotic banger\\". Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune wrote that \\"Elastic Love\\" has the best moments of the album, with the electro beats and psychedelic arcade of sound effects. Richard Wink from Drowned in Sound deemed it a \\"wonderful\\" track, which \\"makes up for the poor beginning to the album\\". He continued, \\"Aguilera dramatically simplifying her usual histrionic vocal delivery, which leads to some surprising results. The lyrics are throwaway, but clever like a dunce who has a happy knack of making a lucky guess\\". The Village Voice editor Drew Hinshaw wrote that her and M.I.A.'s lyrical chemistry acts as a \\"the real amorous game\\", calling it \\"a fun duet, suggesting a two-girls-at-play theme that doubles in size\\". Alexis Petridis from The Guardian deemed it the best song from the album, praising M.I.A.'s \\"incredible pop melody\\" and \\"off-kilter backing of squelching electronics and sub-bass\\" and observed how her instrumentation \\"has also uniquely managed to calm down Aguilera's usual attention-all-shipping vocal approach into something weirder: dead-eyed, thickly smeared with dubby echo\\".

United States, 433 U.S. 299 (1977), was a court case argued before the United States Supreme Court on April 27, 1977. It concerned employment discrimination and was decided on June 27, 1977.. ==Case== In 1969, the Hazelwood School District in Missouri hired its first black teacher, and continued hiring black teachers ever since. In 1972, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was amended to apply to public employers, including school districts, making the hiring of black teachers almost a necessity in order to avoid liability. However, due to statistical disparities in the hiring practices of this particular school district, as well as 55 individual cases of alleged discrimination, the United States brought suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri to enjoin the school district from discriminating based on race. The District Court found in favor of the school district, saying that the ratio of black teachers to white was roughly equivalent to the ratio of black students to white. The United States appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which reversed the District Court's decision. This judgment was based on their decision to disregard the comparison to the student population, and instead compare the Hazelwood hiring statistics to the statistics of the surrounding area, including the St. Louis, MO school districts, saying that those numbers would more accurately reflect the \\"relevant labor market[.]\\" Hazelwood appealed to the Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals decision, arguing that the relevant labor market statistics should not include the St. Louis numbers, because that city had imposed very strict hiring guidelines to help overcome past racial discrimination. ==Judgment== The Supreme Court decided that, in this case, the proximity of the questionable hiring statistics to the application of Title VII to public employers was very relevant. The primary reason for the ultimate decision of the Court was that \\"pre-Act\\" hiring practices, that were perfectly legal under Title VII until the 1972 amendment, might have caused the statistical disparities in question. Based on that fact and the warning in the recent Teamsters decision that, when considering statistics as evidence of discrimination, all of the facts must be carefully considered, the Court vacated the decision of the Court of Appeals and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings, instructing them to consider whether the pre-Act practices might have played a predominant role in the statistics. ==Significance== This case solidified the decision in Teamsters v. United States, where the Court decided that statistics could play a leading role in showing a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII, but that they must be used with great care. The Teamsters decision was very important in the evolution of disparate Impact jurisprudence, and made it much easier for the victims of discrimination to bring cases against their employers. Hazelwood somewhat weakened that decision, however, by noting that statistics which were caused by actions taken legally, before the application of anti-discrimination laws, could not be used in such a way, and that an employer must be given a chance to prove that that might be the case, before a prima facie case can be said to have been established. ==NotesSee also== * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 433 * Hazelwood v.

Geological Society of America Bulletin. 117(11-12):1573-1595. The strata of the Nankoweap Formation are exposed in a small area that occupies an area from just south of Carbon Canyon to Basalt Canyon on the west bank of the Colorado River around Comanche Creek and Tanner Canyon on the east bank of the Colorado River within the eastern Grand Canyon, Coconino County, Arizona. It and associated strata of the Unkar and Chuar Groups are preserved in a prominent syncline and fault block. The most complete, readily accessible, and easily studied, exposure of the Nankoweap Formation occurs in Basalt Canyon. The nomenclature of the Nankoweap Formation has changed over time. Originally, the strata of the Nankoweap Formation was included in-part in the top of the \\"Unkar terrane\\" (Group) and in-part in the basal “Chuar terrane” (Group) by Walcott in 1894.Walcott, CD (1894) Precambrian igneous rocks of the Unkar terrane, Grand Canyon of the Colorado. 14th Annual Report for 1892/3, part 2, pp. 492-519, United States Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia. Van Gundy first recognized the thin sequence of red beds unconformably overlying basaltic flows of the Unkar Group as a separate stratigraphic unit, which he called the “Nankoweap Group.“ Close-up Although more extensive outcrops exist in Basalt Canyon, Comanche Creek, and Tanner Canyon, it is named for a small, fault-bounded block of the Nankoweap Formation in Nankoweap Canyon. It was argued that these redbeds belonged neither to the underlying Unkar Group nor overlying Chuar Group. Maxson in his geological mapping reduced the Nankoweap Group to formational rank because the Nankoweap had not been subdivided into formations. Later, a locally preserved lower member (ferruginous unit and weathered zone) that unconformably overlies the Cardenas Basalt and is unconformably overlain by the upper member of the Nankoweap - was recognized. ==Description== The Nankoweap Formation is slightly more than 100 m in thickness. Currently, it is informally divided into two informal members, the lower (ferruginous) member and the upper member. These members are separated and enclosed by unconformities. The lower (ferruginous) member of the Nankoweap Formation consists of thin, 15 m or less thick, erosional remnants that overlie deeply eroded and often deeply weathered basaltic lava flows of the Cardenas Basalt. Within the Grand Canyon, the lower member of the Nankoweap Formation outcrops at only two locations adjacent to the trace of the north-south-trending Butte Fault. First, it outcrops just north of the Colorado River in the eastern side of the Basalt graben at Tanner Canyon Rapids. At Tanner Canyon Rapids, the lower member consists of red, highly resistant, hematite-cemented, quartzitic sandstones and siltstones that have a maximum thickness of about 15 m and disappears within about 200 m west of the Butte Fault between the upper member of the Nankoweap Formation and the eroded surface of the Cardenas Basalt. Finally, it outcrops 2 km due south of the Colorado River near and at the southern limit of preservation of the Cardenas Basalt and Nankoweap Formation. At this location, it consists of a thin layer of highly ferruginous sandstone that is composed of sediments derived from the underlying Cardenas Basalt and a 10 m thick ferruginous weathered zone (paleosol) developed in the eroded surface of the Cardenas Basalt.Elston, DP, and GR Scott (1976) Unconformity at the Cardenas-Nankoweap contact (Precambrian), Grand Canyon Supergroup, northern Arizona. Geological Society of America Bulletin. v. 87(12):1763-1772 The upper member of the Nankoweap Formation consists of about 100 m of generally reddish-purple, fine-grained, quartzitic sandstones. They are shaley and silty towards the top. The sandstones sometime contain conglomeritic horizons composed of rounded, disc- shaped pebbles of Dox Sandstone and occasional pebbles of basalt lava. A lag deposit of gravel composed of white to yellowish, small pebble to cobble size chert gravel occurs locally at the base of the upper member. Typically, the sandstone sections are thin-to-medium bedded and exhibit planar tabular and trough cross-bedding, ripple marks, mudcracks, numerous soft-sediment deformation structures, and rare salt pseudomorphs. Towards the top of the upper member, massive, meter-scale sandstone beds become common. ==Nature of contacts== Unconformities mark both the base and, possibly, the top of the Nankoweap Formation. The red beds of the Nankoweap Formation unconformably overlie the Cardenas Lavas of the Unkar Group. At most places, the upper member of the Nankoweap Formation directly overlies the Cardenas Basalt. In Basalt Canyon, an angular discordance in this lower contact reflects the erosion of 60 m of Cardenas Basalt has been recognized. West of Tanner Canyon, erosion has locally removed as much as 300 m of Cardenas Basalt before the deposition of the Nankoweap Formation. As demonstrated by a 10 m thick ferruginous weathered zone (paleosol), deep chemical weathering of the exposed lava flows of the Cardenas Basalt occurred before deposition of the Nankoweap Formation west of Tanner Canyon. The deeply weathered lavas retain their original textures but have been pervasively stained and altered to earthy hematite and siderite. The upper contact of the Nankoweap Formation with the base of the Galeros Formation of the Chuar Group appears to be quite sharp. The upper part of the Nankoweap Formation consists of cliff-forming sandstones that grade irregularly upward - from red to white. This change in color has been interpreted to reflect bleaching beneath an unconformity that separates red beds of the Nankoweap Formation from dark-gray dolomites of the Galeros Formation. Because this contact lies in the middle of sheer cliffs formed by the combined sandstones of the Nankoweap Formation and the overlying dolomites of the Galeros Formation, it is not easily accessible and little is known about it. The inaccessibility of the upper contact of the Nankoweap Formation has prevented a close examination of it. Except for wide shallow channels cut in the Nankoweap Formation and filled with dolomite, the upper contact lacks any stratigraphic evidence that indicates a large erosional or temporal hiatus.Ford, TD, and WJ Breed (1973) Late Precambrian Chuar Group, Grand Canyon, Arizona. Geological Society of America Bulletin, Vol. 84, Issue 4, pp.1243-1260. The contact between the overlying Tapeats Sandstone and the folded and faulted Nankoweap Formation is a prominent angular unconformity that is part of the Great Unconformity. Uranium-lead dating of detrital zircons from the Nankoweap Formation indicate the presence of zircon grains in approximately the 800-770 Ma age range. This finding indicates that the Nankoweap Formation is closely related in age and stratigraphy to the Chuar Group - and any unconformity associated with its upper contact is relatively minor in duration and significance. Thus, the Nankoweap Formation is most likely the basal unit of the Chuar Group.Dehler, CM, KE Karlstrom, GE Gehrels, JM Timmons, and LJ Crossey (2012) Stratigraphic revision, provenance, and new age constraints of the Nankoweap Formation and Chuar Group, Grand Canyon Supergroup, Grand Canyon, Arizona. Geological Society of America, Abstracts with Programs, 44(6):82. ==Depositional environments== The depositional environments of the Nankoweap Formation remain unclear and poorly defined. The deeply weathered paleosol developed in the Cardenas Basalt represents an extended period of subaerial weathering prior to the deposition of the Nankoweap Formation. The sandstones of its lower member are also quite weathered and, thus, appear to have accumulated subaerially. The sedimentary structures in the upper member of the Nankoweap Formation are interpreted to indicate that it accumulated beneath moderate- to low-energy, shallow waters, either in a shallow sea or lake. Strata within the upper part of the Nankoweap Formation is inferred to have accumulated in sand and mudflats. Also, cross- bedded sandstone layers within the upper member of the Nankoweap Formation are argued to be beach deposits. ==Fossils== Van Gundy identified a structure found in a sandstone bed of the Nankoweap Formation in Basalt Canyon as a trace fossil impression of a stranded jellyfish. This structure is approximately 12 cm in diameter and consists of a series of radiating lobes, rounded at their ends. Some of these lobes have a median groove radiating from a small, irregular hollow. Initially, later studies also considered this to be a jellyfish impression and it was eventually named “Brooksella canyonensis” by Bassler.Bassler, RS, (1941) A supposed jellyfish from the pre-Cambrian of the Grand Canyon. Proceedings of the United States National Museum. 89(3104):519-522. Later, CloudCloud, PE, Jr. (1960) Gas as a sedimentary and diagenetic agent.

Yale University Press New Haven, Connecticut. obtained a partial second specimen and argued that both specimens were of inorganic origin and formed by \\"compaction of fine sands deposited over a compressible but otherwise unidentifiable structure, possibly a small gas blister.\\" Paleontologists, who were unconvinced by Cloud's interpretation, reinterpretated this structure to be a burrow (trace fossil), known as “Asterosoma,“ made by a sediment feeding, worm-like organism. Other paleontologists, who later reexamined both specimens, argued that they are inorganic, sedimentary structures similar to small \\"sand-volcanoes\\" formed by the upward expulsion of gas or fluid from sediments as more sediment is loaded on top or as the sediment is shaken during seismic activity. Both specimens are very similar in morphology to sedimentary structures initially interpreted to be fossil jellyfish and named “Astropolithon.” Like Brooksella canyonensis, Astropolithon is now regarded to be the result of the venting of fluidized sand into surficial sediments blanketed by microbial mats that were typical of Precambrian sea- and lake-bottoms. Very similar sedimentary structures have been observed in a thick tsunami deposit related to the asteroid impact at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundarySeilacher, A (2007) Trace Fossil Analysis. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany. 226 pp. ==Age (basal Chuar Group theory)== The Nankoweap Formation has not been directly dated using radiometric dating techniques. It is younger than the age of the Cardenas Basalt, which erupted about 1,104 million years ago.Timmons, JM, J. Bloch, K. Fletcher, KE Karlstrom, M Heizler, and LJ Crossey (2012) The Grand Canyon Unkar Group: Mesoproterozoic basin formation in the continental interior during supercontinent assembly. In JM Timmons and KE Karlstrom, eds., pp. 25-47, Grand Canyon geology: Two billion years of earth's history. Special Paper no 294, Geological Society of America, Boulder, Colorado. The Nankoweap Formation was presumed to be older than the 800 to 740 Ma strata that comprises the overlying Chuar Group.Dehler, CM, SM Porter, and JM Timmons (2012) The Neoproterozoic Earth system revealed from the Chuar Group of Grand Canyon. In JM Timmons and KE Karlstrom, eds., pp. 49-72, Grand Canyon geology: Two billion years of earth's history. Special Paper no 294, Geological Society of America, Boulder, Colorado. However, uranium-lead dating of detrital zircons from the Nankoweap Formation found it contains detrital zircons that are approximately 800-770 Ma in age. This finding indicates that the Nankoweap Formation is younger than 770 Ma; it is closely related in age to the Chuar Group - and quite likely is the basal member of this group. ==Barite deposits== Within Nankoweap Canyon, prospect pits have been dug into numerous patches of sandstone that have been replaced by hematite. In these prospect pits, barite cemented sandstone, and thin barite veins, have been found. A few of these patches exceed 10 feet in width. The sandstones containing these patches are highly deformed and cut by numerous small faults.Ford, TD, WJ Breed, and C. Downie (1969) Preliminary geologic report of the Chuar Group, Grand Canyon, Arizona.

The creek is west of Marble Canyon, and enters the canyon near Lower Marble Canyon. The Tanner Graben, a downdropped graben of Dox Formation and Cardenas Basalt is topped by a bright, multilayered section of the Nankoweap Formation.

However, he then chose his father's profession and had his first theatrical engagement at the end of 1905 in Koblenz. In 1910, he appeared in New York City, and in 1911, he was a stage actor in Berlin. A year later, he took roles in the still undervalued cinema. Pittschau personified elegant lovers and was a partner of Hanni Weisse and Henny Porten, among others. In the 20s, his film roles became smaller; after that, he barely received work. He now mostly played at the Theater am Kurfürstendamm, at the Komödie and at the Tribüne. In the 1940s, he lived in poverty and had to rely on the support of the Goebbels-supported foundation for people who worked in the arts, \\"Künstlerdank.\\" After World War II, the Italian director Roberto Rossellini brought the almost forgotten actor in front of the camera again. In the survival drama Germany, Year Zero (1948), he played the bedridden father.

In this role he has been noted as \\"a pathologist of distinction who never sublimated his personality to his public service role.\\" From 1925, until his death in 1941, Tidswell was the Director of Pathology at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children in Sydney. In an obituary, The Medical Journal of Australia wrote of him as an \\"extremely clear thinker, young in mind and receptive of new ideas. In his gentleness of manner, and quiet courtesy, the [children's] hospital has lost a most valued specialist.\\"Nesta Griffiths G (1947), Point Piper, past and Present (Syd:Ure Smith) ==Birth and education== Nugal Hall, Randwick, was Tidswell's home in his teenage years The 1881 Founders' Wing was opened the year Tidswell commenced his education at Newington College The Anderson Stuart Building at Sydney University where Tidswell studied and taught medicine The Royal Alexandria Hospital for Children at Camperdown where Tidswell was Director of Pathology for 28 years St Paul's Anglican Church, Burwood, where Tidswell married Millie Jones in 1902 Gayton, Burwood, where the Tidswell and Jones wedding reception was held A Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost open tourer of the style bought by Tidswell in 1912 Tidswell was born in Sydney, the fifth of nine children born to Frederick Squire Tidswell (1831–1898) and his wife Mary Ann (1836–1912). The fourth child, Francis Tidswell (1864–1866) had died the year before his birth and the sixth child was the architect Thomas Tidswell (1870–1950). He was raised in rural NSW until the age of 13 when his family moved to Sydney. Dr Fred Tidswell, who also owned the Coogee Bay Hotel, bought Nugal Hall, the Mortimer Lewis designed home in Milford Street, Randwick, and members of the family lived there until 1903. Tidswell attended Newington College (1881–1884)Newington College Register of Past Students 1863–1998 (Syd, 1999) p. 198 and then went up to the University of Sydney graduating as a Bachelor of Medicine and Chemistry in 1892. He then studied at University College, London, and was awarded a D.P.H., by the University of Cambridge in 1893. ==Early medical career== Upon graduation, Tidswell occupied a position in the New South Wales Department of Health and then in 1897 was appointed as Demonstrator of Physiology at the University of SydneyThe Newingtonian (Syd, March 1897) p. 252 and so at a young age he was a principal teacher in a medical subject before the establishment of a chair. ==Research== In 1898, Tidswell carried out extensive research on snake venom. He also experimented on the immunisation of horses with tiger snake venom by gradually increasing the quantity of venom injected into the animal until it was capable of withstanding what would at first have been sufficient to kill it. He then set out to determine the quantity of the serum, which he had obtained from the immunised horse, that was required to neutralise this venom – that is, to destroy its effect upon the animal into which he had injected it. Tidswell found that not only did his anti-venene give a high degree of protection against the venom of the tiger snake, but also that the protective effect could be obtained even many hours after the venom had been at work. This is characteristic of the modern anti-venene, that it produces dramatic, almost miraculous, effects upon patients who may have been bitten many hours before the anti-venene can be administered, and who may already have collapsed and be beyond all hope of recovery by any other treatment. ==Board of Health== John Ashburton Thompson, as Chief Medical Officer in NSW, appointed Tidswell as Bacteriologist to the fledgling public health department. Thompson, Tidswell and William George Armstrong went on to produce important research on plague and are credited with developing 20th century scientific understandings of plague, in particular that Yersinia pestis is spread to humans by fleas from infected rats. Their work was a large part of a revolution of social medicine in Australia. The knowledge that infectious diseases could be spread from one human to another by insects and that infection could be derived from animals, brought public health into scientific scrutiny. The outbreak also led to further improvements being made to the North Head Quarantine Station as the value of segregating infected patients from the populace had been realised. As Principal Assistant Medical Officer, Tidswell also filled the role of Microbiologist from 1 January 1898 until 1 July 1908 when the Bureau of Microbiology was established. ==Pathologist== With the creation of the Ministry of Health in 1913, Tidswell resigned and entered private practice. In 1925 he was appointed Director of Pathology at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children. The hospital's centenary history states: \\"As a boy Tidswell had been brought up in the country and taught to respect people for their work rather than their rank. At the Hospital he had a loyal staff who regarded him with the greatest respect and affection. He firmly held that on the job rank was necessary but out of the hospital it did not matter and he would raise his hat courteously to the lowliest employee.\\" In the later years of his career he worked a three-day week dividing his time between Sydney and the Southern Highlands. ==Marriage and family life== In 1902, Tidswell married Edith Millie Jones, the third daughter of The Hon. Richard Jones MLC, of Gayton Burwood. The wedding ceremony was performed at St. Paul's Anglican Church Burwood, followed by a reception at the Jones family home on Burwood Road. The marriage produced one daughter, Marjorie Squire Tidswell (1904–1992). The couple built a home, Deloraine, on the northern tip of Point Piper in 1903. Tidswell's knowledge of trees, flowers and soils led to him being a keen gardener. While the house still stands at 132 Wolseley Road, it has been substantially altered and is now known as Cordoba having been redesigned in a Spanish Revival style by the architects Esplin & Mould. The beautifully landscaped garden has been subdivided leading to the erection of a newer house on the water front at 132A.Walking Coastal Sydney Retrieved 25 January 2014. From the 1930s, the Tidswells lived at their historic 1860s farmhouse, Farnborough on the Illawarra Highway just out of Moss Vale, where they developed another important garden and bred draught horses. The garden is now opened to the public by its current owners. Tidswell was a man of considerable private and professional means and was an early motoring enthusiast. In 1912 he purchased a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost that was fitted with a high-sided Torpedo Phaeton body by coachbuilder Barker. The car was used sparingly by Tidswell but after new owner's and a period of dereliction it has been restored and when offered at auction in England in 2003 it was estimated to be worth between £180,000 and £220,000. ==References== Category:1867 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Australian public health doctors Category:People educated at Newington College Category:Sydney Medical School alumni Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:Australian pathologists ","title":"Frank Tidswell"},{"id":"35878400","text":"A by-election was held for the Australian House of Representatives seat of Warringah on 21 May 1927.

She went missing on 22 August 2009 and her body was discovered on 5 May 2012. Hounslea's daughter and her boyfriend were arrested for her murder but there was not enough evidence to bring a prosecution against either of them. The investigation remains open. == Background == Hounslea was 37 years old at the time of her disappearance, was white around 5 ft 8ins tall, of medium build with blonde or light brown shoulder-length hair. Hounslea was described as having bipolar disorder and was in poor health. Although at the time of the disappearance she was not known to have a job, it was thought she may have been employed as a bartender and seamstress. Hounslea lived with her only daughter, Lois, in Culme Road, West Derby, Liverpool. She was last seen wearing a grey jumper and possibly a pink cardigan over the top with dark jeans and a gold Madonna pendant necklace. It is thought that she had three small bags of clothes with her. Hounslea was last seen by her family when they dropped her off at her home after a family meal at a Chinese restaurant. == Disappearance == The next morning, on 22 August 2009, Lois claims that Hounslea went into her room and told her that she was going to stay with a friend named Vicky for a few days. Lois claimed that Hounslea left that morning carrying a number of bags of clothes. At 17:50, Lois' phone received a text message from Hounslea's phone saying that she was going to stay with a friend. A message was also sent to Vicky's phone from Hounslea's saying that she was going away for a few days. It was later established that Hounslea had booked and paid for a hotel room for that night, but never arrived to check in. The alarm was raised when it was discovered that Hounslea had not stayed with Vicky and had not called her parents, which was said to be out of character. Hounslea's cash card was used to withdraw money on a number of separate occasions in the days following her disappearance. At an inquest in 2014, police files revealed that a total of £850 was withdrawn from her account after she disappeared, including a £200 withdrawal made at 03:23. Police have stated that both Hounslea and her daughter knew the PIN for the card. During the period of her disappearance, an apparent attempt to phone Vicky had been made from Hounslea's phone; however, technical problems prevented the call from being connected. A total of 176 calls were made to Hounslea's voicemail after her disappearance. These calls came from Vicky, and Hounslea's parents and sisters; none came from her daughter Lois. == Discovery of the body == On 5 May 2012, Hounslea's body was found by a dog walker next to the loop line cycle path in Fazakerley, Liverpool near its junction with Blackthorn Road. The dog discovered the bones on an embankment in what appeared to be an old fire pit. The male dog walker called the police immediately. The body was identified using Hounslea's medical and dental records. A 20 cm kitchen knife was found in the fire pit alongside Hounslea's body, similar to knives used at her home. Discovered with the body was some melted blue plastic of the type used to make wheelie bins. Police have been unable to establish exactly when Hounslea was killed but stated that the body was dumped in the fire pit at some time between September 2011 and January 2012. == Subsequent events == Police launched a murder inquiry following the discovery of the body and appealed to the public with the hope of making contact with anyone who saw Hounslea either on the day of the disappearance or after. On 13 June 2012, Hounslea's daughter Lois and her boyfriend, Kevin Kavanagh, then aged 21 and 20 respectively, were arrested on suspicion of murder. They were released on bail the next day. The house Lois shared with her mother was sealed off for forensic examination. Lois and Kevin were released without charge in August 2013 due to insufficient evidence. === Inquest === At the inquest, prosecutors stated there was not enough evidence to charge Lois and Kavanagh as there was \\"no realistic prospect of conviction\\". Lois was twice summoned to appear at her mother's inquest but failed to attend both times claiming that she was unwell after suffering an asthma attack following an arrest for theft. Kavanagh appeared in the witness box but stated that he had been advised not to answer questions put by the coroner to avoid potential incrimination. A narrative verdict was recorded and the police have stated that the case remains open. ==References== Category:1972 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Date of birth missing Category:People from West Derby Category:English murder victims ","title":"Death of Paula Hounslea"},{"id":"35878548","text":"A by-election was held for the Australian House of Representatives seat of Parramatta on 10 December 1921.

The 2012 M23 rebellion against the DRC government led to the displacement of large numbers of people. On 20 November 2012, M23 took control of Goma, a provincial capital with a population of one million people, but was requested to evacuate it by the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region because the DRC government had finally agreed to negotiate with them. In late 2013 Congolese troops, along with UN troops, retook control of Goma and M23 announced a ceasefire, saying it wanted to resume peace talks. A United Nations report found that Rwanda created and commanded the M23 rebel group. Rwanda ceased its support following international pressure as well as the military defeat by the DRC and the UN in 2013. http://docs.house.gov/meetings/FA/FA16/20150520/103498/HHRG-114-FA16-Transcript-20150520.pdf p. 74 ==Background== North Kivu Province, DRC On 23 March 2009, the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) signed a peace treaty with the DRC government, where it became a political party, and the M23 soldiers integrated into the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC). M23 takes its name from the date of these peace accords. The armed wing of the group is led by General Makenga Sultani, who has served as acting president of the group since the 28 February 2013 removal of Bishop Jean-Marie Runiga Lugerero, a former CNDP member. ==Formation== The M23 was formed on 4 April 2012 when nearly 300 soldiers - the majority of them former members of the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) - turned against the DRC government, citing poor conditions in the army and the government's unwillingness to implement the 23 March 2009 peace deal. General Bosco Ntaganda, also known as \\"The Terminator\\", was accused by the Government of Kinshasa of leading the group, and President Kabila called for his arrest on 11 April 2012. The government had threatened to redeploy former CNDP soldiers away from North Kivu before the full implementation of the peace agreement, which prompted many of them to defect from the army and create the M23. The M23 is made up primarily of Tutsis and opposes the Hutu Power militia Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (a group that counts among its number the original members of the Interahamwe that carried out the 1994 Rwandan Genocide) as well as area Mai-Mai (community militias mostly created and supported by the Democratic Republic of Congo). To be able to upstaff the troops, occupied villages were asked to deliver youngsters for the formation of village defence committees. This way, a larger number of more experienced soldiers could be stationed on the battlefield. However, this approach backfired when M23 troops tried to extort from the local population, since the armed youngsters defended their own villagers. Following military successes, M23 rebels made additional demands, citing issues of human rights, democracy, as well as good governance. They have accused President Kabila of cheating in the November 2011 elections. The rebels have threatened to march on Kinshasa and depose the president. ==Mutiny== M23 rebels in Goma, November 2012 The rebels were active in North Kivu province, fighting government forces in the Rutshuru and Masisi territories. On 6 June 2012 a Congolese spokesman reported that 200 M23 soldiers had died in the mutiny and that over 370 soldiers had surrendered to FARDC, including 25 Rwandan citizens. On 8 July 2012, Colonel Sultani Makenga announced that a government offensive to dislodge the group from their hideouts had failed, and that they had in turn captured several towns towards Goma, the provincial capital. ==Late 2012 offensive== March 23 Movement forces had advanced to the outskirts of Goma by 18 November 2012 and warned the UN peacekeepers (MONUSCO) not to support government troops. Congolese government spokesman Lambert Mende accused Rwanda of backing the rebels. \\"The DRC has \\"not yet declared war, but we are ready to face it. This is our country, our duty\\". M23 rebels advanced on Goma 20 November, and the Congolese Army retreated with little fighting. M23 forces paraded through the city, and some residents turned out to welcome them. Congolese customs officers abandoned their posts, leaving the border to Rwanda open. United Nations peacekeepers watched the occupation without intervening, stating that their mandate was limited to protecting the safety of civilians. Jeune Afrique later reported that M23 rebels acquired as well as six artillery pieces (type 26 and BM-type rocket launchers)approximately ~20 shipping containers filled with arms and ammunitions of various caliber, all of which were abandoned by the FARDC during their retreat from Goma. DR Congo president Joseph Kabila urged Goma's citizens to \\"resist\\" the M23 takeover. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon criticized the M23 for alleged human rights violations during the takeover, including \\"intimidation of journalists\\", and abduction of women and children. Noting that the First Congo War had begun with fighting in the same region, the New York Times described the takeover of Goma as \\"raising serious questions about the stability of Congo as a whole\\". On 21 November 2012, during the siege more than 2,000 Congolese soldiers and 700 policemen defected to M23. Nyanzale refugee camp, 150km north of Goma On 22 November, the FARDC, in cooperation with local Mai-Mai elements, routed the M23 rebels from the nearby town of Sake, 27 kilometers from Goma, as they marched towards Bukavu. Also 22 November, Kabila suspended General Gabriel Amisi's FARDC commission because of an inquiry into his alleged role in arms sales to various rebel groups, including the FDLR, in the eastern part of the country, so it implicated M23. On 23 November, M23 rebels retook Sake from the FARDC after an intense four-hour battle and reinforced their position in the town, as they reportedly moved toward Kirotshe to the south, Mushaki to the north-west, and Kingi to the north. Meanwhile, the FARDC reinforced their position in Minova, near the South Kivu provincial border, with more than 3500 soldiers. The UN has declared that it lost access to 30 of its 31 refugee camps in the area due to the M23 offensive. On 24 November in South Kivu, Colonel Albert Kahasha, who had surrendered and joined government troops along with other leaders of Mai-Mai militia groups Raïa Mutomboki and Nyatura. On 13 November he defected again from the FARDC. At a regional meeting in Kampala, leaders of the Great Lakes area gave M23 a two-day ultimatum to leave Goma. A combined force which would include international troops, a FARDC company, and a M23 company would be posted near Goma Airport and would take charge of security. When the ultimatum expired on 26 November, M23 still controlled the city. M23 rebels leaving Goma, 30 November 2012 The FARDC, had previously withdrawn after raping almost 126 women, some of them less than 10 years old, according to the United Nations and looting the money and possessions of the local population,https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43804 came from Minova in a counteroffensive launched against M23 positions in the Masisi, North Kivu region on 27 November. M23 set up a road block on the road from Goma to Sake and reportedly extorted funds from drivers. Following a peace deal negotiated in Uganda, the M23 said it would withdraw from Goma by 1 December. On 30 November, M23 troops began to withdraw from Sake and Masisi. A first contingent of 200 police officers also arrived in Goma on 30 November, in anticipation of M23’s withdrawal. M23 operatives allegedly kept a presence there, dressed in civilian police uniforms. On the eve of the withdrawal, FARDC forces accused M23 rebels of going door to door in some of Goma’s suburbs on the eve of their withdrawal, looting personal possessions, money and vehicles. The political wing of the movement denied this accusation, and said that criminal elements who had escaped from Munzenze prison were responsible for the looting. On 3 December 2012, FARDC and Congolese government officials re-enter Goma, two days after M23 left the city. On 24 February 2013, leaders of eleven African nations signed an agreement designed to bring peace to the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, among them Rwanda and Uganda. Both had been accused of aiding the M23 rebellion, a charge they denied. M23 was not represented either in the negotiations, or at the signing. On 18 March 2013, Bosco Ntaganda handed himself in to the U.S. embassy in Kigali, Rwanda,BBC News - Bosco Ntaganda: Wanted Congolese in US mission in Rwanda. Bbc.co.uk (2013-03-18). Retrieved on 2013-09-04. where he requested transfer to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands. Though the reasons for his surrender are unknown it was speculated that he was either pressured to do so by Rwanda or feared infighting within the M23 movement and its military leader Sulani Makenga, which had recently forced Ntaganda's forces to flee the DRC into Rwanda. Though Rwanda was not a signatory to the Rome Statute, the media speculated it would be forced to turn him over to the ICC. The U.S. also had listed him on its Rewards for Justice Program.The surrender of Bosco Ntaganda - Al Jazeera Blogs On 22 March, he was detained by the ICC and appeared for the first time in front of the ICC on 26 March,BBC News - DR Congo: Bosco Ntaganda appears before ICC.

M23's political leader, Jean-Marie Runiga Lugerero, was sacked. In a statement signed by M23's military leader, Sultani Makenga, he was accused of treason because of \\"financial embezzlement, divisions, ethnic hatred, deceit and political immaturity\\". Makenga declared himself interim leader and clashes between those loyal to Sultani Makenga and those loyal to Jean-Marie Runiga Lugerero, who is allied with Bosco Ntaganda, have killed ten men and two others were hospitalized. M23 has denied that it is hit by dissent. ==United Nations Force Intervention Brigade== Tanzanian soldiers of the UN brigade In March 2013, the United Nations Security Council authorized the deployment of an intervention brigade within MONUSCO to carry out targeted offensive operations, with or without the Congolese national army, against armed groups that threaten peace in eastern DRC. The brigade is based in North Kivu and is made up of a total of 3,069 peacekeepers. It is tasked with neutralizing armed groups, reducing the threat posed to State authority and civilian security and make space for stabilization activities. ==End of rebellion== On 6 November 2013 government forces launched an assault on M23 rebel position in the east of the country. This occurred one day after insurgents called for a ceasefire. The following day M23 issued a document that said they had \\"decided from this day to end its rebellion\\" and instead to pursue its goals \\"through purely political means\\". On 7 November, Sultani Makenga, the leader of M23, surrendered with about 1,500 M23 fighters in Mgahinga National Park, Uganda. They were held in Kisoro. After peace declarations were signed between the DRC Government and M23 rebels on 12 December 2013, issues of legal accountability for the rebellion remain because of international pressure. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== *UN Group of Experts final report 2012 *Full text of the Agenda for the Dialogue between the Government of the DRC and the M23 on the situation in Eastern Congo, 16 January 2013, UN Peacemaker Category:2012 establishments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Military units and formations established in 2012 Category:North Kivu Category:Rebel groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ","title":"March 23 Movement"},{"id":"35878657","text":"A by-election was held for the Australian House of Representatives seat of Maranoa on 30 July 1921.

The bluntnose minnow (Pimephales notatus) is a species of temperate freshwater fish belonging to the genus Pimephales of the cyprinid family. Its natural geographic range extends from the Great Lakes south along the Mississippi River basin to Louisiana, and east across the Midwestern United States to New York State. The bluntnose is very ubiquitous, and may be the most common freshwater fish in the Eastern U.S.Page, Lawrence M. and Brooks M. Burr (1991), Freshwater Fishes, p. 129-130, Houghton Mifflin, New York, NY. ==Description== Bluntnose minnows are commonly long, with a maximum length of . On the first two or three dorsal rays are dark pigmented spots. The scales between the head and the dorsal fin are noted to be smaller than the rest of the scales on the body. They have a rounded head and a terminal mouth, although the snout hangs a little bit over the mouth. The dark coloring on the edges of the scales cause a cross-hatched look along the body. The scales on these fish are cycloid scales, a type of leptoid scale. It is possible to find the age of a fish from the rings on the scales. The lateral line of a bluntnose minnow runs from its head to tail, ending in a black spot that makes them distinguishable from the fathead minnow. These minnows have a pale olive upper body (above the lateral line) and a silvery lower body (below the lateral line), with silvery-blue scales near the lateral line. ==Distribution== The bluntnose minnow can be found in North America, in the Hudson Bay and Mississippi River basins from southern Quebec to southern Manitoba, Canada to Louisiana, United States. They are also found from the Saint Lawrence River in Quebec to the Roanoke River on the east coast of United States. There are also many non-indigenous populations found in Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Michigan, thought to have been introduced by bait bucket release or stock contamination. Bluntnose minnows are thought to be the most abundant freshwater fish in the eastern part of the country. ==Habitat== Bluntnose minnows can be found in lakes, rivers, ponds and streams, showing a preference for shallow, clear water with a sandy bottom. Their habitats range from headwater bogs, swamps, and springs to rivers, ponds, and lakes. Sometimes, up to a dozen species of minnows can be found in a single stream of moderate size. They can be found swimming in large groups or alone. ==Diet== These fish prefer to feed on aquatic insects, algae, diatoms, aquatic insect larvae, and small crustaceans called entomostracans. Occasionally they will eat fish eggs or small fish. ==Life cycle== Bluntnose minnows spawn from early spring to midsummer, depending on their habitat. They attach their eggs under stones in depressions they have dug. During the mating season, the heads of the males will become darker and their bodies bluish. They also develop three rows of tubercles (bumps) on their heads. Eggs hatch in eight to fourteen days. ==Etymology== The genus name Pimephales means fat head, the specific epithet notatus means marked or spotted. ==References== Category:Pimephales Category:Cyprinid fish of North America Category:Fish described in 1820 Category:Taxa named by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque Category:Freshwater fish of North America ","title":"Bluntnose minnow"},{"id":"35879491","text":"Bridgend is a community in Bridgend County Borough, south Wales.

They are used to treat magnesium deficiency, low blood magnesium, eclampsia, and several other conditions. Magnesium is important to health. Usually in lower dosages, magnesium is commonly included in dietary mineral preparations, including many multivitamin preparations. Chelated magnesium is sometimes used to aid in absorption. In 2017, it was the 171st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than three million prescriptions. ==Medical uses== *As a bronchodilator after beta-agonist and anticholinergic agents have been tried, e.g. in severe exacerbations of asthma. Recent studies have revealed that magnesium sulfate can be nebulized to reduce the symptoms of acute asthma. It is commonly administered via the intravenous route for the management of severe asthma attacks. *Obstetrics: Magnesium sulfate is used to prevent seizures in women with preeclampsia and eclampsia, and is also used for fetal neuroprotection in preterm deliveries, but has been shown to be an ineffective tocolytic agent. ==Side effects== More common side effects from magnesium include upset stomach and diarrhea, and calcium deficiency if calcium levels are already low.Magnesium at University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC). Reviewed last on: 6/17/2011 by Steven D. Ehrlich ==Overdose== Overdose of magnesium (hypermagnesemia) is only possible in special circumstances. It can cause diarrhea,https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/ Section: Health Risks from Excessive Magnesium nausea, vomiting, severely lowered blood pressure, confusion, slowed heart rate, respiratory paralysis. In very severe cases, it can cause coma, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest and death. Magnesium overdose can be counteracted by administering calcium gluconate. ==Types of preparations== In practice, magnesium is given in a salt form together with any of several anionic compounds serving as counter-ions, such as chloride or sulfate. Nevertheless, magnesium is generally presumed to be the active component. An exception is the administration of magnesium sulfate in barium chloride poisoning, where sulfate binds to barium to form insoluble barium sulfate. Magnesium is absorbed orally at about 30% bioavailability from any water soluble salt, such as magnesium chloride or magnesium citrate. The citrate is the least expensive soluble (high bioavailability) oral magnesium salt available in supplements, with 100 mg and 200 mg magnesium typically contained per capsule or tablet. Magnesium aspartate, chloride, lactate, citrate and glycinate each have bioavailability 4 times greater than the oxide form and are equivalent to each other per amount of magnesium, though not in price.Firoz M, Graber M: \\"Bioavailability of US commercial magnesium preparations.\\", Magnesium Research 2001 Dec;14(4):257-62.Lindberg JS, Zobitz MM, Poindexter JR, Pak CY: \\"Magnesium bioavailability from magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide.\\", J Am Coll Nutr. 1990 Feb;9(1):48-55. The ligand of choice for large-scale manufacturers of multivitamins and minerals containing magnesium is the magnesium oxide due to its compactness, high magnesium content by weight, low cost, and ease-of-use in manufacturing. However it is insoluble in water. Insoluble magnesium salts such as magnesium oxide or magnesium hydroxide (milk of magnesia) depend on stomach acid for neutralization before they can be absorbed, and thus are relatively poor oral magnesium sources, on average. Magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) is soluble in water. It is commonly used as a laxative, owing to the poor absorption of the sulfate component. In lower doses, they may be used as an oral magnesium source, however. Intravenous or intramuscular magnesium is generally in the form of magnesium sulfate solution. Intravenous or intramuscular magnesium is completely bioavailable, and effective. It is used in severe hypomagnesemia and eclampsia. == See also == * Magnesium sulfate (medical use) ==References== Category:Magnesium ","title":"Magnesium (medical use)"},{"id":"35879581","text":"Agenioideus cinctellus is a spider wasp of the subfamily Pompilinae with a Palearctic distribution. ==Description== A. cinctellus is a relatively small species of spider wasp being 6–8 mm long. The abdomen is mainly black in colour but the rest of the body is very variable and the legs may vary from whitish to reddish brown, some specimens have spots on the tibia of the hind. There is often an oval spot on the inner edge of the eye.Rolf Witt wasps. Observe, determine. natural-Verlag, Augsburg, 1998, . ==Habitat== This species prefers dry habitats and sandy soils. It can be seen searching for prey on vertical surfaces such as old walls. The species has been found on unstable clay under-cliffs on the Dorset coast. ==Biology== In Britain, the flight period is normally June to August but occasionally adults emerge as early as late May. The main prey species are small jumping spiders of the family Salticidae, but members of the family Thomisidae will occasionally be used. This wasp will also hunt spiders found on vertical or nearly vertical planes, such as cliffs, walls and the overturned root plates of wind thrown trees. This wasp uses a wide range of natural cavities for nesting, but will also utilise the abandoned burrows of other aculeate hymenoptera, empty mud cells and snail shells.

The Chiru population numbers approximately 8,599. It is one of the least documented and a highly endangered language spoken in three districts of Manipur: Senapati, Noney district of Manipur and Cachar district of Assam. Chiru has been recognized as a Scheduled Tribe of Manipur by the government of India since 1956 under \\"The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, Act No. 63 of 1956\\" Dated 25 September 1956. The total population of the native speakers of Chiru is only 8599 (Census of India: 2011). The native speakers have high proficiency in Meitei. The language is neither used in schools nor in radio or mass media. Older people read and write in Manipuri written in Bengali script, but the younger generation prefers Roman script. The Chirus are one of the earliest inhabitants of Manipur and Assam. Cheitharol Kumbaba, the Royal Chronicles of Manipur mentioned that King Meidingu Chalamba defeated the Chirus in 1554. This proves that the Chirus had settled in Manipur long before this period. It was also mentioned in the Royal Chronicles of Manipur that an incidence of Meitei King's incursion on Nungsai Chiru Village occurred on 22nd day of Wakching (December–January) 1729 during the reign of Maharaja Garibniwaz (Cheitharol Kumbaba: 1989:90). In spite of the considerably long period of their settlement in the two states (Manipur and Assam), the population of Chiru native speakers is shockingly very low. The growth rate of their population was extremely steady. This might be due to high mortality rate and low birth rate in the previous centuries. The domain of language use for Chiru is very limited. The usage of Chiru by Chiru native speakers is specifically confined only at home domain and within the community among the native speakers. The language proficiency of Chiru native speakers ranges from bilingual to multilingual. The native speakers in Manipur have high proficiency in Manipuri and those in Assam have high proficiency in Hmar, Manipuri and Sylheti Bengali. Chiru speakers in Manipur generally speak Manipuri, Hindi or English while those of Assam speak Hmar, Sylheti Bengali, Manipuri or Hindi at the time of interaction with non-Chiru speakers. The Chiru native speakers in Manipur usually speak either Manipuri or Hindi in the market place, office etc. Moreover, they also speak Paior Thwhen they interact with, and speakers respectively. On the other hand, Chiru speakers of Assam speak Sylheti Bengali, Manipuri or Hmar in the market places, offices or anywhere outside home domain. It is painful to mention that Chiru of Assam has not been recognized by the government of Assam. They are rather recognized as Hmar. Chiru is neither used in schools nor in radio or mass media.

It is also recorded as Langrong by UNESCO and declared as critically endangered language. The Ranglong language is also known as \\"Riam chong\\". ==Distribution== Ranglong language is spoken in Seisimdung, Noagang, Zoitang, Lungkam, Zoinogor, Muolhui, Enhui, Vomthat, Kheuri-laikhuo, Rothabil, Laikhuo, Sorospur, Thumsip, Balidung, Ru-at, Saitha, Zarolian, villages in Tripura, Nurka, Langkhanphong, Pipla, Zairal, Sobiri, Khulicherra, Jugicherra, Salganga, Kaisanary, Jamira villages in Assam and Luimawi village in Mizoram. The Ranglong people lives in a close and compact yet divided by three Indian federal states. Who are the Ranglongs? The term ‘Ranglong’ is also simultaneously used as ‘Langrong’ by different scholars and writers. For instance, GH Damant, in his book ‘Notes on the locality and Population of the Tribes Dwelling between the Brahmaputra and Ningthi Rivers’ published in 1880, by Stanford University, USA, in the ‘Journal of Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland’ and GA Grierson, in his research work, ‘The Linguistic Survey of India’ Vol. III, Part-III, published in 1904, by Kalpaz Publication, New Delhi, used the term Ranglong. Whereas, CA Soppitt, in his publication on ‘A short Account of the Kuki-Lushai Tribe on the North-East Frontier’ published in 1887, by Harvard University, USA, TC Hodson, in ‘The Naga Tribes of Manipur’ published in 1911, by University of London, and Colonel Shakespeare, in ‘The Lushei Kuki Clan’ published in 1912, by University of California, USA, used the term Langrong. At present, the speakers identify themselves with the term ‘Ranglong,’ although some of their correlated ethnic tribes like Mizo, Thado etc., still called them ‘Langrong.’ GH Damant categorised the Ranglong with ‘Old Kukis’ of the greater Tibeto-Burman Family (Damant, ibid, 1880: 237). Some of the ethnic tribes of Old Kukis are Bete, Khelma, Rangkhol, Aimol, Chiru, Ranglong etc. The term ‘Old and New Kuki’ is used to categorise and identify them in relation to their period of migration and contact with the plain population of the present northeast India. Thus, the ‘Old Kukis’ are the first and the ‘New Kukis’ the latter, among the Kuki-Chin groups who migrated in their present areas of settlement and make contact with the plain population. In trying to distinguish the two Kukis, GA Grierson further said, ‘Not only do their customs and institutions differs considerably, but their languages are separated by a large group of dialects in the Lushai and Chin Hills. The so- called New Kukis are, so far as we can see, a Chin tribe, most closely related to the inhabitants of the Northern Chin Hills, while the Old Kukis are related the tribes more to the south’ (GA Grierson, ibid, 1904: 2). The Ranglong being an Old Kuki, its origin and phases of migration is the same as other Kuki-Chin ethnic groups. There is enough literature within the academic circle regarding the migratory route of the Kuki-Chin groups. They were believed to have migrated from some part of China provinces, to Myanmar and to present northeast India. Till now, the Ranglongs would chant in their folk song called ‘Nei omna Durnai phai,’ meaning ‘our place of settlement is Durnai valley.’ The term ‘Durnai valley’ is believed to be the Kabaw Valley of present Myanmar (Burma). There is no tangible evidence why the Ranglongs migrated from the Kabaw valley of Burma. GH Damant said that the so called Kukis ‘are migratory race, living by jhum cultivation and preferring the densest forests’ (GH Damant, ibid, 1880: 237). After their migration from Kabaw valley, they entered Champhai district of present Mizoram, the then Lushai Hills, approximately around 1200 to 1300 A.D. They further move towards Churachanpur district of present Manipur, and settled in and around the confluence of river ‘Tiruong and Tivai,’ which is commonly known as ‘Tipai(mukh)’ in Bengali (it is also call Tuiruong and Tuivai. Ti/Tui indicates water). The accent of the term ‘Tivai got changed to ‘Tipai’ in Bengali, and the confluence of ‘Tiruong and Tivai,’ got the name ‘Tipaimukh.’ The two rivers joined together and flow towards western direction and finally got the name ‘Barak’ in Barak valley of Assam. In memory of those old settlements the Ranglongs would chant, ‘Rili Champhai Zol,’ meaning ‘Rili Champhai plains,’ ‘Rili’ is also termed as ‘Rihdil’ by various Kuki-Chin groups. ‘Li/Dil’ means a lake or pond in Kuki- Chin language. It (Rili) is a big lake in present Myanmar, adjoining Champhai revenue district of present Mizoram and occupies an important place in the history and culture of Kuki-Chin ethnic groups. They still have a sense of belonging to that lake because of its direct linkages with their social history. Again, the Ranglong would also chant ‘Ruonglevaisuo kati,’ which means ‘in the bank of the confluence of river Tiruong and Tivai where we used to settle.’ The settlement of Ranglong in the confluence of river Tiruong and Tivai (Tipaimukh) may be approximately in between 1500 to 1600 A.D. From there, they follow the downstream of the river till present Barak Valley and thereafter dispersed in different direction. Considerable numbers of the Ranglong populations had even migrated to the extent of Sylhet district of present Bangladesh. This is evident from GA Grierson’s comparison of the population of Ranglong language speakers in Sylhet and North Cachar Hills (GA Grierson, ibid, 1904: 207). From Sylhet most of them came back following the river ‘Langkei’ which is ‘Longai’ in Bengali version (the etymology of ‘Langkei’ is elaborated in the next section), river Juri in present North Tripura district, and river Dhalai in Dhalai district of Tripura. Present settlements of Ranglong: The present settlement of Ranglong is found in three states - Tripura, Assam and Mizoram, having a population of approximately 12000 (twelve thousand). It is ambiguous whether Ranglong speakers are still in existence in Sylhet district of Bangladesh, Manipur and Myanmar. As of now, there is limited information about their existence in these mentioned regions. In the state of Tripura, they are mainly concentrated in the hilly terrain of the North Tripura revenue district, under Dharmanagar and Panisagar revenue sub-division, bordering Assam, and in Dhalai district of Tripura. The locations of most of the Ranglong villages in Tripura are found in adjoining National Highway No. 08 (eight) with few exceptions having a distance of five to ten kilometer away from the said National Highway. Considerable numbers of ‘Langkei’ and ‘Dap’ clan of Ranglong community are also found in few interior villages of Kamalpur and Ambassa revenue sub-division of Dhalai revenue district of Tripura. In Assam, they are concentrated in Patherkandi revenue circle of Karimganj district, mostly in the bank of the river Longai bordering Tripura and Mizoram. Few villages are also under Katlicherra revenue circle of Hailakandi district, and Sonai revenue circle of Cachar district of Assam. In Mizoram, the Ranglongs settled in Zawlnuam sub-division of Mamit district. The Ranglongs have settled in their present areas of settlement for last 400 (four hundred) to 500 (five hundred) years approximately. It is evident from the name of places in their locality that is being officially recognised till date by the government of Assam, Tripura and Mizoram. For instance, there is a river called ‘Longai’ used as inter-state boundary among the three mentioned Indian federated states. This river connects Patherkandi revenue circle of Karimganj district of Assam, Panisagar revenue sub-division in north Tripura and Mamit revenue district of Mizoram. The term ‘Longai’ is a Bengali version of Ranglong terminology called ‘Langkei.’ Because of linguistics unfamiliarity of the plain populations, the accent of ‘Langkei’ got changed into ‘Longai.’ In fact, the word ‘Langkei’ is nothing but is one of the names of Ranglong clan. Till now, Langkei is the major clan among the Ranglong Community. Within the native dwellers and even by the government of Mizoram the river is still recognised as Langkei rather than the tainted version. Since they are believed to be the first settler in the bank of river Langkei, the river ultimately got the name cognate with the native dwellers. Similarly, there is a name of locality officially called ‘Solgoi’ in present Patherkandi revenue circle of Karimganj revenue district of Assam. It is a wrong accent of Ranglong terminology called ‘Solngui,’ which is nothing but a name of flower found naturally in that area and that particular area got the name after ‘Solngui’ flower. The Ranglongs once settled in Solgoi areas before moving the upstream of river Langkei (Longai) bordering Mizoram and Tripura. Ranglong as a distinct Community: Past and Present: Unfortunately, the Ranglong community has become the minority of the minorities in their present respective Indian federated states. The Ranglong language has also been declared by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a critically endangered language among the 197 (one hundred ninety seven) languages in India (Press Information Bureau, Government of India, MHRD, 6th Aug. 2014). Evidently, this ethnic community is also very much a victim of amalgamation and delimitation of Indian Territory after Independence. However, it has to be mention that the Ranglongs had been identified as a separate community having separate identity by various renowned scholars. GH Damant put the Ranglong Community under Old Kuki as against Bete, Khelma and Rangkhol Community (GH Damant, ibid, 1880: 237). CA Soppit also clearly mentioned about the community of Ranglong (CA Soppit, ibid, 1887: 3). GA Grierson had again identified the Ranglong as separate community and accordingly undertook detailed linguistic research on Ranglong language (GA Grierson, ibid, 1904: 207-213). TC Hodson also identified the Ranglong as separate community as against Halam, Rangkhol etc., and put it under Old Kuki group (TC Hodson, ibid, 1911: 19). Besides, Colonel Shakespeare highlights the Ranglong as distinct to other tribal languages (Colonel Shakespeare, ibid, 1912: 225). Kenneth VanBik, in his research works on, ‘Proto-Kuki-Chin: A Reconstructed Ancestor of the Kuki-Chin Language’ grouped the Ranglong with Old Kuki as against Halam, Rangkhol, Aimol etc., (Kenneth VanBik 2009: 20). MK Bhasin, in his research works, ‘Genetics of Castes and Tribes of India: Indian Population Milieu’ also clearly identify the Ranglong as separate community alongside Lushai/Mizo, Rangkhol, Halam etc., (MK Bhasin 2006: 268). At present, the status of the community is such that it has no official recognition in their respective federated states as Ranglong. The respective state administration has rather merged them with different communities. The Ranglongs in Tripura has been merged with Halam and Tripuri Community, whereas in Assam with the Kuki, Rangkhol/Hrangkhawl and Tripuri Community. In Mizoram they were merged with Rangkhol/Hrangkhawl and any other Mizo tribes (as per the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes Orders ‘Amendment’ Act 1976). The repercussion is that maximum of the Ranglongs are using the new community, with whom they were merged, as their surname. The serious irony is that, those communities grouped under Old Kuki alongside Ranglong, like Bete, Khelma, Rangkhol, Aimol, Chiru etc., have been recognised as separate tribal community since Indian Independence. Unfortunately, the existence of Ranglong Community has deteriorated to the point of extinction. Conclusion: Considering their merger with different communities in three federated states in India, the Ranglong community is passing through serious identity crisis. They are officially compelled to identify themselves to a community with which the state government had merged them. However, young and learned generations of the Ranglongs have been slowly and steadily recuperating its past identity in the recent years. It is found that they have been very vocal on their distinct identity as ‘Ranglong’ and acknowledged their common identity through diverse socio-cultural activities. The Ranglong Youth Association (RYA), a registered association under Societies Registration Act, 1860, and the only umbrella organisation, have been playing a big role for the socio-cultural uplift of the Ranglong community since its inception in 1994. There is anticipation among the Ranglongs that unless the respective state administration does not take some proactive measures to establish and locate the fact they would continue to be victims of injustice. THE OLD KUKI TRIBES IN TRIPURA: Ranglong,Hrangkhol and Hallam The tribes belonging to the Chin and Kuki are one and the same people who were collectively identified as ‘Kuki’ in India and ‘Chin’ in Burma. The first reference to the term ‘Kuki’ was made in 1777 A.D. in connection to the tribesmen who attacked the British subjects in Chittagong when Warren Hastings was made the Governor General of Bengal (Gangmumei Kamei, Ethnicity and Social Change: An Anthology of Essay, Imphal: PC Jain and Co., 2002: p. 25). There are many surmises and theories about the origin of the word ‘Kuki.’ Some believe that it has been derived from the Baluchistan word ‘Kuchi’ meaning wondering people. Some other said that it comes from the word ‘Kooky’ meaning peculiar or unusual people (Aheibam Koireng Singh, The Kuki Identity then and now, Manipur Times, Nov.18, 2016). S. Prim Vaiphei believes that it was a derogatory name given to the outsiders to an ethnic group of people living in western Burma, North East Indian and Bangladesh (S Prim Vaiphei, eds., ‘The Kukis’ N Sanajaoba, Manipur: Past and Present, Vol. 3, New Delhi: Mittal, 1995, p.126). The term ‘Old Kuki and New Kuki’ had been categorised and being identified in relation to their period of migration and contact with the plain population of the present northeast India. Thus, the ‘Old Kukis’ are the first and the ‘New Kukis’ the latter, among the Kuki-Chin groups who migrated in the present northeastern states and make contact with the so called ‘plain population.’ In trying to distinguish the two Kukis, G.A. Grierson further said, ‘Not only do their customs and institutions differs considerably, but their languages are separated by a large group of dialects in the Lushai and Chin Hills. The so-called New Kukis are, so far as we can see, a Chin tribe, most closely related to the inhabitants of the Northern Chin Hills, while the Old Kukis are related the tribes more to the south’ (G.A. Grierson, Linguistics Survey of India, Vol. III, Part III, 1904: p. 2). According to G.H. Damant, the ‘Ranglong, Bete, Khelma and Rangkhol’ were the Old Kukis (GH Damant, ‘Notes on the locality and Population of the Tribes Dwelling between the Brahmaputra and Ningthi River,’ in the Journal of Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, USA: Stanford University, 1880, p.237). According to T.C. Hodson, the ‘Ranglong, Rangkhol, Bete, Hallam, Aimol, Kolren, Kom, Cha, Mhar, Anal, Hiroi-Lamgang and Purum’ were identified as belonging to the Old Kuki (T.C. Hodson, ‘The Naga Tribes of Manipur’ London: Macmillan and Co. 1911, p. 19). Again, according to Kenneth VanBik, the ‘Ranglong, Aimol, Chiru, Purum, Kom, Hrangkhol, Hallam, Kolhreng, Luhupa, Tarau, Anal, Biate, Vaiphei etc) were categorised as Old Kuki (Kenneth VanBik, ‘Proto-Kuki-Chin: A reconstructed ancestor of the Kuki- Chin languages’ in ‘STEDP Monograph Series’ Berkeley: University of California, 2009, p. 20). At present, it is bewildering to clearly categorise the Old Kuki and New Kuki considering the present socio-cultural setting among hill tribes. As per the Scheduled Tribes Orders Second (Amendment) Acts, 2002, the Government of India identifies some tribal community in the northeastern states under Kuki and not necessary as Old Kuki and New Kuki. As per the identification and categorisation of Old Kuki tribes by the above mentioned scholars there are three tribes found in Tripura. They are ‘Ranglong, Rangkhol and Hallam.’ According to the record of the Scheduled Tribes List, Government of India, most of the other so called Old Kuki tribes are at present found in Manipur and Assam and few of them are also found in Mizoram (for further information please see Scheduled Tribes Orders Second (Amendment) Acts, 2002, Government of India). However, the official recognition of the Old Kuki tribes in Tripura is now in different forms. The Ranglong tribe is now merged with Halam, the Rangkhol/Hrangkhawl with Kuki and the Hallam/Halam is directly recognised as Halam tribe. As the earlier scholars grouped both the ‘Ranglong and Hallam’ under Old Kuki, it could be inferred that the migratory route of the two Old Kuki tribes must be same. Hence, it can be further surmised that there must have been huge magnitude of population intermixture in between the two tribes. S.B.K. Dev Varman rightly said, ‘They came into contact with the ruling dynasty of the day and accepted the suzerainty of the kings of Tripura. They are known as ‘Mila Kukis’ also. The Kukis call them ‘Ranglong’ (S.B.K Dev Varman, ‘The tribes of Tripura: A dissertation,’ Directorate of Research, Tribal Research Institute, Government of Tripura, Agartala, 2004, p.35. As the Ranglong are officially merged with Halam, regardless of the Ranglong being identified as a separate tribe against Halam under Old Kuki by so many renowned scholars (as stated above), maximum of the Ranglongs had used Halam as their surname. But as the Ranglongs recuperates its past distinct identity, they have gradually started using the tribe’s name (Ranglong) as their surname. At present, the Ranglongs are having well awareness about their distinct identity as a separated tribe. They have been acknowledging their identity as Ranglong in different socio-cultural activities. They have their own distinct and organised customary law called ‘Halamasa’ (for more information about ‘Halamasa’ please see ‘Khurpuitabum: An Introduction to the History of Ranglong,’ published by Tribal Research and Cultural Institute, Govt. of India, 2014, pp. 37-46) which is a customary law given by the then Tripura Maharajas. It has been practiced for last fifty years (approximately) and major disputes within themselves are solved and adjudicated on the basis of their customary law. In fact, internal disputes among themselves hardly reach the general court, accepting few cases that are beyond the capacity to solve by village level council. Although the Ranglongs well understood that many renowned scholars identify and categorised the two tribes – ‘Ranglong and Halam’ as distinct and separate (for reference and further information relating to the tribes of ‘Ranglong and Halam’ as separate and distinct to each other please see T.C. Hodson, ibid, p. 19, Kenneth VanBik, ibid, p. 20, and M.K. Basin ‘Genetics of Castes and Tribes of India: Indian Population Milieu,’ in ‘Int J Hum Genet,’ Vol. 6, No. 3, pp. 233-274), they (Ranglong) still identify themselves as Halam relating to any official matter that is beyond the purview of the Ranglong tribes So, many Ranglongs (accepting some of them) who identifies himself/herself as ‘Ranglong’ within his/her locality unfortunately identify himself/herself again as ‘Halam’ if he/she is physically outside or beyond the local areas and especially among the non- Scheduled Tribes populace. For instance, if one Ranglong from Koileng (Bagbasa) of North Tripura identify himself/herself as ‘Ranglong’ within that locality, he/she may again identify himself/herself as belonging to Halam tribes after reaching Dharmanagar town of North Tripura. In short, one person is having dual identity depending upon the situation in hand. This is not to be taken by surprise, because as the Ranglong tribe is officially merged with Halam tribe, few peoples outside the inhabited areas of Ranglong really knew about the separate existence of Ranglong tribes. Hence, for any official purpose and for making any sorts of official correspondence they have to identify themselves as Halam for making things easier. In view of the above complexity, some pertinent questions arise: How long will the Ranglong further maintain this dual identity which they have to temporarily accept due to certain compulsion? Can the record of the Colonial Historians regarding the identification and categorisation of tribes be officially ignored in the days to come? What would be the observation of the educated young generation Ranglongs who are well aware of their present identity crisis? These questions are very complicated where inferences could not be drawn easily. There is, therefore, huge scope for the researcher and scholars who are interested to undertake research on ethnography and Historiography study in Tripura. ==References== *Grierson G.A., Linguistic Survey of India, Vol - iii, Part -iii. p-207 *https://www.ethnologue.com/language/rnl *http://www.sppel.org/ranglongdoc.aspx Category:Kukish languages Category:Languages of Assam Category:Languages of Mizoram Category:Languages of Tripura Category:Ethnic groups in Northeast India Category:Ethnic groups in South Asia Bhasin, M.K.

From 1975-1998 she was a member of the National Research Council of Italy (CNR) in Milan and has also been a visiting scientist at MIT and a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University. She graduated at the University of Florence in Biological Sciences and did a PhD in Immunology at the University Catholic of Louvain. Professor Paola Ricciardi-Castagnoli is a member of EMBO and of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. Since 2002 she has been the President of the European Network of Immunology Institutes (ENII) and Chair of the IFREC-SIgN Winterschool on Advanced Immunology. In 2006 she was awarded a Marie Curie Chair at the Pasteur Institute of Paris by the European Council (6FWP).

Her laboratory is involved in the study of myeloid cells, and in particular dendritic cells (DC), significantly contributing to the identification of the central role of DC in regulating immunity. The present focus of her laboratory is dissecting the molecular mechanisms that DC employ to regulate immunity. Over the course of her career she has formed close collaborative links with many leading groups in the dendritic cell field. In 1996 she organized the 4th International Symposium of Dendritic Cells. She is also a member of the Board of Directors of the International Society for Dendritic Cells founded by Ralph Steinman. Her laboratory was among the first to identify the key role that DC play in both innate and adaptive immune responses via the use of innate receptors such as the Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs). She contributed to the discovery that TLR4 is the receptor for LPS, a finding that led to the award of the Nobel Prize for Medicine to Bruce Beutler in 2011.Il Venerdì di Repubblica, November 4, 2011, n°1233 (pp. 74-78), by Alex Saragosa. With her research group, Professor Paola Ricciardi-Castagnoli has published >300 publications in international peer reviewed journals, with >35,000 citations with an H-index of 75 (as of 2019) .According to the Google Scholar Citations. One of the most relevant discoveries of her group is that DC are able to produce interleukin 2 (IL2)Citation in the reference list from Nature Medicine 17, 604–609 (2011), PubMed upon activation with appropriate microbial or sterile signals. The IL2 cytokine was thought to act only during adaptive immune responses, but is now recognized as a key player in both innate and adaptive immunity. To activate the transcription of IL2, DC (and their progenitors) use the calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) mediated signaling pathway. In addition to their work on IL2, her group has shown that DC play a key role in mucosal tissues, such as the lamina propria of the intestinal villi where DC have a sentinel functions and sense the gut commensal flora with dendrites. This discovery has opened the way to novel studies on the role of the gut microbiome in regulating immune-mediated diseases. ==Honors and Memberships== * German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina honorary member * European Molecular Biology Organization honorary member * Order of the Star of Italy Medal of Ufficiale dell'Ordine della Stella della solidarietà italiana * Marie Curie Chair European Council award * Top Italian Women Scientists 2016 award *Elected: ** Member of the Scientific Council of the Institut Pasteur, Paris ** Member of the Scientific Advisory Board of Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Berlin ** Member of the FIMSA Board and International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) Council ** Member of the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) Biology and Health Strategic Board ==See also== * SIgN Singapore Immunology Network * A*STAR Agency for Science, Technology and Research ==References== Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Italian immunologists ","title":"Paola Ricciardi-Castagnoli"},{"id":"35879680","text":"Mammillaria morganiana, common name owl's eyes or owl-eye pincushion, is a cactus in the genus Mammillaria of the family Cactaceae.

He was born on 30 December 1898, he was the third of six children of Peary Lal Roy and Lolita Roy. Indra Lal Roy was his younger brother. Roy came from a family of highly qualified and established persons. His father was a barrister and his maternal grandfather Dr. Soorjo Coomar Goodeve Chuckerbutty was one of the first Indian doctors to be trained in Western medicine. Roy received his education in England. He attended the St. Paul's School in London. At the age of ten he began training in boxing under Billy Childs, the then boxing coach at Cambridge who later became the featherweight world champion. Jim Driscoll himself took the responsibility of training Roy. Roy became the school champion. He passed in B.A. from Cambridge University. At Cambridge won the university championship from Oxbridge and became an Oxford Blue. Roy was the first Cambridge Blue from Asia. In 1914, Roy became the bantamweight champion in England. Apart from boxing Roy was also proficient in shooting and horse riding. He was the first amateur Indian jockey to have ridden a horse in a race. At the outbreak of the First World War, he became a private in the Royal Artillery while his younger brother Indra Lal Roy obtained the King's Commission to the Royal Flying Corps. In the army he rose to be a lieutenant. After the war he completed in Masters in Economics from Cambridge University in 1919 and returned to India. == Career == Grave of P L Roy, Bhawanipur Cemetery, Kolkata He joined the Bengal Railway as a traffic superintendent. In the 1920s, the sport of boxing was popular mainly among the Anglo-Indians. In order to organize boxing as a sport and make it popular among the Indians, Roy opened a boxing training centre in Ballygunge. In 1928, he took initiative to organize the first inter-Railway Boxing Championship at Kolkata. In the same year he founded the Bengal Boxing Federation and became its secretary. Later he became its president. In 1933, in the competition between the military and the civilians, Santosh De, a student of Roy became the champion. Among the notable students of Roy were Pramatha Chaudhuri, Phanindra Krishna Mitra, Nagen Chatterjee, Joaquim C. A. Minus, Abulal, Johnny Natal, R. Austin, D. Gasper, Kartik Dutta etc. Though Roy himself was an amateur boxer, he fought against Edgar Bright, the then Indian champion in bantamweight division at the Old Empire Theatre and defeated him. He also defeated Philippine boxer Young Turley once. ==Honor== In 2011 the Indian Railway immortalised Paresh Lal Roy by unveiling a marble bust of the boxer in an indoor stadium named after him.

The trophy is one of three Gordon Bennett awards: Bennett was also the sponsor of an automobile race and a ballooning competition. The terms of the trophy competition were the same as those of the Schneider Trophy: each race was hosted by the nation which had won the preceding race, and the trophy would be won outright by the nation whose team won the race three times in succession. Accordingly, after Joseph Sadi- Lecointe's victory in 1920 the Trophy became the permanent possession of the Aéro-Club de France. ==History== James Gordon Bennett Following the success of the Gordon Bennett balloon competition, which had become the most important competition for the sport, Gordon Bennett announced a competition for powered aircraft in December 1908, commissioning a trophy from André Auroc, the sculptor who had created the trophies for both the balloon and automobile competitions. Formulation of the competition rules was entrusted to the Aéro- Club de France.Villard 1987, p. 14 It was decided that each competing nation would be allowed to field a team of three competitors. The 1909 competition was held as part of the Grande Semaine d'Aviation held at Reims in France, and consisted of two laps of a circuit. Like the subsequent competitions, it was not a direct race, but a time trial, with competitors taking off separately. As aircraft became faster and their engines more reliable, the distance to be covered was increased each year. The last competition was held in 1920 in the French communes of Orléans and Étampes. Unlike those held before the First World War which were over short courses marked by pylons, the competition was held between two points apart because of the growing speed of aircraft. Joseph Sadi-Lecointe won in a time of 1 hour, 6 minutes and 17.2 seconds, while fellow French aviator Bernard de Roumanet finished second in a time of 1 hour, 39 minutes and 6.9 seconds. ==Competition winners== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=col Year ! scope=col Location ! scope=col Winning pilot ! scope=col Aircraft type ! scope=col Distance ! scope=col Time ! scope=col Speed -  1909  Reims, France ! scope=row Glenn Curtiss\\"Tabulated Performances of Rheims Meeting\\"Flight 4 September 1909  Curtiss No. 2  15 min 50.6 s  -  1910 Belmont Park, New York, US ! scope=row Claude Grahame-White  Blériot XI   1 h 1 min 4.74 s\\"The American International Meeting\\"Flight 5 November 1910  -  1911 Eastchurch, England ! scope=row Charles Weymann\\"Gordon Bennett Race- Table of Cumulative Lap Times\\"Flight 8 July 11  Nieuport II   1 h 11 min 36.2 s -  1912  Clearing, Illinois, US ! scope=row Jules Védrines  Deperdussin Monocoque   1 h 10 min 56 s\\"The Gordon Bennett Cup\\"Flight 21 September 1912  -  1913  Reims, France ! scope=row Maurice Prevost\\"The Gordon Bennett Race\\"Flight 4 October 1913  Deperdussin Monocoque   59 min 45.6 s -  1920  Orléans/Étampes, France\\"The Schneider and the Gordon-Bennett\\"Flight 2 September 1920 ! scope=row Joseph Sadi-Lecointe\\"The Gordon Bennett RaceFlight 30 September 1920  Nieuport 29   1 h 6 min 17.2 s  } The 1914 race was to have been held at Reims between 19 September and 28 September,\\"The Gordon Bennett Aviation Race\\"Flight 11 April 1914 but was cancelled due to the outbreak of the First World War.

Hampered by gusty winds and rain which turned the grass flying-field to glutinous mud, many of the twenty entrants were unable to take off and none managed to complete the necessary two laps. Eugène Lefebvre, flying Wright biplane put up the best performance, nearly completing the course; Louis Blériot, who had managed to fly about 2.5 km in a Blériot XI put up the next-best performance. It was decided that the third place would be given on the basis of performance in the speed competition to be held that afternoon, and was taken by Hubert Latham. The Wrights themselves had passed on an invitation to compete at Reims, though it seemed awkward since the Gordon Bennett Trophy was crowned with a large replica of a Wright Flyer. The Aero Club of America, which had sponsored the Scientific American trophy won by Curtiss a year earlier, turned to him. His aircraft was not as well developed as the Wright machines and while it was more maneuverable than the European aircraft, it was not nearly as fast. Despite this disadvantage, Curtiss won in 15 minutes and 50.4 seconds. Blériot finished second place with a time of 15 minutes and 56.2 seconds, 5.8 seconds more than Curtiss. {  - !Width=\\"100pt\\"Nationality !!Width=\\"120pt\\" Pilot!!Width=\\"130pt\\" Aircraft Type !!Width=\\"60pt\\" Position !!Width=\\"100pt\\" Time!!Width=125pt\\" Speed!!Width=\\"300pt\\" Notes - France Louis Blériot Blériot XIISecond 15 min 56.2 s   - France Hubert Latham Antoinette VIIThird 17 min 32 s   - France Eugène Lefebvre Wright Model AFourth 20 min 47.6 s   - United Kingdom George Bertram CockburnFarman III    Did not finish course - United StatesGlenn Curtiss Curtiss No. 2 First  15 min 50.4 s   } ===1910=== The 1910 competition was held at the Belmont Park racetrack in New York as the culminating event of a week-long aviation meet. The 5 km course marked out for the competition attracted strong criticism from the competing pilots. Alfred Leblanc, captain of the French team, described it as a death-trap because of the obstacles which would hinder any pilot trying to make an emergency landing, and a tight turn less than 30 m (100 ft) from one of the grandstands was christened \\"Dead Man's Corner\\" by the press. However, the race proceeded as planned.Villard 1987, pp. 58-9 Contestants were permitted to start at any time during a seven-hour period on the day of the race. Claude Grahame-White was first to take off at 8:42, flying a Blériot XI powered by a 100 hp Gnome Double Omega and completing his first lap in 3 minutes 15 seconds. He was followed by Alec Ogilvie flying a Wright Model R at 9:08 and Alfred Leblanc at 9:20. Leblanc, who was the chief pilot for the Blériot company, was flying a 100 hp Blériot XI differing slightly from Grahame-White's, with a different propeller and a reduced wingspan. Leblanc's aircraft was clearly faster: after four laps his time was 1 minute 20 seconds better than Grahame-White's and he completed his nineteenth lap after 52 minutes 49.6 seconds in the air, Grahame -White having completed the 20 lap course in 1 hour 1 minute 4.47 seconds. However half-way round the last lap Leblanc's engine stopped, either through fuel shortage or the breakage of a fuel line, and he had to make a forced landing, colliding with a telegraph pole but fortunately escaping serious injury.Villard 1987, pp.84-6 Meanwhile, Alec Ogilvie had been forced to land by engine problems after 13 laps after a delay of 54 minutes he took off again and eventually completed the course in a total time of 2h 26m 36.6s, good enough to gain him third place. Walter Brookins, flying the Wright \\"Baby Grand\\", was about to take off when Leblanc crashed, and decided to fly to the scene of the accident to see if he could help. However shortly after takeoff a connecting rod broke and his aircraft was wrecked in the subsequent forced landing. Brooking was unhurt.Villart 1987, p. 88 Hubert Latham took off at 10:59, but his attempt was plagued by engine failures, and he spent about four hours on the ground making repairs, eventually completing the course in 5h 48m 53s, an average speed of . Shortly before the latest permitted takeoff time John Drexel and John Moisant, both flying Blériot IXs, started their attempts. Drexel was forced to retire after seven laps, while Moisant completed the course in 1h 57s 44.8s after landing more than once with engine problems, securing second place.Villard 1987, p. 90The American International Meeting Flight 5 November 1910 p. 917 {  - !Width=\\"100pt\\"Nationality !!Width=\\"120pt\\" Pilot!!Width=\\"130pt\\" Aircraft Type !!Width=\\"60pt\\" Position !!Width=\\"100pt\\" Time!!Width=125pt\\" Speed!!Width=\\"300pt\\" Notes - France Alfred Leblanc 100 hp Blériot XI   Crashed on last lap - FranceHubert Latham Antoinette   5 h 48 m 53 s   - United Kingdom Claude Grahame- White100 hp Blériot XI First  1 h 1 m 4.74 s   -  United Kingdom  Alexander Ogilvie Wright Model R Third  2 h 6 min 36 s,  Time includes a 54-minute stop: Speed without stoppage time Villard 1987 pp. 83-4 - United StatesWalter Brookins Wright \\"Baby Grand\\"   Crashed before starting race. - United States John DrexelBlériot XI   Retired after seven laps - United States John Moisant 50 hp Blériot XI Second 1 h 57 m 44.85 s   - } ===1911=== Charles Weymann standing in front of his Nieuport monoplane The 1911 race was held on 1 July at the Royal Aeronautical Society's flying field at Eastchurch, and attracted a crowd of around 10,000 spectators despite the comparative remoteness to the location. Both France and Britain entered three pilots with three reserves, the British entries including a Bristol Prier monoplane to be flown by Grahame Gilmour, but this was not ready in time to compete. The competition coincided with the Circuit of Europe air race, as a result of which the British pilot James Valentine withdrew: however Charles Weymann, the sole American representative chose to withdraw from the Circuit of Europe to take part in the Gordon Bennett competition. The start of the competition was delayed by poor weather, and the first competitor Gustav Hamel, did not take off until 2:50 in the afternoon. Flying a Blériot XXIII monoplane which had been modified shortly before the race by having its wings cut down by about a metre (39 in), he misjudged his first turn and crashed at high speed, astonishingly escaping without serious injury.Villard 1987, p. 122 At 3:00 Louis Chevalier, flying a Nieuport II powered by a Nieuport engine. After five laps his engine began showing signs of trouble and he was eventually forced to land after eleven laps, damaging his undercarriage. He then resumed his attempt flying a replacement aircraft, but this also suffered an engine failure shortly after takeoff and he was forced to withdraw. Weymann took off at 3:45, impressing spectators by the steepness of his banked turns, shortly followed at 4:47 by Alec Ogilvie, flying the aircraft in which he had finished third the previous year, now powered by a 50 hp N.E.C engine. Last to take off were Edouard Nieuport and Alfred Leblanc. Leblanc was recovering from influenza and, probably made cautious by Hamel's crash, did not take the corners as sharply as Weymann, and Nieuport's aircraft, with a less powerful engine that Weyman's, was clearly not in serious competition. {  - !Width=\\"100pt\\"Nationality !!Width=\\"120pt\\" Pilot!!Width=\\"130pt\\" Aircraft Type !!Width=\\"60pt\\" Position !!Width=\\"100pt\\" Time!!Width=125pt\\" Speed!!Width=\\"300pt\\" Notes - France Alfred Leblanc Blériot XXIII(100 hp Gnome)Second 73 m 40.2 s   - FranceEdouard Nieuport Nieuport II 70 hp GnomeThird74m 37.2s  - FranceLouis ChevalierNieuport II (28 hp.

The film competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival where it won the top prize. The film was also selected as the Mexican entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist. The style of the film has been described as being influenced by Austrian director Michael Haneke. ==Plot== Roberto (Hernán Mendoza) is depressed after his wife Lucía dies in a road accident. He decides to leave Puerto Vallarta and live in Mexico City with his 17-year-old daughter, Alejandra (Tessa Ía González Norvind). Settling into her new school, Alejandra goes to a party one night with her classmates. At the party, she has sex with José, who films the encounter on his phone. The next day the footage has been circulated around the school, with Alejandra getting text messages calling her a slut. This incident provides a reason for the students in the school to bully and sexually harass Alejandra. She does not speak of these incidents of bullying or sexual harassment to anyone. The school organises a trip to Veracruz which all the students must attend. At the resort, each room has to be shared in groups of four. Alejandra is bullied again into going into the shower by her female roommates. They then block the door of the bathroom from outside, thus locking her in. At night, the rest of the students enjoy a party in the main room. The boys in the room take turns and rape her. Alejandra is helpless in the locked bathroom with the bullies in the room drinking while she is being raped. The students then all go to the beach to continue the party. When the party ends, Alejandra is asleep on the beach as one of the male students urinates on her. One of the female students suggests she should go into the sea to wash herself. The rest of them join her and they have fun in the water. Alejandra disappears from the group and the rest of them become anxious about what repercussions now might happen. The next morning, the teachers discover that Alejandra is missing and alert her father. He discovers what has been going on with the bullying and is frustrated when the police cannot help him, as the crimes have been committed by minors. Unbeknown to everyone, Alejandra is in fact safe and enters a building to sleep. Meanwhile, her father follows a car driven by José's father and he kidnaps José after his father has parked his car. He ties his hands behind his back and gags him. He drives to the coast where he hires a boat and takes José out to sea where he throws him overboard, before starting the engine again and continuing to ride in the sea. ==Cast== * Tessa Ía González Norvind as Alejandra * Hernán Mendoza as Roberto * Gonzalo Vega Sisto as José * Tamara Yazbek Bernal as Tamara * Paloma Cervantes as Irene * Juan Carlos Barranco as Manuel * Francisco Rueda as Javier * Diego Canales ==Accolades== {  - !

It was classed as a historic monument in the list of 1840. Eglise de la Basse- Oeuvre It is the west end remnant of a much longer church which had been Beauvais' cathedral. It was built in the form of a Roman basilica, a style which still characterized the Carolingian era. The 21 archaeological digs of Émile Chami highlighted this monument. ==History== The Basse Oeuvre with the newer cathedral behind The Basse Oeuvre (so named since the thirteenth century only) was dedicated to St. Peter, the Virgin and St. John the Baptist when it was built in the second half of the tenth century. Few sources allow an exact dating of the building. A text taken from an obituary in the cathedral dating from about 1635, indicate as master of works its bishop, who died in 998 AD. However, Emile Shami based his opinion on another anonymous manuscript source of the 17th century and offered as dating the time of Bishop Hugh, the predecessor of Hervé. Excavations and stratigraphic record support this second hypothesis. Several fires over the centuries have ravaged the church, including two at the end of the eleventh century, one in the late twelfth century, and another in the early twelfth century. These fires caused premature aging of the monument. After the 1225 fire, the Basse Oeuvre's east end was cut off for construction of the new cathedral's chancel, completed in 1272. In 1510, more of its east end was cut off, during building of the Gothic transept of the new cathedral, destroying the remains of the old Carolingian transept, and its nave's three eastern bays. Finally, in the 16th century and early 17th century, three more bays were sacrificed to make room for two buttresses that support the west side of the transept of the architect Martin Chambiges. The building was restored in 1864 to 1867, but this restoration is often deemed too severe on the south side by art historians. The north side was free from restoration, overlooking the cloister of the bishopric, whose west wing is dated to the eleventh century. The small device in re-used stone came from the ancient Gallic ramparts of the city. The wall window keystones are alternately bricks and tiles. Excavations showed a rebuilding of the facade of the Basse Oeuvre and additions resulting from fires in the eleventh century. The present facade is not the original facade of the building. == Bibliography == *Carol Heitz, France pré-romane, éd.

It is estimated that 800–900 people were killed in a single day. Rape and plunder were also carried out, and mosques, temples, schools and houses were set on fire. == Background == When the Pakistani occupation army spread out from Dhaka towards the districts as a part of the Operation Searchlight, the people began to flee their homes. The Hindus began to flee Bangladesh and take refuge in neighbouring India. On their way they had taken shelter in the remote village of Baushgari in Demra union. == Events == The Pakistani occupation army, led by the local collaborators entered the area through the Boral river and then cordoned off the Baushgari and Rupsi villages. One collaborator named Asad led the Pakistani troops to the Baushgari village. In the nightfall, the men were dragged out of their houses and made to stand in a line, while the women were raped in front of them by the Pakistani troops with the help of the collaborators. After that both the men and women were shot to death and their houses were set on fire. A few survivors interred the charred remains of the bodies in a mass grave the next morning. Around 350 Hindus were killed in Baushgari village. == Investigation == An 11-member team from the International Crimes Tribunal investigated the Demra massacre in 2010. The team was led by Sayed Rejaur Rahman, one of the prosecutors of the tribunal. The investigators visited the killing spots in Baushgari village and interviewed the witnesses to the war crimes.

It stands in the eastern side of Prešeren Square, in front of the Central Pharmacy Building in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. It is among the best-known Slovenian monuments. ==Statue== Detail of the statue of Prešeren Sculpture of the muse The statue that stands on a pedestal includes a sculpture of the poet, facing the window where his adored Julija Primic used to live, and a sculpture of a Muse above him sitting on a rock and holding a laurel branch in her hand. The poet is dressed in the outfit of the period and holds a book symbolising his Poems (). The sculpture of Prešeren is high, and the entire monument is high. There is a small statue on the building that Prešeren faces, as well. ==Pedestal== Farewell, relief by Ivan Zajec on the pedestal of the Prešeren Monument The pedestal of Prešeren's statue is made of Pohorje tonalite and has three steps. Above it, there is a cut rock block with the inscription \\"Prešeren\\". The lighter base of the muse is made of Tyrolian granite. It was made by the stonemason Alojzij Vodnik per a design by Max Fabiani, who based his work on a concept by Ivan Zajec. A letter about the erection of the monument and some coins have been built into the pedestal. There are two bronze reliefs on the lower part of the pedestal, depicting scenes from Prešeren's Poems. The right one, titled Farewell () or Črtomir and Bogomila (), depicts a scene from the poem The Baptism on the Savica. The left one, titled Fisherman (), depicts a scene from the poem Fisherman. The reliefs on the pedestal were created by Zajec. They have a Classicist composition, a Realist cadre, an impressionist final touch, and emphasise Prešeren's Romantic poetry with its content. The upper part of the pedestal is decorated with a stylised lime tree, reminding of the poet's homeland's symbol. ==HistoryCreation and unveiling=== Celebration ahead of the unveiling of the monument The idea for the Prešeren monument was first proposed by a group of grammar school students in 1889. In 1891, it was supported by 52 Slovene scholars, and finally, in 1898, by Ljubljana mayor Ivan Hribar. He also organised a board for this purpose. Hribar announced a competition in 1899. Seven sculptors submitted their proposals in time, among them , , , Alojzij Progar, and finally Ivan Zajec, who won it. He received the commission on 18 October 1900. Zajec started his work in the studio of Hans Makart in Vienna. The model for Prešeren was Prešeren's portrait by Goldenstein, and he depicted the suit of Prešeren after a model from 1830–1840, borrowed in a Vienna museum. The model for the muse was Olimpia Pozatti, a dancer from Trieste. The monument of Prešeren was cast in foundry in Vienna (Kaiserlich Königliche Kunst-Erzgießerei) in September 1903, and the muse was cast in the beginning of 1904. The costs for the entire monument were around 71,000 kronen, largely raised by Slovene women and various societies. The monument was ceremonially unveiled on 10 September 1905. Over 20,000 people were present. The ceremonial speech was read by Ivan Tavčar. A biography of Prešeren with some of his poems was published by on the occasion. ==References== Category:Monuments and memorials in Ljubljana Category:1905 sculptures Monument Category:Center District, Ljubljana Category:Art Nouveau sculptures and memorials Category:Art Nouveau architecture in Ljubljana Category:Max Fabiani buildings Category:Statues of writers Category:Sculptures of men ","title":"Prešeren Monument (Ljubljana)"},{"id":"35880278","text":"John Smith (12 July 1834 – date of death unknown) was an English cricketer.

The length of its interface from the south is about 114 metres, while its southern interface extends over 112.5 metres. The structure was near the monuments of ancient bath of Siba. ==History== The history of Siba castle goes back to the Sassanid era (226–651 CE). It was the center of government of that area. It acted as fortified military base for some time and was surrounded by a huge trench for protection. A trench was an ancient defensive strategic feature to defend the cities, castles and the forts in Persia before Islamic era. This gigantic structure was considered a traditional defensive ancient landmark like other landmarks at that time such as huge city gates, cellars, security tunnels and underground military storages. The Castle of Siba was maintained until 1163-1192. Unfortunately it was destroyed by an earthquake in Kukherd and then by a flood in 1367 which destroyed the rest of the castle. *Bastak *Bandar Lengeh *Hormozgān *Castle *AL madani *Paraw Kukherd *The Historic Bath of Siba *Sassanid family tree — of the Sasanian (Sassanid) dynasty == References == * :ar: قلعة سيبة Arabic Wikipedia. * :fa: قلعه سیبه Persian Wikipedia. *2. الكوخردى ، محمد ، بن يوسف، (كُوخِرد حَاضِرَة اِسلامِيةَ عَلي ضِفافِ نَهر مِهران) الطبعة الثالثة ،دبى: سنة 199۷ للميلاد **Mohammed Kookherdi (1997) Kookherd, an Islamic civil at Mehran river, third edition: Dubai *3. محمدیان، کوخری، محمد ، “ (به یاد کوخرد) “، ج1. ج2. چاپ اول، دبی: سال انتشار 2003 میلادی Mohammed Kookherdi Mohammadyan (2003), Beyade Kookherd, third edition : Dubai. *4.محمدیان، کوخردی ، محمد ، «شهرستان بستک و بخش کوخرد» ، ج۱. چاپ اول، دبی: سال انتشار ۲۰۰۵ میلادی Mohammed Kookherdi Mohammadyan (2005), Shahrestan Bastak & Bakhshe Kookherd, First edition : Dubai. *5.

And its effects could have been mitigated by a more effective human response.\\" \\"Governments, regulatory authorities and Tokyo Electric Power [TEPCO] lacked a sense of responsibility to protect people's lives and society,\\" the Diet's Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission said. \\"They effectively betrayed the nation's right to be safe from nuclear accidents. Therefore, we conclude that the accident was clearly 'man-made',\\" it said. The nuclear incident was the result of poor earthquake-safety planning and faulty post- tsunami communication. As a result of collusion between the facility's operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), regulators and the Japanese government the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant unfolded as a \\"man-made disaster\\". The report attributed the cause of the failings to Japan's culture of \\"reflexive obedience\\", noted that there was no separation between atomic regulation and promotion and described a Japan in which nuclear power became \\"an unstoppable force, immune to scrutiny by civil society.\\" TEPCO, regulators and the government \\"failed to correctly develop the most basic safety requirements -- such as assessing the probability of damage, preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster, and developing evacuation plans,\\" the NAIIC said. According to the report the lack of training and knowledge of the TEPCO workers at the facility reduced the effectiveness of the response to the situation at a critical time following the quake and tsunami. As the crisis escalated, TEPCO, the regulators, government agencies and the prime minister's office were ineffective in \\"preventing or limiting the consequential damage\\" at Fukushima Daiichi. \\"According to this commission's study, on March 11, it is believed that the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was in a vulnerable condition with no guarantee it could withstand earthquakes and tsunamis,\\" the report said. The government and plant operator TEPCO have been unwilling to say the reactors could have been damaged by the initial earthquake. An earlier report by TEPCO had all but cleared the huge utility, saying the size of the earthquake and tsunami was beyond all expectations and could not reasonably have been foreseen. But the report of the commission said: \\"Despite having a number of opportunities to take measures, regulatory agencies and TEPCO management deliberately postponed decisions, did not take action or took decisions that were convenient for themselves.\\" It also said that had the company had its way, its staff would have been evacuated from the crippled plant and the catastrophe could have spiralled even further out of control. According to the New York Times the report criticized Tepco as being too quick to dismiss earthquake damage as a cause of the fuel meltdowns at three of the plant's six reactors, which overheated when the site lost power. Tepco has contended that the plant withstood the earthquake that rocked eastern Japan, instead placing blame for the disaster on what some experts have called a “once in a millennium” tsunami that followed. Such a rare calamity was beyond the scope of contingency planning, Tepco executives have suggested, and was unlikely to pose a threat to Japan's other nuclear reactors in the foreseeable future. The parliamentary report suggests according to the New York Times that Reactor No. 1, in particular, might have suffered earthquake damage, including the possibility that pipes burst from the shaking, leading to a loss of coolant even before the tsunami hit the plant about 30 minutes after the initial earthquake. The report emphasized that a full assessment would require better access to the inner workings of the reactors, which may not be possible for years. “However,” the report said, “it is impossible to limit the direct cause of the accident to the tsunami without substantive evidence. The commission believes that this is an attempt to avoid responsibility by putting all the blame on the unexpected (the tsunami),” the report continued, adding, “and not on the more foreseeable quake.” The commission accused the Japanese government, Tepco and nuclear regulators of failing to carry out basic safety measures despite being aware of the risks posed by earthquakes, tsunamis and other events that might cut off power systems. Even though the government- appointed Nuclear Safety Commission revised earthquake resistance standards in 2006 and ordered nuclear operators around the country to inspect their reactors, for example, Tepco did not carry out any checks, and regulators did not follow up, the report said. Tepco “manipulated its cozy relationship with regulators to take the teeth out of regulations,” the report said. Nuclear power plants should have been made more quake-proof, but Japan's nuclear bloc, while reassuring the nation about its safe atomic plants, ignored safeguards that would have helped strengthen the Fukushima facility against a massive, but foreseeable earthquake. The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) did not press Tepco to prepare for a so-called full station blackout — the loss of main and backup power — because the “probability was small.” NISA instead asked Tepco to explain why new prevention measures would not be necessary. Regulators and nuclear operators went to painstaking lengths to ignore safety risks at the plant or cover them up. They disregarded earlier warnings from outside watchdog groups that earthquakes posed a significant safety risk to the nuclear plants, and by doing so they “effectively betrayed the nation’s right to be safe from nuclear accidents.” The report said \\"it is considered that TEPCO management knew about delays in anti-quake works and postponement of tsunami measures and were aware that the Fukushima Daiichi was vulnerable\\". TEPCO also failed to act promptly, the panel concluded, but added: \\"This should not be attributed to individuals … at the plant but the structural problems of TEPCO.\\" The NAIIC blamed lax safety measures on what it called the country's powerful and “collusive” decision-makers and on a conformist culture that allowed them to operate with little scrutiny. “What must be admitted — very painfully — is that this was a disaster ‘Made in Japan,’” investigation chairman Kiyoshi Kurokawa wrote in the introduction to the report. “Its fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to ‘sticking with the program’; our groupism; and our insularity.” Chain of command were disrupted amid the crisis which created confusion, while communication failures about critical decisions undermined trust between the different parties. The prime minister’s office waited too long to declare a state of emergency. TEPCO’s disaster-response manuals were out of date, missed key diagrams, while TEPCO was too slow to relay information to the government. The administration of then prime minister Naoto Kan hampered operations as the disaster unfolded, the report said, and did not use a logical chain of command. \\"The prime minister's office was supposed to contact the plant operator through an on-the-spot task force. But … issued direct instructions to TEPCO head office and the accident site, confusing the command line.\\" Then-Prime Minister Naoto Kan traveled to the plant mid-meltdown and “diverted the attention and time of the on-site operational staff and confused the line of command,” the report said. “Had the head office of Tepco actively communicated the on-site situation from the start, and explained the severity of the situation to the other parties,” the report said, “there is a possibility that the distrust — and the confusion in the chain of command that followed — could have been prevented.” ==Commission Recommendations== The NAIIC made a series of recommendations to try to avoid a repeat of the catastrophe. Japan needs to overhaul its nuclear regulation system by creating an independent watchdog, because the nuclear safety agency was a part of the same government ministry that promoted nuclear power. The commission recommended that the Diet establish a permanent, parliamentary oversight panel to deal with nuclear power and supervise regulators and to ensure that the government and utilities carry out the necessary measures to prevent any recurrence of the Fukushima disaster. A \\"fundamental re- examination of the crisis management system\\" was suggested. The report also called for measures tackling public health and welfare issues, including the establishment of a system \\"to deal with long-term public health effects,\\" monitoring \\"hot spots\\" and \\"the spread of radioactive contamination\\", and for starting \\"a detailed and transparent program of decontamination and relocation.\\" In addition a system of independent investigation commissions dealing with nuclear issues should be developed. The findings published by NAIIC call for further investigation of the impact of the 9.0 magnitude earthquake - as opposed to the towering tsunami - on the reactors at Fukushima. The report also urged the government to set clear disclosure rules about its relationship with nuclear operators. Suggesting that the mind-set that supported the negligence at Fukushima \\"can be found across Japan,\\" Kurokawa also urged citizens to \\"reflect on our responsibility as individuals in a democratic society.\\" The BBC summarised the recommendations of the NAICC as followed: * Permanent committee in National Diet to oversee the regulators, with regular investigations and hearings * Reform of the crisis management system, making boundaries between responsibilities of local and national governments and the operators clear, and establishing clear chain of command in emergency situations * Establishment of system to deal with long-term public health effects, including monitoring and decontaminating radiation- affected areas * Dramatic corporate reform of Tepco and new relationships established among the electric power companies built on safety issues, mutual supervision and transparency * New regulatory body established on independence, transparency, professionalism, and consolidation of functions * Reform of laws related to nuclear energy to meet global standards of safety, public health and welfare * Develop a system of independent investigation commissions == See also == * Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company ==References External links == * Official artchival site at National Diet Library * Executive summary and Main report of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission Report * Fukushima report: Key points in nuclear disaster report - An outline of key quotes, findings and recommendations from the 88-page executive summary of the Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission's report, as provided by the BBC, 5 July 2012 Category:Nuclear energy in Japan Category:Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster ","title":"National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission"},{"id":"35880589","text":"The Cape Town International Challenge was an international tournament which took place in April 2010.

On 22 February 1862, the line was extended to Oberlahnstein and it became a through station. The entrance building is built in a single style that was prevalent at the time with the entrance hall and function rooms on the ground floor and the stationmaster's accommodation on the first floor above. The stucco facade with a simple series of windows is built in the style of neoclassical architecture that was used for Prussian government buildings. Apart from Rüdesheim, the only buildings built purely in form of this architecture left in the Middle Rhine Valley are at the stations of Oberwesel and Bacharach on the West Rhine Railway. Rüdesheim station ===Current situation=== In 2002, the very rundown station buildings were acquired by the Heil brothers of Rüdesheim and completely renovated and refurbished. In addition to the entrance building, the complex includes a freight shed and an office building, all of which are heritage listed. In 2007, its private owners were given a Hessian heritage prize for its exemplary restoration. The station has been restored as the representative entrance building in the city of Rüdesheim, as it was originally built. ==Rail servicesRegional=== Rüdesheim (Rhein) station is served by the Regionalbahn service RB 10 (RheingauLinie) of the Rhein-Main- Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main Transport Association, RMV) operated hourly and, during peak hours, every half-hour. {  - class=\\"hintergrundfarbe6\\" !

Only during construction work or other obstruction of the West Rhine Railway have diverted long-distance trains stopped here. The only exception that in 2012, Rüdesheim station is served by only one long-distance service from 9 September to 21 October. This is also the only service that runs only on the east-bank line and not via Koblenz Hauptbahnhof. {  - class=\\"hintergrundfarbe6\\" ! Line ! Route !

It was officially opened in the Darling Quarter Precinct in Sydney Central Business District (CBD) on 18 May 2012. Luminous at Darling Quarter is a permanent platform solely for illuminated digital 'art' – both animated and static. The 'canvas' extends over four levels of two campus-style buildings, covering 557 windows in total, and presents a digital façade spanning a distance of 150 metres. The artistic and design direction was set by international light artist Bruce Ramus, with Ramus studio responsible for design management and production of the work. Fixtures were manufactured by Australian architectural lighting specialists Klik Systems using advanced LED systems. ==Interactive== Interactive technology by iion, in collaboration with Ramus Illumination, activates the canvas and gives Luminous a social/web presence Interactive content is available from 6pm, Friday through Sunday, with touch screen kiosks in Tumbalong Park allowing the general public to paint their own digital designs and play over-scaled arcade games on the buildings in front of them. Web surfers can also play using their smart phone or contribute on their computer through a dedicated website. The online component of Luminous has similarities to Project Blinkenlights, a Berlin digital light installation, but expands the concept for the general public, allowing user-friendly interaction in an unprecedented way. ==Luminous concept== The Commonwealth Bank of Australia occupying the buildings is joint partner in the project along with the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority and Lend Lease. The consortium selected Bruce Ramus as the first artist, Artistic Director and Lighting Designer for Luminous. Canadian-born Ramus made his name lighting stage shows for U2 and David Bowie, and is design mentor for Sydney Opera House. ==Technology== At Darling Quarter, each window forms a 'pixel' in the canvas, lit with Klik Systems's energy efficient LEDs, and seen from a distance can form a coherent animated picture. A sophisticated colour palette is available thanks to white LEDs added to the standard RGB (red, green, blue) colours. The system is also capable of integrating music: graphic synchronization allows for sound-based designs to be visualized on the canvas. Contrary to many light installations, direct light is minimized to viewers, instead using the automated timber louvers to reflect light from Klik System's linear LEDs (running along the windowsills, angled upwards with a 10-degree spreader lens). The entire project offsets almost all its energy use, thanks to photo-voltaic panels on the roof of both Darling Quarter buildings. The project allegedly uses the same power as 5 household vacuum cleaners. ==Darling Quarter== Lend Lease designed and constructed Darling Quarter for owner APPF Commercial and first proposed the idea of a permanent space for illuminated art. Darling Quarter precinct includes a community green, children’s playground, and a large number of world-food restaurants, cafes and bars, and reflects Lend Lease’s enthusiasm for iconic new spaces for future generations. The digital façade is in action six evenings a week. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, displaying ‘soft’ images (such as clouds or waves). On Friday, Saturday and Sunday 'Luminous' displays interactive artworks that aim to invite debate and make art critics – and artists - of every citizen and visitor. Sydney has a growing reputation for light shows, particularly due to the annual VIVID Sydney festival and the SPARC DESIGN lighting conferences at the Museum of Modern Art, which are regularly sponsored by Klik Systems and other long term supporters in the Australian lighting industry. Vivid Sydney was inaugurated in 2008, curated in 2010 by Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed and is billed as an international carbon-neutral festival of Light, Music and Ideas. The 2012 musical line-up includes Sufjan Stevens and Florence & The Machine. ==References *Designboom *Artdaily *WSJ Life & Style *Treehugger Living/Culture *Guardian on Vivid Sydney *Go Australia *Klik Systems *Ramus Illumination *iion Ltd *Lend Lease *Darling Quarter Official Website Category:Arts in Australia Category:Digital technology Category:Architectural lighting design Category:Buildings and structures in Sydney ","title":"Luminous at Darling Quarter"},{"id":"35880651","text":"Cylindropuntia spinosior, with the common names include cane cholla, spiny cholla and walkingstick cactus, is a cactus species of the North American deserts.

A standout athlete at Wofford College in South Carolina, Carpenter's abilities on the football field attracted the attention of the Baltimore Colts during his senior year in 1957, and the team offered him an opportunity to play professional football on the same team as legendary quarterback Johnny Unitas. After talking to his family and his minister, Carpenter turned them down. The next year, the Colts won the Western Conference championship and went on to defeat the New York Giants in the first overtime game in National Football League history, often referred to as the \\"greatest game ever played\\". Carpenter went on to a career in medicine, devoting a 50-plus-year career to the understanding and treatment of severe mental illness. ==Medical career== Carpenter obtained his M.D. degree from the Wake Forest University School of Medicine. After an internship at the North Carolina Baptist Hospital, he took postgraduate training at the University of Rochester Medical Center.

In 1966, Carpenter took a psychiatric researcher position at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in Bethesda, Maryland, where he studied the psychobiology of affective disorders. Following that, he became a collaborating investigator in the World Health Organization's International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia. At the WHO study, Carpenter developed his interest in schizophrenia research, studying prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes. He continued his work at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Columbia University in New York City before joining the faculty of the University of Maryland School of Medicine in 1977 as professor of psychiatry and director of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center. Carpenter has served as Editor-in-Chief for Schizophrenia Bulletin and on the editorial boards of the Archives of General Psychiatry, Biological Psychiatry, the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, Neuropsychopharmacology, Psychiatry Research, Schizophrenia Bulletin, Schizophrenia Research, Current Psychiatry Reports, and the CD-ROM version of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology publication Neuropsychopharmacology: Fourth Generation of Progress.

Kingdom of Plants 3D is Attenborough's first 3D television series, and follows his two earlier films in the format; Flying Monsters 3D (2010) and The Penguin King 3D (2011). The same production team went on to produce Galapagos 3D, broadcast in 2013. A companion iPad app to the series was released on 23 May 2012, using video and imagery from the series to provide a virtual tour of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Of the app, Attenborough commented \\"You can swipe your finger across the tablet to make a plant flower and, not only that, put it back again; it’s quite fun.\\" ==Episodes== {  !No. !Title !Original air date (UK) - 1 \\"Life in the Wet Zone\\" 26 May 2012 - 2 \\"Solving the Secrets\\" 2 June 2012 - 3 \\"Survival\\" 9 June 2012 } ==References * Official Sky website for Kingdom of Plants 3D * Kew Gardens press release * Category:3D television shows Category:Documentary films about nature Category:2012 British television series debuts Category:2012 British television series endings Category:2010s British television series Category:British documentary television series Category:Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Category:Sky UK original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:3D documentary films ","title":"Kingdom of Plants 3D"},{"id":"35880758","text":"Alfred James Brooks (24 March 1846 – 20 November 1911) was an English cricketer. Brooks was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast-medium. He was born at Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. Brooks made two first- class appearances for Nottinghamshire in 1877, both against Surrey. In his first match at Trent Bridge, Nottinghamshire won the toss and elected to bat first, making 150 all out, with Brooks scoring 6 runs before he was dismissed by James Southerton. In response, Surrey made 103 all out in their first- innings, with Brooks taking the wickets of George Elliott and Allen Chandler to finish with figures of 2/10 from twelve overs. Responding in their second- innings, Nottinghamshire made 120 all out, with Brooks being dismissed for 3 runs by George Strachan. In their second-innings, Surrey made 149 all out, with Brooks taking the wickets of Harry Jupp and Chandler, to finish with figures of 2/30 from 26.1 overs. Nottinghamshire won the match by 18 runs. In the return fixture at The Oval, Surrey won the toss and elected to bat, making 250 all out in their first-innings, during which Brooks took the wicket of George Jones to finish with figures of 1/45 from 32.1 overs. Nottinghamshire could then only manage just 97 all out in their first-innings, with him ending the innings not out on 1. Forced to follow-on in their second-innings, Nottinghamshire were dismissed for 247, with Brooks himself dismissed for a duck by Ted Barratt. Requiring 95 for victory, Surrey reached their target with three wickets to spare. He died at the town of his birth on 20 November 1911. ==References *Alfred Brooks at ESPNcricinfo *Alfred Brooks at CricketArchive Category:1846 births Category:1911 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Sutton-in-Ashfield Category:English cricketers Category:Nottinghamshire cricketers ","title":"Alfred Brooks (cricketer)"},{"id":"35880769","text":"Suba Singh was One of the Three Sikhs who ruled Lahore city with its Governor of Punjab Lehna Singh Majithia Installed by Pashtun King Amir Ahmad Shah Abdali 1747–1772 of Afghanistan Durrani Known as Kings of Kings first crossed the Indus River in 1748, the year after his ascension – his forces sacked and absorbed Lahore during that expedition. The following year (1749), the Mughal ruler was induced to cede Sindh Delhi, Vrndavana Mathura and Kashmir and all of the Punjab including the vital trans Indus River to Afghan Pashtun forces of the DurraniEmpire.

The Lahore Fort and the Walled Lahore City and its gates went to Lehna Singh Majithia. He was, for formal purposes, the Governor of Lahore, and was so recognized. To Suba Singh went the area to the south of the Walled Lahore City, and he resided in the garden of Zubaida Begum in Nawankot, where he built a small fort for himself. The area between Amritsar and Lahore, or more correctly between the Shalamar Gardens and Lahore, went to Gujjar Singh Banghi. Gujjar Singh Banghierected that part of the city, then a jungle and invited people to settle there. He also dug wells to supply water. A mosque was also built for the Muslims in the area. He also built himself a small fort called Qila Gujar Singh. Today, a few walls of that old fort can be seen in a street between today’s Nicholson Road and Empress Road, and the area is still called Qila Gujar Singh. On a final note, their rule of ended when Ranjit Singh besieged the Lahore Fort in 1799 and the three chieftains Lehna Singh Majithia, Gujjar Singh Banghi and Suba Singh fled, leaving the city firmly in the hands of the young man from Gujranwala Ranjit Singh. == Sources == A history of the Sikhs by Kushwant Singh Category:Indian Sikhs Category:People of the Sikh Empire ","title":"Suba Singh"},{"id":"35880798","text":"Fritz Greiner (1879–1933) was an Austrian film actor. ==Selected filmography== * The Hunter of Fall (1918) * The Monastery's Hunter (1920) * The War of the Oxen (1920) * Storms in May (1920) * Der Überfall auf den Europa-Express (1921) * Nathan the Wise (1922) * The Woman from the Orient (1923) * The Emperor's Old Clothes (1923) * The Way to the Light (1923) * Two Children (1924) * To a Woman of Honour (1924) * Zigano (1925) * Goetz von Berlichingen of the Iron Hand (1925) * Adventure on the Night Express (1925) * What the Stones Tell (1925) * Wallenstein (1925) * The Eleven Schill Officers (1926) * The Schimeck Family (1926) * Vienna, How it Cries and Laughs (1926) * Circus Romanelli (1926) *The Black Pierrot (1926) * Our Emden (1926) * The Fallen (1926) * His Greatest Bluff (1927) * Klettermaxe (1927) * Doña Juana (1927) * Modern Pirates (1928) * The Criminal of the Century (1928) * Hurrah!

This transform is proposed in order to rectify the limitations of the WT and the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT). The FRWT inherits the advantages of multiresolution analysis of the WT and has the capability of signal representations in the fractional domain which is similar to the FRFT. ==Definition== The fractional Fourier transform (FRFT)H. M. Ozaktas, Z. Zalevsky, and M. A. Kutay, The Fractional Fourier Transform with Applications in Optics and Signal Processing. Wiley, New York, 2000.，a generalization of the Fourier transform (FT), serves a useful and powerful analyzing toolE. Sejdic, I. Djurovic, and L. Stankovic, \\"Fractional Fourier transform as a signal processing tool: An overview of recent developments,\\" Signal Process., vol. 91, pp. 1351--1369, 2011. in optics, communications, signal and image processing, etc. This transform, however, has one major drawback due to using global kernel, i.e., the fractional Fourier representation only provides such FRFT spectral content with no indication about the time localization of the FRFT spectral components. Therefore, the analysis of non-stationary signals whose FRFT spectral characteristics change with time requires joint signal representations in both time and FRFT domains, rather than just a FRFT-domain representation. The first modification to the FRFT to allow analysis of aforementioned non-stationary signals came as the short-time FRFT (STFRFT).L. Stankovic, T. Alieva, and M. J. Bastiaans, \\"Time- frequency signal analysis based on the windowed fractional Fourier transform,\\"Signal Process., vol. 83, pp. 2459--2468, 2003.R. Tao, Y. Lei, and Y. Wang, \\"Short-time fractional Fourier transform and its applications,\\" IEEE Trans. Signal Process., vol. 58, pp. 2568--2580, 2010. The idea behind the STFRFT was segmenting the signal by using a time-localized window, and performing FRFT spectral analysis for each segment. Since the FRFT was computed for every windowed segment of the signal, the STFRFT was able to provide a true joint signal representation in both time and FRFT domains. However, the drawback is that the STFRFT has the limitation of a fixed window width which needs to be fixed a priori; this effectively means that it does not provide the requisite good resolution in both time and FRFT domains. In other words, the efficiency of the STFRFT techniques is limited by the fundamental uncertainty principle,J. Shi, X.-P. Liu, and N.-T. Zhang, \\"On uncertainty principle for signal concentrations with fractional Fourier transform,\\" Signal Process., vol. 92, pp. 2830--2836, 2012. which implies that narrow windows produce good time resolution but poor spectral resolution, whereas wide windows provide good spectral resolution but poor time resolution. Most of the signals of practical interest are such that they have high spectral components for short durations and low spectral components for long durations. As a generalization of the wavelet transform, Mendlovic and DavidD. Mendlovic, Z. Zalevsky, D. Mas, J. Garcia, and C. Ferreira, \\"Fractional wavelet transform,\\" Appl. Opt., vol. 36, pp. 4801--4806, 1997. first introduced the fractional wavelet transform (FRWT) as a way to deal with optical signals, which was defined as a cascade of the FRFT and the ordinary wavelet transform (WT), i.e., : \\\\begin{align} W^{\\\\alpha}(a,b)&=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{a}}\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\mathbb{R}}\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\mathbb{R}}{\\\\mathcal K}_\\\\alpha(u,t)f(t)\\\\psi^{\\\\ast}\\\\left(\\\\frac{u-b}{a}\\\\right)dtdu\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{a}}\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\mathbb{R}}\\\\left(\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\mathbb{R}}f(t){\\\\mathcal K}_\\\\alpha(u,t)dt\\\\right)\\\\psi^{\\\\ast}\\\\left(\\\\frac{u-b}{a}\\\\right)du\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{a}}\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\mathbb{R}}F_{\\\\alpha}(u)\\\\psi^{\\\\ast}\\\\left(\\\\frac{u-b}{a}\\\\right)du\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where the transform kernel \\\\mathcal{K}_{\\\\alpha}(u,t) is given by : \\\\mathcal{K}_{\\\\alpha}(u,t)= \\\\begin{cases} A_{\\\\alpha}e^{j\\\\frac{u^2+t^2}{2}\\\\cot\\\\alpha-jut\\\\csc\\\\alpha},&\\\\alpha eq k\\\\pi\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\delta(t-u),&\\\\alpha = 2k\\\\pi \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\delta(t+u),&\\\\alpha = (2k-1)\\\\pi \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{cases} where A_\\\\alpha=\\\\sqrt{{(1-j\\\\cot\\\\alpha)}/{2\\\\pi}}, and F_{\\\\alpha}(u) denotes the FRFT of f(t). But it could not be regarded as a kind of joint time-FRFT-domain representation since time information is lost in this transform. Moreover, Prasad and MahatoA. Prasad and A. Mahato, \\"The fractional wavelet transform on spaces of type S,\\" Integral Transform Spec. Funct., vol. 23, no. 4, pp. 237--249, 2012. expressed the ordinary WT of a signal in terms of the FRFTs of the signal and mother wavelet, and also called the expression the FRWT. That is, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\left(W_{\\\\psi}^{\\\\alpha}f\\\\right)(b,a)&=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{a}}\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\mathbb{R}}f(t)\\\\psi^{\\\\ast}\\\\left(\\\\frac{t-b}{a}\\\\right)dt\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\frac{\\\\csc\\\\alpha}{4\\\\pi^2}\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\mathbb{R}}F(u\\\\sin\\\\alpha)\\\\Psi^{\\\\ast}(au\\\\sin\\\\alpha)e^{j\\\\frac{u^2}{4}(1-a^2)\\\\sin2\\\\alpha- jbu}du\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where F(u\\\\sin\\\\alpha) and \\\\Psi(u\\\\sin\\\\alpha) denote the FTs (with their arguments scaled by \\\\sin\\\\alpha) f(t) and \\\\psi(t), respectively. Clearly, this so-called FRWT is identical to the ordinary WT. Recently, Shi et al. proposed a new definition of the FRWT by introducing a new structure of the fractional convolution associated with the FRFT. Specifically, the FRWT of any function f(t)\\\\in L^{2}(\\\\mathbb{R}) is defined as [8] : W_{f}^{\\\\alpha}(a,b)=\\\\mathcal{W}^{\\\\alpha}[f(t)](a,b)=\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\mathbb{R}} f(t)\\\\psi_{\\\\alpha,a,b}^{\\\\ast}(t)\\\\, dt where \\\\psi_{\\\\alpha,a,b}(t) is a continuous affine transformation and chirp modulation of the mother wavelet \\\\psi(t), i.e., : \\\\psi_{\\\\alpha,a,b}(t)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{a}}\\\\psi\\\\left(\\\\frac{t-b}{a}\\\\right)e^{-j\\\\frac{t^2-b^2}{2}\\\\cot\\\\alpha} in which a\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R^+} and b\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} are scaling and translation parameters, respectively. Conversely, the inverse FRWT is given by : f(t)=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi C_{\\\\psi}}\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\mathbb{R}}\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\mathbb{R}^{+}}W_{f}^{\\\\alpha}(a,b)\\\\psi_{\\\\alpha,a,b}(t)\\\\frac{da}{a^2}db where C_{\\\\psi} is a constant that depends on the wavelet used. The success of the reconstruction depends on this constant called, the admissibility constant, to satisfy the following admissibility condition: : C_{\\\\psi}=\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\mathbb{R}}{\\\\frac{\\\\Psi(\\\\Omega)^2}{\\\\Omega}}\\\\,d\\\\Omega<\\\\infty where \\\\Psi(\\\\Omega) denotes the FT of \\\\psi(t). The admissibility condition implies that \\\\Psi(0)=0, which is \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}}\\\\psi(t)dt=0. Consequently, continuous fractional wavelets must oscillate and behave as bandpass filters in the fractional Fourier domain. From this viewpoint, the FRWT of f(t) can be expressed in terms of the FRFT-domain representation as : W_{f}^{\\\\alpha}(a,b)=\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\mathbb{R}}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi a}F_{\\\\alpha}(u)\\\\Psi^{\\\\ast}(au\\\\csc\\\\alpha)}\\\\mathcal{K}^{\\\\ast}_{\\\\alpha}(u,b)du where F_{\\\\alpha}(u) indicates the FRFT of f(t), and \\\\Psi(u\\\\csc\\\\alpha) denotes the FT (with its argument scaled by \\\\csc\\\\alpha) of \\\\psi(t). Note that when \\\\alpha={\\\\pi}/{2}, the FRWT reduces to the classical WT. For more details of this type of the FRWT, see [8] and.L. Debnath and F. A.

The Medieval walls were replaced with a series of bastions in the 17th century. In the 19th century, the walls were torn down and replaced with the Defence Line of Amsterdam (Stelling van Amsterdam), a fortification line which encircled Amsterdam at a distance from the city. Remains of the Medieval and 17th- century defenses include the former city gates Waag and Munttoren, as well as the defensive tower Schreierstoren and the watchtower Montelbaanstoren. == History  Earthen walls === Around the year 1300, an earthen wall had been erected behind the Nieuwendijk dike. Traces of this wall were discovered during archeological excavations around Nieuwezijds Kolk in 1994. Following the in 1303, Count William III of Holland withdrew the privilege of Amsterdam to have defenses, forcing the town to remove the wall.Ernest Kurpershoek, \\"De laatste stadswal van Amsterdam: Oude muur niet bestand tegen modern geschut\\", Ons Amsterdam, nr. 9, September 2004 (Dutch) About 40 years later, around 1340, new walls were constructed, both along the western oudezijde (\\"old side\\") and along the eastern nieuwezijde (\\"new side\\") of the Amstel river. On either side of the town, a moat was dug, and a wall topped by a wooden palisade was then built on the inner side of the moat. When in 1385 new walls and moats were built beyond these original walls and canals, the existing walls became known as Achterburgwal (\\"back wall\\") and the new walls were called Voorburgwal (\\"front wall\\"). This is how the canals Oudezijds Voorburgwal, Oudezijds Achterburgwal, Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal and Nieuwezijds Achterburgwal got their name. The city walls had three gates: \\"De Sint Anthoniespoort en de stadsmuur: Archeologische Begeleiding De Waag, Nieuwmarkt (2007)\\". AAR (Amsterdamse Archeologische Rapporten) 45, 2010. Gemeente Amsterdam, Bureau Monumenten en Archeologie (Dutch) * at the northern end of the Warmoesstraat street * at the western end of the Nieuwendijk * Bindwijkerpoort on the southern edge of the city, by Spui. The Waag, originally the city gate Sint Antoniespoort In 1425 the city expanded and a new moat was dug, which still exists as the Singel, Kloveniersburgwal and Geldersekade canals. Along the inner side of the canal, an earthen wall was built with three gates: a new Haarlemmerpoort gate, the Sint-Antoniespoort (now the Waag), and the Regulierspoort (now the bottom half of Munttoren tower). === Stone walls === After visiting Amsterdam in 1481, Emperor Maximilian I decreed that the town was to build stone walls to safeguard against attacks by the Duchy of Guelders and the Bishopric of Utrecht. The city had to pay for the walls itself, and instituted a tax to fund the costly project. Construction started in 1482 and took about 20 years to complete, all in all. The Schreierstoren tower (left) The end result was a brick wall, 5 to 6 metres high, supported by stone arches. The walls encircled the entire town, with the exception of the harbour front on the IJ bay along the northern side of the city. At regular intervals along the walls, a number of semicircular defensive towers were built. One of these towers is still standing, the Schreierstoren, built around 1487. \\"Schreierstoren (±1487)\\", Amsterdam Monumenten (Dutch) In 1494, a ceremony was held to mark the completion of the city walls. Ironically, by that time the walls were already antiquated. The walls were built to withstand medieval sieges, but gunpowder and iron instead of stone cannonballs had come into general use for attacks on walled cities. The city walls had five gates: * Haarlemmerpoort * Regulierspoort (now the bottom half of Munttoren tower) * Sint Antoniespoort (now the Waag) * * Oudeschans canal, with Montelbaanstoren tower (right) In 1512, troops from the Dutchy of Guelders attacked the city and looted the Lastage, an area of shipyards beyond the city walls on the eastern side of the town. To protect the Lastage, a new moat was dug in the period 1515-1518. By expanding a branch of the Amstel river, the Nieuwe Gracht (\\"New Canal\\", now the Oudeschans) canal was created. The soil produced by widening the river branch into a canal was used to build a wall along the inner side of the canal, topped by a wooden palissade. As part of these new defensive works, the Montelbaanstoren was built around 1516 as a watchtower. \\"Montelbaanstoren (1516, 1606)\\", Amsterdam Monumenten (Dutch) === Bastions === The 17th-century Haarlemmerpoort gate, designed by Hendrick de Keyser The Singelgracht canal at Leidsepoort gate, depicted in an 1816 painting by Johannes Jelgerhuis A colored lithograph of the Utrechtsepoort by Willem Hekking, July 1858. This gate was located on the south side of what is now the Frederiksplein. During the 17th century, the city expanded rapidly. To protect the grand new grachtengordel (the concentric belt of canals), a system of 26 bastions was constructed along the Singelgracht canal. Immediately following the Alteratie in 1578, the city began to strengthen the weak spots in its defenses. For instance, a bastion was constructed by the Haarlemmerpoort gate, which at that time lay near Herenmarkt square. William of Orange ordered the fortifications engineer Adriaen Anthonisz to Amsterdam in 1581 in order to oversee the construction of the new defensive works. In 1585, the city government decided to construct new earthen walls with 11 bastions beyond the existing walls. The city was expanding so rapidly that the area between the old and new walls was filled with new houses within a matter of a few years. In 1613 it was decided to construct new defensive walls with bastions on the western side of town, along the current Marnixstraat and Weteringschans streets, with a new outer moat (the Buitensingel, now Singelgracht) and inner moat (the Lijnbaansgracht). Within these new walls, the grachtengordel (the concentric belt of canals) could now be constructed. Amsterdam in 1657 began to construct fortifications to protect its fourth and largest 17th-century city expansion. This was one of the most ambitious construction projects undertaken in the 17th-century Dutch republic. Supporting the heavy walls on the porous Amsterdam soil required large numbers of deep foundation piles and retaining walls. Thousands of labourers transported soil and sand from the dunes and the Gooi using carts and wheelbarrows. Kilometers of retaining walls were built, canals were dug, and bridges and sluice gates were constructed. Around 1663, the massive project was complete. The walls rested on a nine metres deep wooden floor, supported by over 100,000 piles with crossbeams. On the top of the wooden floor, brick arches were built. Each bastion had 44 arches and each curtain wall had 47 arches. The arches were then covered with soil, and the walls were covered with stone. The walls were supported by 14 kilometres of retaining walls to prevent the soil from sinking away. The fortifications consisted of 26 bastions in total. In the flanks of these bastions were casemates with cannon and munition. Windmills were placed on top of most of the bastions. There were five main gates in the 17th-century fortifications: * * Leidsepoort * * * In addition, there were several smaller gates: * * * Zaagmolenpoort The city walls were never seriously put to the test. During the Rampjaar of 1672, the Dutch Water Line proved sufficient to stop the invading French troops from taking Amsterdam. The fortifications were neglected and began to decay. In 1769, for instance, the Muiderpoort gate collapsed, and in 1794, part of the Reguliersbolwerk bastion sank into the canal. Following the Napoleonic era, the bastions were turned into a park area. A path was constructed along the top of the bastions so that the citizens of Amsterdam could go for a leisurely stroll. In the period 1839-1848, the city defenses were gradually demolished. The final remaining curtain wall, between the bastions Rijkeroord and Slotermeer, was demolished in 1862 and replaced with a path for strolling. The gates were left standing but were repurposed as offices for tax collection.René Ros, \\"Verdedigingswerken van Amsterdam door de eeuwen heen\\", Erfgoed van Industrie en Techniek 2010, nr. 1 (Dutch) During the Industrial Revolution in the second half of the 19th century, the city started expanding beyond its 17th-century walls. The former bastions, now an area of recreation, were largely replaced with new buildings, and the Singelgracht canal was straightened; the bastions which had once jutted out were now no longer visible. === Fortification lines === Fort bij Uitermeer, one of the forts of the Defence Line of Amsterdam (Stelling van Amsterdam) In 1787, the Patriotten city government sought to protect the city against the Prussians by erecting 27 defensive posts along the seven entrances into the city. The polders between each of these posts were flooded. The Prussians were unable to overcome these defensives, but managed to get by the posts using the poorly defended entrance by the Haarlemmermeer. During the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in 1799, Cornelis Krayenhoff protected the capital by erecting the Linie van Noord-Holland (\\"North Holland Line\\"). He flooded the lower-lying areas between Monnickendam and Krommeniedijk, and protected the higher situated areas using earthen walls and field artillery. A year later, Krayenhoff oversaw the construction of a second defensive line, west of Amsterdam, the Linie van Beverwijk (\\"Beverwijk Line\\"), consisting of three lines of lunettes. The lunettes were spaced at a distance of 400 metres from each other. Ten of these lunettes still remain. Krayenhoff reused a number of the 1787 defensive posts for the Posten van Krayenhoff (\\"Krayenhoff Posts\\"), a defensive line constructed around Amsterdam in the period 1805-1810. The range and accuracy of artillery significantly improved as a result of the Industrial Revolution. To keep the city out of range of enemy artillery fire, it was decided to build a new line of fortifications around Amsterdam, at 15 to 20 kilometres' distance from the city centre. This Defence Line of Amsterdam (Stelling van Amsterdam), constructed in the years 1880-1914, was the most modern and largest-area circular fortification system in Europe in its day. The line stretched 135 kilometres and included 42 forts as well as four artillery batteries. The line was never tested, but did have a deterrent effect. In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, the Defence Line, as well as the Dutch Water Line, were a factor in the German decision not to invade the Netherlands. The Defence Line has survived largely intact and was named a World Heritage Site in 1996.Stelling van Amsterdam (Dutch) == Remains== De Gooyer originally stood on top of the Oosterbeer bastion The park Eerste Marnixplantsoen, formerly Haarlem bastion. This is the only remaining site along Singelgracht canal that still has the pointed shape of a bastion The well-known red-light district around the canals Oudezijds Voorburgwal and Oudezijds Achterburgwal is still known as De Wallen (\\"The Walls\\"), after the original Medieval earthen walls. Remains of the Medieval defensive works include the Waag (originally Sint Antoniespoort gate) and the bottom half of Munttoren tower (originally Regulierspoort gate), as well as the defensive tower Schreierstoren and the watchtower Montelbaanstoren. In the Geldersekade canal walls, there are still some sandstone fragments of the original Medieval city walls. On 19 June 2007, part of the Medieval walls was briefly exposed when a four metres deep hole was dug to inspect the foundations of the Waag.\\"15de eeuwse stadsmuur even zichtbaar\\", Amsterdam.nl (Dutch) A few patches remain of the park that was constructed on top of the bastions in the 19th century. These include the Eerste Weteringplantsoen, Tweede Weteringplantsoen, Eerste Marnixplantsoen, and Tweede Marnixplantsoen. The Eerste Marnixplantsoen, formerly bastion Haarlem, is the only remaining site along Singelgracht canal that still has the pointed shape of a bastion. Two windmills remain of the mills that stood on top of the bastions: De Gooyer and De Bloem. However, neither windmill still stands on its original location. Although Singelgracht canal was straightened, the canal and the Nassaukade, Stadhouderskade and Mauritskade streets along the canal still follow a zigzag pattern, revealing the location of former bastions. == Bolwerkenroute == In 2010, the Bolwerkenroute Amsterdam was presented. This route is to consist of 26 stone plaques at each of the 17th-century bastions. The first plaque, measuring 60 by 60 centimetres, was presented on 24 February 2010 at Max Euweplein square.

The album contains twelve compositions, mostly songs by Knightley. The duo self-released the album in early 1987 on cassette only. It was recorded and released to coincide with their first tour, and was only sold from the duo's concerts. The duo halted their time together as Beer returned The Albion Band, but returned in 1990 with Tall Ships, an album centered on its title track which is a twenty-two minute adaption of the much shorter song that opens Show of Hands. Both albums, along with Out for the Count (1991), were out of print by 1995, so the duo released the compilation Backlog 1987–1991 (1995) to compile highlights from the three albums.

Knightley recalled the duo played \\"25 gigs a year on the folk scene to audiences of twenty people – seventy sometimes, if we were lucky. But it was low key.\\" The album was only sold on cassette at the duo's live performances from early 1987. It was released to coincide with the tour. Being a low-key release, it was not reviewed by any local publications. The touring, nonetheless, gave the duo a small following. It would be three years until the duo could record a follow- up release, due to Beer's commitments to The Albion Band. The duo eventually recorded another cassette release, Tall Ships, in 1990. The album was centered on an expanded song suite adapted from the first song on Show of Hands. Beer left The Albion Band in 1990, allowing the duo to become a full-time partnership.

This says that making a mistake is not allowable. As for the mood of the team, we're sorry that it was a little insufficient to reach first place in Brussels. So we need to polish our programs for victory in London. To win with the team, we will have to increase our difficulty on vault. My vault in Brussels wasn’t competitive because of its low start value. I would like to make my vault more difficult, and increase my difficulty on bars a little.

Songs from the album appear on Backlog 1987-1991, a 1995 album containing songs from the band's earlier materialAll Products : Show of Hands, Online Shop for the first time on CD. This was due to Tall Ships going out of print later in 1990. Steve Knightley said that \\"Tall Ships\\" is set in a small West Country fishing village in the years just after the Napoleoniac Wars.Tall Ships liner notes Some of \\"Tall Ships\\" appears on their debut Show of Hands, albeit in a different recording. The full 22 minute version appears again on Backlog 1987-1991 and Roots - The Very Best of Show of Hands. The album is sometimes referred to as Tall Ships/Six O Clock Waltz, as \\"Tall Ships\\" takes up all of Side A whilst \\"Six O Clock Waltz\\" opens Side B. ==Background== Show of Hands, a Devon-based folk duo of Steve Knightley and Phil Beer, formed in 1986. Nonetheless, having known each other since 1972, they had performed before hand, for example Knightley's contribution to Beer's first live album with Paul Downes, Live in Concept (1980), and Beer's role in Knightley's pub rock bands of the 1980s, Short Stories, The Cheats and Total Strangers, when members of those bands could not appear. This is in addition to Knightley joining Beer and Downe's early 1980s band Arizona Smoke Revue. Beer joined The Albion Band in 1984, this halting collaborations between the two for a while. Nonetheless, Beer found some free time in 1987 and suggested to Knightley they form a duo. For the recording their first album, 1987's Show of Hands, they set up their own recording studio, known as Catsley Home. The album was recorded in January 1987 to coincide with their first tour, and was sold on the tour as a cassette. Being such a small-key release, it did not attract any attention from local publications. It, and the tour, did, nonetheless, gained the band a small following. It would be three years, however, until the band could follow up the album, due to Beer losing free time due to The Albion Band reculling after their short hiatus, who recorded albums in each year from 1987 to 1990. Show of Hands successfully regrouped in 1990 to record their second album, centered around an expanded song suite, \\"Tall Ships\\", which Knightley had written prior and used with Show of Hands. ==Music== Tall Ships was recorded in 1990 in a home studio that the duo had set up. The album, being a cassette only release, is split between Side A and Side B, but on Tall Ships, the two sides are especially distinct due to Side A being filled by \\"Tall Ships\\", the 22-minute suite, whilst the other side contains shorter compositions. This template is not unlike several 1970s progressive rock albums. Steve Knightley said that \\"Tall Ships\\" is set in a small West Country fishing village in the years just after the Napoleonic Wars, and tells a story of villages forced by starvation to wreck passing merchant ships, their \\"decks piled high\\" with food and stores. The song is a side-fulling suite consisting of ten distinct sections. Part of the song was previously recorded by the duo for their debut album where it opened that album. On Tall Ships, the first part of the composition, \\"The Wrecker’s Prayer\\", is a poem read aloud by actor Jim Carter, who was a friend of Knightley and at the time was little known.Centenary: Words & Music of the Great War – A unique collaboration with Jim Carter & Imelda Staunton. The new double album available for pre-order now!  Show of HandsCarter records war poetry album - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk In addition to the Knightley compositions, the album includes a waltz, \\"Six O'Clock Waltz\\". \\"Tall Ships\\", \\"Domination of the Sword\\" and \\"Lovers Never Friends\\" were chosen as highlights of the album by the duo, due to them including them on their 1995 compilation album Backlog 1987–1991, which features duo-selected highlights of the band's first three, cassette-only albums. On this album, \\"Lovers Never Friends\\" is retitled to the grammatically correct \\"Lovers, Never Friends\\". ==Release and reception== As with its direct predecessor and successor, Tall Ships was only released on cassette. Much mirroring the release scheme of their first album, Tall Ships was self- released only on cassette in 1990, and sold at the duo's live performances. The band played mostly at mostly pubs and small clubs at the time. The cassette received a favourable reception from attenders, but being a much low- key release, it was not reviewed in any local publications. Following the album's release, Phil Beer left The Albion Band, allowing Show of Hands to become a full-time musical partnership.Roots liner notes They subsequently recorded one final cassette-only album, 1991's Out for the Count, but before they released their first studio CD, release, 1994's Beat about the Bush, they would form the Anglo-Chilean band Alianza for one album in 1992, and record a Show of Hands live performance in 1992 for released in 1994 as Show of Hands Live. Along with Show of Hands and Out for the Count, Tall Ships never returned to print after its original run in 1990. To keep the availability of music from the cassettes that the band likes most, on their newly established own label Hands on Music, they released a compilation album in 1995 of the name Backlog 1987–1991, which features highlights of the three cassette albums, including three of the six tracks from Tall Ships. For their 2007 best-of compilation album, Roots: The Best of Show of Hands, one track from this album appeared, \\"Tall Ships\\", retained in its full 22-minute length at the end of the second disc, this disc being subtitled Longdogs because the songs on it were chosen using the winners in polls on the band's forum Longdogs to find the best songs from each of their albums. In this booklet of Roots: The Best of Show of Hands, the album is referred to as Tall Ships/Six O'Clock Waltz.Liner notes ==Track listing== #\\"Tall Ships\\" ##\\"Wreckers Prayer Part One\\" ##\\"Tall Ships\\" ##\\"Spanish Ladies\\" ##\\"Tall Ships Part One\\" ##\\"Rambling Sailor\\" ##\\"Winter's Welcome\\" ##\\"Storm\\" ##\\"Wreckers Prayer Part Two\\" ##\\"Well Bred Clowns\\" ##\\"Tall Ships Part Two\\" #\\"Six O Clock Waltz\\" #\\"Deads Will Roll\\" #\\"Don't It Feel Good\\" #\\"Dominion of the Sword\\" #\\"Lovers Never Friends\\" ==References== Category:1990 albums Category:Show of Hands albums Category:Self-released albums ","title":"Tall Ships (album)"},{"id":"35881050","text":"Gatehouse Bank PLC (Gatehouse) is a UK regulated bank, based in Mayfair, London.

Since 1994 it has become a biennial event. Until 1953 each congress was organised by radiological society of the host country, but in that year, a formal organisation, the International Society for Radiology was set up to provide continuity between the congresses. At the second congress, held in 1928 in Stockholm, three international commissions were set up - the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) and the International Commission on Radiological Education (ICRE). The former two have become fully functional organisations in their own right while the latter has remained a sub-committee of the ICR. Within years of Röntgen discovering X-Rays in 1895, they were being used for imaging fractured bones. Various societies sprung up in different countries where ideas were exchanged between like-minded people and national standards for the measurement of X-Ray intensity developed. These societies also tried to address the problems associated with the dangers of X-Rays, particularly cancer. Typical X-ray equipment in the 1940s By the end of the First World War a number of proposals on how to measure the intensity of X-Rays had been made, but there was little agreement between the various parties concerned. In 1925 the British Institute of Radiology, under the leadership of Charles Thurstan Holland invited delegates from a number of countries to attend the First International Congress on Radiation in London. This congress set up a framework for future meetings - future congresses would meet every three years in a different country, would be organised by the host country. The host country would nominate the chairman of the congress. It was also established that three commissions should be set up which would meet at the congresses: :*The International Commission of Radiation Units & Measures (ICRU) :*The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) :*The International Commission on Radiological Education (ICRE) Until the outbreak of the Second World War, congresses were held every three years. The 1940 congress was due to meet in Berlin in 1940, but was suspended due to the war. Apart from some copies of records kept by the 1973 Congress secretary-general, Benjamin Orndoff, the records of the congress, which had been handed to the German organisers in preparation for the next congress in Germany, were lost during the Second World War. The second congress was held in Stockholm under the chairmanship of Manne Siegbahn where the three commissions proposed in London met for the first time. Subsequent meetings were held in Paris (1931), Zurich (1934) and Chicago (1937). After the war, the British Institute of Radiology organised the sixth Congress which was held in London, exactly 25 years after the first congress and in the same hall as the first congress. A total of 3364 people from 54 countries including 1,742 radiologists registered for the congress. The incumbent chairman of the ICR, Arthur C. Christie, who had been nominated thirteen years before was unable to attend the London conference, so Orndoff, the secretary-general of that congress deputised handing the presidency to Ralston Paterson. The congress also saw a resumption of the work of the three international commissions. At the seventh congress, held in Copenhagen in 1953, the organisational details of the conference were overhauled and an executive committee under the chairmanship of Lauriston S. Taylor was set up to oversee the organisation of future congresses and to provide continuity between congresses. Before the Second World War, the location of the congresses was dictated largely by the places of residence of the delegates who had to travel by rail or sea - a delegate from the western seaboard of the United States would have to commit a month to attend a week- long ICR congress in Europe. The advent of air travel removed this restriction and subsequent congresses have since been held in many parts of the world. The following congresses have been held to date (or are scheduled): * 1925 (1st) - London * 1928 (2nd) - Stockholm * 1931 (3rd) - Paris * 1934 (4th) - Zurich * 1937 (5th) - Chicago * 1950 (6th) - London * 1953 (7th) - Copenhagen * 1956 (8th) - Mexico City * 1959 (9th) - Munich * 1962 (10th) - Montreal * 1965 (11th) - Rome * 1969 (12th) - Tokyo * 1973 (13th) - Madrid * 1977 (14th) - Rio de Janeiro * 1981 (15th) - Brussels * 1985 (16th) - Hawaii * 1989 (17th) - Paris * 1994 (18th) - Singapore * 1996 (19th) - Beijing * 1998 (20th) - New Delhi * 2000 (21st) - Buenos Aires * 2002 (22nd) - Cancún, Mexico * 2004 (23rd) - Montreal * 2006 (24th) - Cape Town * 2008 (25th) - Marrakesh * 2010 (26th) - Shanghai * 2012 (27th) - São Paulo * 2014 (28th) - Dubai * 2016 (29th) - Buenos Aires == International Society of Radiology == The International Society of Radiology was set up in 1953 to oversee the organisation of the International Congresses of Radiology and to provide continuity between congresses. The 1950 congress provided an occasion for workers in the radiology industry to meet for the first time in over a decade and to discuss the direction future congresses should take. At the 1953 congress, under the guidance of Flemming Norgaard in Copenhagen the International Society of Radiology was set up to oversee the organisation of the International Congresses of Radiology rather than the ad hoc arrangement whereby the organisation of the next congress was left entirely in the hands of the host country. A permanent committee would also provide continuity between congresses. Norgard became the first secretary-general of the Society, while the radiologist from the sponsoring society who had been president of a congress was, by that token, president of the ISR until the next meeting. ==See also== * Journal of Radiological Protection * National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements of the United States ==References * ICRU website * ICRP website Category:Radiology organizations Category:Organizations established in 1928 Category:Organizations established in 1925 Category:International nuclear energy organizations Category:International medical and health organizations Category:Standards organizations ","title":"International Congress of Radiology"},{"id":"35881087","text":"Llangynwyd Lower is a community in Bridgend County Borough, south Wales.

The community is the southern part of the old parish of Llangynwyd, and was created by government reorganization in 1974. The majority of Llangynwyd Lower is made up of hilly farmland and is sparsely populated. The western border of the community is a woodland valley, while the eastern border roughly follows the River Llynfi and the A4063 road. ==Buildings of note== To the west of the community on the slopes of Mynydd Ty-talwyn, are the remains of several medieval house platforms. Coytrahen House is an 18th and 19th century landscaped park containing a once elegant three-storey country house. The house and gardens were built during the ownership of John Popkin, but during the industrialisation of the area the western edge of the park was opened up to the Great Western Railway. The track of the original 1828 Maesteg to Porthcawl Tramway runs through the area, on the hillside, west of the present rail line.

The album follows Phil Beer's departure from The Albion Band in 1990, allowing Show of Hands to become a full-time partnership. Recorded straight to Digital Audio Tape in The Old Court, Devon, in 1991, the duo released the album later on in the year on cassette, becoming the final of their cassette-only releases. The album was released to a positive reception from concert goers, but as with the duo's previous releases, it did not bring the bang attention from any publications. The duo followed the release with their first CD release, Show of Hands Live (1992). By 1995, Out for the Count and the duo's first two albums were out of print, so the duo released the compilation album Backlog 1987–1991 (1995) containing material from the three albums, including five songs from Out for the Count. It is the only Show of Hands album to not have any of its songs featured on Roots: The Best of Show of Hands, however several of their albums that do have a song featured were re-recorded for the compilation. ==Background and recording== The songs on the album were recorded straight to Digital Audio Tape. Show of Hands, a Devon-based folk duo of Steve Knightley and Phil Beer, formed in 1986. Nonetheless, having known each other since 1972, they had performed before hand, including when Knightley contributed to Beer's first live album with Paul Downes, Live in Concept (1980), and Beer's role in Knightley's pub rock bands of the 1980s, Short Stories, The Cheats and Total Strangers, when members of those bands could not appear. This is in addition to the duor and Downe's early 1980s band Arizona Smoke Revue. Beer joined The Albion Band in 1984, this halting collaborations between the two for a while. Nonetheless, Beer found some free time in 1987 and suggested to Knightley they form a duo. The duo recorded their first two albums, Show of Hands (1987) and Tall Ships (1990) in small home studios, and sold them only as cassette releases at the duo's concerts.Roots: The Best of Show of Hands liner notes.

Written by William Wister Haines, Jonathan Latimer, and Charles Marquis Warren, the film is about a former soldier who thinks he may have caused the death of his commanding officer in Tunisia. After visiting the officer's widow, they fall in love, and she encourages him to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point. World War II hero Audie Murphy made his film debut in the small role of Ladd's academy roommate, Cadet Thomas. ==Plot== West Point cadet Rockwell \\"Rocky\\" Gilman is called before a hearing brought after an influential cadet, Raymond Denmore, Jr., is forced to leave the academy. Gilman has reported Denmore for lying to him during training, and in retaliation has been accused of bullying and hazing the dismissed cadet. Denmore's attorney, Lew Proctor, attacking the academy and its Honor Code system, declares that Gilman is unfit and possibly criminally liable. Gilman is confined to quarters by the academy superintendent and warned not to discuss the case with anyone. Consequently, he breaks a date his girlfriend Ann Daniels without explanation. The hearing resumes and Gilman's classmate, Eddie Loughlin, recounts how Gilman uncomplainingly withstood the rigors of academy training, especially during his plebe year, when he was still recovering from war wounds. Gilman takes the stand and testifies about his war experiences. Unwillingly drafted in December 1941, he learned by bitter experience that all soldiers in combat must obey their superiors unquestioningly. As a result, he applied for and completed officer candidate school. Gilman joined a unit going into combat in North Africa and became friends with both Loughlin and West Point graduate Lt. Harry Daniels. Daniels was killed in action and Gilman wounded during a battle in Tunisia, after which Gilman spent two years recovering in an Army hospital. Although awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for destroying an enemy tank during the action, Gilman turned down the medal. After his discharge from the Army, Gilman returned home to Brooklyn where he learned that his former sweetheart had married in his absence. Gilman changed numerous jobs before realizing that he cannot adjust to civilian life. On the evening of V-E Day, as the city celebrated, Gilman became depressed, feeling that people were dancing on the graves of countless soldiers, and instead went to see Daniels' family and his widow Ann. John Craig, a nurse at the hospital where Gilman was treated, then testifies that Gilman suffers from nightmares but refuses to discuss what troubles him. When given a drug to help him reveal his feelings, Gilman disclosed that during the battle Daniels ordered Gilman's platoon to counter-attack at a specific hour but Gilman inexplicably delayed the attack for three minutes, resulting in Daniels' death. Gilman was unable to explain the delay and believes himself a coward. Called back to the stand, Gilman concedes Proctor's charge that he deliberately disobeyed orders but refuses to discuss it. Proctor demands his immediate court-martial, but the superintendent insists that Rocky be given time to consider his testimony. That night Gilman receives a note from Ann saying she is going away and breaks quarters to go to New York. Gilman tells Ann that he has decided to resign from the academy and go with her. Ann refuses to accept the decision and insists that he return to confront his accusers. The next day, Gilman's adoptive father, Pop Dewing, brings three witnesses to the hearing to support his son. The first, Ann, recalls that when she first met him on V-E day, Gilman shocked her with a confession that he caused her husband's death. Realizing that he is tortured by misplaced guilt, she took him to a West Point ceremony commemorating Daniels' death. Ann realized that she has feelings for Gilman and was told by her mother-in-law that in his last letter, Harry said that if he should be killed, he wanted Ann to have a normal life. Encouraged by Ann, Gilman was admitted to West Point as a cadet, continuing to see her, but she remained unsure if he ever intended to marry her. When he cancelled their date, Ann intended to break off their relationship until he told her of his decision to resign. The next witness, the Army physician who administered the therapeutic drug, testifies that after reviewing Gilman's medical records, he realizes that there is a gap in his memory of the battle. Finally a soldier from Gilman's platoon testifies that while Gilman was leading the unit to make the counterattack, it was ambushed by a German tank concealed in a grove. Gilman was knocked unconscious by an explosion and when he recovered shortly after, was unaware that he was ever unconscious. Gilman was mortified to discover that the specified time of attack had passed and that Daniels had been killed, but because he refused to discuss the incident, he never learned about the concussion that created the delay. Hearing the testimony, Gilman's accuser admits that he lied about Gilman's conduct during training, and the hearing is closed. Later, General Dwight D. Eisenhower speaks at the West Point graduation, with Gilman among the proud graduates. ==Cast== * Alan Ladd as Cadet \\"Rocky\\" Gilman * Donna Reed as Ann Daniels * George Macready as Major General Bond * George Coulouris as Lew Proctor * Harold Vermilyea as Raymond Denmore, Sr. * Henry Travers as Pop Dewing * Tom Neal as Captain Harry Daniels * Conrad Janis as Raymond Denmore, Jr. * Dick Hogan as Cadet Sgt.

Paramount assigned William Wister Haines to write the script in March 1947 and he went to West Point for research. Producer Robert Fellows met with West Point's superintendent, General Maxwell D. Taylor, who promised co-operation. Fellows and Haines shot documentary footage at West Point in June.author=The same month it was announced the film's leads would be Alan Ladd and Joan Caulfield. Caulfield's casting meant she had to be replaced on Night Has a Thousand Eyes by Gail Russell. John Farrow assigned to direct in August. The same month Audie Murphy was cast. He had been under contract to James and William Cagney for a year and a half but they had never used him in a film. His appearance in the film was technically a \\"loan out\\" but Murphy received all his fee for this film. The film was made with the co operation of West Point. Filming started on location at West Point in early September 1947. That week, Joan Caulfield was replaced by Donna Reed, who had to be borrowed from MGM. Gerald J Higgins acted as technical adviser. In November 1947 the film was re-titled Now and Forever. The following March it became Beyond Glory. ==Reception== The reviewer in The New York Times called the film \\"a manful effort to extol the martial virtues and to defend the Academy against its detractors.\\" The reviewer continues: ==References* * Beyond Glory at the Audie L.

The track \\"7th Time\\" was picked up by John Peel, and led to the band recording two of the Peel Sessions at the BBC, in June and November 1985. \\\\- Weyzig played guitar and keyboards on the album, and performed with the band on stage as a live guitarist and keyboard player until 1990. In 1995, Weyzig (vocals, guitar, editing/production) formed the Dutch indie-wave band Born For Bliss along with Remco Helbers (bass guitar, Chapman Stick) and Willem Van Antwerpen (drums). In 1996, Born For Bliss released its first single, \\"Arabia\\", on Nuclear Blast - Death Wish Office, a German label. The single became a club hit and made its way high into the German alternative charts. In 1997, the band released its first full-length album, Flowing with the Flu, which also entered the German alternative charts. In 1998, the German Goth rock group Love Like Blood asked Weyzig to write a song for their Snake Killer album. This resulted in the track \\"Ylene\\", which became one of their favorites during Love Like Blood's live performances later that year. From 1999 to 2008, Weyzig took a break from releasing albums, but returned in 2009 to join his long time friend Rob Keyzer in the band White Rose Transmission, founded by Carlo van Putten (singer of Dead Guitars) and Adrian Borland (front man of the British 1980s' cult band The Sound).

He grew up in Oberlin, Ohio and attended the local public schools where he was a National Merit Finalist. He then attended Dartmouth and did a study abroad program in France. Andrews graduated with Honors from Dartmouth College where he studied mathematics and economics. He then completed his graduate work at Villanova University in the United States. ==EmploymentEarly Employment=== Following graduation from Dartmouth College, Geoff accepted an appointment as computer coordinator at the Westtown School in Westtown, PA where he taught mathematics and computer science. While at Westtown he helped develop the first AP computer science examination and in 1985 was funded by the National Science Foundation to work on a new computer language for education. In 1986 Geoff entered Villanova University's graduate program in computer science and taught mathematics there. He completed his master's degree in 1988; during the years he was studying and teaching at Villanova Andrews also worked as a database designer at Isolite, in sales at IBM and earned his private pilot's license. After graduating he began work at EFD enterprises and subsequently went to PMC engineering. In 1991 his wife was promoted to a management position in IBM to Cleveland Ohio and he came along with her. Starting in Ohio he worked as the Technology Director for the Chagrin Falls Schools located east of Cleveland. ===Polaris Career Center=== In 1995 Polaris Career Center hired Andrews to work with all of their associated school districts. In 1996 at Polaris Geoff created the Instruction Learning and Technology Leadership Institute, which trained hundreds of teachers to leverage technology as a catalyst to improve learning. That led, in 1997 to Andrews and Polaris receiving a ten million dollar Technology Innovation Challenge Grant from the US Department of Education. The grant focused on the unique and compelling uses of the internet in education. The grant paid to train 10,000 teachers in Cleveland, Miami and Phoenix, and led to Andrews being named one of 15 Shapers of the Future across the country. In 2003 Andrews was given the role as Assistant Superintendent of Polaris. At Polaris Andrews oversaw: *Quality & Data Analysis *Curriculum *Human Resources *Information Technology *Professional Development at Polaris ===Oberlin City School District=== In 2006 Geoffrey Andrews filled the position of Superintendent at the Oberlin City Schools, a district who was in academic watch at the time. Oberlin is now the first full K-12 International Baccalaureate (IB) district in Ohio. The IB is split into the Primary Years Program, Middle Years Program, and the Diploma Program. Founded in 1968, IB is made to develop the intellectual, personal, emotional and social skills to live, learn and work in a rapidly globalizing world. In 2011, for the first time ever, Oberlin received a rating of Excellent from the state. Every graduating student has also been accepted to college. ===Western Academy of Beijing=== Andrews was appointed director of the Western Academy of Beijing (WAB) for the 2011−12 school year. WAB is a full IB international school located in China consisting of approximately 1,500 students from over 50 countries worldwide. == References  * Dartmouth College website * Oberlin City Schools Website * Polaris Career Center Website * Villanova University Website * Western Academy of Beijing Website Category:Living people Category:1961 births Category:American school administrators ","title":"Geoffrey G.

A group of men who work for Major Harper, led by gunslinger Minniger, attempt to arrest rancher Alexander Kain and his English partner Jameson. They are stopped by William Bonney, aka Billy the Kid, who shoots and injures them. Jameson offers Billy a job as a ranch hand. A drunken group of Harper's men attack the ranch and kill Jameson.

It is the oldest substantially unaltered building in Long Street. Palm Tree Mosque in 1943 The building stands on land once owned by Hermanus Smuts, south-west of a block of land granted to him in 1751. The grant was bounded by Long, Leeuwen and Keerom Streets. After his wife died in 1754 portions of the property were sold off. At the time the property had stables on it. It was purchased by one J. M. Vogel and again, after Vogel's death in 1777, by Baron Willem Ferdinand van Reede van Oudtshoorn. In 1782 it was transferred to one of his sons. Successive owners were Daniel Hugo (1785), Daniel Krynauw (1786) and Carel Lodewijk Schot (1787). Schot went bankrupt, but is probably responsible for building the first residence in about 1788. The property was bought by J. P. Roux in 1790. Freed slaves Jan van Bougies and Frans van Bengalen bought the property in 1807 and Jan van Bougies became the sole owner in 1811. Jan and Frans, along with some followers, broke away from the Auwal Mosque, when the former failed to succeed as imam. When Jan van Bougies died in 1846, aged 112, he left the property to his wife Samida of the Cape, but specified that it continue to operate as a mosque, the second oldest in Cape Town. The second storey was presumable added after the house had been turned into a mosque some time between 1811 and 1821. There was once a garden in front of the house, in which two palm trees grew. Today there is only one. The low sash window and shortened door are not by design; Long Street was raised over the years. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1788 Category:Mosques in Cape Town Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1788 Category:History of Cape Town Category:1788 establishments in the Cape Colony Category:18th- century mosques ","title":"Palm Tree Mosque"},{"id":"35881163","text":"Meguro motorcycles were built by Meguro Manufacturing Co motorcycle works (目黒製作所), founded by Hobuji Murato and a high-ranking naval officer, Takaji Suzuki, in 1937. One of the first Japanese motorcycle companies, it became a partner of Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd, and was eventually absorbed. Named after a district of Tokyo, Meguro had its roots in Murato Iron Works, which was established in 1924. Meguro Seisakusho, which had once developed a copy of a Harley-Davidson V-twin, was established to design and build gearboxes for the nascent Japanese motorcycle industry. Abe Industries, which had once produced its own motorcycle, merged with Meguro in 1931. Once a prestige brand, supplying the Japanese government with military and police motorcycles, and racing alongside Honda, Meguro (メグロ) became bankrupt after launching a range of lightweight motorcycles which sold poorly, and experiencing a yearlong labor strike. The Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan, Inc. rates the Meguro Z97 model introduced in 1937 as one of their 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology. ==History== Meguro MR twin-cylinder engine cutaway Although the first motorcycle arrived in Japan in 1895, it was not until the 1930s that its own motorcycle industry started to develop. After the Wall Street Crash, Meguro invested in Harley-Davidson and obtained drawings, tooling and important knowledge of metal heat treatments in order to make gearboxes. These were then used in their vehicles and those of another early Japanese company called Rikuo (literally \\"Road King\\"). The resulting transfer of American intellectual property taught the Japanese how to produce motorcycles in quantity. In 1935, Murato and Suzuki built a 500 cc single Z97 model based on a Swiss Motosacoche design but work was restricted due to the start of WW2,Popular Mechanics, Feb 1953 during which it supplied aircraft parts. Meguro started full production again in 1948, the Z97 being joined by 125 cc, 250 cc and 350 cc overhead valve singles. In the 1950s Meguro entered racing and built its first twin-cylinder design, the T1 \\"Senior\\" with a British design-inspired pre-unit parallel twin engine; and later the K-series \\"Stamina\\" model, a copy of the BSA A7, one of which Meguro had bought in 1953.

A right back, he was capped five times for Norway. ==Club career== He played for Orkdal during his youth, but after the club was relegated to Fourth Division after the 1970 season, Wormdal transferred to Rosenborg in the First Division. He debuted against Frigg on 5 September 1971. He originally played as a center back, but was quickly transferred to the right back position. Despite Rosenborg winning the double in his inaugural season, Wormdal did not have sufficient matches to claim either title. In the 1971 Cup Final he would have been awarded the title if he had played, but coach Nils Arne Eggen instead chose to use his last substitution for Tor Røste Fossen. Eggen told Wormdal that he would have ample opportunities later, but Rosenborg would not claim a title again until 1985, the season after Womdal retired. His ultimate match was against Viking on 24 August 1984. In 1984 season, Wormdal was plagued with injuries and manager Bjørn Hansen decided that Wormdal's services would not be needed for the 1985 season. The resulting public outcry led Hansen to change his position, but the offer was the rejected by Wormdal. Wormdal played 201 league matches for Rosenborg, of which 17 were played in the Second Division, and scored one goal. He is the Rosenborg player with the twelfth-most league matches. He played three UEFA Cup and two UEFA European Cup matches. Only seven players have played more seasons for Rosenborg. ==International career== Wormdal made his way to the national football team in 1979 and helped Norway qualify for the 1980 Summer Olympics, including winning over West Germany. However, Norway joined in on the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott, hindering Wormdal from becoming an Olympian. He was capped five times for Norway. ==Playing style== Wormdal played a right back who was particularly noted for being able to quickly bring the ball from the defense to the offense, also in difficult circumstances. He was offensive and popular among the fans, but controversial and unorthodox. He was best between the two penalty areas. Adresseavisen declared him Rosenborg's all-time right back in 2010, ahead of Vegard Heggem and Christer Basma.

Designed by architect Víctor D’Ors (son of Eugenio d'Ors), sculptures by Cristino Mallo and Frederic Marès, 1963. Art and culture in Francoist Spain is a historiographic term, with little use beyond the chronological placement of artists and cultural events, or political identification. The term is used generically, without involving ideological or aesthetic evaluation of the entire art and culture of Francoist Spain (1939–1975), which would only be suitable for art and culture more identified with the Franco regime, where other expressions are sometimes used: 'Fascist art and culture in Spain', 'Falangist art and culture', or 'nationalist- catholic (nacional-católica) art and culture', and so forth. The terms 'Spanish Fascist art', 'Fascist Spanish painting', 'Spanish fascist sculpture', 'Spanish fascist architecture', 'Spanish fascist culture', 'Spanish fascist literature', and so on, are infrequently used, but there are examples, as in the writing of Spanish historian . Such terms have a wide application, which can be restricted to cultural products more identified with Spanish Falangism and the azul (blue) familias del franquismo (organizations affiliated with Francoism), although very often these more specific terms are generalized, to cover all of the art identified as \\"nacional\\" ('national') in Francoist Spain. ==Internal and external exile== Artists active in Francoist Spain include the writers José María Pemán, Agustín de Foxá and Luis Rosales, the painters Carlos Sáenz de Tejada and Fernando Álvarez de Sotomayor, architect and sculptors of the Valle de los Caídos, and the music of Concierto de Aranjuez, Quintero, León y Quiroga, the films of José Luis Sáenz de Heredia and Luis Lucia Mingarro. Prominent cultural figures included the psychiatrists Antonio Vallejo-Nájera and López Ibor,Juan Casco y Antonio Espino En el centenario de López Ibor, El País 09/05/2006. as well as the social scientists Melchor Fernández Almagro, Ramón Carande and Luis Suárez Fernández). Much of the Spanish artistic and cultural production of the time was made by authors ideologically opposed or indifferent, or who had aesthetic criteria completely unrelated to a Fascist aesthetic: writers Carmen Laforet, Antonio Buero Vallejo, Vicente Aleixandre; visual artists Dalí, Joan Miró, Antoni Tàpies; sculptors Paul Serrano, Eduardo Chillida, Jorge Oteiza; architects Saenz de Oiza, Miguel Fisac; composers Bernaola Luis de Paul; filmmakers Luis García Berlanga, Juan Antonio Bardem, Carlos Saura; and researchers in natural sciences such as Large Covián, Michael Sanudo Catalan, George Francis Taylor, Antonio de Zulueta, and social scientists such as Jaume Vicens Vives, José Antonio Maravall, Antonio Domínguez Ortiz, Julio Caro Baroja, José Luis Sampedro, Fabian Estapé, Juan José Linz. Some of these artistic and cultural figures were situated more or less precisely in the so-called internal exile. The list of those belonging to this category is not easy to determine. The literature often refers to Vicente Aleixandre and Dámaso Alonso, but in the case of Alonso, 'internal exile' can only be attributed to the period prior to integration in institutions (Royal Academy). Also frequently included are Juan Gil Albert and Rafael Cansinos-Asséns among the literati, and Joan Miró among the visual artists. The Epistolario del exilio (Letters from Exile) of Max Aub, referring to internal exile, collects the letters of Gabriel Celaya Luis Landinez Gloria Fuertes, Aleixandre, José Agustín Goytisolo and Luis Goytisolo, Gil Albert, Jose Luis Lopez Aranguren José Carlos Mainer, Roman Gubern, Ana María Matute, and others. Others included as internal exiles may be Blas de Otero, José Hierro, Eugenio de Nora, José Agustín Goytisolo, and José Ángel Valente. Jorge Tello Francisco, Antonio de Zulueta and Miguel Catalan Sañudo survived in internal exile, but in a significantly reduced capacity for scientific work due to the hostility of the new authorities, the lack of communication with the outside world, and the postwar economic hardships.(José Manuel Sánchez Ron, Un siglo de ciencia en España, Residencia de Estudiantes, ). Many artistic and cultural figures, whether or not from the beginning, eventually reaching a high social and even official recognition, as the regime struggled to maintain an inclusive attitude towards cultural products that were not identified as a direct challenge by the opposition to Franco (especially after the appointment of Joaquín Ruiz-Giménez as education minister, replacing José Ibáñez Martín in 1951).Ruiz Giménez no estaba solo. Dio paso a una serie de personajes que se revelarían capitales en el proceso de amoldamiento mutuo entre el poder y la vanguardia. Durante su mandato en el ministerio de Educación (1951-1956), se creó un cierto clima liberal (Marzo, op. cit., pg. 25). Spanish art forms not only developed in the interior of Spain, but outside it, given the extraordinary cultural power of the Spanish Republican exiles, to which belonged figures of the stature of Juan Ramón Jiménez, Pablo Picasso, Julio González, Pablo Casals, Luis Buñuel, the architects of GATEPAC, José Ferrater Mora, Zambrano, Américo Castro, Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz, Juan Negrín Blas Cabrera, and many others. A leading Falangist, Ernesto Giménez Caballero, was the main theorist of the art of Francoist Spain. In 1934, after attending a conference in Italy, Ernesto Giménez Caballero had been published in an F. E. magazine article, Art and State\\", which became a book in 1935. Caballero identified the Monastery of El Escorial as \\"the epitome of all the virtues of Spanish art and a \\"symbol of what art should be fascist, while the most prestigious Spanish art theorist of the time, Eugenio d'Ors, strove to create an artistic environment related to the regime but open and assimilative (Salón de los Once, Academia Breve de Crítica de Arte, 1941-1954)), including the avant garde, which increased over time to even be a hallmark of the regime, increasingly interested in showing, both internally and externally, a contemporary image. Artists and writers related to Franco have suffered from a general underestimation by historians, art critics and literary critics. As Andres Trapiello stated, Francoists \\"won the war and lost the history of literature\\".Andrés Trapiello, Las armas y las letras: literatura y Guerra Civil (1936-1939), Península, 2002, ; reeditado en Destino, 2009 . Citado por Javier Rodríguez Marcos en Generales, curas y señoritos españoles, El País, 30/03/2009. ==Fascist repression and ideological control== In accordance with the scheme menendezpelayano (identification with Catholic Spain and its opposite with anti-Spanish sentiment, coming from outside or inside), the government intended to create a new cultural and educational initiative in 1939, which would have an obsessive focus on the Spanish nationalism and nacionalcatolicismo religion. Sincere or not, the Franco regime failed to impose a totalitarian culture consistent with other exclusionary cultural, and historical sources often termed \\"traditionalist,\\" \\"authoritarian\\" and \\"dictatorial\\" to describe it.Stanley G. Payne Cultura y educación en El primer franquismo, Temas de Hoy, 1997, pgs. 102 y ss. This meant, especially during the years immediately after the Spanish Civil War, a culture of imposition, reconquest attitudes, or imperialism.Francisco Javier Paredes Alonso, Historia contemporánea de España: Siglo XX, pg. 868. ===Schools and universities=== CSIC, Madrid, 1939. (The inscription, glorifying Francisco Franco, was removed in August 2010. The disciplines or names that should appear in the branches of the tree are also considered controversial: in the Francoist version, Franco gave prominence to theology, from which other sciences are \\"slaves\\" according to the scholastic aphorism philosophia ancilla theologiae.panoramio.com (File accessed 2011). The frieze here, and the magazine Arbor during the 1950sMagazine issue of March 1955, no numbers (File accessed 2011). used a logo without inscriptions on the branches, and this is the version in use today.)The organizational logo of CSIC (File accessed 2011). Franco's regime brought about a strong political repression in Spain, the widespread and systematic 'cleansing' of the education system, through the D-Commission, responsible for academic appointments; the C-Commission to control changes in secondary schools; and the A- and B-Commissions to oversee universities. The government implemented an ideological and moral censorship and propaganda apparatus that effectively used modern means of mass communication (No-Do, Prensa del Movimiento (Movement Press), strict control of radio and television from 1956). Most of the filters were merely symbolic sanctions, as many of those affected were either dead or in exile. Of those who remained in Spain some were also subject to criminal prosecution, such as Julián Besteiro, who died in prison, or John Peset, who was shot. Several of the victims of government reprisals had no special political relationship with the left, such as Flores de Lemus. Among high school teachers to be 'purified' by Franco's regime was Antonio Machado (despite having died in France); among Normal School teachers, there was Eliseo Gomez Serrano (shot), and among teachers Amos Steel and Vicente Moliner Nadal (both shot). Biescas and Tunon ( op. Cit., Pg. 16) put the figure of 7,000 teachers among the 270,000 total prisoners in concentration camps and prisons of the first Franco period, and the two-thirds of faculty exiles or dismissed. Of professors active in June 1936 at the University of Madrid (Complutense today), 44.3 percent were sanctioned. The figure is similar between teaching assistants and aides reaching 43.6 percent, although 7.6 percent of them have not found data. descargas/prensa/tribuna928.pdf Complete listing of Complutense University reprisals after the Civil War. Universities were restructured by the law of July 1943. University rectors had to be members of the Falange. The reality, both in secondary education as well as university and other higher level educational institutions, was that teachers and students, in opposition to the scientific spirit, were framed by the SEU and Servicio Nacional del Magisterio (National Teachers Service). Fascist ideals were also expressed through weekly publications, such as El Español published by the Deputy Secretary of Education and directed by Juan Aparicio. These devices were completed with the Instituto Nacional del Libro (National Institute of Newspapers), which was created in 1939 and led by Julian Pemartín, a leading ideologue of the regime. (Tunon de Lara, The Spain of the Crusade , op. cit., pg. 114). All cultural institutions were impacted, including the Real Academia Española, from whom Ramón Menéndez Pidal resigned as director between 1939 and 1947; museums such as Museo del Prado; the Ateneo de Madrid; and others, among which were those previously identified with krausismo - Institución Libre de Enseñanza, Junta para la Ampliación de Estudios, Residencia de Estudiantes, Instituto Escuela - all of which were replaced by a new organization, the National Research Council (CSIC):Elvira Ontañón El Instituto-Escuela, un proyecto educativo vigente, El País, 23/04/2007. ===Centralization of cultural control=== While the pursuit of the peripheral nationalism fell short of a total ban on local languages and cultures (Catalan language and Catalan culture, Euskara and Basque culture, Galician and Galician culture), a policy of Castilianization was nonetheless implemented in education and in almost all public areas. (Luis Hurtado Alvarez: if you're Spanish, speak Spanish, May 18, 1937. Quoted in escueladesara.com) Even then policy was not always followed to the full extent, and with which not even all members of the regime agreed (as in the controversy between Carlos Sentís and Josep Montagut). The allocation of areas of power between the familias del franquismo - nacionalcatolicismo, Falangist 'Blues', monarchists, Carlists (supporters of King Juan Carlos), 'Juanistas' (supporters of Juan de Borbón), military groups such as the Africanists, and other factions - corresponded to each of the areas including ministries, and did not always have well-defined functions: Catholics accounted for the Ministry of Education of Spain, which focused most of cultural policy, but the Blues had their share of political and social and apparatus in the nationalist Movement, which sought a totalitarian presence in all aspects of public life and even private. Each of the 'Blue' Francoist families controlled the country's communication media. The Church, in exchange for support for the uprising, the regime demanded control of the field that had traditionally considered theirs: education and teaching. For its part, the Falange as a single party would try to impose its support through the mass media. This explains the division of powers that the constitution made after the first administration by a law of January 30, 1938. In the Ministry of the Interior (National Service of Press and Propaganda) the Falangists had control; in Education, monarchists of Acción Española with Pedro Sainz Rodríguez in front, under the watchful eye of Cardinal Goma, primate of Spain. Colleagues appointed following the tactic of combining different ideological positions that had presided over the constitution of government. In the National Primary Education, the traditionalist Romualdo de Toledo, in Higher Education and Media, Joseph Pemartín, monarchist Acción Española, in the Technical Education and Vocational a technocrat, Augustus Krahe. Manager of Fine Arts, Eugenio d'Ors, and Archives and Libraries, Javier Lasso de la Vega.Alicia Alted, Notas para la configuración y el análisis de la política cultural del franquismo en sus comienzos: la labor del Ministerio de Educación Nacional durante la guerra, en Fontana, op. cit., pgs. 217-218. Catholic clerical personalities were significantly elevated to positions of high influence in the ideological and cultural spheres of Spain: Justo Pérez de Urbel and other Benedictines in particular; Enrique Pla y Deniel, Isidro Goma, Leopoldo Eijo y Garay, Casimir Morcillo Gonzalez, and other bishops; or admitted to the clergy late in their careers, so-called late vocations (Ángel Herrera Oria, leader of the National Catholic Association of Propagandists, was ordained at age 53 and became a bishop; José María Albareda belonged to Catholic organization Opus Dei since 1937, was director of CSIC, and ordained a priest at age 57 years; Manuel García Morente, a leading philosopher, was ordained a priest at age 54 years), so that neo-Thomist thought (revived interest in Thomas Aquinas), or neo- Scholasticism, has been described as the dominant intellectual environment, based on the Vatican position prior to the Vatican II Council. ==Literature== Within Franco's Spain, and among artists in exile and in the image of Spain abroad, the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) was perpetuated as a reference to Spain's cultural life. The destruction of the Spanish artistic heritage had been of great magnitude, not only as a result of acts of war, but particularly by the iconoclastic fury of the Republican rearguard. These events were widely publicized in the new state, which in turn exhibited as an achievement its own recovery the most important collections of the Museo del Prado, except at Geneva, where Spain obtained from Vichy France two emblematic pieces from Spain under different circumstances (La Inmaculada de Soult and La dama de Elche, 1941). Spanish cultural life after the war was tragically overshadowed by the violent death of prominent individuals identified with both sides (Federico García Lorca, Ramiro de Maeztu, Pedro Muñoz Seca). Valle Inclán and Unamuno died of natural causes (January and December 1936 respectively), and Manuel Azaña and Antonio Machado (shortly after crossing the French border in 1939). The poet Miguel Hernández died in prison in 1942. Antonio Buero Vallejo later attained great success with a bitter view of man and society in a theatre scene in which even the comedic playwrights of the winning side could not escape the absurdity (Enrique Jardiel Poncela, Miguel Mihura, Edgar Neville, José López Rubio, Antonio Lara de Gavilán (\\"Tono\\") and his follower Alfonso Paso). ===The cultural landscape=== The literary production of intellectuals related to the new national government, although some international celebrities of great weight returned to Spain (Arturo Duperier, José Ortega y Gasset, Salvador Dalí) and minimal scientific activity was maintained (creation of the Institute of Political Studies (1939), CSIC (1939), and the Institute of Hispanic Culture (1946)) and some areas of relations (social gatherings such as the Café Gijón, magazines such as Vértice (1937 to 1946), Escorial (1940 to 1950), Garcilaso-Juventud creadora (1943 to 1946), Espadaña (1944 to 1951), Ínsula (launched 1946), Cántico (1947 to 1949), the long Spanish postwar recovery during the 1940s and 1950s created a cultural wasteland within the destroyed, hungry and isolated Spain, exacerbated by repression, the 'purification' of the educational system and cultural institutions, the purges of books, and widespread censorship. Compared with the preceding period, called the Silver Age (la Edad de Plata), shows one of the clearest contrasts in the cultural history of Spain. The term \\"cultural wasteland\\" or \\"intellectual wasteland\\", widely used, has itself been debated by many authors and may be unfair to the actual cultural productions; but it nevertheless has the virtue of connecting itself to the essentialist debate, pessimistic and inward-looking, on the 'Being of Spain', the existentialist view of the country, that was in itself the more important intellectual subject of the time. From the history of science, the time has come to be known as the destruction of science in Spain. Possibly the most synthesized description is to be found among some novelists, poets and playwrights in their titles: Carmen Laforet with Nada (1945), Dámaso Alonso with Hijos de la ira (Sons of Wrath) (1946); Alfonso Sastre with La mordaza (The Bite) (1954); Luis Martín-Santos with Tiempo de silencio (Time of Silence) (1962); and Carlos Barral with Años de penitencia (Years of Penance) (1975). Vicente Aleixandre, among the Generation of '27 poets and writers, best represented the vital, intellectual commitment to an interior exile, rich but hidden. Prominent representatives of the generation, such as Dámaso Alonso and Gerardo Diego, were involved in the Franco regime's cultural institutions, while others (Luis Cernuda, Jorge Guillén, Pedro Salinas and Rafael Alberti) went into an exile shared with a host of writers (Ramón J. Sender, Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz, Américo Castro, Corpus Barga, José Bergamín, León Felipe, Francisco Ayala, Max Aub, Arturo Barea, María Zambrano, Alfonso Daniel Rodríguez Castelao ('Castelao') writing in the Galician language, Josep Carner and Mercè Rodoreda writing in the Catalan language), scientists, artists and professionals from all disciplines whose international recognition was high in all types of universities and cultural institutions, culminating in the Nobel Prizes awarded to Juan Ramón Jiménez (literature, 1956) and Severo Ochoa (medicine, 1959). The granting of the same award in 1977 to Vicente Aleixandre featured the return to Spain of surviving exiles, who saw the international recognition of the restoration of democracy in Spain. Internal exiles who gained public recognition were Juan Gil Albert and Rafael Cansinos-Asséns. The writers closely aligned with the Franco regime (Manuel Machado's brother Antonio, a living symbol of the fratricidal division; Eduardo Marquina, Eugenio d'Ors, Vicente Risco, Lorenzo Villalonga, Julio Camba, Wenceslao Fernández Flórez, Manuel García Morente, Tomás Borrás, Jacinto Miquelarena, José María de Cossío, the Marqués de Lozoya, Rafael Sánchez Mazas, Víctor de la Serna, José María Pemán (the 'minstrel of the Crusade'), Ernesto Giménez Caballero, Manuel Halcón, Juan Antonio Zunzunegui, Ángel Valbuena Prat, Eugenio Montes, Samuel Ros, Agustín de Foxá, Luis Rosales, José María Gironella, José Luis Castillo-Puche, Emilio Romero) or those who for one reason or another tried a compromise approach, with different reception from the regime (José Martínez Ruiz ('Azorin'), Jacinto Benavente, Ramón Pérez de Ayala, Carlos Arniches, bilingual Catalan language-writer Josep Pla, and have been mostly a common destiny in their assessment by subsequent literary criticism; relatively speaking, somewhat similar to the relegation and contempt suffered by intellectuals who supported the European Fascist regimes after their defeat (examples include Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Martin Heidegger and Ezra Pound). Others, such as Camilo José Cela and Pío Baroja, have been more fortunate. The alignment on either side of the Spanish Civil War was becoming somewhat diffuse for a growing group of intellectual personalities, both in exile and within Spain, converging on what has been called the third (una tercera) of Spain. This is the case of Manuel de Falla and Ramón Gómez de la Serna (both resided until their deaths in Argentina, but are not identified specifically with either the exiles or with the Francoist authorities, who sought to recruit them), a significant group of Republican exiles to which violence had distanced them from the Republican side since the beginning of the war, called los blancos de París (the whites of Paris): Salvador de Madariaga, Niceto Alcalá-Zamora or Alfredo Mendizabal, and the Spanish Committee for Civil Peace, established in Paris in February 1937), and other significant groups who chose to stay in Spain or who returned in the early postwar years: the physician and essayist Gregorio Marañón or philosophers José Ortega y Gasset, Javier Zubiri and Julián Marías. Symbolically, the three main leaders of the Association of Service of the Republic of 1931 (Ortega and Perez de Ayala Marañón) agreed in its hopeless rejection of opposition and the resigned acceptance of the Franco regime, returning to Spain in the 1940s. Meanwhile, a select group of intellectuals from the left of Falangism distanced themselves from the regime (the environmentalist journal Escorial, which received the controversial liberal denomination \\"Falangism\\": Pedro Laín Entralgo, Antonio Tovar, Dionisio Ridruejo, Jose Maria Alfaro Polanco, Gonzalo Torrente Ballester, José Luis López Aranguren, and Álvaro Cunqueiro, who continued to write most of his work in the Galician language. Something similar happened with the explicit position of a remarkable group of poets to \\"uproot\\" (Dámaso Alonso's expression) and leave the \\"garcilasista aesthetic\\", named after the official youth magazine Garcilaso-Juventud creadora: Luis Rosales, Luis Felipe Vivanco, Leopoldo Panero, in favour of social poetry (magazine Espadaña, from 1944 to 1951): Eugenio de Nora, Victoriano Crémer, who is associated with the subsequent careers of Gabriel Celaya and Blas de Otero, usually identified with the internal exiles, or a group of novelists labelled \\"tremendistas\\" (Tremendismo literary movement): Camilo José Cela, La familia de Pascual Duarte (1942), Rafael García Serrano, Luis Landínez, Darío Fernández Flórez.

The part of the hierarchy clearly identified with the most immobile elements, was (as they themselves were called \\"the bunker\\" during the 1970s) relatively marginalized from the center positions of power. In 1967, the government enacted a law to protect Religious Freedom. The Western Alliance Sentinel (rhetorical expression for Spain and Franco himself, identified with each other) with the United States to defend the free world had become a key support. The Franco regime even applied for membership in the European Common Market, which was denied approval because of Spain's lack of democracy (1962). The regime adapted Franco's charismatic ideology of the technocrat (a name which was used to designate economic and other technical experts linked to Catholic group Opus Dei), while the ideological alternatives were raised with increasing boldness. The consequences came to the point that the result came to be described as a fight or dispute of cultural hegemony, a hegemony crisis or crisis ideológica.50 Some newspapers (Diario Madrid, forced to close in 1971; Informaciones) and magazines (Triunfo, Cuadernos para el Diálogo, 1963–1976) exploited to the limits the relaxation of censorship, sometimes exceeding the tolerance of the authorities and arousing scandals, which made them political and cultural references.

The university, a challenging environment since the events of 1956 (led by youth of both sides), became one of the strongholds of the opposition to Franco, as demonstrated in February 1965, and the scandal of the deprivation of university chairs to Enrique Tierno Galván, Jose Luis Lopez Aranguren and Agustín García Calvo, in solidarity with Antonio Tovar and José María Valverde. The incidents of 1968, simultaneous to the so-called revolution of 1968 worldwide, were the extension of these events. File:Camilo José Cela Madrid 1996.jpgCamilo José Cela.

The hospital is owned by BMI Healthcare. The building was previously a private residence constructed in 1865. ==History== Thornbury was built between 1864 and 1865, when Frederick Mappin, the cutlery and steel magnate, commissioned the architects M.E. Hadfield and Son to design a new house for him. Mappin had previously been Master Cutler in 1855 and would go on to become Mayor of Sheffield in 1877/8 and a Liberal MP in 1880. Thornbury is a big bold stone house with curving two storey bay windows. It is in the Classical style with two wings, balustraded parapet and a steep pitched roof with tall chimneys and gables. The main entrance is at the western side of the building and this has a two storey porch and a large oriel window. The house which sits on six acres of land looks over mature gardens which were designed by Robert Marnock. The entrance is reached by a long sweeping drive off Fulwood Road; a small lodge is situated at the entrance to the drive. During the Second World War the house was used for storage by The Admiralty. In 1947 it was purchased by the newly formed National Health Service for £11,500 and used as an annexe for the Sheffield Children's Hospital. It opened in 1951 as a 50-bed unit and was known as Thornbury Annexe until 1976 when it was renamed as the Children’s Hospital, Thornbury. It served as a medical annexe, isolation ward and convalescent home for the children. In 1982 it was sold by the trustees of the former United Sheffield Hospitals for development as a private hospital, however the annexe stood vacant for a number of years but the Sheffield Child Development Study research unit remained in the grounds of the disused annexe. In July 1990 the unit moved to new premises in the Stephenson Unit at Sheffield Children's Hospital. Thornbury was enlarged and restored in the early 1990s and opened as a private hospital under the management of BMI Healthcare. ==Services== The hospital now has in-patient facilities with four operating theatres, an endoscopy suite, a high dependency unit and an intensive care unit. The hospital offers treatment from routine investigations to complex surgery. ==See also== * List of hospitals in England ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Sheffield Category:History of Sheffield Category:Houses completed in 1865 Category:Hospitals in Sheffield Category:Private hospitals in the United Kingdom ","title":"Thornbury Hospital"},{"id":"35881279","text":"Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Boyd (April 8, 1858 - death date unknown) was an American baseball second baseman and outfielder in the late 19th century, who played in predecessor teams to the Negro leagues.

In response, Kent made 124 all out in their first- innings, with Smith taking the wicket of John Burton to finish with figures of 1/21 from eleven overs. Responding in their second-innings, Nottinghamshire made 165 all out, with Smith being dismissed for a single run by Edgar Willsher.

He was the spiritual guru of prominent 16th-century saint Eknath. His compositions were mostly written in Marathi. He also wrote a few verses in Hindi. ==Biography== Janardan Swami was born into a Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmin, Deshpande family at Chalisgaon, Maharashtra. They belong to Ashvalayana Sutra and Shakala Shakha. His parents reportedly subscribed to the Asvalayana tradition and were probably adherents of the school of thought initiated by the 8th-century philosopher Adi Shankaracharya. Janardan Swami was a devotee of the Hindu deity Dattatreya. He was appointed as Killedar or governor of the fort at Daulatabad (previously Devagiri) by its contemporary Muslim occupants. According to legend, Dattatreya once conversed with Janardan Swami inside a cave within the fort perimeters at Daulatbad. It is also believed that during one of his tours to Ankalakopa, Dattatreya again appeared before him as Narasimha Saraswati. Narsimha Saraswati was an earlier saint and spiritual master and is widely considered to be the second incarnation of Dattatreya. He is thought to have initiated Janardan Swami under a cluster fig (audumbara) tree. Janardan Swami had disciples of various social classes and even Muslims and Arabs. Among his disciples, Eknath is considered the most significant while Ramajanardana and Janijanardana are his other well-known disciples. Very few details of Janardan Swami's life are known. On one occasion, he had probably instructed Eknath to embark on a pilgrimage. It is thought that he accompanied his disciple until Trimbakeshwar, a Hindu pilgrimage town near Nashik, Maharashtra. He has composed considerable volumes of devotional poetry, known as abhanga. Janardan Swami breathed his last at Daulatabad where he is believed to have undergone Mahasamadhi. His samadhi shrine is located within a cave on a hill at Daulatabad. ==See also== *Eknath, his principal disciple *Dnyaneshwar *Namdev ==References *http://santeknath.org/jivangatha.html *Savitribai Khanolkar, Saints of Maharashtra, published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai, 3rd Edition, 2000.

The film was shot at Bronson Canyon and Red Rock Canyon State Park, California. It was the first of four Audie Murphy films for producer Grant Whylock's Admiral Pictures. ==Plot== Captain Stanton is a renowned Indian Fighter with his animosity stirred by the fact that his career officer father was forced to resign after trusting a group of Indians who broke their word to him. Stanton is sent to the field to relieve the commander of a troop unsuccessfully hunting Apaches who have fled their reservation. Stanton quickly meets with success by having his new troop drop their excess equipment to move faster and longer. He defeats a war party of Apache by luring them with an unescorted wagon loaded with hidden soldiers who engage the enemy until Stanton's mounted troop surround and defeat them. Stanton captures Red Hawk, the son of Chief Victorio and uses him to negotiate a truce with the Apaches promising to stay on their reservation in return for white miners not trespassing on their land to mine gold. Though the territory remains peaceful, the economy of the settlers and miners faces a serious economic threat when the miners are unable to pay the business interests that advance them money for their mines in return for a percentage of the profits. Captain Stanton's sympathies gradually change when the miners continue their trespassing. He also is attracted to Dawn Gillis, a courageous missionary teacher who is half Indian herself, and teaches in an Indian school. Stanton ruins his military career by beating up a local troublemaker who makes racist taunts to Dawn, then later engages a group of whites who massacre a group of Indians at the school that leads Stanton to open fire on the whites killing several of them. A delegation complains about Stanton's behaviour and the economic disaster to the Federal Government in Washington D.C. who send out a new commander named Colonel Perry. The Colonel not only relieves Stanton but dismantles his line of outposts to monitor white entry into the reservation that leads the miners to swarm in and hostilities to resume. Victorio's Apaches lure the inexperienced Colonel and his men into an ambush but a messenger escapes to the remnants of the Colonel's command of which Stanton takes charge to straighten out the mess.Apache Rifles at the Audie Murphy Memorial Site ==Cast== * Audie Murphy as Jeff Stanton * Michael Dante as Red Hawk * Linda Lawson as Dawn Gillis * L.

The band formed in Paris in 2008 but have been based in London, UK, since 2011. They've been described as \\"shape-shifting pop blend[ing] folk melodies, electro beats and exotic rhythms\\". Their debut album, Towards, was released on 5 May 2014. Their second album, Overseas, was released on 15 June 2018. ==History== The band was formed in 2008 in Paris by then-literature-students Michael Liot (vocals, strummed instruments) and Fabienne Débarre (vocals, keyboards, xylophone). They were very quickly joined by William Serfass (vocals, percussions, bass, electric guitar). After releasing two self-produced EPs (We Were Evergreen, Flings) in France, they moved to London where they released a third EP, Leeway. Since then, they have toured with the likes of Metronomy, Goldfrapp, Slow Club, King Charles, Michael Kiwanuka and Villagers. 2014 saw them play at Glastonbury, Reading, Leeds and Lovebox, among other festivals, as well as Solidays in France and Parkpop in the Netherlands. We Were Evergreen wrote and recorded the soundtrack to 2013 French film Fonzy. The Michael Creange and WEKEED remix of their song \\"Baby Blue\\" was featured in Kim Chapiron's film La Crème de la Crème as well as in the launch video for the Nokia Lumia 625. After changing their name to Evergreen, the band released their second album Overseas in June 2018. Featuring songs both in French and English, the album tackles the themes of borders, identity and language, with the sea as a central motif. ==DiscographyEP=== * We Were Evergreen - 2010 * Flings - 2010 * Leeway - 2013 * Aux Echos - 2017 ===Albums=== * Towards - 2014 * Overseas - 2018 Towards was released on 5 May 2014 by Island Records in the UK and Because Music in France, Belgium and Switzerland. It was recorded and mixed in Brixton's Iguana Studios, with Charlie Andrew (producer of Alt-J, Sivu and Marika Hackman). The album was described as \\"smart pop that keeps its charm\\" (Clash), \\"considered but playful\\" (The 405), \\"a sublime, varied LP that’s a perfect accompaniment to the impending sun-pecked skies\\" (music OMH). The first three singles from the album were 'Daughters', 'False Start' and 'Best Thing'. The video for 'Daughters', directed by Dominique Rocher, is a take on the Danaids myth based on overlapping choreography, and shot in a single take as well as a single room. \\"Towards\\" was released on December 2d, 2014 in the USA via Minty Fresh. \\"Overseas\\" was released on June 15th, 2018 by Because Music.

It contains programs that can search for similar protein sequences in protein sequence databases. Sequence searches are a standard tool in modern biology with which the function of unknown proteins can be inferred from the functions of proteins with similar sequences. HHsearch and HHblits are two main programs in the package and the entry point to its search function, the latter being a faster iteration. HHpred is an online server for protein structure prediction that uses homology information from HH-suite. The HH- suite searches for sequences using hidden Markov models (HMMs). The name comes from the fact that it performs HMM-HMM alignments. Among the most popular methods for protein sequence matching, the programs have been cited more than 5000 times total according to Google Scholar.Citations to HHpred, to HHsearch, to HHblits == Background == Proteins are central players in all of life's processes. Understanding them is central to understanding molecular processes in cells. This is particularly important in order to understand the origin of diseases. But for a large fraction of the approximately 20 000 human proteins the structures and functions remain unknown. Many proteins have been investigated in model organisms such as many bacteria, baker's yeast, fruit flies, zebra fish or mice, for which experiments can be often done more easily than with human cells. To predict the function, structure, or other properties of a protein for which only its sequence of amino acids is known, the protein sequence is compared to the sequences of other proteins in public databases. If a protein with sufficiently similar sequence is found, the two proteins are likely to be evolutionarily related (\\"homologous\\"). In that case, they are likely to share similar structures and functions. Therefore, if a protein with a sufficiently similar sequence and with known functions and/or structure can be found by the sequence search, the unknown protein's functions, structure, and domain composition can be predicted. Such predictions greatly facilitate the determination of the function or structure by targeted validation experiments. Sequence searches are frequently performed by biologists to infer the function of an unknown protein from its sequence. For this purpose, the protein's sequence is compared to the sequences of other proteins in public databases and its function is deduced from those of the most similar sequences. Often, no sequences with annotated functions can be found in such a search. In this case, more sensitive methods are required to identify more remotely related proteins or protein families. From these relationships, hypotheses about the protein's functions, structure, and domain composition can be inferred. HHsearch performs searches with a protein sequence through databases. The HHpred server and the HH-suite software package offer many popular, regularly updated databases, such as the Protein Data Bank, as well as the InterPro, Pfam, COG, and SCOP databases. == Algorithm == Iterative sequence search scheme of HHblits Modern sensitive methods for protein search utilize sequence profiles. They may be used to compare a sequence to a profile, or in more advanced cases such as HH-suite, to match among profiles. Profiles and alignments are themselves derived from matches, using for example PSI-BLAST or HHblits. A position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) profile contains for each position in the query sequence the similarity score for the 20 amino acids. The profiles are derived from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), in which related proteins are written together (aligned), such that the frequencies of amino acids in each position can be interpreted as probabilities for amino acids in new related proteins, and be used to derive the \\"similarity scores\\". Because profiles contain much more information than a single sequence (e.g. the position-specific degree of conservation), profile- profile comparison methods are much more powerful than sequence-sequence comparison methods like BLAST or profile-sequence comparison methods like PSI- BLAST. HHpred and HHsearch represent query and database proteins by profile hidden Markov models (HMMs), an extension of PSSM sequence profiles that also records position-specific amino acid insertion and deletion frequencies. HHsearch searches a database of HMMs with a query HMM. Before starting the search through the actual database of HMMs, HHsearch/HHpred builds a multiple sequence alignment of sequences related to the query sequence/MSA using the HHblits program. From this alignment, a profile HMM is calculated. The databases contain HMMs that are precalculated in the same fashion using PSI- BLAST. The output of HHpred and HHsearch is a ranked list of database matches (including E-values and probabilities for a true relationship) and the pairwise query-database sequence alignments. HHblits, a part of the HH-suite since 2001, builds high-quality multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) starting from a single query sequence or a MSA. As in PSI-BLAST, it works iteratively, repeatedly constructing new query profiles by adding the results found in the previous round. It matches against a pre-built HMM databases derived from protein sequence databases, each representing a \\"cluster\\" of related proteins. In the case of HHblits, such matches are done on the level of HMM-HMM profiles, which grants additional sensitivity. Its prefiltering reduces the tens of millions HMMs to match against to a few thousands of them, thus speeding up the slow HMM-HMM comparison process. The HH-suite comes with a number of pre-built profile HMMs that can be searched using HHblits and HHsearch, among them a clustered version of the UniProt database, of the Protein Data Bank of proteins with known structures, of Pfam protein family alignments, of SCOP structural protein domains, and many more. == Applications == Applications of HHpred and HHsearch include protein structure prediction, complex structure prediction, function prediction, domain prediction, domain boundary prediction, and evolutionary classification of proteins. HHsearch is often used for homology modeling, that is, to build a model of the structure of a query protein for which only the sequence is known: For that purpose, a database of proteins with known structures such as the protein data bank is searched for \\"template\\" proteins similar to the query protein. If such a template protein is found, the structure of the protein of interest can be predicted based on a pairwise sequence alignment of the query with the template protein sequence. For example, a search through the PDB database of proteins with solved 3D structure takes a few minutes. If a significant match with a protein of known structure (a \\"template\\") is found in the PDB database, HHpred allows the user to build a homology model using the MODELLER software, starting from the pairwise query-template alignment.

Boetticher later said \\"Audie got in real trouble with some people in Las Vegas, and he needed a director to make a picture, and he would be the producer. He was a friend, and he was in trouble, so I made the picture for him.

He studied medicine in Graz and Vienna, where he showed interest in psychoanalysis and attended lectures of Sigmund Freud. He graduated in 1922. Betlheim specialised in neuropsychiatry in Vienna, Berlin, Zürich, and Paris. During his specialisation, he published six articles in distinguished Austrian and German neurological or neuropsychiatric journals. ==Career and later life== He worked at the Vienna neuropsychiatric clinic headed by Julius Wagner-Jauregg. After the first analysis with Paul Schilder, Betlheim completed his training with Sandor Rado. Betlheim's first analyses were supervised by Karen Horney and Helene Deutsch. He returned to Zagreb in 1928. During World War II, in 1941, the Independent State of Croatia authorities sent Betlheim, Stjepan Steiner and 80 other Jewish physicians to Bosnia to treat endemic syphilis. He later escaped and joined Partisans. After the war, in 1948, he became an assistant at the Neurologic-psychiatric Clinic of the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, where he introduced the psychoanalytical dimension into the understanding of mental illness. He became a member of the International Psychoanalytical Association in 1952. Betlheim further developed the group therapy for sexual disorders. In 1953 Betlheim founded the ambulatory psychotherapeutic ward, the first in Croatia, at the neurologic-psychiatric Clinic of the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb and neuropsychiatric clinic at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb. Parallel to his therapeutic work, Betlheim was also a prolific scientist and teacher. ==Personal life and death== Betlheim was married to Marie Luise (née Morgenroth) with whom he had a daughter named Ruth. Until his death Betlheim treated patients, taught and did scientific research. He was buried at the Mirogoj Cemetery.

He was said by some to be illegitimate, although this was later contradicted.Carlyle, Edward Irving \\"John de St Paul\\" Dictionary of National Biography 1885–1900 Vol. 50 p.173 ==Early career== He was appointed a clerk in the English Chancery in around 1318 and became rector of Ashby David in Lincoln in 1329, the first of numerous clerical benefices he was to receive, of which probably the most important was the office of Archdeacon of Cornwall. From 1334 he was regularly appointed guardian of the Great Seal in the absence of the Lord Chancellor and in 1337 he became Master of the Rolls. He was granted a house in Chancery Lane in the city of London in 1339. He was briefly Lord Keeper of the Great Seal in 1339.Carlyle p.173 ==Disgrace== In 1340 King Edward III, while engaged in the Siege of Tournai, received numerous complaints of acts of corruption and maladministration committed by his officials. He returned to England with great speed, and dismissed most of the offending officials, including St Paul, who was imprisoned and deprived of the Mastership of the Rolls. After a personal plea for clemency on his behalf by the Archbishop of Canterbury, John de Stratford, St Paul was soon released from custody, but he was not restored to the Mastership.Carlyle p.173 ==Archbishop of Dublin== In 1349 he was made Archbishop of Dublin.Ball p.80 He received a commission from Pope Clement VI to proceed against certain heretics who, having fled from the Diocese of Ossory, had been sheltered by his predecessor in the See of Dublin, Alexander de Bicknor. He held a Synod in Dublin in 1351, which dealt with a wide range of issues, including the proper observance of Good Friday, the banning of secret marriages, and the ritual of genuflection.D'Alton, John Memoirs of the Archbishops of Dublin Dublin Hodges and Smith 1838 p.135 He maintained the long-running dispute with Richard FitzRalph, Archbishop of Armagh over the latter's claim to be Primate of Ireland. He persuaded the King to revoke his order which gave the See of Armagh precedence, and to remove the cause to Rome for the Pope's adjudication. He obtained numerous benefits for the Archdiocese of Dublin.Carlyle p.173 His extensive additions to Christ Church Cathedral, which he undertook at his own expense, included the long choir (1358) and the new organ. Most of his innovations, including the \\"long quire\\" were destroyed in the 1870s, when the interior of the cathedral was altered beyond recognition. Christchurch Cathedral-Archbishop de St Paul built the choir and installed the organ. He is buried under the high altar. Few traces of his work survive today. ==Chancellor and statesman== He was Lord Chancellor of Ireland, with one brief interval, from 1350 to 1356.Ball p.80 In 1358 he was appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland, and the Lord Deputy of Ireland was instructed to pay great heed to his advice. He sat on a Royal Commission to explore for and oversee gold and silver mines in 1360. In 1361 he was summoned to a Great Council in Dublin: although he was a strong supporter of English rule in Ireland, he urged a policy of moderation and an amnesty for Anglo-Irish leaders who had been in opposition to the Crown.Carlyle p.173 He also advised that the gentry of the Pale should live permanently on their estates and fortify their homes.D'Alton ==Death== He died on 9 September 1362 and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, which he had done much to improve at his own expense, under the high altar.Ball p.80 ==References== Category:Archbishops of Dublin Category:Lord Chancellors of Ireland Category:Masters of the Rolls Category:Members of the Privy Council of Ireland Category:1290s births Category:1362 deaths Category:People from the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster Category:Clergy from Yorkshire ","title":"John de St Paul"},{"id":"35881647","text":"Watford Football Club is an English football club based in Watford, Hertfordshire.

Watford's first opponents were 1. FC Kaiserslautern. Watford lost the first leg 3–1, however a 3–0 win at Vicarage Road saw them safely through to the second round, where they faced Levski Spartak, a Bulgarian side. A 1–1 draw in Hertfordshire was followed up with a 3–1 win after extra time in the Vasil Levski National Stadium, ensuring Watford's progress to the third round. The draw matched Watford with Czechoslovakian club AC Sparta Prague. At home, Watford went 2–0 down in the first half however recovered to 2–2 with goals from Wilf Rostron and Jimmy Gilligan but a late winner from substitute Zdeněk Ščasný sunk the Yellows.

A major storm sank 25 ships out of a fleet of 28 sheltering in the bay, and some 5,000 people were drowned.https://hdnh.es/el-desastre-naval-de-la-herradura/ King Philip II of Spain had gathered a fleet in Málaga to relieve Spanish-held Oran, which was under siege by the Ottoman Empire. On October 18, 28 galleys, loaded with supplies, soldiers and their families, set sail under the command of Juan de Mendoza y Carrillo, Captain General of the Galleys of Spain. A strong easterly storm blew up, so Mendoza took shelter in La Herradura Bay. This is a horseshoe-shaped bay, opening towards the south-west. On the morning of October 19 the storm unexpectedly returned, now blowing from the south and turning into a cyclone. Despite efforts to beach the ships, high winds and waves threw them onto each other and the rocks of the Punta de la Mona headland. Of the 28 galleys, 25 sank and between 3,000 and 5,000 people died. The surviving ships were La Soberana, Mendoza and San Juan on the seaward side of the fleet that were blown eastward around Punta de la Mona into more sheltered waters. Some 2,000 people rescued themselves by swimming ashore. Many of them were naked galley slaves who were unburdened by the boots, clothing and armour of the sailors and soldiers but who then survived harsh months of winter weather and starvation before being recaptured. This was a true disaster for the Spanish Navy, which had just suffered a terrible defeat in the Battle of Djerba. Nevertheless, Oran and Mers El Kébir were successfully defended against the Ottomans. In 1604, author Miguel de Cervantes – who himself fought aboard galleys in the Battle of Lepanto – referred to the event in his book Don Quixote: A plaque with this quote can be found near the town's Saint Joseph’s church. A monument on La Herradura’s seafront commemorates the tragedy. Erected in 1990, it is by Granada-based sculptor Miguel Moreno. ==ReferencesSources== *Naufrágio en La Herradura *La Herradura Monument *El naufrágio del Capitano Category:Maritime incidents in Spain Category:1562 in Spain Category:Maritime disasters ","title":"La Herradura naval disaster"},{"id":"35881700","text":"Francisco Rivera Jr. (born October 8, 1981) is an American mixed martial artist who last competed in the Bantamweight division of the UFC.

The movie made its international premiere at the Cannes Film Festival and went on to play at numerous festivals around the world, including the London Film Festival, Deauville American Film Festival, and the Los Angeles Film Festival. It was released theatrically in France by Diaphana in January 2013, IFC Films/Sundance Selects in the U.S. on March 22, 2013 and by Soda Pictures in the U.K. in May 2013.http://www.sodapictures.com/cinema/206/ ==ReceptionCritical response=== The film received positive reviews. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives a score of 92% based on 64 reviews. Metacritic, another review aggregation website, assigned the film a score of 81 out of 100, based on 27 reviews from mainstream critics. Roger Ebert called it, “A remarkably natural and unaffected film about friendship between two high-spirited graffiti artists” and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone in his 3.5 star review said the movie is, “A fresh, funky jolt of filmmaking joy.” A.O. Scott of The New York Times wrote that, “Adam Leon’s loose and rambunctious debut… has a lot to say about the contradictions of a place that is defined by both abundant opportunity and ferocious inequality. But the film makes its points in a lighthearted, street-smart vernacular, treating its protagonists not as embodiments of a social condition but rather as self-aware individuals who are, like teenagers everywhere, both smart and dumb. Their friendship — which is based above all on shared artistic ambitions — is a perfect comic pairing.” Other notable positive reviews included the Los Angeles Times, Christian Science Monitor, NPR, Entertainment Weekly, Chicago Tribune, The Wall Street Journal, and Chicago Sun-Times, whose Sheila O’Malley wrote, “Adam Leon has created something unique and current, with affectionate nods to New York films of the past.” ===Box office=== Released on March 22, 2013 in the United States, Gimme the Loot opened to the highest per screen average in the country. ===Accolades=== Along with the winning the Grand Jury Prize at the 2012 SXSW Film Festival, Gimme the Loot was nominated for Best First Feature and won the Someone to Watch Award for director Adam Leon at the 2013 Independent Spirit Awards. Adam Leon received a Gotham Award nomination for Bingham Ray Breakthrough Director in 2013.

Noneto) was a tango ensemble set up by Ástor Piazzolla which was active between 1971 and 1972. The short-lived ensemble was based on Piazzolla’s first Quinteto, comprising Astor Piazzolla (bandoneon), Osvaldo Manzi (later Osvaldo Tarantino (piano), Antonio Agri, (violin), Oscar López Ruiz (electric guitar) and Kicho Díaz (double bass). To this he added a quartet comprising Hugo Baralis (2nd violin), Néstor Panik (viola), José Bragato (cello) and José Corriale (percussion). For many musicologists this was the ensemble in which Piazzolla reached the zenith of his musical career. Thanks to the presence of a string quartet within the formation, Piazzolla was able to evolve a more complex contrapuntal language, to which was added the rhythmical improvisations of the piano, guitar and percussion, providing a language close to that of cool jazz and rock, a tendency which would become more accentuated in the later European stage of Piazzolla’s career. The Noneto recorded the albums Música popular contemporánea de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Vol. 1 y 2, published in 1971 and 1972, respectively. There are also recordings of them accompanying the singers Amelita Baltar and Mina, and of the music from Bernardo Bertolucci’s film Last Tango in Paris. Some of this music was not used in the film due to its late completion by Piazzolla, who was busy preparing for his first concert at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires in 1972. Bertolucci employed Gato Barbieri to complete the music and that part of Piazzolla’s music that was completed late was used for Francesco Rosi’s film Cadáveri eccelenti in 1976. In 1972 Piazzolla composed the three movement Concierto de Nácar, for the Conjunto 9 and orchestra, one of his most complex compositions which incorporated various techniques of contemporary music composition, such as polyrhythm and polytonality. Within a year of its formation the Conjunto 9 had run into financial problems and was dissolved in 1972. Piazzolla re-formed the Conjunto 9 in 1983, with some changes in its formation, for his second concert at the Teatro Colón on 11 June where they played together with the Buenos Aires Philharmonic, conducted by Pedro Ignacio Calderón. The programme included his Concerto for bandoneon and orquestra and Concierto de Nácar. This time the Noneto was made up of: Astor Piazzolla (bandoneon), Pablo Ziegler (piano), Fernando Suárez Paz, (violin), Oscar López Ruiz (electric guitar) and Héctor Console (double bass) plus Hugo Baralis (2nd violin), Delmar Quarleri (viola), José Bragato (cello) and Enrique Roizner (percussion). ==Discography== *Música Popular Contemporánea de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, vol. 1, (1971) *Música Popular Contemporánea de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, vol. 2, (1972) *El gordo triste, a recording of Amelita Baltar, who is accompanied by the Noneto in the tango Los paraguas de Buenos Aires, (1972) *Roma 1972, recording of a concert on 10 April 1972 in the Instituto Ítalo Estadounidense in Rome (1994). *Signori...: Mina!, recording of a concert in April 1972 in the Teatro 10 in Rome where Mina sang Balada para mi muerte accompanied by Conjunto 9 (1972). *Astor Piazzolla y su Conjunto 9, recording which contains the compositions Jeanne et Paul and El penúltimo for the film Last tango in Paris (1972). *Astor Piazzolla en el Teatro Colón, recording of a concert on 11 June 1983. ==References== *Natalio Gorin, Piazzolla: A Memoir, Amadeus Press 2001. *Azzi and Collier, Le Grand Tango: The Life and Music of Ástor Piazzolla, Oxford University Press, 2000.

As Raleigh's chief designer he designed the company's best selling Chopper bicycle. He drew the design for the Chopper on an envelope as he travelled home from the USA, in 1967, inspired to replicate the design of Peter Fonda's character's motorbike in the film Easy Rider. He came up with his drawing as he flew home from the trip, set up for him to \\"get-to-grips\\" with youth culture. In the 1980s, production of the Chopper ceased when the rival BMX hit the market, but, due to popular demand, a limited edition Chopper was released in 2004. Oakley married twice. His first marriage, in 1954, was to Brenda Wilson; the couple had a son and daughter. Oakley was married to Karen Francis from 1992 until his death. Oakley died from cancer, aged 85. ==Early life and education== Oakley was born on 27 April 1927 in Netherfield, Nottinghamshire, a small town three miles (5 km) east of Nottingham. The son of a local printer, he was educated at the all-boys Chandos Street School (which amalgamated in 1973 to form Carlton le Willows School). Leaving education at 15, Oakley joined the Raleigh Bicycle Company as a trainee draughtsman, producing fuses and turning-out cartridges; war-effort duties that diminished his early involvement in bicycle engineering. Intrigued by aircraft, he joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1941 and later obtained a qualification in mechanical engineering from the University of Nottingham. ==References * Obituary in The Independent Category:1927 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of Nottingham Category:Deaths from cancer in England Category:Cycle designers Category:English designers Category:English mechanical engineers Category:People educated at Carlton le Willows Academy Category:People from Nottingham Category:Place of death missing Category:Royal Air Force personnel of World War II ","title":"Alan Oakley (designer)"},{"id":"35881774","text":"Student (, Stýdent) is a 2012 Kazakhstani drama film directed by Darezhan Omirbaev.

The Malvern Hills Bill was in preparation to modernise some of the clauses in previous acts a clause was inserted to gain authority to rebuild the cafe. Five members of the House of Lords Select Committee visited the Malvern Hills and decided that there were enough facilities in the immediate area and that St Ann's Well cafe should be enough provision on the hills, so the application to rebuild was turned down. The cost of implementing the 1995 Act was approximately £250,000. ==Overview== The 1995 Act gave the Malvern Hills Conservators further powers to: * Purchase or lease buildings off their land and refurbish them for use as offices, information centres and residential accommodation for employees; * Dispose of land by sale, exchange or letting; * Increase the number of refreshment stalls permitted on their land from three to six; * Set aside money from their general fund to create a fund to purchase further land; * Grant easements; * Impose fines under the Byelaws; * Restrict public access to their land, in consultation with other bodies, for a reasonable period to protect ancient monuments, sites of natural beauty, trees and flora and fauna and in the interests of public safety; * Regulate horse riding; * Remove placards, abandoned machinery and vehicles and to dispose of them after a specified period; * Permit temporary lavatories for special events. ==See also== Malvern Hills Conservators ==References *Malvern Hills Conservators *Malvern Hills Act 1995 c. iii *Malvern Hills Bill Hansard, 8 March 1993 *Malvern Hills Bill Hansard, 15 February 1994 *Malvern Hills Conservators National Archive Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1995 Category:Common land in the United Kingdom Category:Malvern Hills ","title":"Malvern Hills Act 1995"},{"id":"35881793","text":"The New England Glassworks was a short-lived glass-making factory located in Temple, New Hampshire in the 1780s, and one of the first glassworks in the United States. Founded in 1780 by Robert Hewes, a Boston-based businessman, the glassworks employed Hessian deserters from the British forces of the American Revolutionary War. The glassworks was established in 1780 and failed due to a lack of financing in 1783. Its abandoned site was excavated in the 1970s, and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==History== The remote site (on the outer portions of rural Temple, near its border with Sharon) was chosen because of ready access to trees for firewood, necessitating the hauling of other materials to the site. The factory was beset by financial and logistical difficulties which ultimately led to its failure. The first building, constructed at Hewes' expense, was destroyed by fire not long after its completion. The glass furnaces were damaged by frost before rebuilding was completed, after which Hewes appealed first to the town and then the state for additional financial support. In 1781 the state authorized a lottery to raise up to £2,000 in support of the effort. The lottery was a failure, and the glassworks eventually failed. The quality of its products (window glass, bottles, and similar household items) was not particularly good, since the sand used in the glass was apparently sourced locally and of poor quality. ==Archeology== The glassworks site was excavated in the 1970s, in what archeologist David Starbuck in 2006 termed \\"the largest industrial dig ever conducted\\" in New Hampshire.Starbuck, p. 158 According to artifacts recovered there, the site produced window glass, small bottles, and \\"vessels suitable for chemistry\\".Starbuck, p. 159 The main glasshouse was determined to be about square, containing a glass furnace of German design.

The designers of the building, Paul Herbé and Jean Le Couteur, along with engineer René Sarger, were inspired by the Gospel of John. Its nave measures long and wide. The church is noted for its central tower. At the entrance to the nave there are small organs offered by the parish of Boufarik opposite which is a mosaic. The mural dates to 324, from the first Roman basilica of Castellum Tingitanum (Chlef).

He was the seventh child in a family of 4 sons and 3 daughters raised by August Wilhelm Langschmidt (*8 June 1754), a wealthy merchant of Grabow, and his wife Dorothea Elisabeth Höpcker (*6 September 1774). Wilhelm was expected to take up the profession of merchant, but showed little interest in such a career, and instead had a great passion for painting. In 1826 he turned to the Mecklenburg Grand Duke Friedrich Franz for support, but was rejected. For a while he studied in Berlin under Prof. Kretsch, and decided to emigrate to South Africa, but not before marrying Dorothea Ahrens from Ludwigslust, 18 years his junior. The couple landed in Cape Town on 2 March 1840, where Langschmidt lived and worked until 1851. He was active as a miniaturist, and portrait and landscape painter, working mainly in oils, pastels and chalks. He also ran drawing classes and was a competent lithographer. A supporter of the Anti-Convict movement, he destroyed a portrait he had painted of the Governor, Sir Harry Smith, at an anti-convict meeting. Returning to his merchant roots in 1856, Langschmidt bought the farm \\"Grietjiesgat\\" and started a trading store, around which in due course the town of Grabouw grew, named for his German hometown. Langschmidt is assumed to have eventually retired to his farm \\"Gustrow\\", also near Elgin in the Western Cape. He had at least 18 children, some sources citing 23, including 3 sets of twins.

She is graduated in Modern History and is currently working as a researcher for the university where she deals with religious history and Church's institutions. She lives in Rome. == La Panzanella == \\"La Panzanella\\" (2009), the first book by Giulia Villoresi, tells the story of Carlotta, ugly duckling teenager. Among episodes, memories and thoughts the writer talks about the difficult growth and the constant search of love and beauty. Carlotta Cordelli named \\"Panzanella\\" or \\"Gnoccolona\\" because of his extra pounds, is a Roman girl of Neapolitan descent. Beautiful daughter of a fascinating mother and granddaughter of charming grandparents, she sees herself ugly, fat and clumsy and she feels excluded from the universe of its peers for its diversity: It is not only the physical to make it different, but also the uninterrupted flow of thoughts and reflections, between dream and philosophy accompanying the course of his days. The novel, as a sort of diary, recounts the life of Carlotta: the wickedness of the Nuns of the elementary school with the first sufferings and first rejects, the years of the middle school and the transformation of the body, the bitter discovery of sexuality, the desire to be different and anarchic, cigarettes smoked in secret, the Saturday night life, the holidays and the trip to Amsterdam, the one to Athens, the experience of death and torture, adventures with older boys, the attempts of losing weight, the Light Night in Rome, etc.. Then she will meet the true love, but it will not cure all the thoughts of the girl and her sense of inadequacy to the world. This love will be another piece of life that could help her to grow up. \\"“Volevo essere adeguata ma non possedevo il segreto. La bellezza e l’amore erano le due cose a cui ancora pensavo di più”. (\\"I wanted to be appropriate, but I did not possess the secret. The beauty and love were the two things that I thought even more. \\") Carlotta is the emblem of a lazy, lonely and depressed generation, looking for something to believe which prevent her to recognize the value of the present. The author was able to tell with witty humor and an immediate style, typical of the thought, a story of hardship and passage from adolescence to adulthood.

Jaswant's day starts when he wakes, and it could be early morning or late evening. Then one day one of his friends, Sansar, introduces a young man named Amal, a photographer by profession, and Jaswant hires him on the spot, with a generous salary and accommodations. Amal accompanies Jaswant everyone, including his frequent trips to assorted courtesans, and takes vivid photographs. Then Jaswant meets with an eligible young girl and marries her. A few years later she gives birth to a son, Naresh. Jaswant finds out that Amal has been taking an unusual interest in Naresh, including scolding him so that he can stop following Jaswant's footsteps. Jaswant warns Amal, only to find out that Amal has slapped Naresh. An enraged Jaswant fires Amal. Seventeen years later, India is free from British rule, Jaswant is widowed, Amal is being released from prison along with other freedom fighters, and Naresh is to get married soon. It is then Jaswant comes across a locket that once belonged to his wife. Jaswant opens the locket hoping to see his photograph, but is stunned when he sees another man photo in the locket.

After blowing a few, Felix is asked by the kitten to make one to ride in. Felix then makes the bubble, and the kitten starts to float away in it. Much to their surprise, the bubble is too difficult to burst, and Felix goes on to chase his airborne companion for hundreds of miles. Finally the bubble reaches the Arctic and settles to the surface. Felix at last opens the sphere and frees the kitten. While they are traveling home, darkness falls, and the two cats are separated without realizing. To deal with the situation, Felix blows lantern bubbles to brighten the place. The Arctic became a beautiful lighted paradise, but a local bear does not appreciate it and therefore goes to confront Felix. To defend himself against the fearsome bruin, Felix shields himself in a bubble. The bear then pushes Felix's bubble into a hole in the ice cap where it sinks into the water. Once more, Felix feels he is untouchable until an eel is able to penetrate his protective orb. Although other eels pack themselves into the bubble, Felix is able to slip out. He then carries the eel-filled bubble all the way home. Upon reaching a seafood store in a city, Felix sells the eels he has, receiving a sackful of cash. While celebrating his earnings, he suddenly remembers about his little buddy who is still missing. Lost in some wilderness, the kitten is weeping and does not know what to do.

He was little more than a schoolchild when he was invited to play for the Murroe and Boher teams, however, he quickly established himself on the Cappamore team, winning a Murphy Cup medal in 1897. Mulcahy later played with the Commercials club in Dublin and won five county senior championship medals. Mulcahy joined the Limerick senior team in 1896 and enjoyed much success during his brief tenure with the team. He was the full-forward on the team that won All-Ireland, Munster and Croke Cup titles in 1897. Mulcahy later joined the Dublin senior team and added a Leinster medal to his collection in 1902. He played his last inter-county match in May 1908. ==Honours== ;Cappamore *Murphy Cup (1): 1897 ;Commercials *Dublin Senior Hurling Championship (5): 1899, 1905, 1907, 1909, 1916 ;Limerick *All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (1): 1897 *Munster Senior Hurling Championship (1): 1897 * Croke Cup (1): 1897 ;Dublin *Leinster Senior Hurling Championship (1): 1902 ==References== Category:1877 births Category:1953 deaths Category:Cappamore hurlers Category:Limerick inter-county hurlers Category:Dublin inter-county hurlers Category:All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship winners ","title":"Pat Mulcahy (Limerick hurler)"},{"id":"35882233","text":"Jim or James Cronin may refer to: * Jim Cronin (zookeeper) (1951–2007), founder of Monkey World, Dorset, England, a sanctuary for abused and neglected primates * Jim Cronin (baseball) (1905–1983), American Major League Baseball infielder * Jim Cronin (soccer) (1906–1942), American soccer player * James Cronin (1931–2016), American particle physicist * James Cronin (rugby union) (born 1990), Irish rugby union player * James Cronin, founder of the Ceroc dance club ","title":"Jim Cronin"},{"id":"35882240","text":"Princess Athena of Denmark (Athena Marguerite Françoise Marie; born 24 January 2012), is the younger child and only daughter of Prince Joachim and Princess Marie of Denmark.

The first part aired on October 22, 2014, and the second on October 29, 2014 on the cable network FX. The first part was written by James Wong and directed by Michael Uppendahl and the second part was written by Jennifer Salt and directed by Howard Deutch. The episode's first part introduces the main characters of Stanley (Denis O'Hare) and Maggie Esmerelda (Emma Roberts), it also stars Wes Bentley as the title character of the episode. The second part of the episode deals with the backstories of several characters including Twisty the Clown (John Carroll Lynch). ==PlotPart 1=== At the American Morbidity Museum, Stanley, disguised as Dr. Sylvester Mansfield, and his assistant Maggie, disguised as a Miss Rothschild, attempt to sell a specimen to the museum. The curator runs a background check on Stanley and determines his credentials are fraudulent. The museum guide says that they would pay handsomely for a legitimate specimen, some of which they get from freak shows. Learning that one of the two remaining freak shows is in Florida, the pair set out. Ethel visits Dr. Myron Bonham, who diagnoses her with cirrhosis of the liver. Her prognosis is dire: six months to a year. Back at the freak show, the carnies explain that they will not be performing on Halloween by telling the twins about the legend of Edward Mordrake: a noble Englishman with a second, whispering face on the back of his head. His failed attempts to kill the face drove him insane, and his family sent him to Bethlem Royal Hospital. He escaped to a freak show where one Halloween night, he murdered his entire troupe and then hanged himself. The legend says that if they perform on Halloween, he will appear and take a soul. When Jimmy criticizes Ethel, she corroborates that it happened to her former troupe. She has been drinking, which will accelerate her demise. Jimmy confronts her, but she waves him off. At Mott Manor, Dora is dressed in costume as Woody Woodpecker, Dandy throws a tantrum after Gloria gives him a box containing a Howdy Doody costume. Dandy decides to craft the pieces into a clown costume. Later, Dandy dressed in the costume, threatens Dora with a knife. She tells him that she is aware of his animal kills, and that he does not \\"have the guts\\" to kill a human. He tells her to mind her own business and that he hates her, he runs away and she mutters that the feeling is mutual. In a Palm Beach neighborhood, Jessie, is teased by her older brother Mike. Twisty approaches from behind him. Mike screams, causing their mother to run upstairs. She asks where Mike went – Jessie points to her bedroom's open window. Maggie arrives at the freak show claiming to be a fortune teller in need of a job. Jimmy tries to convince Elsa that Maggie is the real deal. Maggie begins a demonstration, using her observations to deduce who Elsa is and what she wants to know. Maggie claims to see a song from Elsa with thunderous applause and that further, a refined man with dark hair will guide Elsa to stardom. Elsa hires her. Later from a payphone, Maggie calls Stanley to tell him about the horror of working with the freaks. Stanley is excited about the prospective gold mine that she has found, though Maggie hedges about murdering them. In the trailer, Dell pumps iron while Desiree tries to get his libido going. When she complains, Dell gets violent and demands respect. Desiree tells him to get off her or he will never see her again, then she leaves the trailer. Frustrated, Dell also leaves and passes Ethel. She first questions what the fight was about, then asks him questions about their past. He tells her that the love they had was not real, but admits he should have been a better father to Jimmy. She demands that Dell never reveal to Jimmy that Dell is his father. Dell gets curious, and Ethel reveals she is dying. She asks Dell to guide and take care of Jimmy. Bette has a nightmare of surgical separation from Dot, who seems to relish the idea. Dot tells Bette she will find a doctor to separate them, even if one dies just so the other can have a shot at happiness. The girls go to rehearse, unafraid of the Mordrake legend. Paul and Eve try to stop them when Elsa enters, refusing to believe in superstitions. Dot asks Elsa to wait so they can rehearse first, but Elsa demands that the carnies get to their instruments. She sings Lana Del Rey's \\"Gods and Monsters\\". As she sings, Edward Mordrake emerges in a green mist on the freak show grounds and, entranced by the music, enters the tent to watch Elsa. In Ethel's trailer, Mordrake appears. He confirms the superstition is true. He says the second face is a lie detector, and asks for the story of how she ended up in her current predicament. In flashback, Ethel once had a popular burlesque show with Dell. When he told her to go solo as a classical actor, the show failed miserably. Mordrake's whispering face tells of a darker, deeper shame: Ethel admits that, in order to make money, Dell charged tickets for admission to the birth of Jimmy and, as soon as Jimmy was born, Dell started charging people to hold the \\"freak\\" baby. Mordrake is moved by her story. Ethel bows her head, saying she is ready to be taken, but Mordrake disappears. Dandy visits the bus captives and tries to lure them with candy so that he can stab them, but is interrupted when Twisty brings an unconscious Mike. ===Part 2=== Mordrake continues to seek a \\"pure freak\\" for his spirit troupe. He visits Suzi and Paul, who tell their respective stories. Suzi reveals she had a spinal condition which required doctors to remove her legs at age two. Her parents gave up hope soon after her operation and left her on the doorstep of a children's home. She later stabbed a man she was street-begging with due to frustration. Paul was born with his condition, and reveals that he planned to have his entire body tattooed, but insisted on stopping before his face was covered – he has a handsome face that \\"could have ruled the world\\" with a normal body. Mordrake passes on each one. He eventually reaches Elsa, who assumes he was awestruck by her singing performance, and insists that she needs \\"a new arranger\\" for her music. Mordrake becomes frustrated, and has his spirit troupe forcefully remove her prosthetic legs while she pleads that she is \\"not one of them\\". Elsa eventually tells her story. She worked as a dominatrix in a German brothel that catered to extreme and violent fetishes. She was eventually abducted and drugged to participate in a snuff film, in which she had her legs amputated; she was rescued by one of her clients afterwards. Mordrake's other face whispers that Elsa is \\"the one\\", and he prepares to kill her, but stops as he hears music. Meanwhile, Jimmy and Maggie venture into the woods in the dark to avoid being arrested for a curfew violation, and they witness Twisty chasing one of his captives, who has escaped. Twisty catches her and carries her back into the woods. Jimmy insists on following, to Maggie's dismay. They spy upon Twisty until they are beaten from behind by Dandy, dressed in the clown costume. They awaken to Dandy giving Twisty's earlier captives a show, with Twisty excitedly playing a toy piano. Dandy puts Maggie in a box and prepares to saw her in half when Jimmy breaks free and knocks Dandy away. Jimmy yells for the captives to run for safety as Dandy angrily rises. As Twisty is about to kill Jimmy, Jimmy's body disappears and Mordrake appears. Twisty is asked to tell his story, but first, he is ordered to remove his mask, to which he uncomfortably complies. He speaks slowly, and tells a story of how he was a regular clown in a traveling carnival entertaining children, but was constantly bullied by the carnies, who referred to him as \\"simpleton\\" and accused him of sexually abusing young patrons. Twisty flees the circus and began crafting toys out of garbage. Upon trying to sell the toys, he had a run-in with a shop owner, who inadvertently triggers memories of Twisty's abuse at the circus. Twisty attempted to commit suicide with a shotgun, but it is shown that he failed and mutilated his lower jaw. He later works at Elsa's freak show, now wearing his signature grinning mask to cover his grotesque jaw. Twisty says all of the children forgot how much they loved him, so he had the idea to create his own audience. The girl was abducted to be a babysitter for the children he intended to collect. He justifies his actions to Mordrake by claiming he saved the children from their \\"mean\\" parents, and calls himself a \\"good clown\\". Mordrake decides that Twisty is the one he wants, and stabs him to death as Jimmy watches while hiding. Twisty's spirit awakens surrounded by Mordrake's spirit troupe, who put their hands on him in acceptance. It is shown that Twisty's jaw is now normal again. Dandy stumbles across Twisty's dead body and dons his mask, implying that he plans to continue Twisty's murderous spree. Jimmy and Maggie have escaped and notified the police, who call them heroes for saving the captives. Jimmy tell the officers that Meep was a hero, and says that someone will pay for his death. Back at the freak show, Jimmy tells Elsa that Mordrake has claimed his victim, though he does not say who, and announces that the curfew has been lifted. A crowd has gathered to thank Jimmy for finding the children, and Elsa invites them to buy tickets to that evening's show, to which they comply, selling out the show. Elsa tells Dot and Bette that their act has been demoted as Stanley introduces himself as Richard Spencer, a talent scout from Hollywood, to Elsa. Dandy arrives home, still dressed in the clown outfit and wearing Twisty's mask. Dora yells at him for still being dressed up, and he slashes her throat. ==ReceptionReviews=== \\"Edward Mordrake\\" received positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, both Part I and Part II each have an approval rating of 75% based on 12 reviews. Part I's critical consensus reads: \\"Though stagnant at times, \\"Edward Mordrake, Pt. 1\\" gets into the Halloween spirit introducing new characters including the first supernatural element of the season.\\" Part II's critical consensus reads: \\"\\"Edward Mordrake Pt. 2\\" was a nice change-up from the first three episodes, giving more reasons to care about Freak Show's characters.\\" Reviewers praised Elsa and Twisty's backstories and particularly John Carroll Lynch's performance. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club gave the first part a B- rating, writing: \\"The love of a good shock often stands in for American Horror Story inability to scare: It's much easier to fleetingly startle than suggest that any of the primary characters are in mortal danger. 'Edward Mordrake (Part 1)' reinforces that difficulty... Freak Show is succeeding at making us care for these people; if only it could make us fear for them as well.\\" He gave the second part a C+ rating, criticising the idea to make Twisty the Clown into an origin story for Dandy, however he did praise the acting, particularly Finn Wittrock's. Matt Fowler of IGN gave \\"Edward Mordrake (Part 2)\\" a positive review, writing: \\"Freak Show, by dropping a few characters (like Dot/Bette, Dell, and Ethel), losing the obligatory song, and tightening its belt, got good this week. Mordrake wasn't frightening but the backstories he brought out of both Elsa and Twisty were haunting and ghoulish.\\" ===Ratings=== \\"Edward Mordrake (Part 1)\\" was watched by 4.44 million viewers and was the highest rated cable broadcast of the night. The episode received a 2.2 ratings share among adults 18–49, down 0.1 from the previous week's episode. \\"Edward Mordrake (Part 2)\\" was watched by 4.51 million viewers, a slight increase from the first part. Like the previous half, the episode was also the highest rated cable program for the night, with a 2.3 ratings share among adults 18–49. ==References== Category:2014 American television episodes Category:American Horror Story: Freak Show episodes Category:Halloween television episodes Category:Fiction about urban legends Category:Television episodes about the paranormal ","title":"Edward Mordrake (American Horror Story)"},{"id":"35882301","text":"Mar-Zutra II was a Jewish Exilarch who led a revolt against the Sasanian rulers in 495 CE and achieved seven years of political independence in Mahoza. Mar-Zutra II became Exilarch of the Jewish community in Babylon at the age of fifteen in 483 CE, twelve years before the revolt. After King Kavadh I denied Jews the right to organize their own militia, Mar-Zutra took advantage of the confusion into which Mazdak's communistic attempts had plunged Persia and led a successful military revolt that achieved political independence for the Jews of Mahoza. The Jewish state lasted seven years, until 502 CE, when Kavadh finally defeated Mar-Zutra and punished him with crucifixion on the bridge of Mahoza. A son was born to him on the day of his death, who would be named Mar- Zutra III. The latter did not attain to the office of Exilarch, but returned to the Land of Israel, where he became head of the Academy of Tiberias, under the title of \\"Resh Pirka\\" ('Aρχιφεκίτησ), several generations of his descendants succeeding him in this office. After Mar Zutra's death his successor Mar Ahunai did not dare to appear in public for almost thirty years following Mar-Zutra's defeat and it is not known whether he ever really acted as Exilarch following Kavadh's reign, which ended in 531 CE. ==References== Category:5th-century births Category:502 deaths Category:Exilarchs Category:People executed by crucifixion Category:Jewish rebels Category:5th- century Jews Category:6th-century Jews Category:Jews in the Sasanian Empire Category:People executed by the Sasanian Empire Category:Rebellions against the Sasanian Empire ","title":"Mar-Zutra II"},{"id":"35882310","text":"Gamze Bulut (; born August 3, 1992 in Eskişehir) is a Turkish female middle- distance runner and is currently on a four-year ban until May 29, 2020.

In 1918, during the final year of the First World War, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig was Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. Haig commanded the BEF in the defeat of the German Army's Spring Offensives, the Allied victory at Amiens in August, and the Hundred Days Offensive, which led to the war-ending armistice in November 1918.Sheffield 2001, p. 21.Sheffield, Gary. Forgotten Victory, p. 263.Hart 2008, p. 2. == Political manoeuvres  War Cabinet discussions === On 1 January Derby told Haig that he saved Robertson from the sack by threatening resignation. He also hinted to Haig that the government wanted the removal of Launcelot Kiggell (\\"a tired man\\") as BEF Chief of Staff, and that General Butler, Haig's preferred choice, was not acceptable.Sheffield & Bourne 2005, p369 Haig had an interview with the King (2 January) to pick up his Field Marshal's baton. Haig appears to have been placing too much faith in recent German peace feelers (\\"Germany is now ready, we are told, to give all we want in these respects\\"), now known not have been seriously intended. He told the King that British soldiers (who, in a large conscript army, now included men from \\"all classes in the nation, and many are most intelligent\\") needed to be told what they were fighting for. In Haig's view, Britain should keep to her original war aims – the defence of France and liberation of Belgium – not try to gain Alsace-Lorraine for France or Trieste for Italy. In Haig's view the \\"democratising of Germany\\", about to be publicly reiterated by Lloyd George as a British aspiration in his Caxton Hall speech (5 January), was likely to destabilise Germany, as the fall of the Tsar in March 1917 had destabilised Russia, and was not \\"worth the loss of an Englishman\\" (like many Scots of his era, Haig often referred to Britain or even the British Empire as \\"England\\").Harris 2008 p421 Haig attended a meeting of the War Cabinet (7 January). He claimed to have recommended that the British should keep the initiative and draw in German reserves (to prevent a German attack on the French) by renewing the offensive around Ypres, and that this proposal did not meet with political approval. In fact the logistical infrastructure was not available for a breakout from the Ypres salient, and there is no mention of his suggestion in the official minutes. The minutes do agree with Haig's account that he warned only of limited German offensives. After the meeting Robertson, who had also been present and who had been concerned that Haig had not got his point across, insisted that Haig submit a paper warning of the danger of a major German offensive. Over lunch (9 January) at 10 Downing Street with Lord Derby (Secretary of State for War) and Lloyd George (Derby bet a skeptical Lloyd George 100 cigars to 100 cigarettes that the war would be over by the following year), Haig predicted that the war would end within a year because of the \\"internal state of Germany\\" (a broadly accurate prediction). Charteris' final intelligence report had deduced that Germany was bringing 32 divisions, ten per month, from the moribund Eastern Front, so the most likely time for a German Offensive was in late March (again, a correct prediction). Bonar Law (Chancellor of the Exchequer and Conservative Leader) asked Haig what he would do if he were a German general: Haig replied that any German attempt to \\"break through\\" would be a \\"gambler's throw\\" as Germany had only a million men as reserves and the balance of manpower would shift in favour of the Allies in August (i.e. when more US troops had arrived – in fact this would happen a month or two earlier as US deployment was speeded up after the German Spring Offensives) and that if he were a German general he would launch only limited offensives, although he did warn that the German generals might try to keep the civilians out of power by launching an attack to knock out France. Haig again left the politicians with the impression that he thought the Germans would launch small attacks on the scale of Cambrai.Sheffield 2011, p.259-60Groot 1988, p.355-6Harris 2008 p422-3 === Manpower === As far back as 18 April 1917 Lloyd George had caused Hankey to draw up a memo recommending keeping \\"the War Office short (of men) to compel the soldiers to adopt tactics that will reduce the waste of manpower ... (and force the generals to make) careful substitution of elderly and partially fit men and coloured men ... behind the lines\\".Mead 2008, p323 A manpower committee under Lloyd George's chairmanship had given the Royal Navy, RFC, shipbuilding, food production and timber felling all higher priority than the Army. The War Cabinet allocated (9 January) 100,000 Category A men to the Western Front rather than the 615,000 demanded by the Army. Lloyd George discounted the Army's warnings and wrongly thought the Western Front secure.Harris 2008, p433-4 Between January and March the BEF received 174,379 men, including 32,384 Dominion troops and 7,359 non-combatants. Many of the troops were Category B, i.e. not fully fit for combat, but the extra manpower enabled fitter men to be \\"combed out\\" from non-combatant jobs behind the lines. The BEF's manpower shortage was not solely the fault of the politicians. 120,000 men of the BEF general reserve were kept in Britain to help the economy by spending their wages there. There were too many troops in the Middle East (2 divisions were rushed from there to France after the German offensive began), but this was partly the fault of Robertson who had attempted to prevent action there by submitting inflated estimates of troop requirements. 88,000 BEF men were on leave when the German offensive began. Haig seems to have had little sympathy with the government's political constraints – he was unhappy at their lack of vigour in conscripting organised labour (diary 23 December 1917, 10 March), whilst as late as 29 March, following the first German Spring Offensive, Haig would press for the extension of conscription to Ireland (not just for military reasons but \\"for the good of Ireland\\", and disagreeing with the King).Harris 2008, p433-5 Although there were about 1.5m soldiers under Home Forces Command in the UK at any one time, nearly a third of these were sick or wounded and another third engaged on legitimate work for various branches of the Army. Only around a third were potentially available for service on the Western Front, the majority of these being in training or under nineteen. Eighteen-year olds had to be sent to France after the German Spring Offensives in 1918.Robertson 1921, p343-4 Haig remonstrated in vain with Derby (10 January) about the promotion of his ally Lt-Gen Trenchard from command of the RFC (replaced by Maj-Gen John Salmond) to become Chief of Air Staff.Harris 2008 p423-4 On 14 January Haig wrote to his wife, apropos the loss of Trenchard, that Derby was \\"like the feather pillow, bear(ing) the mark of the last person who sat on him\\" and remarking that he was known in London as the \\"genial Judas\\".Sheffield & Bourne 2005 p372 The War Office ordered (10 January) a reduction in the size of British divisions from 12 infantry battalions to 9 and a reduction in BEF cavalry strength from 5 divisions to 3. 134 infantry battalions were disbanded or amalgamated, and another 7 converted to pioneers. By mid January Haig had 58 infantry divisions, down from 62. Fighting strength was cut by 70,000 – a drop of about 7%. On 13 January Herbert Lawrence (then Head of BEF Intelligence) told Haig that the Germans would not have sufficient superiority \\"to ensure a decisive victory\\", although intelligence estimates of German strength were to be sharply increased over coming weeks.Harris 2008, p435 Haig had used the need to send British troops to Italy after Caporetto as an excuse not to take over a section of French line, as had been agreed between the British and French governments in early October, but in January the Supreme War Council at Versailles recommended (SWC Joint Note 12 and Note 14) an extension of the British line to some point between the River Ailette and the Laon-Soissons road. Haig complained to his diary (14 January) that the British government were taking the advice of Henry Wilson and the \\"Versailles gentlemen (who have no responsibility)\\" but in practice he was being overruled. There is no evidence that he considered resignation. === Haig survives criticism === By now Haig's 1917 offensives were being criticised in the press. Lovat Fraser wrote a highly critical article (\\"Things Hidden\\") in Northcliffe's Daily Mail on 21 January. He wrote of the \\"ridiculous theory of \\"attrition\\" \\", the \\"strategy of the Stone Age\\" and advocated attacks on other fronts. Northcliffe was now an ally of Lloyd George but appears not to have agreed the exact details of the press campaign with the Prime Minister. In Parliament J. C. Wedgwood MP openly demanded a change of command.Harris 2008 p424Sheffield 2011, p.257Groot 1988, p.358-61 The purge of Haig's staff continued, with the appointment on 22 January of Herbert Lawrence as BEF Chief of Staff, in place of Lt-Gen Launcelot Kiggell. Lawrence was a much stronger character than Kiggell, and having made money in business and having no plans to stay in the Army after the War, was not beholden to Haig – actually in time the two men made a good team.Sheffield 2011, p.258 Haig also lost the Deputy Chief of General Staff, Maxwell (QuarterMaster General), the engineer in chief and the director-general of medical services. Even Terraine admits the changes strengthened the BEF.Wiest 2005, p90Groot 1988, p.359-60 The Cabinet Minister Jan Christiaan Smuts and the Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey, whom Lloyd George had contemplated appointing to Kiggell's job, were sent on a five-day mission to France coinciding with the Lovat Fraser article. On the first evening they met Haig at GHQ and assured him that Lloyd George had no wish to replace him, although they had in fact been tasked by the Prime Minister on 18 January \\"to find out who are the rising men\\" amongst the British generals. Hankey wrote that \\"the atmosphere of complaisant optimism that formerly pervaded GHQ\\" was now \\"conspicuous by its absence\\", that general opinion was that the US Army would not be ready for a major offensive before 1920, and that there was open talk, in which Haig participated, of a compromise peace, Haig being worried about the danger of France or Italy collapsing and believing that Britain had already gained more from the war than other powersIt is unclear what Haig meant by this. He may possibly, in J P Harris' view, have been referring to Britain's colonial gains in Africa and the Middle East and risked being left exhausted compared to the USA. Hankey also recorded that officers had been angered by the Lovat Fraser article. Over the next few days Hankey and Smuts took discreet soundings among the Army Commanders to see whether any of them were willing to replace Haig – none of them were. The only possibility seemed to be Claud Jacob, GOC II Corps. Hankey formed the opinion that nobody important amongst the British generals thought a major German attack likely.Groot 1988, p.360Harris 2008 p424-6 The Unionist War Committee (a committee of Conservative backbenchers) passed a resolution on 24 January in support of Haig and Robertson and demanding that the Prime Minister condemn Northcliffe's press campaign against Haig. Repington, now writing for the \\"Morning Post\\" and in a bizarre reversal of allegiances now effectively an ally of the generals – and using information clearly leaked by the War Office – attacked the government over manpower (24 January), complaining that the BEF was only to be given 100,000 Category \\"A\\" men. Asquith (Liberal Leader and Leader of the Opposition), then in France to visit his badly wounded son Arthur, visited Haig (26 January) and assured him that Northcliffe's campaign had backfired, although attacks against Robertson might continue.Harris 2008 p426-7 === General Reserve === At the Supreme War Council at the Trianon Palace Hotel, near Versailles (29 January – 2 February) Haig and Petain (French Commander-in-Chief) complained of shortage of troops. The BEF was facing a 100,000 manpower shortage by June 1918, whilst Petain talked of losing 25 divisions to natural wastage, but Haig's political credibility was so low that Hankey wrote that they \\"made asses of themselves\\". Haig argued against a common command, claiming that it would be \\"unconstitutional\\" for him to take orders from a foreign general. It was agreed that an Allied General Reserve be set up, under Foch with Henry Wilson as his deputy, but Haig argued that he did not have divisions to spare for this (worrying that they would be shipped off to fight the Turks but thinking the proposal would take time to be become operational) and suggested to the French Prime Minister Clemenceau (who was suspicious of Foch's ambition to become generalissimo, and whom Haig thought \\"the soundest and pluckiest of the lot ... a grand old man, full of go and determination\\") that he might resign. Lord Milner thought Haig's stance \\"desperately stupid\\", although in Sheffield's view Haig had a point that control of reserves by a committee was not necessarily sensible. Clemenceau attacked Lloyd George's wish to make offensives against Turkey top priority, and got Lloyd George to agree to delay offensives against the Turks for two months. Robertson openly opposed the Prime Minister; Haig did not speak in his defence, later writing that \\"LG never asked my opinion\\". On the last day the conference discussed the General Reserve and extension of line. Again, Haig did not openly oppose the government's plans, nor did he – at this stage – threaten to resign.Wiest 2005, p93Sheffield 2011, p.263Groot 1988, pp.361-2, 368-9Harris 2008 p427-8 By 4 February the BEF front had increased from 95 miles to 123 miles, an increase of almost 30%. Besides constructing his defences, for which he had inadequate labour, Gough was formally ordered (Instructions to Fifth Army 9 February, following recommendations by Tavish Davidson on 4 February) to construct defence in depth, including an \\"emergency defensive zone\\" along the Somme and Tortille rivers (which run roughly north–south south of Peronne), and a fortified bridgehead around Peronne, from whence \\"strong counterattacks\\" were to be conducted when Petain sent the promised reinforcements. GHQ possibly still thought that the main German attack might be elsewhere. Gough had too many men too far forward in positions too far apart to be mutually supporting.Groot 1988, p367Wiest 2005, p94 Harris 2008, p440 Whereas Fourth Army (as Second Army, under Rawlinson's command, was currently numbered) had 14 divisions holding 23 miles, First Army 16 divisions holding 33 miles and Third Army 16 divisions holding 28 miles, Fifth Army had only 14 divisions holding 42 miles. Lloyd George later claimed that Haig left his Fifth Army flank weak out of pique, a claim given some credence by Greenhalgh.Harris 2008, p437 === Fall of Robertson === Lloyd George now prepared for a showdown with Robertson, who was still unhappy over the handing over of British divisions to General Reserve. He proposed that the CIGS be reduced to his pre-1915 powers (i.e. reporting to the Secretary of State for War, not direct to the Cabinet) and that the British military representative at the Supreme War Council in Versailles be Deputy CIGS and a member of the Army Council (i.e. empowered to issue orders to Haig). He offered Robertson a choice of remaining as CIGS with reduced powers or else accepting demotion to Deputy CIGS at Versailles – either way, Lloyd George would now have been able to cut him out of the decision-making loop.Groot 1988, p.363-6 Letters from Derby (early February) make clear that he expected Haig to back him and Robertson. Derby summoned Haig back to London on Saturday 9 February, meeting him at Victoria Station. As they drove to Downing Street (\\"by a circuitous route\\") together, Derby told him that the War Cabinet had already decided to sack Robertson. In a private meeting with Lloyd George, Haig agreed in principle with Robertson's position that the CIGS should himself be the delegate to Versailles, or else that the Versailles delegate be clearly subordinate to the CIGS to preserve unity of command, but he accepted that the War Cabinet must ultimately make the decision. Haig then told Lloyd George that he was \\"prepared to work with\\" the General Reserve scheme. Haig met Robertson on the morning of Monday 11 February, telling him to accept the post of Deputy CIGS in Versailles, and displaying no sympathy for Robertson's reluctance to hand over his job to Henry Wilson, whom Robertson disliked. He then had a meeting with the King, and asked him to urge Robertson to accept the Versailles job. Haig wrote in his diary that it was Robertson's \\"duty\\" to go to Versailles if the government so desired.Wiest 2005, p90-1, 96Harris 2008 p428-31 Haig then returned to France (13–15 February) to inspect Fifth Army, which was taking over a section of French line. On the morning of Saturday 16 February he met with the French Minister of Munitions, and attended a British Army Commanders' conference at which the apparent imminence of a major German attack in the Third or Fifth Army sectors (but probably not Flanders at this stage, as the ground was still wet there) was discussed. It was still thought that this might be the prelude to greater German attack in Champagne, a view apparently shared by French intelligence. Later that day he travelled back to England by destroyer and special train.Harris 2008 p428-31, 442 At home at Kingston Hill on Sunday 17 February he was visited (separately) by Robertson and Derby, then was driven by Derby to visit Lloyd George at Walton Heath. The Prime Minister told him that the War Cabinet thought Robertson's refusal to agree tantamount to resignation. According to Lloyd George, Haig \\"put up no fight for Robertson\\" and regarded Derby's threat of resignation with \\"an expression of contempt\\". That afternoon, at Lloyd George's request, Wilson visited Haig. He agreed to Haig's request that Plumer, who had just declined the job of CIGS, be restored to command of Second Army at Ypres (he had been away commanding British troops in Italy) and that Rawlinson (who had been in command at the Ypres Salient) replace Wilson as British Permanent Military Representative at Versailles. That evening Derby visited Haig, who urged him not to resign. On Monday 18 February Haig met Bonar Law, who was about to announce Robertson's \\"resignation\\" and who wanted to confirm whether or not it was true that Haig supported the General Reserve scheme, as Lloyd George claimed – Haig was in fact ready to \\"work with\\" it, but threatened to resign if forced to hand over divisions. Haig congratulated himself (19 February) at having defused a major crisis in civil-military relations by deferring to civilian authority. Haig thought Robertson (who had begun his military career as a private) egotistical and not \\"a gentleman\\" and was unhappy at the way Robertson had allowed divisions to be diverted to other fronts, even though he had in fact fought to keep such diversions to a minimum. Although Haig had been suspicious of Henry Wilson, they gradually established a warily respectful relationship, and interactions were socially more smooth than they had been with Robertson, with whom Haig had never been on first-name terms.Sheffield 2011, p.264-5 Haig noted (diary 25 February) that as CIGS Wilson was no longer keen on diverting efforts to other fronts, nor on Rawlinson building up a strong staff at Versailles.Harris 2008, pp442-3 Haig's callousness towards Robertson and Derby, his equals, has been compared unfavourably to the care with which he tried to protect the interests of his subordinates Charteris and Kiggell.Harris 2008 p431 == German Michael Offensive  Eve of the offensive === By March 1918 Germany's Western Front armies had been reinforced to a strength of almost 200 divisions by the release of troops from the Eastern Front. At this point Haig had 52 divisions in his front line Armies, and another 8 in GHQ reserve, and 3 cavalry divisions.Sheffield 2011, p.268 Haig wrote to his wife (22 February) that he was \\"quite confident\\" and that it was \\"God's Battle\\" quoting 2 Chronicles XX Chap.Wiest 2005, p95 General Butler moved from GHQ to take command of III Corps (the southernmost and most vulnerable corps of Fifth Army) on 25 Feb.Harris 2008, p445 Allied intelligence did not fall for German deceptions that they might attack in Italy or the Balkans. At an Army Commanders Conference (Saturday 2 March), Cox reported that a German offensive was imminent, perhaps designed to \\"cut off the Cambrai salient\\" (Third Army sector) and draw in British reserves, although it was still expected to be prior to a bigger offensive in Flanders or Champagne.Sheffield 2011, p.261Harris 2008, p443 Haig privately thought the Guards Division \\"our only reliable reserve\\".Sheffield 2011, p.265 He has been criticised for writing (2 March) that he \\"was only afraid that the Enemy would find our front so very strong that he will hesitate to commit his Army to the attack with the almost certainty of losing very heavily\\". The claim does not appear in the official minutes, which merely warn of a \\"prolonged\\" German offensive. In Sheffield's view he was in fact referring to the First, Third and Fourth (actually the former Second Army at Ypres, temporarily renumbered as it was under Rawlinson's command whilst Plumer was away commanding in Italy) Army fronts which he had spent a week inspecting, and which were well-defended – Smuts and Hankey had come to the same conclusion in January. Haig thought the Canadians \\"really fine disciplined soldiers now and so smart and clean\\" compared to the Australians. On 6 March Haig had an apparently entirely amicable meeting with Petain. On 7–9 March Haig inspected Fifth Army's front, starting in the south with III Corps. He noted widespread concerns, which he shared, at lack of reserves – he released 39th Division to Fifth Army and deployed 50th Division south from Flanders, under GHQ control, to the rear of Fifth Army.Harris 2008, pp445-6Sheffield 2011, p.267 Byng was sent a direct order (10 March) to hold the Flesquieres salient as a \\"false front\\" Harris 2008, p451 Haig was in England from 12 March. On 14 March, at a meeting at Downing Street, warning of serious manpower problems by June \\"if (sic) the Germans attacked\\". Bonar Law and Lloyd George, by Haig's account, tried to get him to say that the Germans would not attack. They accused Haig of having said that there would not be a major German offensive (which was not actually what he had said – he had said it would be \\"a gambler's throw\\") but agreed to shelve the General Reserve for the time being until enough American troops had arrived. On the same day Haig attended two long sessions of the Supreme War Council (at one of which, to his amusement, Clemenceau told Foch to shut up). On 15 Haig took part in a long discussion about the bombing of German cities, which he regarded as a waste of effort. That night Doris gave birth to his son Dawyck. He returned to France the next day.Groot 1988, p.369Harris 2008, p446 Gough – whom Haig had been subject to a great deal of political pressure to sack – dined with Haig on evening of 15 March. There is no indication that he was crying out for reinforcements. Gough later wrote in his memoirs that Haig had explained to him that he was concentrating on holding the Channel Ports.Harris 2008, p441 As late as 17 March Cox, who had replaced Charteris as Intelligence Chief, predicted that the German offensive was not yet immediately imminent; Haig still believed that a power-struggle between generals and politicians in Germany (in fact the generals were very much in control) would determine if there was any attack. Haig's diary for 19 March shows him still sympathetic to the idea of a compromise peace.Harris 2008, p432 On the evening of 19 March Lawrence told Haig that the German offensive would most likely be on 20 or 21 March.Harris 2008, p447 By 20 March deployment of German trench mortars had been reported by deserters, and British artillery began some spoiling fire. === 21 March === Germany launched an attack, \\"Michael\\", on 21 March 1918. The German bombardment began at 4.45am; Haig was informed at 8am whilst he was dressing. 76 German divisions (German divisions were somewhat smaller than British), 6,608 guns and 534 heavy mortars hit 26 British divisions (the combined total of Fifth and Third Armies) and 2,686 guns. The Germans enjoyed superiority of 5:1 over the 12 divisions of Gough's Fifth Army, which were spread thinly over line recently taken over from the French; on the southern wing the Germans enjoyed an 8:1 numerical superiority, and their attack was helped by fog in the morning.Harris 2008, p447-9Groot 1988, p.376 Haig was initially calm on 21 March, as – in the days before battlefield radios – GHQ was \\"an information vacuum\\" where detailed reports often took over a day to reach him, and spent much of the day entertaining foreign dignitaries including Newton D. Baker, the US War Secretary. Haig did not speak to Gough that day; Gough spoke on the telephone to Davidson in the morning and to Herbert Lawrence in the evening; according to Gough's later account Lawrence \\"did not seem to grasp the seriousness of the situation\\" and downplayed the chances of a renewed German onslaught the next day. GHQ may well still have still expected the main blow to fall on the French in Champagne. By the end of day the Germans had overrun the British Outpost Zone but had not penetrated the Battle Zone, a penetration of less than 3 miles, similar to that of Third Army at Arras on 9 April 1917, and on three-quarters of the 50 mile front attacked the Germans failed to reach their first day objectives. Lacking reserves Gough had to retreat behind the Crozat Canal. According to his diary, Haig appears to have been satisfied with the results of the first day (which was usually the most successful of any offensive), not realising that unlike the Germans in previous offensives he had insufficient reserves and depth of fortifications.Sheffield 2011, p.269 === 22 and 23 March === Gough authorised a general retreat to the Somme at 10.45am on 22 March. There was soon a breakdown in communications between corps – Butler's III, Maxse's XVIII, Watt's XIX to its north, Congreve's VII further north, and V Corps (part of Third Army) to its north. Haig still anticipated further German attacks in Champagne or Arras, and his only actions on 22 March appear to have been to confirm Gough's decision to fall back to the non-existent Peronne bridgehead, and to telegraph Petain, who had already sent 3 French divisions to the southern sector, for more help.Harris 2008, p450-1 Byng had held the Flesquieres Salient too strongly. The whole salient was not evacuated, freeing up a division, until 1.30am on 23 March. V Corps was close to collapse, with the Germans edging around their southern flank and threatening to split them off from Fifth Army to their south.Harris 2008, p452 A report by Cox on the morning of 23 March suggested that Michael was an all-out effort, i.e. not a prelude to an attack in Flanders or Champagne.Harris 2008, p454 On Saturday 23 March Haig met Byng and Gough for the first time since the offensive began. Pétain and Haig met at Dury at 4pm on 23 March, Petain stressing the need for Gough's Fifth Army to keep in touch with Pellé's French V Corps on its right. Petain agreed to place a group of two French armies under Fayolle as a reserve in the Somme valley, south of Fifth Army, but could not agree to Haig's request to send 20 French divisions to Amiens because of the risk of a German attack in Champagne. Haig's diary at this point stresses the importance of maintaining contact with Petain, even at the cost of abandoning the \\"northern flank\\".Travers 1992, p.66-7 Amidst mutual suspicion – a French officer recorded Petain's increasing fears on 22 and 23 March that the British would retreat on the Channel Ports – Petain was issuing orders to cover Paris as a priority and maintain contact with the British \\"if possible\\".Sheffield 2011, p.273, 275 At 7pm Haig met with Plumer, Horne, Davidson and Lawrence, and ordered 3rd, 4th and 5th Australian Divisions south. Haig's GHQ Reserve was massed in the north, 72 hours' march away, to protect the Channel Ports. Formal orders were issued to Fifth Army to maintain contact with Third Army to their north and the French to their south.Sheffield 2011, p.270-1 After initial optimism, Tim Travers has written of \\"panic\\" setting in amongst senior officers like Herbert Lawrence and Tavish Davidson at GHQ on 23 March, and there is evidence that a retreat towards the Channel Ports may have been considered.Travers 1992, p.54, 66-70Sheffield 2011, p.275 === 24 March === By the afternoon of 24 March Haig knew that the Germans were across the River Tortille and were advancing on Amiens.Harris 2008, p453 Having at first regarded the situation as in hand, he was incredulous at this development.Wiest 2005, p96 24 March was, in Sheffield's view, \\"probably the most traumatic day (Haig) had endured since\\" First Ypres in 1914. Half of BEF supplies came in to Le Havre, Rouen and Dieppe and passed by train through Amiens, making it a major choke point, although the Germans did not initially realise the importance of the city.Sheffield 2011, p268, 272 Planning that winter had left open the question of whether the BEF would retreat southwest or form \\"an island\\" around the Channel Ports (Calais, Boulogne, Dunkirk) through which Haig's armies drew the other half of their supplies. A retreat on the ports does not seem to have been decided until some days after 21 March.Travers 1992, p.69-70 Haig remained composed in front of more junior officers.Sheffield 2011, p.276 Haig dined with Byng on the evening of 24 March and ordered him to maintain contact at all costs with Horne's First Army to his north. He told Byng that he was thinning his lines in the north ready to strike \\"when the enemy has penetrated to Amiens\\". Harris argues that this seems to assume that Amiens would be lost and would need to be recovered to restore contact between Third and Fifth Armies. Travers suggests that Haig had written off both Fifth Army and the link with the French at this point, that his telephone call to Henry Wilson that evening was to ask him over to France to discuss a retreat on the Channel Ports, and that he wanted the 20 French divisions at Amiens not to maintain the link with the French but to cover the British retreat or perhaps to counterattack.Travers 1992, p.68 Sheffield argues that orders to Third Army were not a precursor to retreat but \\"a means to an end\\", pointing to orders for, if needs be, a counterattack onto the northern flank of the German attackers, and also argues that although GHQ had a duty to consider contingency plans, evacuation was, unlike in 1940, never actually likely.Sheffield 2011, p.279 === 24/25 March === The next day or two are one of the occasions where doubt has been cast on the authenticity of Haig's diary. Haig's handwritten diary of the next meeting with Petain (Dury, 11pm on 24 March) is brief.Sheffield 2011, p.273 Haig agreed to put Gough's Fifth Army under the command of Fayolle (part of VII Corps, the northernmost corps of Fifth Army, was transferred to Third Army on 25 March).Harris 2008, p453-6 Haig's manuscript diary has him asking Petain to \\"to cooperate on my right\\" by concentrating a large force at Abbeville (30 miles north-north-west of Amiens, i.e. suggesting that Haig did not expect to hold Amiens). An undated British typescript record, drawn up later, refers to Amiens instead. Petain was still expecting another German attack in Champagne, but was still promising to help – however, he had told his subordinates earlier that day that he would prioritise covering Paris (Haig's manuscript and typed diary differ on the degree to which he informed Haig of this at the Dury meeting).Harris 2008, p453-4 Haig's typed diary – probably based on notes prepared in April – describes Petain as \\"almost unbalanced and most anxious\\", claiming that after attending a French Cabinet meeting in Paris, where he had been ordered to \\"cover Paris at all costs\\", he threatened to retreat on Paris, leaving the British right flank uncovered.Sheffield 2011, p.273 Tim Travers argues that Petain said at the meeting that he would only retreat on Paris if Haig retreated on the Channel Ports, and that Major-General Clive reported from the meeting that Petain had come away satisfied that Haig would not break contact. In a postwar exchange of letters with Haig Petain denied that he had ordered a retreat on Paris or had threatened Haig that he might, a recollection which Herbert Lawrence appears to have supported.Travers 1992, p.66-8 Petain appears not to have discovered until 25 March that Michael was an all-out effort, but nonetheless was, according to other eyewitness accounts, in a state of despair by Tuesday 26 March.Harris 2008, p455 Sheffield's view is that Haig and Lawrence, on the long drive back to GHQ from their meeting with Petain may simply have misunderstood his intentions, and that any factual errors in Haig's diary for this period were honest if mistaken recollections. In the typed diary, Haig also claimed that on returning to GHQ at 3am on 25 March he telegraphed to Wilson (CIGS) and Milner (listed as Secretary of State for War – an error on Haig's part, as Milner did not hold this position until April, and thus evidence that the account was written up later) to come over to France and ensure the appointment of \\"Foch or some other determined general who would fight\\" as Allied Generalissimo. There is no record of any such telegram.Sheffield 2011, p.271 Wilson's diary records that Haig telephoned him at 7 or 8pm on 24 March, before the meeting with Petain, and after Haig's evening visit to Third Army. Milner, whom as a Cabinet Minister Haig had no authority to \\"summon\\", was already in France (on Lloyd George's orders after a War Cabinet meeting on 23 March), having visited Tavish Davidson at GHQ whilst Haig and Lawrence were with Petain, then reaching Versailles at 2.30am on Monday 25 March. Wilson's diary for their meeting on Monday 25 March (11am) describes Haig as \\"cowed\\" and saying that unless the French sent more help the BEF was beaten and \\"it would be better to make peace on any terms we could\\". Wilson claimed that Haig suggested Petain be appointed Allied generalissimo (which is not consistent with Haig's later claim that Petain was unwilling to help the British) and that he proposed Foch over Haig's objections.Travers 1992, p.68Groot argues that Petain's sending of 3 French divisions on the evening of 21 March, not the 20 Haig demanded, vindicated Henry Wilson's warnings that relying on bilateral agreement with Petain would provide \\"very cold charity\\".(Groot 1988, p.368-9) In fact Petain seems to have done somewhat more than this over the following days, although coordination between Haig and Petain was gradually breaking down. Haig met Weygand (then French Military Representative on the Supreme War Council) at Abbeville at 4pm on 25 March (an attempt to have Poincare and Clemenceau attend had fallen through), but left him with the impression that he did not expect to hold Amiens.Harris 2008, p456Haig's manuscript diary mentions that the French politicians did not \\"turn up by train as expected\\", a comment which in the typed version is amended to state that they had \\"not yet arrived\\" (Sheffield & Bourne 2005, p393). That day Lord Milner had already met Rawlinson, then Clemenceau.(Harris 2008, p455) At 5pm Milner was having a meeting with Poincare, Clemenceau, Foch and Petain at the latter's HQ at Compiegne, perhaps suggesting that the politicians were giving greater priority to the meeting with the French generals.(Doughty 2005, p437) He told him it was a \\"matter of time\\" until the British and French armies were driven apart.Doughty 2005, p436 He gave Weygand a letter for Clemenceau, asking for 20 French divisions (at Amiens according to his diary) to cover the southern British flank. The letter is ambiguous and talks of the BEF fighting its way back \\"covering the Channel Ports\\", not specifically a retreat \\"to\\" the ports.Sheffield & Bourne 2005, p.8, 393 === Doullens, 26 March === There were three conferences at Doullens on 26 March. The first was between Haig and his Army Commanders (except Gough). There was then a second with them and Wilson and Milner, who was able to bring assurances of French help from Clemenceau and Foch. The main conference was attended by Poincare, Clemenceau, Petain and Foch, as well as Haig, Wilson and Milner. Haig accepted the appointment of Foch to coordinate reserves of all nationalities wherever he saw fit. In his typed diary Haig claimed much of the credit for Foch's appointment and to have insisted that he have wider powers over Petain across the whole front, not just the Amiens sector, than Clemenceau had wanted to grant him.Wiest 2005, p97Harris 2008, p456-7 The typed diary, although fuller, does not specifically contradict the handwritten original, and Sheffield's view is that Haig either needed to reconcile himself psychologically to the need to accept a French superior or else was simply letting off steam and wanted to give himself the credit he felt he deserved.Sheffield & Bourne 2005, p.8 Milner, who represented the British government at Doullens, recorded that Clemenceau was unhappy with Petain's recent efforts, but claimed that he himself had persuaded Haig to accept the appointment of Foch; Haig's official biographer Duff Cooper gave Haig the credit but commented that the idea had probably occurred to several participants simultaneously.Gollin, 1964, p.505-7 In his diary for that day Haig accused Petain of \\"funk\\". He was later to make the same accusation against the King on 29 March and Lloyd George on 3 April; Harris suggests that he was attributing to others an emotion of which he felt ashamed in himself. After the conference Haig went riding (his main form of relaxation) for the first time in days, and Wilson recorded that he seemed \\"10 years younger\\" that evening. Gough was relieved of command of Fifth Army. Haig recommended Cavan for the job.Sheffield 2011, p.279 Instead it went to Rawlinson, who took command at 4.30pm on 28 March.Harris 2008, p468-9 Although the leaders did not know it, and although Albert and Montdidier had fallen, the British defence on the ground had been solidifying since 25 March. The Germans were experiencing logistical problems after advancing over the ravaged 1916 Somme battlefield, subject to constant attack by the RFC, and with their supplies and equipment pulled by horses in poor shape.Harris 2008, p458 A German offensive near Arras (\\"Mars\\", 9 German divisions, 28 March), against the junction of First and Third Armies, was predicted exactly by British Intelligence and was repulsed.Sheffield 2011, p.277Harris 2008, p459 After this was beaten back, between 29 and 31 March the Germans pushed on Amiens again. A Canadian brigade took part in an action at Moreuil Wood (30 March).Sheffield 2011, p.278 == German Georgette offensive  Haig keeps his job === Haig met Clemenceau at Dury on 1 April. Clemenceau summoned Foch on the telephone, and after his arrival he ordered the French line extended northwards to the River Luce, south of the Somme. Haig agreed with Clemenceau's suggestion that Foch should be given more power over Petain.Harris 2008, p465 The Germans were known to still have a large number of divisions in reserve (diary 2 April).Harris 2008, p461 Lloyd George, Clemenceau, Foch, Petain, Haig and Pershing (the US Commander-in-Chief, who had not been at Doullens) met at Beauvais (3 April), where Foch was given \\"strategical direction of military operations\\" although his powers were still largely based on persuasion rather than command. Haig also urged that the French launch an offensive to take the pressure off the British, to which Foch and Petain agreed in principle. Although Gough had been removed from command of Fifth Army, Haig still planned to appoint him to a new Reserve Army, holding a line along the River Somme between Peronne and Abbeville (roughly east–west), in case the BEF had to form a defensive perimeter around the Channel Ports. Haig had privately defended him after the Doullens Conference and did so again to the Prime Minister on 3 April, when Lloyd George demanded that Gough be sacked altogether and \\"sent home\\".Harris 2008, p462-3 Haig described Lloyd George in his diary (3 April) as an \\"impostor\\" and a \\"cur\\", whilst the following day (4 April) Lloyd George, having returned to England overnight, wrote to his wife (in Welsh) that he had found \\"Haig more anxious\\" (than the French leaders) and that he thought both Haig and Herbert Lawrence \\"both of them very second rate men\\".Grigg 2002 p485 Haig was sent a direct order to sack Gough by Lord Derby (4 April). After the war Haig commented that a scapegoat had been needed and that he had been \\"conceited enough\\" to think that he himself could not be spared. German attacks on 4 April (Villers- Bretonneux, east of Amiens, 25 miles from the German starting point on 21 March) and 5 April on the Somme front were beaten back by British and Australian forces. Although this was the furthest part of the German advance, Haig was still (5 April) discussing contingency plans with General Asser to cover Rouen and Le Havre in case Amiens fell. The Government demanded a full report (6 April) into Fifth Army's debacle, especially the loss of the Crozat Canal and the Somme bridges.Sheffield &Bourne; 2005, p427 Haig had already asked the politicians to accept his judgement or replace him, and wrote to Derby offering to resign (6 April).Harris 2008, p463 With a German offensive against Vimy or on the Lys sector apparently imminent, Tavish Davidson visited Foch at Beauvais (6 April). He asked for a French offensive, or that they take over front as far north as the Somme, or send French reserves to behind the British front. Haig also wrote to Foch that day. Haig met Foch at Aumale on 7 April; Foch said he wanted an offensive by Rawlinson's Fourth Army (the former Fifth Army) in cooperation with Debeney's French First Army. Haig regarded this as a time-wasting tactic as Fourth Army was still in no shape to attack. Foch was willing to deploy 4 French infantry and 3 cavalry divisions near Amiens but not further north. Haig asked Henry Wilson to come out and lobby Foch. Foch may have been influenced by a German attack (by General von Boehm's Seventh Army) against the French (\\"Archangel\\"), towards the Oise-Aisne Canal on the morning of 7 April, which took more prisoners than the Germans suffered casualties.Harris 2008, p466-7 Haig's letter offering to resign was read by Derby to the War Cabinet (8 April). Afterwards a smaller meeting of Lloyd George, Bonar Law, Curzon and Hankey was called to discuss, in Hankey's words, \\"the desirability of getting rid of Haig\\". Lloyd George wanted to accept his resignation, but Henry Wilson, who thought there was no \\"really outstanding personality\\" for the job, suggested waiting for Haig's report on the March retreat before making a decision. Although opinion was \\"unanimously agst Haig\\" the other ministers thought there was no obvious successor (Hankey thought the only possibility was Plumer \\"in whom the troops are said to have confidence\\" but who was \\"as stupid as Haig himself\\"). Haig no longer enjoyed the support in Parliament of a few weeks earlier.Sheffield 2011, p.279French 1995, p233 Rumours were rife in GHQ that Haig would soon be dismissed in favour of Robertson, Wilson (who may have been a prime mover for Haig's dismissalGroot 1988, p.380.), or more likely Plumer, Byng or Allenby.Hart 2008, p. 250. === \\"Backs to the Wall\\" === On 8 April Haig, having learned of intelligence reports of German reserves massing in the British sector, tried again, asking his French liaison officer, General de Laguiche, to ask Foch to send French divisions to free up six British divisions to form a reserve in Flanders, but Weygand arrived at GHQ to tell Herbert Lawrence in person that this was not going to happen. Wilson arrived in France on the morning of 9 April, just as the German offensive in Flanders was beginning. British Intelligence did not predict the scale of Georgette, although in fairness the Germans were changing their plans frequently and only finalised their intentions a week or so beforehand. The Germans enjoyed significant artillery superiority (although less than they would have preferred after the intense fighting in the Somme sector) and some of the BEF line was held by poor-quality Portuguese divisions.Harris 2008, p467 Foch visited Haig at 1pm on 9 April, and again refused Haig's demand that the French take over more BEF line so as to free up a British reserve. Haig felt that Foch's proposal to deploy 4 French divisions west of Amiens would simply increase Rawlinson's logistical troubles without doing much to help.Harris 2008, p468 On 10 April Georgette was extended northwards, as von Arnim's Fourth Army also attacked, forcing the evacuation of Armentieres by Du Cane's XV Corps. Haig yet again demanded that the French take over \\"some portion\\" of the British line and give French assistance \\"in order ... to continue the battle\\". Just as \\"Michael\\" had swept over the Cambrai and the Somme battlefields, won at such cost by Haig's own offensives in previous years, this offensive swept over Passchendaele although not Ypres itself. Foch and Weygand visited Haig at 10pm on 10 April and agreed to take over the British line as far as the River Somme and to send a single division, the 133rd (not quite the \\"large force of French troops\\" claimed by Haig in his diary), to Dunkirk by rail. By 11 April 37 German divisions were engaging 13 British, roughly a 2:1 advantage as German divisions were somewhat smaller than British. The only fresh British reserves were 1st Australian and 4th Canadian Divisions. Haig visited Plumer then demanded four French infantry divisions (Foch was offering a cavalry corps) be deployed between St Omer and Dunkirk in case the Germans broke through to Hazebrouck, \\"the Amiens of the north\\", a key railhead through which supplies were brought from the Channel Ports – had it fallen the Channel Ports might have been at risk and Plumer's Second Army might have been cut off.Sheffield 2011, p.282Harris 2008, p469 Haig issued his famous order (11 April) that his men must carry on fighting \\"With Our Backs to the Wall and believing in the Justice of our Cause\\" to protect \\"The safety of our homes and the Freedom of mankind\\" – the latter being a real concern after recent British propaganda dwelled on the harsh terms imposed on Russia at Brest-Litovsk.Sheffield 2011, p.283 He also added that \\"the French Army is moving and in great force to our support\\" – in Greenhalgh's view this may have been intended as blackmail. On 12 April Haig met with Clemenceau and told him that the BEF required massive French help to \\"keep the war going\\". 12 April Lt-Gen John du Cane was appointed senior liaison officer between Haig and Foch, an idea broached by Wilson to Foch on 9 April. French observers were impressed by the resilience of British lower ranks, and by Plumer, but less so by other British generals.Harris 2008, p469-71 === Crisis continues === Foch had earlier refused to send 4 French divisions to Flanders but now redeployed Maistre's Tenth French Army to the Somme sector, freeing up British forces. Foch was given the title of Generalissimo (he would have preferred \\"Commander-in-Chief\\") (14 April) to give him more clout over Petain, who was still reluctant to release French reserves. Eventually, later in the year, Petain would simply be placed under Foch's command, although Haig and Pershing retained their right of appeal to their own governments. During a renewed attack (17 April) Foch drew attention to the valour of the British at First Ypres and refused to send further French reinforcements so as to keep a strategic reserve.Sheffield 2011, p.284-5, 288Groot 1988, p379 On 18 April Foch offered to deploy 15 French divisions to the British sector, in return for Haig deploying tired British divisions to the French sector. Now that the immediate crisis in Flanders appeared to have passed, Haig saw this as an attempt to merge (\\"a permanent Amalgam\\") the British and French Armies. He discussed the matter with Lord Milner on 19 April (on his way back from a meeting with Clemenceau in Paris, and taking office as Secretary for State for War – in place of Haig's ally Lord Derby – that day). Haig seems to have admired Milner (diary 26 Dec 1917, 28 April 1918), but this was not reciprocated, as Milner had lost confidence in Haig during the Third Ypres Offensive the previous year. They agreed that mingling of British and French forces was \\"for a time necessary\\" but could not be allowed to become permanent.Harris 2008, p471 24 April saw a further unsuccessful German attack at Villers-Bretonneux near Amiens, featuring the first tank-to-tank combat. On 25 April the Germans took Mount Kemmel from the French in Flanders. The next day Haig visited Second Army Advanced HQ and discussed abandoning the Ypres salient. It was Foch who insisted on holding on. The British retreated but held the City of Ypres.Harris 2008, p473 ===Disputes with French and Americans=== Another meeting was held on 27 April, attended by Clemenceau, Foch, Milner, Wilson and Haig. Wilson pressed Foch on whether the priority was to hold onto the Channel Ports or to keep the British and French armies united. Foch indicated that the latter was the priority. British IX Corps was moved to the French sector.It was deployed to the Chemin des Dames sector, where it was to be overrun a month later. By the end of April Haig claimed to notice a slackening of enemy fighting spirit and on 30 April Ludendorff called a halt to the Flanders offensive, although he hoped to attack the British in Flanders again at some point in the future.Harris 2008, p473-4 The French were also irritated that they had not been consulted about the British shipping US infantry and machine gunners to France. Although some American divisions were now serving with the British forces, at the Supreme War Council on 1 May Haig thought Pershing \\"very obstinate and stupid\\" for refusing to integrate US troops (1 May) with Allied units (an ironic complaint in view of his reluctance to integrate British troops with French). Haig still thought that the Americans lacked competent senior generals and staff officers, and that they would not be ready for two years.Harris 2008, p474Sheffield 2011, p.288 On 2 May Haig thought the Germans \\"uncannily quiet\\".Harris 2008, p475 At Abbeville (2 May) it was agreed that in the event of renewed attack British forces would retreat south if necessary and abandon the Channel Ports rather than lose touch with the French. Contingency plans were made (11 May) although it is unclear that they would ever have been executed.Sheffield 2011, p.289 == Final German offensives  The Maurice Debate === The near-debacle of March 1918 was an object of political controversy. Repington wrote that it was \\"the worst defeat in the history of the Army\\". Bonar Law had claimed in a House of Commons debate (23 April) that Haig and Petain had agreed the extension of the British line, which was not wholly true as in January 1918 the Supreme War Council had ordered a longer extension than Haig and Petain had agreed between themselves in December 1917, only leaving them to sort out the details.Groot 1988, p.357 Lloyd George was accused (in the Maurice Debate of 9 May 1918 in the House of Commons, after Maurice's public letter two days earlier) of having given false information about troop strengths to the House of Commons in his speech of 9 April, thereby implying him to have hoarded troops in the UK to make it harder for Haig to launch offensives. Lloyd George misled the House of Commons in claiming that Haig's forces were stronger (1.75 million men) at the start of 1918 than they had been a year earlier (1.5 million men) – in fact the increase was caused by an increase of 335,000 in the number of labourers (many of them Chinese, Indians and black South Africans), and Haig had fewer combat infantry (630,000, down from 900,000 a year earlier), holding a longer stretch of front (the rest of Haig's men would have been tank, air & artillery crews and above all logistical support personnel).Hart 2008, p. 229. Although Maurice – who certainly collaborated with Robertson – visited Haig (13-16 April) shortly before his press letter, there is no specific evidence that Haig collaborated with his actions. Haig wrote to his wife that he had opposed Maurice in taking his concerns into public, but he was privately disappointed at how Lloyd George was able to get off the hook with a \\"claptrap speech\\".Groot 1988, p379. Maurice believed he had saved Haig from dismissal.Sheffield 2011, p.290 === Bluecher Offensive === By late spring the BEF had taken just over 300,000 casualties. 12 of Haig's divisions had been reduced to skeletons. Battalions had had to be brought in from the Middle East. Haig spent time touring his forces in May.Sheffield 2011, p.286 Haig's wife reported rumours (11 May) that he was to be brought home as Commander-in- Chief Home Forces (in succession to Viscount French, who had just been appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; in the event Robertson was appointed to the vacancy); when Wilson denied the rumours to Haig's face, Haig recorded (20 May) that \\"no one has been chosen yet!\\" to replace him.Sheffield 2011, p.280 Haig and Lawrence visited Rawlinson (17 May) and ordered him to prepare an offensive near Villers-Bretonneux, in conjunctions with Debeney's French First Army. However, the plans were put on hold because of the next German offensive.Harris 2008, p476 Intelligence of Germans massing on the Chemin des Dames was at first thought to be a bluff until a few days before the attack happened. A third major German offensive (\\"Bluecher\\"), against the French in that sector, starting on 27 May, again achieved a 25 mile penetration and overwhelmed Hamilton-Gordon's IX British Corps which had been sent there to refit after being involved in \\"Michael\\" and \\"Georgette\\". Foch at first believed \\"Bluecher\\" was a diversion to draw allied reserves away from Flanders, which was partly true, but Haig guessed correctly that the enemy would \\"devote all his energy to exploiting his success\\".Harris 2008, p477 Foch met Haig in Paris on 31 May and asked him to release some US divisions trained by the British and still under British command, to take over trenches in Alsace so as to free up French divisions. Haig was worried that the Germans would attack his sector again (intelligence reported extra German hospital spaces being made available near La Bassee) – this was indeed the German plan but the offensive in question, \\"Hagen\\", was repeatedly postponed and never actually took place. He promised to consider the matter, although he did agree to create a reserve corps of 3 British divisions to serve anywhere on the Western Front. He recorded that Foch was \\"more anxious\\" than he had ever seen him, although Lord Derby, who was also present, recorded that Haig himself seemed \\"tired and anxious\\".Harris 2008, p478Groot 1988, p.381. === Greater powers for Foch === Amidst British concerns that France might collapse altogether, the sixth session of the Supreme War Council met on 1–3 June. The British delegates – Lloyd George, Milner, Wilson and Du Cane – met privately on 1 June, and Haig advised them that the French Army had been in such a poor state since the Nivelle Offensive and the mutinies that to place US Divisions under French command would be to throw them away. At the Franco-British session that afternoon Foch complained that the BEF was still shrinking in size and infuriated Lloyd George by implying that the British Government was withholding manpower. Haig did not side openly with him. On 3 June Foch informed Haig that he and Pershing had agreed that the US Divisions would move to the French sector.Harris 2008, p478-9 Foch moved French forces down from Flanders. Haig complied with Foch's request to deploy a corps of 3 divisions to the Somme sector, but sent a formal protest to the British Government (4 June) at any further movement of reserves out of the BEF sector. At a major Allied conference at Beauvais (7 June) Lord Milner agreed with Clemenceau that Foch should have the power to order all Allied troops as he saw fit, over the protests of Haig who argued that it would reduce his power to safeguard the interests of the British Army.Harris 2008, p479 It was agreed that Haig and Foch should meet more frequently, and in time they developed a good working relationship (although wags at GHQ said he had to fight \\"Boche, Foch and Loygeorges\\"). Cooperation improved when the Germans launched their \\"Gneisenau\\" Offensive on 9 June, to widen the \\"Bluecher\\" salient westwards.Groot 1988, p.382. Milner and Lloyd George told Haig that he should consider himself subordinate to Foch for the time being and that they were no longer interested in sacking him (this may have been untrue – as late as July, just before the battle of Amiens Lloyd George may have been trying to replace Haig with Cavan Groot 1988, p.385.French 1995, p234). \\"Gneisenau\\" was quickly defeated by the French General Mangin at the Battle of the Matz (11 June). === Peace Offensive === By 14 June the German offensive against the French had ground to a halt, which initially puzzled Haig (diary 21 June); as well as the same supply issues as in March it was in part because the underfed German troops were disproportionately hit by the influenza pandemic. The mood of the Allied leaders was improved by the deployment of US troops: by 22 June, there were 19 US divisions on the Western Front, 14 of them in the French sector.a US division was significantly larger than a British or French division Some of them had seen combat and had performed better than expected. By the time Haig met Foch on 28 June both men appear to have been in an optimistic mood, not least because of the recent speech by German Foreign Minister Richard von Kühlmann, which appeared to have abandoned the possibility of an outright German victory.Harris 2008, p480 On 4 July the 4th Australian Division attacked at Hamel.The Australian Corps was under the command of Monash since Birdwood's promotion to command a reconstituted Fifth Army in May. 10 Australian battalions and 4 US companies took 1,470 prisoners at a cost of 1,000 casualties. Haig had approved the attack on 25 June, but thereafter his only direct involvement was to dissuade Pershing from removing the American troops. A tactical pamphlet on the lessons was quickly published. Haig forbade Rawlinson to push any further, but again asked him to draw up a plan for an attack in the Amiens area.Sheffield 2011, p.293-4Wiest 2005, p98 Haig took a few days leave in England on 6 July, his first since the crisis had begun. With another German attack imminent, Foch asked Herbert Lawrence (12–13 July – Haig was still on leave in England) to send 8 Divisions – he sent only 2 (Godley's XXII Corps). Haig thought this was contradicting Foch's Directive Generale No 4 of 1 July that covering Paris and Abbeville was to take priority, and wrote to Foch that he was misreading a German feint attack as Crown Prince Rupprecht still had 25 divisions in reserve on the BEF front. Haig still believed that the assumptions of that document, that any attacks in Champagne or Flanders might be feints to draw in Allied reserves before a major attack from the Lens/Chateau-Thierry region (i.e out of the \\"Michael\\" and \\"Bluecher\\" salients), were still good. Wilson consulted the War Cabinet then, in the small hours of 15 July, telephoned Haig and told him to \\"exercise his judgement\\" about holding the British line. Haig felt that they would take credit for Foch's victory but might dismiss him if disaster befell the British forces.Harris 2008, p481 The German \\"Friedensturm\\" (\\"Peace Offensive\\") began against the French at Rheims at 4.15am on 15 July. Haig eventually agreed that the French could use XXII Corps if necessary \\"for exploitation\\". Over lunch with Foch on 15 July he agreed to send another two British divisions to Champagne. The \\"Peace Offensive\\" turned out to be the last German throw of the dice. On 17 July Haig asked for XXII Corps back, but did not get it. On 18 July a major Allied offensive, the Second Battle of the Marne, began. Most of the troops involved were French and American, but XXII Corps (4 divisions in total) participated from 20 July. The Germans were decisively defeated and the ground lost to \\"Bluecher\\" recaptured; \\"Hagen\\" was finally cancelled.Ludendorff ordered a switch to a defensive posture on 2 August. The offensives had left the Germans much weakened. Between 25 March and 25 June the length of trench held by the Germans had increased from 390 km to 510km. The German Army had suffered about a million casualties, many of them amongst elite stormtroops. Many of the German troops were undernourished or suffering from influenza, whilst there was a sharp drop in discipline and morale as they realised that victory had eluded them. (Harris p.485)Sheffield 2011, p.291-2Harris 2008, p481-2 == Planning Amiens == Rawlinson drew up plans to use both the Canadian Corps as well as the Australian Corps for Fourth Army's forthcoming attack at Amiens, and found (16 July) that Haig had already had the same idea.Sheffield 2011, p.294 The four Canadian divisions were transferred to the front in secrecy, moving into place with two hours to spare – the Germans thought they were still at Arras.Harris 2008, p489Sheffield 2011, p.299 Brudenell White, Chief Of Staff Australian Corps, drew up many of the plans.Sheffield 2011, p.295 Foch placed Debeney (First French Army) under Haig's command, against Rawlinson's wishes, and encouraged him to aim for a penetration to Roye, 25 miles South East of Amiens. Neither the Prime Minister (who wanted to wait for the Americans to be ready before beginning major offensivesWiest 2005, p100) nor the CIGS Henry Wilson were told about the offensive until zero hour, Haig telling Wilson that \\"nothing startling\\" had happened at his meeting with Foch on 25 July. On that same day Wilson had submitted a paper forecasting that stalemate would continue on the Western Front until mid-1919, and that other fronts offered better prospects. Haig wrote on the cover of his copy: \\"Words! Words! Words! Lots of words! And little else.\\" Sheffield 2011, p.294-5 To Rawlinson's dismay Haig, at the request of Foch (who was pleased at the success of the Second Marne, but worried that the Allied advance might bog down), brought the date two days forward to 8 August, and extended the planned advance to Ham, a further 15 miles east of Roye. Prior & Wilson Prior & Wilson 2004, p.305-6 criticise Haig for this overambition, but Sheffield argues that there was little concrete change in the operational plans, as the more distant objectives were beyond artillery range anyway, and suggests that Haig was both paying lip service to Foch's wishes and prodding Rawlinson to more aggressive exploitation in the event of success – in the event Haig did not criticise the cavalry for not reaching Ham.Sheffield 2011, p.296-7 Haig spent the night before the battle at his own Advanced HQ in a train at Wiry au Mont Station, and visited Rawlinson on the morning of the offensive.Harris 2008, p492Sheffield 2011, p.298 == Battle of Amiens == Amiens began at 4.20am on 8 August with an attack with 11 divisions across a 19,000-yard front. The Germans were bombarded with 350,000 shells from 1,236 field guns and 677 heavy guns, 450 of them on counterbattery work, an effective doubling of Fourth Army's usual 1,000 guns, and far more accurate and effective than before, with 504 out of 530 German guns already identified. 800 RAF and 1,104 French aircraft, and 552 tanks, were employed. Cavalry were involved from the outset, alongside light Whippet tanks (the attempt to coordinate the two was not, in the event, a success) and a battalion of armoured cars. Fourth Army advanced 8 miles on the Australian and Canadian front (6,000 yards had been planned), the longest one-day advance since 1914. The Germans lost 15,000 casualties, 400 guns and 12,000 prisoners while French took 3,000 more – earning General Erich Ludendorff's description of the battle as \\"The Black Day of the German Army\\".Hart 2008, p. 311Sheffield 2011, p.296, 298-9Wiest 2005, p102 The RAF suffered heavy losses. 45 aircraft were lost and 52 damaged beyond repair. There has been speculation that Haig may have had a role in ordering the switching of RAF efforts from ground support to an attack on the Somme bridges, for which they were ill-equipped and which made them vulnerable to German aircraft. There is no evidence that this was so and Salmond, the RAF Commander, never tried to blame Haig.Harris 2008, p493-4 Foch, claiming that the Germans were showing signs of demoralisation, demanded (10 August) that Haig push on and capture the Somme crossings. Haig would have preferred to have First Army attack at Aubers and Third Army towards Bapaume, and after initially agreeing with Foch's demand, changed his mind after consulting Currie and Lambert (GOC 32nd Division). Edmonds later claimed that Rawlinson was \\"almost insubordinate\\" in asking Haig whether he or \\"Marechal Foch\\" was in command, but this may not be an exact recollection as there is no record of the two men meeting that day. Haig told Byng (11 August) to be ready to attack with Third Army towards Bapaume and permitted Rawlinson to order a pause. Foch visited Haig's command train that evening and concurred with the decision.Sheffield 2011, p.300-1 Haig's initial orders to Rawlinson, to be ready to attack again after a short halt, have been criticisedPrior & Wilson 2004, p.334 but Sheffield suggests that Haig had to defer to Foch this time, to clear the way for Byng's attack. Haig then cancelled Fourth Army's attack on Currie's advice (based on aerial reconnaissance) that it would be \\"a desperate enterprise\\" for the BEF to overreach itself and engage new German troops with tired Allied ones who had outrun much of their artillery cover, and he switched to a new line of offensive. Haig wrote that on 15 August he \\"spoke to Foch quite straightly, and let him understand that I was responsible for the handling of the British forces\\". Foch had little choice but to agree, and interfered little with Haig's decisions thereafter, but removed First French Army from Haig's command.Sheffield 2011, p.302Wiest 2005, p104 == Battles after Amiens == Allied logistics had now improved to the point where a steady rhythm of limited attacks could be kept up, as opposed to single large attacks which ran out of steam like the Spring German offensives. Byng's Third Army launched the Battle of Albert between the Scarpe and the Ancre on 21 August. Byng had fewer tanks (156) than Rawlinson had had at Amiens, and apart from the elite New Zealand and Guards divisions, many of his troops were teenaged British conscripts. Haig – as with his previous offensives in 1916 and 1917, but now also urged on by Foch – encouraged his subordinates to aim for ambitious objectives, in this case urging Byng to revise his plans to thrust from Albert to Bapaume as quickly as possible, although Byng appears to have largely ignored him and made little use of cavalry. The attack reached Amiens-Arras railway.Sheffield 2011, p.303-4 On 21 August Haig was with Winston Churchill, Minister of Munitions, who had fought many battles Sheffield 2011, p.317 to prevent the conscription of skilled munitions workers into the army, and who told him that new equipment (tanks, guns, new poison gases etc) was being produced ready for what the government expected to be the war-winning offensive in July 1919.Hart 2008, p. 360, p364. Haig told him the Allies were \\"wearing out\\" the enemy and should not allow him time to regroup and rebuild his strength. Sheffield points out that this was the same argument he had used in previous years, but this time he was right. Byng called a halt that evening, but Haig demanded further attacks, due for 23 August.Sheffield 2011, p.304-5 On 22 August, the day Fourth Army retook Albert (a symbolic victory as it had been their forward base at the Somme two years earlier) Haig ordered his Army Commanders to pass down to all ranks the message that bold attacks were now needed, even to the point of divisions driving for distant objectives leaving their flanks uncovered: \\"risks which a month ago would have been criminal to incur, ought now to be incurred as a duty\\". It has been suggested that this was aimed in part as a rebuke to Byng. The following day he sent out further guidance, quoting the relevant passage of Field Service Regulations, on how \\"advance guards\\" should feel for weak spots in the enemy defences.Sheffield 2011, p.305-6 Sheffield (disagreeing with Harris & Barr pp146–7) argues that Haig was still aiming for relatively limited objectives, but with bigger bites across a wider front as he had wanted to do since 1915, and that he was aiming for \\"soft-spot infiltration\\", although still hoping for a complete enemy breakdown which would allow deep cavalry exploitation.Sheffield 2011, p.306-7 The Battle of Albert (21–3 August) saw Third Army push forward up to 4,000 yards over an 11 mile front, taking 5,000 prisoners, with Fourth Army attacking on the southern flank – in Gary Sheffield's description, a victory for ordinary British troops which would not have happened without Haig's prodding of Byng. The attacks continued for another two days, then on 26 August Currie's Canadian Corps, now part of First Army, attacked at Arras further north. Haig wrote to his wife that this, the Battle of the Scarpe, was \\"the greatest victory which a British Army has ever achieved\\", and although it did not achieve quite the planned level of success – cavalry, including a brigade of infantry in buses, had been ready to exploit – Ludendorff ordered further withdrawals that evening, including the ground gained by \\"Georgette\\" in April.Sheffield 2011, p.307-9 == Advance to the Hindenburg Line == After his recent successes Haig was Foch's most important subordinate, and in a letter of 27 August advised him to attack with several concentric major offensives into German-held territory, which would require the Americans to call a halt to their September offensive northeast from St Mihiel towards Metz and instead attack north from the Argonne. Foch adopted this policy in his Directive of 3 September.Sheffield 2011, p.313-4 Haig still expected the decisive attack to be made by the Canadians attacking the Drocourt-Queant Line, but on 27–9 August Fourth Army advanced six miles towards Peronne, whilst further north the New Zealand Division (part of Third Army) took Bapaume, the objective of the Somme offensive of 1916.Sheffield 2011, p.310-1 Haig knew that because of manpower constraints the BEF would soon be cut from 61 divisions to 42 (10 of them from the Dominions) and that Pershing was withdrawing three of the five US divisions serving on the British sector. By this time Haig was keen to preserve the strength of the Canadian Corps, ordering them not to attack the Drocourt-Queant position unless sure of taking it, and the cavalry. In late August-early September the Germans had been driven back 15 miles and 40,000 prisoners taken, but at the cost of 80,000 casualties and Haig was aware that immediate decisive victory was unlikely.Wiest 2005, p106Sheffield 2011, p.312 When Haig's forces began to advance towards the Hindenburg Line Haig received a supposedly \\"personal\\" telegram from the CIGS Henry Wilson (31 August), warning him that he was not to take unnecessary losses in storming these fortifications. Haig, surmising that the War Cabinet were not forbidding him to attack but might dismiss him if the assault failed, telegraphed Wilson back the following day that they were a \\"wretched lot\\" (Wilson replied that the Government were worried about needing to retain troops in the UK because of the police strike) and wrote that attacking the Germans now would be less costly than allowing them time to regroup and consolidate.Hart 2008, p. 421. Byng, Horne and Rawlinson also wanted to attack rather than let the Germans consolidate.Sheffield 2011, p.315 The advance up to the Hindenburg Line was difficult as many formerly British trenches in front of it had been converted to German use.Hart 2008, p420 Acting largely on his own initiative, Monash captured Mont Saint Quentin (31 August) then Peronne (2 September), making untenable a position which Ludendorff had hoped to hold throughout the winter – Haig ordered III Corps to reinforce the Australians. That day Haig met with Roger Keyes to discuss a possible landing on the North Sea Coast (as in 1917, the mooted landing never took place), and told him that he doubted the Germans could hold the Hindenburg Line. On 2 September the Canadian Corps and British XVII Corps took the Drocourt-Queant Line. That night the Germans retreated to the Hindenburg Line, along with further withdrawals in the Ypres and Lens areas – all the German gains from their Spring Offensives had now been retaken. Haig gave orders (3 September) to advance cautiously but to avoid \\"deliberate operations on a large scale\\" to conserve manpower for the forthcoming decisive battle. Haig thought the Germans' optimal strategy would be to abandon the Hindenburg Line and retreat to the Antwerp-Meuse Line, but although this was indeed Hindenburg's preference Ludendorff would not contemplate it.Sheffield 2011, p.314 Plumer's Second Army was (9 September) hived off from Haig's direct command into the Group d'Armees de Flandres (GAF), commanded notionally by King Albert of the Belgians but in reality by his chief of staff, the French General Degoutte. Haig had to agree but declined to loan three cavalry divisions as well. Dissatisfied by Plumer's plan for a limited offensive to retake Messines, Haig urged him to retake the high ground around Ypres (the British objectives from the previous autumn) and be prepared to land a division on the coast at Ostend. Plumer was sceptical as late as 13 September.Sheffield 2011, p.316 On 10 September Haig, on a brief visit to London, told Lord Milner (Secretary of State for War) that 77,000 prisoners and nearly 800 guns had been taken in four weeks, and that German morale was disintegrating and it was \\"the beginning of the end\\". He thought that the aim should be to win the war that year, and by spring 1919 at the latest, not July 1919 as the politicians had in mind, and urged that all available able-bodied men and transportation in the UK be sent, as well as men earmarked for the Royal Navy and for munitions production, even at the cost of reducing future munitions output. On 12 September, the day the Americans attacked at St Mihiel, Third Army began moving up to the Hindenburg Line by attacking at Havrincourt, beginning a fortnight of grinding progress against Germans who were still fighting hard on that sector. On 18 September Fourth Army attacked at Epehy, reaching the Hindenburg Line. Haig received a congratulatory note from Wilson saying \\"you must be a famous general\\", to which he replied that he was not (as this would have meant currying favour with Repington and the Northcliffe Press) but \\"we have a number of very capable generals\\".Sheffield 2011, p.318 By this stage the British cavalry were weakened just as they were playing a much large role in the war. 2nd Cavalry Division had been broken up to provide a squadron of cavalry for each division, leaving Kavanagh's Cavalry Corps with only two cavalry divisions, supported by a brigade of infantry in buses. (By contrast, of Allenby's 11 divisions in Palestine, 4 were cavalry.) Haig spent the whole of 17 September at a cavalry pursuit training exercise, followed by a conference, and then wrote up the report personally. He still hoped that cavalry could conduct a deeper exploitation towards Ghent or Valenciennes, but no longer had the resources to do so.Sheffield 2011, p.321-2 With few functioning tanks and armoured cars left, the British were hampered by lack of cavalry.Hart 2008, p490 Milner and Haig met again at GHQ in France (21 September) – Milner warned Haig that manpower would not be available for 1919 if squandered now and told Wilson (23 September) that Haig was being \\"ridiculously optimistic\\", might \\"embark on another Paschendal (sic)\\" and that he \\"had grave doubts whether he had got inside of DH's head\\"; Wilson thought the War Cabinet would have to \\"watch this tendency & stupidity of DH\\". He complained that Haig, Foch and du Cane did not understand the shortage of manpower – in fact Haig understood it perfectly well but hoped to win the war before British manpower ran out.Groot 1988, p.390.Sheffield 2011, p.317-8 Lloyd George still hoped to shift British efforts to other fronts, leaving the Americans to take over more of the burden on the Western Front going forward.Wiest 2005, p107 == Storming the Hindenburg Line == The Allied \\"Grand Offensive\\", planned by Foch and Haig, now began, the most important attack being that on the Hindenburg Line. Haig spent 26 September touring senior British Headquarters, contrasting Rawlinson's optimism with Byng's caution, and – at Monash's request – giving a short pep talk and shaking hands with senior officers of the Australian Corps. On that day the Franco-American attack began in the Meuse-Argonne, then on 27 September British First and Third Armies attacked. First Army, which included the Canadian Corps, had to cross three trench systems and the Canal du Nord (dry but 100 feet wide), pinning many German reserves in five days of hard fighting and in due course penetrating 6 miles over a 12 mile front and taking 10,000 prisoners. On 28 September the Flanders Army Group (GAF) attacked in Flanders, eventually advancing six miles and almost reaching Roulers, which had been the immediate objective of the Third Ypres Offensive the previous autumn. On 29 September Fourth Army attacked, including the famous crossing of the St Quentin Canal (35 feet wide and 6 feet deep) by 46th Division, part of IX Corps, the men using lifebelts taken from Channel Ferries, after a mustard gas bombardment. Fourth Army was attacking forces of roughly equal strength, with the Australians (including the US 27th and 30th Divisions) covered by 1,488 guns and massed Vickers Guns. Rawlinson's artillery density was equal only to that of 1 July 1916 but infantry had more organic firepower now. There were conflicting reports as to whether the US II Corps had captured the crossing over Bellincourt Tunnel (where the canal disappeared underground) – when asked for guidance by Monash, Haig ordered that his own attack must proceed as planned, even if American troops were killed by friendly fire. A cavalry brigade commanded by Haig's cousin, Brigadier-General Neil Haig, was briefly committed to dismount and fight as infantry. By early October Fourth Army was through the Beaurevoir (German Reserve) Line and into open country.Sheffield 2011, p.319-20, 322-3Wiest 2005, p107-8Hart 2008, p420, 423, 428 In late September Bulgaria sought an armistice, which also contributed to Ludendorff wanting an end to the war.Hart 2008, p449 On 3 October Haig received a memo from Winston Churchill arguing for the conservation of resources for a decisive struggle in 1920. Haig thanked him politely, but wrote on his copy \\"What rubbish: Who will last until 1920. Only America?\\" There were still rumours that Haig might be dismissed and replaced by Allenby.Sheffield 2011, p.324 With the GAF and Argonne attacks frustrated by logistical problems (Pershing refused Haig's request to send any further American divisions to the British sector, where the bulk of German forces were deployed and where Haig felt he could make better use of them). At a meeting with Byng and Rawlinson on 1 October \\"they agreed that no further orders from (Haig) were necessary\\", as all attacks were proceeding satisfactorily. In early October Fifth Army, now under Birdwood, took Aubers Ridge and Loos.Sheffield 2011, p.325 On 2 October Hindenburg told the Kaiser's Crown Council that Germany could no longer win a military victory, and the following day a new government was formed under Prince Max, which approached President Wilson for peace based on the Fourteen Points. When Haig met Foch on 6 October, Foch showed him the newspaper reports of this and told him it was a direct result of the BEF breach of the Hindenburg Line at its strongest point, although the almost simultaneous capitulation of Bulgaria was also a factor and discussions would continue for a month until the ceasefire on 11 November. At the meeting Haig again asked for US divisions for his sector, and was told this was not going to happen.Groot 1988, p.391.Sheffield 2011, p.326 == Final victory and armistice negotiations == After the breach of the Hindenburg Line, Haig's forces were through to open country. The Germans retreated to the River Selle (east of Cambrai) after a further British victory at the Second Battle of Cambrai, at which massed cavalry were used. On 10 October Haig received a paper from Foch recommending the seizure of the Rhineland – he disapproved, thinking this was too much like asking the Germans to surrender. The following day he received a telegram of congratulation from Lloyd George, which annoyed him by implying that the victories had been won by Marshal Foch.Sheffield 2011, p.328 By 12 October Third Army was held on the Selle River. On 14 October Plumer resumed his advance in the north, taking RoulersHart 2008, p477 and reaching Courtrai. On the same day President Wilson rejected German peace overtures, causing the Germans to abandon the Belgian Coast and the city of Lille (17 October) which they had been hoping to hold as bargaining chips. On the same day Fourth Army crossed the River Sambre and plans were made to advance on the River Selle, amidst worrying signs of a stiffening of German resistance.Sheffield 2011, p.329 When asked his opinion about the armistice terms which should be offered to Germany, Haig presented pessimistic advice to the War Cabinet on 19 October. He urged moderation, warning that intelligence reports suggested that the German Army was still \\"far from beaten\\" (an ironic claim in view of his willingness to pronounce Germany on the verge of defeat in previous years) and was concerned that the Germans were holding back the 1920 Class of conscripts to form a new reserve. He warned that the French and Americans \\"are not capable of making a serious offensive now. The British alone might bring the enemy to his knees. But why expend more British lives – and for what?\\" (Herbert Lawrence had also advised Haig it was in Britain's interests for the war to end on lenient terms) and that prolonged fighting would increase the influence of the USA, and that harsh terms might encourage Germany to turn either to Bolshevism or else back to military rule. He advised that the Allies should simply demand that Germany give up Belgium and Alsace- Lorraine.Sheffield 2011, p.330-1 After one meeting on 21 October Haig suspected Henry Wilson, a staunch Unionist, of wanting to prolong the war as an excuse to subdue southern Ireland by bringing in conscription there.Groot 1988, p.393. Haig gave Foch the same advice at the Senlis Conference (25 October) – he was privately suspicious of French plans to occupy the Rhineland,Sheffield 2011, p.330-1, 333 writing to his wife (1 November) that the peace of the world for the next fifty years depended on not driving Germany to seek future revenge by humiliating her.Wiest 2005, p109 He would later (e.g. in June 1919) defend the decision to save lives and money by offering Germany an armistice once she was clearly beaten, although with hindsight this allowed the myth to grow up that Germany had not really been defeated.Sheffield 2011, p.339, 362 The Allies agreed to offer peace on the basis of the Fourteen Points with a British opt-out for Point 2 (Freedom of the Seas).Hart 2008, p496 First and Third Armies crossed the Selle on 20 October. Fourth Army advanced to the Sambre and Second Army to the Scheldt. President Wilson publicly refused to offer Germany a separate peace (23 October). Ludendorff resigned (26 October), whilst Turkey sued for peace at the end of October. The German fleet mutinied (30 October). The Americans broke out of the Argonne on 1 November and two days later cut the Lille-Metz railway. 4 November saw an armistice with Austria-Hungary after the victory of the Italians – with British and French assistance – at Vittorio Veneto; Hungary and the Slav parts of Austria-Hungary had already declared independence in late October. The collapse of Austria-Hungary encouraged the politicians to demand stricter armistice terms (although less strict than Foch or Pershing would have liked) and Germany was required to evacuate the Rhineland as well. Between 26 October and 1 November was a period of quiet for resupply, then after 1 November followed three days of small gains. Haig had been irritated on Foch's insistence that Plumer's Second Army remain part of the GAF so that the French and Belgians could take credit for liberating Brussels,Groot 1988, p.392-4. and after an ill-tempered exchange of letters with Foch, Haig regained control of Second Army (4 November). German fighting capacity was deteriorating, with much of their resistance coming from machine guns and artillery. The last offensive began on 4 November, including Sambre- Oise (where the poet Wilfred Owen was killedHart 2008, p488) where makeshift tank bridges were used, and the Forest of Mormal where the BEF had fought in August 1914.Hart 2008, p487 The crossing of the Sambre (4 November) saw further mass surrenders of German troops and made the German High Command realise that they must make peace before their army, which they wanted at home to use to prevent Germany turning to Bolshevism, disintegrated altogether.Sheffield 2011, p.333 Haig was now recovering his optimism. The Scheld was crossed on 9 November, two days ahead of schedule, with the Germans now offering little resistance as they retreated to the Antwerp-Meuse Line. Byng and Rawlinson politely declined Haig's plans to exploit with Kavanagh's Cavalry Corps, citing logistical difficulties. The Canadians attacked the German Seventeenth Army at Mons, ending the war at the place where the BEF had begun it.Hart 2008, p494 When the armistice took effect (11am on 11 November) Haig was at Cambrai in conference with his Army Commanders and Kavanagh – after planning the British contribution to the occupation of the Rhineland they posed for a group photograph. In England it was rumoured in England that the Kaiser, before being diverted into exile in the Netherlands, had been intending to surrender personally to Haig.Sheffield 2011, p.334-6 == Analysis == J.P. Harris is highly critical of Haig's command record in the first half of 1918. Although British Intelligence guessed the location (but not the magnitude) of the March attack, insufficient troops were given to Fifth Army. Gough later complained of Haig's and Lawrence's apparent detachment for the first few days of the offensive (\\"a failure of leadership\\" in Harris's view), which may well have contributed to Gough's decision to order his corps commanders to retreat, a process which soon threatened to turn to rout. Haig's initial complacency soon turned to serious alarm, a breakdown in relations with Petain, and without the intervention of Lloyd George, Wilson, Milner and Foch in the 24–26 March period, it is quite possible that the BEF might have been decisively defeated and the British and French Armies driven apart. Harris also suggests that Haig was close to panic on 9–12 April and 25–28 April, only holding on to the city of Ypres because of Foch's intervention. When the French in their turn came under attack at the end of May he was \\"slow to reciprocate the support he had received\\", albeit based on justified concern that there might be a German attack on the BEF front. He remarks that \\"despite the British government's generally poor view of his performance, and ... brainpower\\" he \\"somehow r(ode) out the crisis\\" and \\"rather amazingly\\" remained in command.Harris 2008, pp. 483–4 In the spring of 1918 Intelligence under Brigadier-General Edgar Cox, and Operations (\\"Oa\\", now under the future CIGS Brigadier-General John Dill) were now both put under Maj-Gen \\"Tavish\\" Davidson. This was probably part of the cutting-down to size of Charteris' intelligence empire. A separate section—Staff Duties under Maj-Gen Guy Dawnay—covered organisation, training, anti-aircraft and (briefly) machine guns. In June Staff Duties gained control of censorship and publicity (formerly part of intelligence) and transport (formerly a separate department under Eric Geddes) was put back under the Quartermaster-General (now Sir Travers Clarke). No evidence has been found as to whether Haig supported or resisted these changes. Better BEF performance that year probably owed something to greater efficiency at GHQ, although greater delegation to corps and divisional commanders was probably also a factor.Harris 2008, p. 464 There is some dispute over how much direct operational control Haig maintained in the Hundred Days, Tim Travers arguing that he exercised \\"a symbolic form of leadership\\", allowing his Army Commanders (Plumer, Byng, Horne, Birdwood and Rawlinson) a very free hand, whilst at the same time Ferdinand Foch, whose role had initially been confined to advice and deployment of reserves, was exerting ever-greater influence over strategy. Robin Prior argues that by the second half of 1918 both Lloyd George and Haig were \\"moving steadily to the sidelines\\",Prior & Wilson 1996, p. 200 although he also concedes that Haig intervened in operations much less now he knew the BEF to be a fine fighting instrument and \\"he proved far more effective as a commander\\" as a result.Prior & Wilson 2004, p. 305 By contrast Sheffield argues that Haig was Foch's principal subordinate—they met sixty times between April and November—and influenced his strategy (in Wiest's view Foch was also \\"a buffer between Haig and his political tormentors in London\\".) \\"At last (Haig) was able to behave as the sort of \\"arms-length\\" Commander-in-Chief that was his ideal: setting broad objectives\\" but devolving detailed planning of battles. Besides, \\"he had presided over the transformation of the army\\" and \\"Haig's performance as a general improved as the army matured. He was ... doing fewer things better\\". GHQ also played a key role in sequencing the attacks of the armies in late September, and keeping them fully supplied.Sheffield 2011, pp. 336–8 The forces under Haig's command—including Monash's Australian Corps and Currie's Canadian Corps—achieved impressive results: whereas the French, American and Belgian armies combined captured 196,700 prisoners-of-war and 3,775 German guns between 18 July and the end of the war, Haig's forces, with a smaller army than the French, engaged the main mass of the German Army and captured 188,700 prisoners and 2,840 guns and around half of these prisoners were captured by British cavalry. British daily casualty rates (3,645 per day) were greater during this period than at the Somme (2,950) or Third Ypres (2,121) but not Arras (4,070 over a shorter period),British Military Leadership in the First World War because British forces were attacking across the line, instead of being rotated through a single offensive.Hart 2008, p. 364. The military historian, Gary Sheffield, called this, the so-called Hundred Days Offensive, 'by far the greatest military victory in British history'. == References  Bibliography == * Bond, Brian and Cave, Nigel (eds) Haig – A Reappraisal 70 Years On.

Through his relationship with Joseph Bell & Son, Robinson received commissions for work, became a director at the firm and later became owner. He became part-owner of the flagging Bristol Guild of Applied Art, which then became a well-reputed and successful guild in Bristol. ==Early life and studies== Robinson was born on 17 December 1888, and his birth was registered in January 1889 in Barton Regis, Gloucestershire. He was the son of Kossuth Robinson and Mary Selina Wathen Robinson who lived in the Westbury area of Bristol until 1899. Then they moved to a newly built house in the Sneyd Park area. Kossuth Robinson was a Justice of the Peace for the County of Gloucestershire and at one time had kept a 100-acre farm. The family were reasonably well off and when he died on 9 February 1928 he left an estate worth some £27,000.

In the Second World War Arnold worked as an Air Raid Warden during the blitzes that Bristol endured.Robinson, Geoffrey. Notes to the Friends of Bristol Cathedral. ==Education== Robinson was educated at Clifton College and was to become an Academician of the Royal West of England Academy (RWA). ==Career== He started his working life serving as an apprentice to Christopher Whall from 1906 to 1912 and it was at Whall’s studio that he was to meet and befriend Karl Parsons and Edward Woore. In around 1912 he started to work with the Glass House in Fulham, working with amongst others Edward Woore. Most of his early commissions were for churches and institutions in Bristol, where the Robinson family were well known and influential. In particular, and working with Woore, he undertook commissions for the firm Joseph Bell and Sons.Foyle, Andrew and Nikolaus Pevsner. (2011). The Buildings of England. Somerset: North and Bristol. Yale University Press. . Robinson became a director of the Bristol firm of Joseph Bell & Son, which carried out stained glass work for many West Country churches. Especially well known in Bristol are the Civil Defence windows that Arnold Robinson designed for Bristol Cathedral and his Bunyan and Tyndale windows in Tyndale Baptist Church. Joseph Bell & Son was initially established by Joseph Bell (1810–1895) and then run by his son, Frederick Henry Bell (1847–1899) and grandson, Frederick George Bell (1878–1967) until 1923 when it was sold to Arnold Robinson. Arnold Robinson was also heavily involved with the Bristol Guild of Applied Art. Established in 1908 by followers of William Morris's Arts and Crafts creed, the Bristol Guild of Applied Art was a co-operative of skilled workers offering hand-crafted work to replace mass-produced goods, improving the relationship between the worker and his work. Initially the guild was unsuccessful. In 1918 it was bought as a business by three private owners, including Arnold Robinson; It was to become one of Bristol’s most successful shops and the Guild Gallery on the shop’s second floor an important Arts centre. ==Personal life== Arnold married Constance Burgess in 1925. They had three children, Daphne, Cecily and Geoffrey. Geoffrey followed in his father’s footsteps as a stained glass artist.

Norway was the 1994 World Champion and 1993 runner-up and, with its Olympic duo, the 1995 bronze medalist, while Undset was also an Olympic silver medalist from the 1992 quadruple sculls. Germany had been runner-up at the last two editions of the World Championships and a bronze medalist in 1993. The lone exception to the dominance of these three nations was Denmark, who won the 1995 World Championships with Lars Christensen and Martin Haldbo Hansen. Australia, meanwhile, sent one of its defending Olympic champions, Peter Antonie, to Atlanta with a new partner, Jason Day. Antoine was also one half of the winning crew at the 1995 Double Challenge Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta. Hungary's Zsolt Dani and Gábor Mitring were the 1994 winners of that tournament. In the opening round, Norway posted the fastest time by nearly five seconds, while the other heats were won by Denmark and the Italian duo of Davide Tizzano and Agostino Abbagnale, both of whom were Olympic champions in the quadruple sculls from 1988. The Hungarians, meanwhile, were eliminated in the repêchage. In the semi-finals it was France who eliminated the Australians with the fastest time in the round, nearly three seconds ahead of its closest competition, while Italy won the other heat. The race in the final was closer, but Italy, Norway, and France were all ahead of the pack and crossed the finish line in that order. Denmark, the reigning World Champions, came in fourth nearly five seconds later. ==Medalists== {  - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"gold\\"Gold bgcolor=\\"silver\\"Silver bgcolor=\\"CC9966\\"Bronze - valign=\\"top\\"  Davide Tizzano Agostino Abbagnale  Kjetil Undset Steffen Størseth  Frédéric Kowal Samuel Barathay } ==Heats== *SA/B denotes qualification to Semifinal A/B. *R denotes qualification to Repechage. ===Heat 1=== { width=50% - !Rank !Rowers !Country !Time !Notes - 1 Kjetil Undset, Steffen Størseth  6:43.35 SA/B - 2 Kajetan Broniewski, Adam Korol  6:48.13 R - 3 Peter Antonie, Jason Day  6:50.15 R - 4 Ondrej Hambálek, Ján Žiška  6:55.87 R - 5 Lee In-su, Lee Ho  7:11.56 R - } ===Heat 2=== { width=50% - !Rank !Rowers !Country !Time !Notes - 1 Lars Christensen, Martin Haldbo Hansen  6:48.75 SA/B - 2 Sebastian Mayer, Roland Opfer  6:51.41 R - 3 Tom Symoens, Björn Hendrickx  6:54.80 R - 4 Erik Tul, Luka Špik  7:02.48 R - 5 Melquiades Verduras, José Antonio Merín  7:13.99 R } ===Heat 3=== James Cracknell was one of the nominated British scullers but he was suffering from tonsillitis;

He was the son of Joseph Shipley (b. 1823) and Isabel (née Hetherington). At one period he lived in John Clay Street, South Shields. He was apprenticed in the merchant marine, but the log books of his voyages (1870–1871) list him on every page for committing every misdemeanour in the sailing book. At some time during his early career he became a painter and decorator (he is described as such in Thomas Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings, published in 1891, so balloon jumping was quite in keeping with his character At the time both ballooning, but more particularly, parachuting were unheard of novelties, at the forefront of aviation, and as such attracted much interest and curiosity wherever they took place. In spring 1890, he made two parachute descents from a balloon floating above the town. He made his first balloon ascent from a field in Westoe on 5 April 1890 and after a successful flight (reaching, it is said, the height of 6000 feet) came down at Cleadon. On 5 April he made a particularly rash jump, descending from (so it is said) 15,000 feet. Shipley, dressed showily in dark velvet, landed on the roof of a house in John Williamson Street. An article appeared about 10 days later in the South Shields Daily Gazette which included a poem (of which it was said contained 9 verses) written by someone using the pseudonym \\"Geordie\\". The first verses were also published in Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings. Queries have been raised regarding the accuracy of the heights given in the report. Shipley continued with his ballooning and parachuting and carried out a jump descending on Newcastle Town Moor in about 1896. He was sufficiently proficient, however, to later be engaged by the Hudson Soap Co. to advertise its soap. == See also == *Geordie dialect words ==References * Allan’s Illustrated Edition of Tyneside songs and readings * Ryhming out for daredevil artist, Shields Gazette, Thursday 6 May 2010 * Ancestry search Category:People from South Shields Category:1853 births Category:Geordie songwriters Category:Year of death missing Category:English people of Scottish descent Category:English people of Irish descent Category:Anglo-Scots ","title":"William Hetherington Shipley"},{"id":"35882472","text":"Al Yamamah (meaning The Dove in English) is a weekly Arabic magazine published in Saudi Arabia.

The majority of Llangynwyd Middle is made up of hilly farmland and is sparsely populated. The River Llynfi flows through the community alongside the A4063, the main road linking Maesteg in the north and Bridgend town in the south. ==History== The community of Llangynwyd Middle makes up most of the old parish of Llangynwyd once known as yr Hen Blwyf (the old parish). One of the first areas of upland Glamorgan to come under the rule of the Normans, it became known as Tir Iarll (the earl's land) and was believed to be annexed by Robert, Earl of Gloucester. A castle was built there in the 12th century, though the fortification, now known as Llangynwyd Castle, was first mentioned in 1246. The castle was destroyed in 1257, probably by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. The castle was partially rebuilt by Gilbert de Clare during the 1260s, but was again sacked in the riots of 1294-5. This time the castle was left ruinous and today only basic masonry and foundation stones can be seen. Despite falling under early Norman rule, the area around Llangynwyd remained rooted in Welsh traditions, and became a centre of Welsh literary tradition, and is connected with Welsh medieval poets, such as Rhys Brydydd, Rhisiart ap Rhys and Gwilym Tew. During the 14th century, a church dedicated to St Cynwyd was raised, which gives its name to the community. The church, built with a square unbuttressed western tower, was greatly restored between 1891-3 by G.E. Halliday. Ann Maddocks the 'Maid of Cefn Ydfa', is buried in the churchyard. == References  *Map showing the community boundaries of Llangynwyd Middle Category:Communities in Bridgend County Borough ","title":"Llangynwyd Middle"},{"id":"35882495","text":"Andrey Aguilar Komissarov (born 18 November 1960) is a Costa Rican former swimmer who competed in the 1980 Summer Olympics and in the 1984 Summer Olympics.

The region of West Florida initially had the same borders as the erstwhile British colony. Much of its territory was gradually annexed by the United States in the West Florida controversy. At its greatest extent, the colony included what are now the Florida Parishes of Louisiana, the southernmost parts of Mississippi and Alabama, and the panhandle of Florida. Whereas southeastern Louisiana and present-day coastal Mississippi and Alabama were annexed either prior to or during the War of 1812, the land which makes up present-day Florida was not acquired until several years later. It became the Florida Territory of the United States in 1822. ==History== Annotated map of the territorial changes of Spanish West FloridaUnder Spanish rule, Florida was divided by the natural separation of the Suwannee River into West Florida and East Florida. (map: Carey & Lea, 1822) Spain was the first European state to colonize the Florida peninsula, expanding northward from Cuba and establishing long-lasting settlements at St. Augustine, on the Atlantic coast, and at Pensacola and San Marcos (St. Marks), on the Gulf of Mexico coast. Following Spain's losses to Great Britain during the Seven Years' War, Spain ceded its Florida territory to Britain in 1763. British administrators then divided the territory into two colonies: East Florida, including the Florida peninsula with the capital at St. Augustine, and West Florida, to which was appended part of the territory received from France under the 1763 peace treaty. West Florida extended from the Apalachicola River to the Mississippi River, with its capital at Pensacola. In 1779, Spain entered the American Revolutionary War on the side of France but not the Thirteen Colonies. Bernardo de Gálvez, governor of Spanish Louisiana, led a military campaign along the Gulf coast, capturing Baton Rouge and Natchez from the British in 1779, Mobile in 1780, and Pensacola in 1781. In the 1783 peace treaty, Great Britain returned both Florida colonies to Spanish control. Instead of administering Florida as a single province, as it had prior to 1763, New Spain preserved the British arrangement of dividing the territory between East and West Florida (Florida Oriental and Florida Occidental). When Spain acquired West Florida in 1783, the eastern British boundary was the Apalachicola River, but Spain in 1785 moved it eastward to the Suwannee River. Wright also notes, \\"It was some time after 1785 before it was clearly established that Suwannee was the new eastern boundary of the province of Apalachee.\\" The purpose was to transfer San Marcos and the district of Apalachee from East Florida to West Florida. ==See also== *Spanish Florida *New Spain *British West Florida *East Florida *West Florida *Republic of West Florida *West Florida Controversy *Florida Territory ==ReferencesBibliography== * Reprint, Pioneer Publishing, 164 pp. * *Gannon, Michael (1996).

It especially common in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, and can trace its origin to Chinese cuisine. In Indonesia, the dish is recognized as a popular Chinese Indonesian dish, served from simple travelling vendor carts frequenting residential areas, humble street-side warung to restaurants. == Preparation and serving == The yellow wheat noodle is boiled in water until it achieves an al dente texture and mixed in a bowl with cooking oil, soy sauce and garlic. The oil coats the noodle in order to separate the threads. The oil can be chicken fat, lard, or vegetable oil. The chicken meat is diced and cooked in soy sauce and other seasonings including garlic. The chicken meat might also be cooked with mushrooms. The seasoned chicken and mushroom mixture is placed on the noodles, and topped with chopped spring onions (green shallots). Bakmi ayam is usually served with a separate chicken broth, boiled chinese cabbage, and often wonton () either crispy fried or in soup, and also bakso (meatballs). While Chinese variants might use pork fat or lard, the more common Indonesian mie ayam uses halal chicken fat or vegetable oil to cater to Muslim eaters. Additional condiments might include tong cay (salted preserved vegetables), bawang goreng (fried shallots), daun bawang (leek), kulit pangsit goreng (fried dumpling skin), acar timun cabe rawit (pickled cucumber and birds eye chilli), sambal and tomato ketchup. Mie ayam \\"chicken noodle\\" can be served in two different variants, which are the common savoury or salty noodle (mie asin) and sweet noodle (mie manis). The sweet variant is often also called as mie yamin. For the sweet noodle, the cook will put additional sweet soy sauce kecap manis, so the appearance will be a little bit brownish. == Variants == Mie ayam sold by travelling vendor with wonton and bakso meatball. Other types of noodles such as bihun (rice vermicelli) and kwetiau (flat noodle) might be served in the same recipe instead of the bakmi. Kwetiau ayam (chicken kway teow) and bihun ayam (chicken bihun) refer to almost exactly the same recipe with mie ayam by replacing yellow wheat noodle with flat noodle or rice vermicelli. In Indonesia, the name is shortened to mie ayam or mi ayam. In Indonesia chicken noodles is often seasoned with soy sauce and chicken oil, made from chicken fat and spices mixture (clove, white pepper, ginger and coriander), and usually served with a chicken broth soup. Different with Indonesian chicken noodles, traditionally in Singapore, curry powder was added to the stock, and the soup enhanced with oyster sauce and green onions. Also, fish dumpling and mushroom were added. == See also== * Mie goreng * Kwetiau goreng * List of chicken dishes ==References== Category:Indonesian Chinese cuisine Category:Indonesian noodle dishes Category:Indonesian chicken dishes Category:Street food in Indonesia ","title":"Mie ayam"},{"id":"35882571","text":"Stepanóvich (Russian, Belarusian) or Stepanovych (Ukrainian) is an East Slavic-language surname.

Tan was a former editor of Temasek Review, a now-defunct socio-political website that mainly produced articles on Singapore. With effect from 7 May 2020, his Facebook pages and website are officially banned in Singapore by the government in accordance with its fake news law, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA). On 27 May 2020, Tan has since been referred to Singapore's Attorney-General Chambers for contempt of court. == Activism == Tan was an editor and one of the contributors and founders of the sociopolitical website The Real Singapore (TRS). In January 2011, Tan reproduced a blog post on one of his websites, Temasek Revealed, which claimed that a full-time national serviceman had died after being shot during training. The post subsequently went viral. After the Ministry of Defence identified the post as a hoax and made a police report, a 19-year-old was arrested and charged for \\"transmitting false messages to the public\\", an offense under Singapore's telecommunications laws. Temasek Revealed was taken offline after the incident. In July 2012, Tan sent SBS Transit an \\"expletive-filled rant in an e-mail\\" following a trip on one of its buses, which also propagated on local forums and social media sites. Following SBS Transit's complaints to the police, Tan published an apology on his blog which he said \\"maligned the good work SBS Transit Ltd has done for Singapore\\" which amounted to \\"blesphemous libel\\", in return for the company to stop pursuing the matter. The company acknowledged Tan's apology and offer to retract his previous statements. On 6 Feb 2015, two editors of TRS, Ai Takagi and Robin Yang Kai Heng, were arrested under the Sedition Act for sedition charges. Tan moved to Australia soon after and The Real Singapore was shut down on 3 May 2015 by order of the Media Development Authority of Singapore. He subsequently started a new website called Straits Times Review, later changing its name to States Times Review. Law minister K Shanmugam had identified Straits Times Review as a publisher of fake news, citing the site's claim of a \\"near-zero turnout for former president SR Nathan’s funeral, and that kindergarten kids were forced to attend, in an attempt to paint him as an unpopular president\\". == Political career == Tan contested under the Reform Party banner in 2011 as his party, the Singapore People's Party, was not interested in contesting in the Prime Minister's ward. As the main organizer of the two parties' joint walkabouts, Tan sought the Reform Party's help to contest in Ang Mo Kio GRC. The Reform Party then \\"loaned\\" Alex from the Singapore People's Party to contest in the ward. In his maiden election speech, Tan underscored the lack of a social safety net for the elderly in Singapore and the influx of foreigners that has diluted Singaporeans' identity. Other campaigning issues he took on included the state of overcrowding, cost of living and the lack of transparency and accountability in the national retirement fund, the Central Provident Fund, and the national reserves. In one of his speeches, Tan questioned Dr Vivian Balakrishnan about statements Balakrishnan had made about the government wealth fund GIC's portfolio having returned to pre-crisis levels and claimed that no statistics or figures were provided to back up the statements. In an open letter on the States Times Review, whereby website which is banned in Singapore, Tan challenged law minister K Shanmugam to stand against each other for election in a Single Member Constituency at the 2020 general elections. However, at present, Tan refused to return to Singapore to nominate himself on 30 June 2020 Nomination Day for the 10 July 2020 General Election, as he is on self- exile asylum in Australia. ==Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act== In April 2020, multiple Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act correction notices were issued to Tan on four occasions. In May 2020, Tan was issued another correction notice for spreading online falsehoods and manipulation. A new correction notice was issued on 27 May 2020. In June 2020, Tan was again issued with another correction notice for spreading online falsehoods, misleading misinformation and manipulation.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pofma-office- instructed-issue-correction-directions-alex-tan-sns-12880108 ==Other activities== In July 2011, Wang Peng Fei, a People Republic of China (PRC) student in Singapore made derogatory remarks against a Malay woman in his YouTube video post, and Tan lodged an official police report against him. The PRC student was subsequently expelled. Another PRC student, Sun Xu, who made a disparaging comment about Singaporeans (referring them as dogs), was also reported by Alex. ==ControversiesAllegations of Singapore government's role in 1MDB scandal=== On 6 November 2018, States Times Review published an article \\"Lee Hsien Loong becomes 1MDB's key investigation target\\", alleging that Malaysia had signed several unfair agreements with Singapore in exchange for Singapore banks’ assistance in laundering the Malaysian state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and implying that Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is complicit in the money laundering on 1MDB. The Coverage of Malaysia subsequently published an article based on the content of this article, leading to the Monetary Authority of Singapore to file a police report against him for \\"impugning its integrity\\". K Shanmugam also called out the 'absurd' allegations and warned that such a method of propagating fake news has been used successfully in other parts of the world, and that when the information appears in mainstream media it gives \\"some credence\\" to the falsehoods. The article also claimed that editor Ms Clare Rewcastle of Sarawak Report (SR) said in an interview with Malaysian media that Singapore, along with the United States and Switzerland, were key investigation targets in the 1MDB scandal. In response, SR called the interview \\"erroneous\\" and disowned the claim, saying that \\"SR (had) not given any such interview and (had) not written on this subject\\" and that \\"the article moreover (was) unclear in its direction and meaning.\\" On 9 November, the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) ordered States Times Review to take down the article or face blocked access by the Internet Service Providers (ISP) should it fail to do so by 5 p.m. that day. However, States Times Review refused to remove the alleged offending article on a Facebook post at 6 p.m. that day, with Tan even inviting Lee Hsien Loong to file a case with Australian authorities. As such, IMDA would direct ISPs to block States Times Review as it had not complied to the order by 5 p.m. that day. However Facebook had refused to take down the article from its platform as revealed by the Ministry of Law, which justified the necessity for legislation to defend Singapore from deliberate online falsehoods since \\"Facebook (could not) be relied upon to filter falsehoods or protect Singapore from a false information campaign.\\" Shortly after the blocked access to the offending article, Tan would announce that he would shut down States Times Review after the next Singaporean general election due to be held on 10 July 2020 and its Facebook page by 23 November 2018, saying that he would 'stop writing and continue life in Australia'. However, he also indicated that he would be offering help to a Toronto-based reader, a dual citizen of Canada and Singapore, to help start a new website Singapore Herald, whose server would be based in Burlington, Massachusetts. ===Banned and blocked in Singapore=== Facebook has blocked access to the State Times Review's (STR) page in Singapore, after it was instructed to do so on Monday (Feb 17) by the office overseeing the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA). ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Singaporean politicians Category:Reform Party (Singapore) politicians Category:Singaporean people of Chinese descent ","title":"Alex Tan"},{"id":"35882629","text":"Özlem Kaya (; born April 20, 1990 in Ardahan, Turkey) is a Turkish female middle-distance runner.

He played college football at William Penn University and was signed by the New York Jets as an undrafted free agent in 2012. He has also been a member of the New York Giants and Detroit Lions. According to Pro Football Focus, he led the league in run-stop percentage between 2013 and 2016. ==Early years== Harrison was born in New Iberia, Louisiana on November 29, 1988. He attended Lake Charles Boston High School, where he primarily played shooting guard on the school's basketball varsity team. On November 29, 2005, during his junior season, he injured the meniscus in his left knee, and gained \\"like 40 or 50 pounds\\" over the next two months. He decided to take on football for his senior year, playing both offensive and defensive line, and was an all- district and all-Southwest Louisiana selection in 2006. He was also named as the team captain and was selected as Lake Charles Boston's Offensive MVP and Defensive MVP along with being selected as the Lake Charles Boston's Offensive Lineman of the Year. Since much of recruiting takes place during a high school player's junior season, Harrison was overlooked by college scouts and wound up without any scholarship offer after his graduation. He enrolled at Northwest Mississippi Community College, but dropped out after the first semester to work as a night stocker at Walmart in Lake Charles. However, he was later recruited to William Penn University, in Oskaloosa, Iowa, by former NMCC assistant coach Steve Miller. ==College career== In his freshman year at William Penn, Harrison finished fifth on the team in tackles. As a sophomore and junior, he was voted second-team all-conference. During his senior season, he was recognized as NAIA All-American and first-team all-conference after posting 3.5 sacks and 8.5 tackles for losses among his team-high 60 tackles. Throughout his college career, he started all 44 games he played at William Penn. ==Professional career== Prior to the draft, Harrison worked out at Iowa State's pro day, and was “considered a late-round prospect in a weak class of nose tackle.” The last player to have been selected from William Penn in the NFL Draft was Andy Stokes in 2005, who was taken by the New England Patriots with the final pick, and their last player to appear in an NFL game was Warren Loving in 1987. After receiving a seventh-round grade by Jeff Bauer, Jets' director of college scouting, Harrison went undrafted in the 2012 NFL Draft. Right after the draft, he was called by twelve NFL teams to join their practice camp squads. ===New York Jets=== Harrison was signed by the New York Jets as an undrafted free agent on April 29, 2012. He appeared in 5 games in 2012 but did not record a single stat that year. Following the departure of Sione Pouha and a preseason injury to Kenrick Ellis, Harrison was named the starting defensive tackle for the 2013 season. On October 20, 2013, Harrison recorded his first career sack when he brought down New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.

The episode is co-written by executive producers Nicole Yorkin and Dawn Prestwich and directed by Phil Abraham. In the episode, Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) obtains Rosie Larsen's keys, which allow access to the casino's tenth floor; Stan Larsen (Brent Sexton) learns of son Tommy's (Evan Bird) bad behavior at school; Mitch Larsen (Michelle Forbes) meets David Ranier (Jonathan Cake); and Darren Richmond (Billy Campbell) asks Nicole Jackson (Claudia Ferri) to assist the police. ==Plot== Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman) calls Linden from their office to tell her that it has been cleared out. Lt. Carlson (Mark Moses) tells Holder that the Larsen case has been transferred to County Sheriffs Office and that he is risking his career by continuing to be Linden's partner. Holder defends Linden, but Carlson tells him that she once spent a month in a psych ward after she \\"completely lost it\\" working on a case. Outside in Linden’s car, Holder calls County looking for Rosie's case files but is unable to reach anyone in Evidence. When Linden suggests they work around Gil and the County Police, Holder reminds her she is suspended. The two visit Richmond to ask him to persuade Jackson to get them access to the casino. Richmond replies that he is also not on good terms with Jackson. In the car, Linden apologizes to Holder for their separation at the reservation on the day he was assaulted. He reassures her that they are still friends and exits the car. After parking at her motel, Linden finds her son Jack's jacket in the back seat and begins to cry. The next morning, Mitch goes to see David Rainer, Rosie's biological father. Rosie had visited him before her death. He is unaware that Rosie has since died. He tells Mitch that Rosie wanted to know more about Mitch's life. As they reflect on the past, he mentions that Rosie was planning a trip to California to see the monarch butterflies. As she leaves, he asks if Rosie is his child. Mitch lies, saying that she is Stan's. Tommy Larsen's elementary school principal (Nancy Kerr) leaves Stan a message concerning his son. At school, he is told that Tommy stomped on a nest of baby birds and is suspended for two weeks. To no avail, Stan pleads his case about not being able to take care of his son while he is working. Outside, he yells at Tommy and takes away his house privileges, comparing his behavior to Rosie misbehaving. Tommy argues that point and says that he hates her and is glad she is dead. Stan slaps Tommy and orders the boys into the truck. Holder finds Linden asleep in her car and tells her the case files never made it to County. Gil Sloane (Brian Markinson) later arrives at his apartment to find that Holder has ransacked it and is still there. Holder demands to know where the Larsen case files are. Gil denies knowledge. While Holder is inside, Linden takes Gil's GPS from his car. The detectives access it to find two addresses visited by Gil the previous night. Holder suggests that Gil stashed the case files at one of the locations. They arrive at a Greek restaurant, one of the addresses Gil visited. Holder recalls previously visiting the place with Gil, adding that Gil has a storage unit in the back. After finding the unit and breaking in, they find plastic bags containing the Larsen evidence and Rosie's keychain. In a meeting with Richmond, Jackson speaks of plans to build a museum and gift shop on the waterfront, and requests tax exemption for all tribal lands in the city in exchange for her campaign backing. He responds by asking her to let the police search the casino. She refuses and he ends the negotiation. Despite Jamie's (Eric Ladin) insistence, Richmond refuses to negotiate with Jackson, saying that she only serves herself. Jamie says that the race will never be won with such a clean campaign, and Richmond later admits to Gwen (Kristin Lehman) that he is probably going to lose. At home, Stan apologizes to his sons, both of which voice their abandonment concerns. Stan assures them they will never be alone. Mitch later calls Stan crying and saying Rosie had been planning a trip. Their daughter was leaving them. Mayor Lesley Adams (Tom Butler) meets with Gwen, who tells him to walk away from Jackson's waterfront project. She threatens to tell her father, a key figure in Adams' political career, about an intimate moment they shared years ago. She points out that she was 14 years old at the time, but he says her father already knows. He then calls Richmond \\"desperate\\" for this latest threat from her. At the casino, Holder and Linden realize Mary is too scared to let her into the casino through the kitchen, where she would avoid security cameras. Holder maps out the route to the elevator for Linden, who enters a side door on her own. Holder distracts the security guards by causing a commotion on the casino floor, finally leaving when Roberta Drays (Patti Kim) shows up. Linden gains access to the tenth floor construction site and calls Holder to describe what she sees. She turns on a generator and opens a sliding glass door, causing sounds identical to the background noises heard in Rosie's voice mail to Alexi. She gazes at the Seattle skyline from a balcony, deducing that Rosie was leaving town that night, came to the tenth floor to say goodbye to the city, and must have seen Michael Ames meeting with someone. Back inside, she notices a keycard from City Hall between some exposed floorboards. The card is smeared with blood. As she attempts to retrieve the card, she is knocked out from behind. ==ReceptionCritical reception=== \\"Sayonara, Hiawatha\\" received positive reviews. Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic rated the episode 4 out of 5 stars, stating that the episode \\"left me more bored than anything, but Linden and Holder's scenes had me captivated. So much so that the final ten minutes of finally entering the mysterious tenth floor was chock full of suspense... Sure, everyone's impacted by the death, but the real gripping, compelling, and driving force of the show remains the case and its two wonderful lead detectives.\\" The A.V. Club's Brandon Nowalk rated this episode a B, saying \\"'Sayonara, Hiawatha' is a smart, restrained episode, but I can't follow suit because it's time to confess how much I love this show. This one, the muted procedural inflected with horror. It may have taken me two months, but I can't deny the careful craftsmanship, and the emotional effect has been the stronger for it.\\" William Bibbiani of CraveOnline called the episode \\"the best...of The Killing so far this season\\". He added, \\"For weeks now I've been saying that for The Killing to avoid turning into an absolute debacle, the series would have to pull out all the stops in the finale. 'Sayonara, Hiawatha' is an encouraging step in that direction.\\" ===Ratings=== The episode was watched by 1.31 million viewers and received an adult 18-49 rating of 0.4, marking the series' lowest numbers. == References  *\\"Sayonara, Hiawatha\\" at AMC * * Category:The Killing (American TV series) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"Sayonara, Hiawatha"},{"id":"35882699","text":"Haikou is the capital of Hainan Province, China.

On 9 January 2012, he was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment. ==Pearl Roundabout incident== In February 2011, large-scale pro-democracy protests began in Bahrain as part of the international Arab Spring. The center of the protests was Pearl Roundabout in Manama, which protesters compared to Tahrir Square in the recent Egyptian revolution. The roundabout saw several battles between protesters and police, including a 17 February pre-dawn raid that killed four protesters\\"Bahrain deploys army after raid\\", Al Jazeera English, 17 February 2011. Retrieved 20 May 2012. and injured one hundred more. After seeing the violence, al-Ghanmi left his guard post and joined the crowd, announcing to them that he could no longer support \\"a killer institution\\". The crowd hoisted him on their shoulders, and al-Ghanmi became an immediate \\"mini-celebrity\\" of the protest movement. In the month that followed, al-Ghanmi criticized Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, the King of Bahrain, at a series of rallies. According to an activist interviewed by BBC News, approximately two hundred police followed al-Ghanmi's example and defected, almost all of whom were also later arrested. Human Rights First described him as a hero of the Arab Spring for his actions during the protests. ==Arrest and trial== In March 2011, the government of Bahrain brought Gulf Co-operation Council troops led by Saudi Arabian forces into the country to battle the protesters, and the protesters were dislodged from the Pearl Roundabout. Al-Ghanmi went into hiding to avoid the crackdown. His family alleged that they were threatened in an effort to make them reveal his whereabouts. Al-Ghanmi was discovered and arrested on 4 May. From September 2011 to January 2012, al-Ghanmi was held in solitary confinement, allegedly for shouting \\"Down, down, Hamad\\" in the prison yard. In December 2011, al-Ghanmi's lawyer alleged that al-Ghanmi had been subject to insults, abuse, and beatings by his guards. On 9 January 2012, al-Ghanmi was sentenced to twelve years' imprisonment by a military court for having defected from the police: two years for \\"disturbing the peace\\", three years for \\"incitement to hatred against the government\\", and seven and a half years for his going absent without leave and his participation in the rallies. == Responses == Al Wefaq, Bahrain's main opposition party, said that al-Ghanmi arrest is \\"yet another prove that the government only recognizes Bassiouni Report when it comes to official statements for media consumption\\".\\"\\"الوفاق\\": الحكم على الشرطي الغانمي مصداق على عدم اعتراف الحكومة بتقرير بسيوني\\" (in Arabic).

The Industrial version of ID8279 was available for USD $30.70 in quantities of 100.Intel Corporation, \\"Microcomputer Component: New industrial grade product line answers the demand for high-reliability components to operate in industrial applications.\\", Intel Preview, March/April 1979, Pg. 11. Its important features are: * Simultaneous keyboard and display operations. * Scanned keyboard mode. * Scanned sensor mode. * 8-character keyboard FIFO. * Right or left entry 16-byte display RAM. * Programmable scan timing. * Used for Interaction between keyboard and different microprocessor. Keyboard section: * The keyboard section consists of eight return lines RL0 - RL7 that can be used to form the columns of a keyboard matrix. * It has two additional inputs : shift and control/strobe. The keys are automatically debounced. * The two operating modes of keyboard section are 2-key lockout and N-key rollover. * In the 2-key lockout mode, if two keys are pressed simultaneously, only the first key is recognized. * In the N-key rollover mode, simultaneous keys are recognized and their codes are stored in FIFO. * The keyboard section also has an 8 x 8 FIFO (First In First Out) RAM. * The FIFO can store eight key codes in the scan keyboard mode. The status of the shift key and control key are also stored along with key code. The 8279 generates an interrupt signal when there is an entry in FIFO. * In sensor matrix mode, the state (i.e., open/close status) of 64 switches is stored in FIFO RAM. If the state of any of the switches changes, then the 8279 asserts IRQ as high to interrupt the processor. Display section: * The display section has eight output lines divided into two groups A0-A3 and B0-B3. * The output lines can be used either as a single group of eight lines or as two groups of four lines, in conjunction with the scan lines for a multiplexed display. * The output lines are connected to the anodes through driver transistors in case of common cathode 7-segment LEDs. * The cathodes are connected to scan lines through driver transistors. * The display can be blanked by BD (low) line. * The display section consists of 16 x 8 display RAM. The CPU can read from or write into any location of the display RAM. Scan section: * The scan section has a scan counter and four scan lines, SL0 to SL3. * In decoded scan mode, the output of the scan lines will be similar to a 2-to-4 decoder. * In encoded scan mode, the output of scan lines will be binary count, and an external decoder should be used to convert the binary count to decoded output. * The scan lines are common for keyboard and display. * The scan lines are used to form the rows of a matrix keyboard and also connected to digit drivers of a multiplexed display, to turn ON/OFF. CPU interface section: * The CPU interface section takes care of data transfer between the 8279 and the processor. * This section has eight bidirectional data lines DB0 to DB7 for data transfer between 8279 and CPU. * It has a single address line to select the data buffer (A0=0) or the control register (A0=1)of the 8279. * The control signals WR (active low), RD (active low), CS (active low) and A0 are used for read/write to 8279. * It has an interrupt request line IRQ, for interrupt driven data transfer with processor. * The internal clock frequency of the 8279 is nominally 100 kHz. An internal prescaler divides an externally applied clock by an integer between 2 and 31 (both inclusive) to produce the internal clock. * The RESET signal sets the 8279 in 16-character display with two -key lockout keyboard modes. == Interfacing of 8279 with 8085 == In a microprocessor based system, when a keyboard and a 7-segment LED display are interfaced using ports or latches then the processor has to carry the following task. * Keyboard scanning * Key debouncing * Key code generation * Sending display code to LED * Display refreshing == Operating modes == The basic input modes of 8279 are * Scanned keyboard * Scanned sensor matrix * Strobed input * Display Modes The two basic output modes are * Left Entry (Typewriter type) * Right Entry (Calculator type) full datasheet link: http://www.futurlec.com/Datasheet/80Series/8279.pdf == References == Category:Intel chipsets Category:IBM PC compatibles Category:Input/output integrated circuits ","title":"Intel 8279"},{"id":"35883093","text":"Anna Christina Andersson (born January 28, 1982) is an ice hockey player from Sweden.

During his career, he designed 18 ships for the French Navy, and oversaw the construction of most of them. == Biography == Born to a family of naval engineers of renown, the son of François Coulomb the Elder, François Coulomb was appointed master-constructor in 1727. His first designs were for the 8-gun bomb vessels Tempête (launched 1726) and Foudroyante (1728). In 1727, he designed the frigate Zéphyr (1728), a light (demi-batterie) frigate of 28 guns. In 1730, he designed the 50-gun Diamant. In 1733, he completed the design of the 62-gun Borée. In 1737, he began the 74-gun Terrible (1739). Both ships were longer than their predecessors, each allowing an extra pair of guns on their lower decks. The year 1740 saw the design and commencement of the 80-gun Tonnant (launched 1743). In 1743, he designed the 28-gun frigate Diane (launched 1744). In 1745, he designed the 64-gun Triton, and the 74-gun Conquérant (1746), which was rebuilt in 1764 to the specifications of the Citoyen class. In 1748, he began work on the 80-gun Foudroyant and the 30-gun Pomone, and the next year, the 50-gun Hippopotame. He designed two more 74-gun ships - Redoutable and Téméraire - which were completed after his death. His last achievement, in 1751, was the design of the 80-gun ship of the line Océan. The plans were completed just before he died, and the ship was built by Joseph Chapelle and launched in 1756. ==References== * *Nomenclature des navires français de 1715 a 1774.

She is born in Paris in 1972 and currently lives in Marseille. She curated exhibitions in France and worldwide on the relationship between art, video and computer games and politics. She also promotes free and open source culture as well as indie games and art games. ==Background== A graduate of the Institute of Political Studies in Aix-en-Provence and a Postgraduate Diploma in Cultural Project Management of the Paris 8 University, Isabelle Arvers specializes in new media since 1993. She wrote her thesis in French on \\"Digital virtuality as a way to apprehend reality\\". To better understand new technologies and content of tomorrow, she first worked in the field of special effects and DVD production at EX MACHINA then at DUBOI. She then collaborated to the non profit organization Art 3000, which is now in charge of a multimedia cultural space Le Cube at Issy les Moulineaux. Thanks to this experience she discovered generative and interactive technologies as well as an international network of artists and professionals in the digital art field. She coordinates the International Symposium of Electronic Arts ISEA 2000 in Paris. ==Curating digital media== In 2000, she becomes Image content manager for the electronic shop Gizmoland.com, a lab for experimentations with sound, visual or digital artists and a gallery to show artworks in streaming (music, animation, digital art, games) with the following artists : Eric Maillet, Alain Declerc, Philippe Lejeune, Audiorom, David Nicolas, Laurent Hart, Jim Avignon In 2001, she curates for Gizmoland the Video Cuts 2001, Centre Pompidou. In 2002 she is the curator of Playtime the Gaming Room of Villette Numérique a gameart, retrogaming and gaming room and a net.art gallery on \\"sound games\\", 2002, Paris, and of Tour of the Web in 2003, Centre Pompidou, featuring French and international artists, as Vuk Cosic or Miltos Manetas. In 2005, she curates three Web plasticians sessions at the Pompidou center, about machinima, VJ-ing and 8 bit music. ==Retrogaming== Playtime is a retrogaming room and a game art exhibition curated by Isabelle Arvers in 2002 for the first edition of the Festival Villette Numérique. This is the first major event dedicated to games and old computer games in a French cultural structure. The idea behind Playtime—the gaming room is to contrast the low-tech aesthetics of the first gaming computers and consoles with high-tech broadcasting devices (screen- walls, interactive installations, giant broadcasting screens and online devices), to enable the public to appreciate the mind-boggling developments in graphics and the technology used in video and digital games over the last thirty years, while they are playing. Game heroes in retro gaming, is a show curated by Isabelle Arvers in 2011 in Marseille. This event deals with the history of video games through the heroes who have shaped the imagination of nearly 4 generations of players: Pacman Zelda Supemario, Donkey Kong, Sonic ... ==Chip tunes== In 2004, she organized a Game Boy music concert with Bubblyfish and Glomag and \\"High Score\\", a Game Boy music festival with the artists : Gameboyzzz Orchestra (PL), Bubblyfish and Glomag (US) and Teamtendo (FR). This event is featured in the movie \\"8 bit a documentary about art and video games\\", directed by Marcin Ramocki and Justin Strawhand that was premiered at MOMA in 2006. ==Game art vs Artgames== She curated the wireless art event Wifiledefrance for la Region Ile de France, where she invited the project Noderunners, a wifi game in the city. She was the net.art curator for the 2004 Banana RAM festival, Italy. She curated the exhibit Gametime, Experimedia, about games, music and cinema, Melbourne in October 2004 and la Nuit Numérique for the 2004 Bitfilms Festival, Hamburg, Germany, November 2004. Her last exhibition and events projects attempt to portray video games as a new language and as a means of expression for artists : No fun games and the gaming experience, Bergen Norway, 2005; Mal au Pixel, Paris, France, 2006; Articule 3, emerging Swiss creation, Annecy, France, 2007; Playing to real, Meudon, France, 2007, Gamerz 2008-2011, Aix-en-Provence, 2008 & 2009, Machinima screenings, Gameplay & Mostravideo Brasil, 2009, Game Heroes, Marseille 2011. She curates machinima programs for many institutions and festivals. ==WJ-s performances== She is also a WJs and plays live with online creation through the multiscreen environment WJ-S created in 2006 by Anne Roquigny. WJ-S is a software and a flexible public device for web performances allowing WJs (webjays, artists, curators, web addicts, web mutants) to play live with online text, sound and visuals. WJs take the control of a multiscreen environment and surf at distance in different browser windows simultaneously. WJ-S is a visible and collective experience of the surf. Since 2007 Isabelle Arvers has been giving Wj-s performances about the relationship between art and video games on the web, about Neen, an art movement that claims that \\"websites are the art of our day\\", showing websites of Angelo Plessas, Rafael Rozendaal, Andreas Angelidakis, Mai Ueda, or Nikola Tosic, and she also gives Wj-s performances about psychogeography a situationist concept, emotional mapping and data visualization. ==Workshops== Because she believes that machinima are a new artform and a new way of expression, she gives workshops to students and teenagers in Machinima, movies created with videogames and also workshops of WJ-S and how to use this software to create performances using the web as a giant hard disk. The purpose of these workshops is to show that mass media can be used as a tool for creation. She gives workshops of Pleade, an online archive publishing Open Source application developed by AJLSM. PLEADE helps institutions to put archival finding aids encoded in EAD (Encoded Archive Description) on the Web, by providing a set of tools to build dynamic Websites. ==Publications== She writes essays and articles about digital art, game art and machinima in magazines like Amusement, Digitalarti, MCD, or Multitudes. Her last essay \\"Cheats or Glitch? Voice as a game modification in Machinima\\" was published by the MIT Press in 2010. * \\"This Spartan Life, un machinima au congrès\\", Revue Multitudes, 2012 * \\"Penser l'eouvre d'art en dehors de l'économie traditionnelle\\", Archée, 2011 * \\"Cheats or glitch ?

It stars Vishal, Anjali and Varalaxmi Sarathkumar in the leading roles, while Santhanam and Nithin Sathya play other pivotal supporting roles. ==Cast== * Vishal as Raja * Anjali as Madhanadevi * Varalaxmi Sarathkumar as Gajarani * Santhanam as Nandagopal * Nithin Sathya * Sadagoppan Ramesh * Sonu Sood * Subbaraju * Rajendran * Manobala * Swaminathan * Kalabhavan Mani * Chitti Babu * Manivannan * Yuvina Parthavi * Vichu Vishwanath * Lollu Sabha Manohar * Gayathri Rao * Usha Elizabeth * K. S. Jayalaxmi * Arya in a special appearance * Sadha in a special appearance * Bhama as Hafra ==Production== Director Sundar C and Vishal announced that they would work together on a project in January 2012, and it was revealed that Vishal would portray a triple role in the film. After denying reports that the female lead role was first offered to Shruti Haasan, Sundar C hinted that they were set to sign on Hansika Motwani, but her busy schedule left her unavailable to commit dates for the project. Titled Madha Gaja Raja' after Vishal's three characters, Karthika Nair eventually joined the team to portray the role during April 2012.http://www.sify.com/movies/karthika-is-vishal-s- heroine-news-tamil-meqkUFedahbsi.html The film subsequently began production in Chennai during early May 2012, with a song shot featuring Vishal and Santhanam alongside Sadha, who was revealed to be making a guest appearance in an item number. Sundar C then chose to shoot some further scenes with Sadha and make her appearance last longer than just for a song sequence.http://www.sify.com/movies/sada-to-sizzle-with-vishal-news-tamil- mfdpAWfcjhbsi.htmlhttp://www.sify.com/movies/vishal-starts-mgr-with-sundar-c- news-tamil-mfeoF8biigisi.html However soon after production began, Sundar C chose to alter the script, with the new version having Vishal portray only a single character, with two leading actresses instead of one. Disappointed with this development, Karthika Nair left the project stating that the role of the lead actress had been significantly diminished as result of the change of story.http://www.sify.com/movies/karthika-opts-out-of-mgr-news-kollywood- mf3kdMjfjjisi.html Taapsee Pannu signed on to replace Karthika, but soon afterwards left the project citing date clashes with her commitments for the promotional activity of her Hindi film. Varalaxmi Sarathkumar was consequently drafted in after working producers Gemini Film Circuit during their previous venture Podaa Podi (2012), while Anjali was selected for the main leading female role. Gayatri Rao joined the film's cast to portray Santhanam's love interest, while actors Nithin Sathya and Sadagoppan Ramesh were selected to portray Vishal's friends in the film. The team subsequently began another schedule with the new storyline in Palani during June 2012.http://www.sify.com/movies/varalakshmi-replaces-taapsee-in-mgr-news- tamil-mg0tVJdbjjasi.html The team moved to Jaipur during August 2012 to complete another schedule, while Vishal revealed that the title now referred to the agitated state of Lord Ganesha rather than the names of his characters, stating that \\"Gaja Raja\\" could be literally translated as fury. During the particular schedule, Vishal suffered an injury when filming a fight scene and was forced to take a week's break from working. The film's shoot moved to Hyderabad during September 2012, with Arya joining the team's cast to shoot for a guest appearance. Arya had flown in from Chennai and completed his work on the film within a single day. The team planned to shoot a song sequence in China, but eventually flew to Australia to record the sequences. By October 2012, it was revealed that the film was complete and Sundar C was putting \\"finishing touches\\" to the project. ==Soundtrack== The music of the film was composed by Vijay Antony collaborating with Vishal for second time after Vedi and with Sundar C for first time. Vishal has sung a song named \\"My Dear Loveru\\", which was released as a promotional track in December 2012. ==ReleaseDelays=== Promotional campaigns started for the film in November 2012, with an initial release date of 14 January 2013 announced by the producers, Gemini Film Circuit. However, Vishal's other film Samar (2013) had been long-delayed and also wanted to release on the same date, and the actor tried to ensure both films did not clash. As a result, Madha Gaja Raja was briefly put on hold until the release of Samar.http://www.sify.com/movies/vishal-v-s-vishal-upsets-the-trade-news- tamil-mluk5hgijcbsi.html The makers then suggested that the film would release on 26 January 2013, but Samar's success meant that they sought to avoid releasing the film, while Samar was still running in theatres. The failure of Mani Ratnam's Kadal (2013) affected Gemini Film Circuit's finances after the venture became an unexpected failure, and distributors of Kadal wanted compensation before Madha Gaja Raja was released. After nine months of little information about the project, the producers announced their intentions of releasing the film on 9 September 2013 to coincide with the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi.http://www.sify.com/movies/long-delayed-madha-gaja-raja-to-release- on-ganesh-chaturthi-news-national-nihm4lfcbjfsi.html However the plans were put on hold after an Australian national, Santhanam, successfully appealed for a court injunction to stop the film's release in September 2013. He claimed that Gemini Film Circuit had agreed to pay him a sum of six million rupees for his services of providing production facilities during the team's schedule in Australia, but had failed to make the payment. Under financial restraints, Gemini Film Circuits had also sold on the film to Vishal's newly launched production studio, Vishal Film Factory, but failed to inform Vishal of the outstanding payment which had to be made to Santhanam. The High Court subsequently had put a stay order on the release of the film until the issue was sorted. Vishal then took up the responsibility in trying to release the film, and helped get it censored, but was unsuccessful in getting the film released. Vishal later disassociated from the film and Gemini Film Circuit acquired the film again from the actor, and revealed that they would release the film in due course. The makers continued to announce more potential release dates throughout 2014, none of which materialised. Distributor P. T. Selvakumar contemplated purchasing the film's distributing rights and planned to release the film on 7 March 2014 but the idea was dropped. Similarly Vishal made further efforts to try and release the film after the success of his own productions, but failed in his attempts. Sundar C and Vishal subsequently moved on to finish and release another film together during the period of delay, Aambala (2015). After further months of deadlock, in October 2015, it was announced that Sri Obuleshwara Productions had secured the distribution rights for the Telugu dubbed version of the film. Subsequently, in November 2015, Vishal pledged that he would take action to release the film by December 2015. The plans to release on 29 April 2016 also failed and the film still remains unreleased.https://twitter.com/VishalKOfficial/status/720769500539437056 ==References * Category:Unreleased Tamil-language films Category:Indian films Category:Tamil-language films Category:Masala films Category:Films directed by Sundar C.

Her mother does not approve of this, as she wants Sonia to marry the Caucasian male of her choice, and will not permit any interference from her in-laws, who are asked to leave her house. In the meantime Amar's passport and money are stolen.

An informal pool had been created by Judge Rocco Chinnici in the early 1980s following the example of anti-terrorism judges in Northern Italy in the 1970s.Jamieson, The Antimafia, p. 29 Most important, they assumed collective responsibility for carrying Mafia prosecutions forward: all the members of the pool signed prosecutorial orders to avoid exposing any one of them to particular risk, such as the one that had cost Judge Gaetano Costa his life. Costa had signed the indictments of 55 against the Mafia heroin-trafficking network of the Spatola-Inzerillo-Gambino clan after virtually all of the other prosecutors in his office had declined to do so – a fact that leaked out of the office and eventually cost him his life. He was murdered on 6 August 1980, on the orders of Salvatore Inzerillo.Giovanni Falcone, Paolo Borsellino and the Procura of Palermo , Peter Schneider & Jane Schneider, May 2002, essay is based on excerpts from Chapter Six of Jane Schneider and Peter Schneider, Reversible Destiny: Mafia, Antimafia, and the Struggle for Palermo, Berkeley: University of California Press In July 1983, Rocco Chinnici was killed by the Mafia. His place as head of the ‘Office of Instruction’ (Ufficio istruzione), the investigative branch of the Prosecution Office of Palermo, was taken by Antonino Caponnetto, who formalized the pool. Next to Giovanni Falcone, the group included Paolo Borsellino, Giuseppe Di Lello and Leonardo Guarnotta.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, pp. 85-90 The group subsequently pooled together several investigations into the Mafia, which would result in the Maxi Trial against the Mafia starting in February 1986 and which lasted until December 1987. The trial was held in a bunker-courthouse specially constructed for this purpose inside the walls of the Ucciardone prison in Palermo. A total of 475 mafiosi were indicted for a multitude of crimes relating to Mafia activities, based primarily on testimonies given as evidence from former Mafia bosses turned informants, known as pentiti, in particular Tommaso Buscetta and Salvatore Contorno. Most were convicted and, to the surprise of many, the convictions were upheld several years later in January 1992, after the final stage of appeal. The importance of the trial was that the existence of Cosa Nostra was finally judicially confirmed. ==ReferencesBibliography== *Jamieson, Alison (2000).

It premiered on September 30, 2012 and concluded on May 12, 2013. The season's plot follows the introduction of magic by Rumplestiltskin/Mr. Gold into Storybrooke, leaving the fate of both the real world and the Fairytale Land that was intertwined, resulting in new threats emerging. Furthermore, Rumplestiltskin locates his son, only to find he is Henry Mills' father, and outsiders Greg Mendell and a woman named Tamara arrive in Storybrooke with the intention to remove magic and the town. They eventually fail to destroy Storybrooke, though they kidnap Henry and take him to Neverland to the unknown Peter Pan, leading the main characters to follow them to retrieve him, setting the premise for the third season. New characters introduced in the season include Baelfire (the son of Rumplestiltskin) under his new alias Neal Cassidy - who is also the father of Henry Mills - Captain Killian \\"Hook\\" Jones, Princess Aurora, Mulan, Prince Phillip, Robin Hood, and the Darling Family. The season premiere was watched by 11.36 million viewers, achieving an adult 18-49 rating/share of 3.9/10.0. These numbers sunk to a low of 7.08 million viewers in February 2013, but remained stable above 7 million throughout the remainder of the season with a season finale viewership of 7.33 million and a 2.3/7 adult 18–49 rating/share. ==Premise== With the curse broken, the residents of Storybrooke struggle between their original and cursed memories, and are left wondering of the fate of their land. After Emma and Mary Margaret survive the trip back to the Enchanted Forest by accident, they find that part of the realm was spared from the curse which kept the remaining inhabitants frozen during the twenty-eight years. Among them are the cunning Cora and the ruthless Captain Hook, who follow Emma and Mary Margaret to Storybrooke to get even with Regina and Rumplestiltskin. People outside of Storybrooke are also allowed in, including Greg Mendell and Tamara, who both have a secretive past involving magic which leads to Henry's captivity in Neverland. ==Cast and charactersRegular=== * Ginnifer Goodwin as Snow White / Mary Margaret Blanchard * Jennifer Morrison as Emma Swan * Lana Parrilla as Evil Queen / Regina Mills * Josh Dallas as Prince Charming / David Nolan * Emilie de Ravin as Belle / Lacey * Jared S.

Co-creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis spoke about the repercussions of the first season finale's events, stating, \\"Magic as we know always comes with a price and we are introducing it to a world where it has never been before and I think that’s going to have unpredictable results. It’s going to affect everybody this season because that’s what’s more fun.\\" said Kitsis. On everyone in Storybrooke's memories returning Horowitz commented, \\"One of the things that’s interesting to us to explore is this notion that just because the memories have returned does not mean that the past 28 years did not happen. Those memories, the Davids, the Mary Margarets, the Mr. Golds, all those people, who they were existed and what they did actually happened and those are the things that will have to be dealt with.\\" The show still bounced back-and-forth between the fairy-tale world and Storybrooke, although there were slight differences compared to season one. It was hinted that another form of narrative was introduced during the season. ===Casting=== In June 2012, it was reported that season one recurring actresses Meghan Ory (Red Riding Hood/Ruby) and Emilie de Ravin (Belle/Lacey) had both been promoted to series regulars for the second season. In July 2012, it was announced that Pretty Little Liars star Julian Morris would be guest starring as Prince Phillip, an altruistic hero and adept warrior, while Teen Wolf actor Sinqua Walls was cast as Sir Lancelot, a former member of the round table. In the same month, it was announced that The Tudors star Sarah Bolger and The Hangover Part II actress Jamie Chung had joined the recurring cast as Princess Aurora (Sleeping Beauty) and Chinese warrior Mulan. On August 3, 2012, The Rite actor Colin O'Donoghue booked the recurring role of Captain Killian \\"Hook\\" Jones, the prime antagonist of J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan. O'Donoghue joined the main cast during the second half of the season. The same day, it was reported that True Blood's Michael Raymond-James had joined the season's recurring cast in an unknown role, described only as \\"mysterious\\". This was later revealed to be Neal Cassidy (Rumplestiltskin's son Baelfire, Emma Swan's ex-boyfriend and Henry Mills' father). Lost alum Jorge Garcia recurs as Anton the Giant, referenced from Jack and the Beanstalk. Garcia was originally scheduled to appear in only one episode, but his character was later expanded. Actor Raphael Sbarge, who portrays Jiminy Cricket, was made part of the recurring guest cast this season, as opposed to being included in the first season's main cast. The L Word actress Rachel Shelley played the recurring role of Milah, Rumplestiltskin's wife. Eureka actor Christopher Gauthier is recurring throughout the season as Mr. William Smee, Captain Hook's right- hand-man. In October 2012, Can't Hardly Wait star Ethan Embry joined the recurring cast as an unknown visitor to Storybrooke. Eion Bailey (Pinocchio/August Booth) made guest appearances in episodes six and 18. Tony Perez (Prince Henry) and Alan Dale (King George/Albert Spencer) both made recurring appearances in some capacity throughout the season. Actor Noah Bean reprised his role as Daniel, the Evil Queen's love-interest, during episode five, \\"The Doctor\\". The X-Files actress Annabeth Gish guest starred as Anita, the leader of a pack of werewolves, in Child of the Moon. The Christmas Card actor Chad Michael Collins and 24 veteran Gregory Itzin appeared in In the Name of the Brother as Gerhardt/Frankenstein's Monster, Dr. Frankenstein's younger brother and as Alphonse, the boys' father, respectively. Scream and Charmed actress Rose McGowan portrayed a young Cora in The Miller's Daughter. Lesley Nicol, of Downton Abbey fame, was cast as Johanna in The Queen is Dead which also featured Heroes vet Rena Sofer as Queen Eva, Snow White's mother. It was implicated that the role has the potential to become recurring. Caprica actor John Pyper-Ferguson guest starred in Welcome to Storybrooke as Kurt Flynn, a widower who longs to aid his son after experiencing the loss of his mother. Season one co-star Jamie Dornan also reprised his role as Sheriff Graham Humbert in the episode. Since the first season, Kings actor Sebastian Stan had portrayed Jefferson/The Mad Hatter in a recurring role; he has since departed from the show with obligations to the Broadway play Picnic and the feature film Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It was reported that ABC was set to recast the role with the potential for a possible spin-off based on the character. However, Stan's recasting was repudiated by series co-creator Adam Horowitz, saying that Stan \\"is a very busy man, I don't know when he will be making his way back toward us\\". He later confirmed that Stan would definitely not be re-appearing in 2013. ===Filming=== Principal photography for the season began in Vancouver, British Columbia on July 16, 2012 and completed on April 5, 2013. The town of Steveston doubles as Storybrooke for the series. ==RatingsSoundtrackHome video releasesReferences* Category:2012 American television seasons Category:2013 American television seasons Season 2 ","title":"Once Upon a Time (season 2)"},{"id":"35883319","text":"Frances Sarnat Hugle (August 13, 1927 – May 24, 1968) was an American scientist, engineer, and inventor who contributed to the understanding of semiconductors, integrated circuitry, and the unique electrical principles of microscopic materials. She also invented techniques, processes, and equipment for practical (high volume) fabrication of microscopic circuitry, integrated circuits, and microprocessors which are still in use today. In 1962, Hugle co- founded Siliconix, one of Silicon Valley's first semiconductor houses. She is the only woman included in the \\"Semiconductor Family Tree.\\" ==Early life and education== Frances Betty Sarnat (Sarnatzky) was born on August 13, 1927, in Chicago, Illinois, to Nathan Sarnat (Sarnatzky) and Lylian Steinfeld. Sarnat attended Hyde Park High School on Chicago's south side, where she participated in many of the school's science clubs, including the chemistry, physics and biology clubs. In the spring of 1944, just before her graduation, she was selected to represent Hyde Park High in Chicago's Math Contest, in which she took first place. After graduation, Sarnat attended the University of Chicago. In 1946, at the age of eighteen, she was awarded a Bachelor of Philosophy.About Alumni - Alumni Deaths; University of Chicago Magazine, Volume 96, Number 3; February 2004. It was while studying here that she married fellow student, William B. Hugle, in 1947.\\"William Bell Hugle - inventor\\"; Hendricks, Tyche; SF Gate; October 17, 2003 obituary article; retrieved 11/04/2012. They founded several R&D; companies together. In 1957, the University of Chicago additionally awarded her a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry based upon the course work she had completed between 1944 and 1947. Hugle's graduate studies in crystallography, including studies in x-ray diffraction techniques, took place at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY. In 1960, she received a Master of Science degree from the University of Cincinnati. Hugle also received an honorary doctorate from a Canadian university. In the mid-1960s, she taught at Santa Clara University. ==Professional career== Hugle founded her first research company, Hyco Labs, in the mid-1940s and assumed the title of Director of Research. At Hyco Labs, she began the research and development of materials, processes and specialized equipment that would become the foundation of much of her future work. After marrying, the Hugles founded Stuart Laboratories, Inc.Levine, Bernard; Guinther, Fred; February 24, 1997; The Package, \\"Electronic News;\\" 43:2156; p. 36.

In March 1951, she went to work for Standard Electronics Research Corp., where she was cleared for \\"secret\\" work. She remained at Standard Electronics Research Corp until August 1952, and shortly thereafter obtained employment at the Baldwin Piano Company, which was looking to use transistors in their electronic organs and may have been interested in \\"military and industrial electronics\\".Rostky, George; October 30, 1997; A Radio and Silicon, \\"Electronic Engineering Times;\\" Issue 978; pp. 113–120.Hoffler, Don C.; January 18, 1971; Silicon Valley U.S.A., Part II; \\"Electronic News.\\" In 1959, both Hugle and her husband began work at Westinghouse Company in Pittsburgh. In 1960, at the request of Westinghouse, the Hugles moved to southern California to set up an astro- electronics laboratory. In late 1961, the Hugles moved again, to the Laurelwood Subdivision in Santa Clara, in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the Hugles co-founded Siliconix in 1962. She developed Siliconix's first products and became its first Director of Research and Chief Engineer.Carey, Pete; October 16, 2003; Silicon Valley Pioneer, Siliconix Founder, Dies at 76, \\"Mercury News;\\" p 1C. After leaving Siliconix in 1964, Hugle developed products for two more semiconductor companies that she co-founded with her husband. These were Stewart Warner Microcircuits, where she once again served as Director of Research and as Chief Engineer, and Hugle Industries. ==Inventions and patents== Hugle was awarded at least seventeen patents, some posthumously. Amongst these, she has been credited with the invention of tape automated bonding (TAB) (a technology first put into commercial use by General Electric); and Hugle was the first person to patent flex-based packaging.Gilleo, Ken; August 2005; Flex, Chips and RFID: Synergy in Minneapolis; \\"CircuiTree;\\" 18:8; pp 48, 50.

Another guest, doctor Mitu Khurana from Delhi was asked by her orthopaedic surgeon husband and in-laws to abort her girl twins 20 weeks after conceiving. Her story helped dispel the perception and myth among people that the abhorrent practice of female foeticide is practised only by rural people or those living in small towns or is confined only to lesser educated people. The show claimed that according to 2011 Census, the rate at which the unborn female child is killed amounts to killing off girls a year and there were 914 girls for every 1,000 boys. The episode concluded with a song \\"O Ri Chiraiya\\" sung by Swanand Kirkire along with Ram Sampath. ===Impact=== On the next day after the episode went on air, Rajasthan Chief Minister, Ashok Gehlot urged the public representatives and other non- governmental organisations to take actions to stop the illegal practice of female foeticide. An official reported that Gehlot also reviewed existing efforts taken by the government against the issue. He also directed the officials to prepare a plan for a special campaign against female foeticide. Khan, as promised on the show, met Gehlot over the issue of female foeticide. Gehlot accepted the request to set up fast track court to deal the case of the sting operation featured on the show, which was conducted in 2005 by Meena Sharma and Shripal Shaktawat. After discussion with Gehlot, Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High Court Arun Kumar Mishra given permission to set up the fast track court. The sting operation had revealed the faces of more than 140 doctors involved in the illegal practices of sex determination test and abortion. But no one had been punished in the case even after seven years. On 10 May 2012, The Rajasthan Government suspended the licenses of six sonography centres and issued notices to 24 others for violating the provisions of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal and Diagnostic (PCPNDT) Act, 1994. However, the health minister of Rajasthan, Rajkumar Sharma, criticised the show for \\"sensationalising female foeticide cases\\". He argued that the government had already been taking action against female foetecide, and did not perform a knee-jerk reaction following the show. The first episode of the show also influenced several state governments in India. Maharashtra Health Minister, Suresh Shetty asked for Khan's support for the government's campaign against female foeticide. In a letter written to Khan, Shetty mentioned that the Maharashtra government had registered cases against 317 sonography centres in the state conducting unauthorised sex determination tests. Also 27 doctors and four families who sought sex determination tests have been punished under the PCPNDT Act. However, Bollywood actor couple Ajay Devgn and Kajol became associated with the government's campaign against female foeticide. Haryana government made it compulsory to submit identification proof of the pregnant woman at ultrasonography centres as a pre-condition for undergoing the prenatal sex discernment test. Haryana government also announced a reward of to those who give information about doctors conducting sex determination tests in the state. The Government of Madhya Pradesh had suspended licence of 65 Medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) centres in the state. ==Episode 2: Break the Silence== Air Date: 13 May 2012 The second episode focused on child sexual abuse in India. For the episode, Khan had worked with NGOs working with children abused sexually. It showcased two cases of people – Cindrella Prakash and Harish Iyer – who have had gone through bad experiences. Cindrella was molested in her childhood by an elderly person close to her family while her parents were not in the house. Harish was sexually abused and raped for several years by a similar person close to his family until one day he fought back at the age of 18. The show also focused on how the victims hesitate to tell their parents about their suffering due to fear and shame. It went on to explain on how at times, even after informing their parents, they are unable to take necessary actions due to disbelief or fears of being ridiculed by society. The chief guest was Sridevi, who applauded Harish's courage and determination and handed him a present for appreciation. She signed Khan's letter to the Parliament of India lending his support to the Parliament for strong child sexual abuse laws in India. The episode included a workshop for children to create awareness about the subject amongst children and their parents. The children were told that there are three \\"danger zones\\" (private parts) on everyone's body. These include the chest, area between the legs and the bottom. The children were advised to shout and run to a safe place, and immediately inform a person whom they trust (preferably parents) in case any unwanted person tries to touch them in these areas. ===Impact=== Following the broadcast of the second episode, the helpline for children received an increased number of calls from all over the country, reporting child abuse (sexual abuse of children and other forms of abuse). On 22 May 2012, the legislation to protect children below 18 years from sexual abuse became a reality with the Lok Sabha passing the bill which was earlier cleared by the Rajya Sabha. Child rights activists have called the bill regressive, however, and teens across the country are generally appalled that according to the bill the minimum age for sexual consent was increased from 16 to 18. ==Episode 3: Marriage or Marketplace== Air Date:- 20 May 2012 The third episode focused on the Dowry system in India. Khan spoke with several women who had faced dowry harassment by their in-laws before and after marriage. It showcased the story of Komal Sethi from New Delhi who was married to a software professional. Though her in-laws showcased a loving nature in the beginning of the arranged marriage talks, as the date of the wedding neared, they demanded furniture, cars, jewellery, home appliances and cash from her family. These kind of demands continued after the wedding. After her husband got a job opportunity in the USA she was forced to ask for money from her parents so that her husband could buy the travel tickets to USA and a car there. Once in the US, her husband tortured her (by not respecting her, by not letting her to eat enough and strangulating her repeatedly) to get money for furniture and cars in the US, although they had already been given so in India and her husband was earning $65,000 per year. Apart from these, he also pressurised her to get the legal rights to her house in India. Upon her consistent refusal, he left her without food and water, confining her in their apartment for four days before she was rescued by a women's care helpline. Her parents commented at the end of Komal's story that they should have refused the initial demands and broken off the arrangement rather than suffering later and ultimately breaking the marriage. The second showcased story on the show was of Nishana, who was then pursuing PhD from American College, Madurai. A big family from the city had approached her family for their girl's hand in marriage. After the marriage, her in-laws demanded a car, although her family had given a considerable amount of gold and cash in dowry. Even after agreeing to their demand of car, and some whimsical demands of a forced plastic surgery for Nishana, the caustic comments did not stop. When she could not take it any more, Nishana committed suicide. The second guest on the show was Paramjeet Kaur Moom, from Karimpur, Punjab. Her marriage also, was an arranged marriage. After marriage, her husband demanded money to go abroad for studies from her. Despite having financial difficulties at the time, her family took a loan of ₹ and provided for him. After being abandoned in India just after a week of their marriage, although he had earlier promised to take her abroad with him, her in-laws started abusing her physically and verbally and demanding more money. After 3 years of marriage in 2012, despite her father having provided in excess of ₹, she was forced out of her home. At the time of airing, she was being forced to give divorce. In the show, Parneet Singh, Regional Passport Officer of Jalandhar, Punjab was also present and voiced a way for taking action against the husband. The story of Paramjeet was shown to be part of a more generic problem in Punjab of NRI marriages. Apart from these, the episode showcased several stories from both, urban and rural areas, where the women had to face similar abuse and demands, some of which had ended with divorce or lawsuits which are still pending judgement. The show also highlighted that many people from lower income brackets take loans from the bank for their daughters' marriage expenses. To curb these type of incidents, representatives of some communities present in the audience outlined some steps taken by them. Their main point was to avoid too much fanfare, typical of Indian marriages, so that there is no pressure on the poor to arrange weddings like the rich did. The episode also showcased the story of Rani Tripathi from Mumbai who fought back by recording the dowry demands by the groom's parents with a hidden camera. Once she informed the media about the tape it was showcased in major TV channels across India. Her efforts and courage was appreciated by Khan. The show was concluded by audience opinions and the episode song Rupaiyya composed by Ram Sampath and performed by Sona Mohapatra. ==Episode 4: Every Life is Precious== Air Date:- 27 May 2012 The fourth episode of the show threw light on the frail health care system prevalent in the country. The show started with the story of VS Venkatesh who went through four surgeries to cure an infection in his leg. He later learnt that the entire process that had cost him was unnecessary and the infection could have been treated with medicines. Next, Arvind Kumar from Hyderabad shared that he was hospitalised in an ICU for three days and later advised a surgery when all he needed was a dose of ORS. The episode showcased the tragic tale of Major Pankaj Rai's wife Seema who was suffering from a kidney ailment and lost her life when the doctors forcibly operated on her for kidney and pancreas transplant without her family's consent. While the surgery cost Rai and the loss of his wife, the doctors were not bothered to inform the family about her demise and switched off their mobile phones. Dr Anil Pichad from Mumbai who owns a pathology lab revealed that he used to overcharge patients for tests as he had to pay commission to the doctors. But after he went through a personal tragedy, he stopped bribing the doctors and charges only nominal fees. Several women from Kowdipally village in Andhra Pradesh were forced to undergo operations to get their uterus removed. The farmers sold their lands or took loans to meet the high costs of these operations which were not needed at all. The show also shed light on a number of other such medical cases where patients suffering from minor ailments were recommended to undergo surgeries on the pretext of extracting more money from them. Khan spoke to Dr KK Talwar, Chairman, Board of Governors, Medical Council of India (MCI), a statutory body regulating medical colleges, affiliation, new colleges, and doctors' registration, to understand their actions to tackle such frauds. Dr Talwar committed Khan and the people of the country to take actions against such corrupt doctors. Khan read out the statistics of the percentage of doctors in England whose licenses were permanently cancelled in the past 3 years, and according to the RTI filed by Khan and his team, not even a single doctor's licence has been cancelled in the recent past in the country, thus letting the corrupt doctors off scot free. Khan also spoke to retired Major General Som Jhingon, ex-chairman, MCI, who had resigned from his post as he was completely disillusioned by the way the organisation was functioning. Khan, with the help of Dr. Shamit Sharma from Rajasthan, enlightened viewers by informing them about generic medicines that are available at affordable cost and are in no way inferior to the branded medicines produced by celebrated pharmaceutical companies. The show also spoke about Dr. Devi Prasad Shetty and his noble scheme that allows poor people to get medical treatment at affordable rates. Veteran Dr. Gulati also urged the government to prioritise health schemes so that even the poor could lead a healthy life. The show ended up with a song \\"Naav\\" composed and sung by Ram Sampath, with lyrics written by Suresh Bhatia. ===Aftermath=== Highly upset with Aamir on the issues raised in the episode 4, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has demanded an apology from Aamir Khan and warned him of legal action if he did not do so. However Aamir declined to apologise ़ The Rajya Sabha Parliamentary standing committee on Commerce has invited Aamir Khan, who exposed malpractice in the medical sector on his \\"Satyamev Jayate\\" TV programme, for an interaction on the issue along with his team to share knowledge they gained while researching the episode and to give his views on FDI in the pharmaceutical sector. On 21 June 2012, Khan appeared before the Parliamentary panel examining FDI in the pharmaceuticals sector and pitched for generic medicines, saying companies will continue to make profit if they sell cheap drugs to the poor. The Government of Karnataka has announced the opening of 'Janatha Bazaar Generic Drug Store', a chain of medical stores, so as to sell generic drugs at subsidised rates, almost 50% less than the MRP. According to the sources, the stores will sell both generic and branded medicines authorised by the US Food and Drug Administration, surgical equipment and orthopaedic implants at 50 per cent of MRP. The government has also plans to make it mandatory for all government doctors to prescribe only generic drugs. Previously, the Government of Maharashtra had also announced plans to take steps to make generic medicines available in all government hospitals of the state and to set up government-aided medical stores across the state. The Government of Chhattisgarh has cracked down on nine private doctors and suspended their registration for allegedly advising and removing of uterus and both ovaries without any convincing medical reasons. ===Controversy=== The nephrologist involved in the court case about the death of Seema Rai (which was referred to as a case of medical negligence by Major Pankaj Rai in the episode), Dr. Rajanna Sreedhara, stated that his legal counsel and Fortis Hospital, where he worked, were preparing to send a legal notice to Khan and the show producers for libel. He accused Khan of failing to do a proper research, and retired Army Major Pankaj Rai of falsely accusing him of causing his wife's death through medical negligence. Sreedhara appealed on IBN Live and social networking forums for a chance to tell his side of the story. He claimed that Rai was harassing him for the past two years for a crime he had not committed, and that the show had ruined his reputation as a respected physician. On reading Sreedhara's transcript defending himself, Rai wrote an open letter to IBNLive, and provided several supporting medical and legal documents. He stated that the doctor had not presented the facts correctly, and that he was \\"fighting a lone legal battle with limited resources against a mighty corporation.\\" ==Episode 5: Intolerance to Love== Air Date:- 3 June 2012 The fifth episode focused on unacceptability of love marriage in Indian culture, and also threw the limelight on honour killing in the country. The show showcased some real life examples where a couple married against their families' wishes and had to leave their loved ones and of honour killing. The first case saw a couple; Lokendra and Fehmida from Uttar Pradesh, who have been struggling to save their life from the latter's family despite a protection order from court, which is proving them helpless. The next case was of 27-year-old from Kolkata; Rizwanur Rahman, who lost his life in an attempt to marry a Hindu girl Priyanka Todi, daughter of industrialist Ashok Todi. The episode then showcased the story of Manoj-Babli honour killing case from Haryana, both of whom were killed for having a love marriage. Manoj's mother and sister have been, often being threatened number of times to withdraw the complaint. Aamir then had an interaction with Khap Panchayat, a religious caste-based council having no judicial powers. The panchayat claimed Manoj and Bablis marriage to be immoral, however added that they didn't deserve to be killed. Sanjay Sachdev, Chairman of Love Commandos from New Delhi was invited for the episode as a guest. His committee helps believes in the motto, \\"Love shall conquer the world\\", and thus helps couples by giving them basic necessities and legal help. The last story was of Alka and Uday, both doctors by profession. Alka's parents refrained themselves for a long time from accepting their daughter's marriage due to the fear of social stigma. Her parents realised that their daughter's happiness weighed more than social stigma and accepted the marriage. The show ended up with a song \\"Ghar Yaad Aata Hai Mujhe\\" sung by Sona Mohapatra and Ram Sampath. ===Aftermath=== Haryana's khap panchayats, known for their bizarre diktats, have now demanded that Aamir Khan's popular TV show, Satyamev Jayate, be pulled off air. Aamir drew the ire of the kangaroo courts after he accused them of triggering honour killings. ==Episode 6: Persons with disabilities== Air Date:- 10 June 2012 The sixth episode focused on the social problems faced by those with disabilities. In the show, Aamir highlighted the hardships faced by the disabled who even today continue to struggle for their basic rights. People with disabilities are no different from regular people when it comes to the zeal and appreciation for life. India has to decide whether it wants the crores of people with disabilities to stay at home, or to be a part of the mainstream and contribute to the economy. Circumstances led Dr Rajendra Johar to be confined to the bed, and he was declared disabled. But he has turned the very notion of disability on its head, and from his bed has helped countless people with disability to gain education, employment and self-respect. Dr Johar is the founder of the NGO Family of Disabled. Pratibha Chaturvedi is Shreya's mother – and her best friend. \\"She calls me 'dost',\\" giggles the cute little girl, who is affected by cerebral palsy but wants to lighten the burden on her mother's life. \\"Sometimes she gets so tired and I press her feet\\", says Shreya. Shreya Chaturvedi is 11 and exudes an enviable zest for life. Another person with disability is Sai Prasad, who demonstrates similar enthusiasm, and he has taken flight, literally. Software engineer Krishnakant Mane writes poetry in his spare time, and climbs real mountains as well as the virtual ones created by a disabled-unfriendly world. Another person with disability is Sai Prasad, who demonstrates similar enthusiasm, and he has taken flight, literally. Sai Prasad found the country's infrastructural disability to be more challenging than his own. He saw a world of difference in the facilities for the disabled in the United States compared to what there is in India. And the Song of the Show, Chanda, was performed by differently abled people. ==Episode 7: Danger at home== Air Date:- 17 June 2012 The seventh episode deals with the serious issue of domestic violence. This episode had a majority of male audience. The show started with Aamir Khan asking audience on their view about unsafe place for women. There were many views regarding this. All the views from audience pointed to a public place. Khan contradicted this by first showing his findings about the patients statistics in a hospital in Bandra, Mumbai. The show then proceeded with interview with some women affected by domestic violence. In this episode, Khan had promised Shanno, a cab driver who was a victim of domestic violence that he would hire her vehicle whenever he would visit Delhi next. When the actor arrived in the capital for two days (to present his research on medical malpractices in Parliament), he hired a cab from Sakha, the agency that Shanno works with. ==Episode 8: Poison on our Plate?== Air Date:- 24 June 2012 The show highlighted the adverse effect of pesticides on people's health and the environment. Examples of toxic chemicals entering the human food chain through spraying of chemicals by farmers were given. It also demonstrated new farming techniques which do not support spraying of any chemicals such as pesticides and fungicides. Organic farming techniques and success story of a farmer were also shown. The show was started with a brief on a small research that was carried out by a doctor on how dangerously high dose of chemicals found in pesticides are entering infants through breast feeding mothers. Then a small documentary was shown on how some villages in the Kasaragod District, state of Kerala, were affected by repeated unscientific spraying of pesticides using helicopter during a continuous period of 25 years, between 1976 and 2000. Then a doctor who served the same village described the plights of the people, on how they fought and ended this practice. He gave evidence that the mortality rate during pregnancy had decreased significantly as a result of not using pesticides. The show then discussed on alternatives to pesticides free farming. Aamir Khan talked to Sikkim's Chief Minister, Pawan Chamling, about Sikkim imposing a total ban on chemical pesticides and fungicides. Sikkim is the first state in India aiming to convert all its farms to use organic farming practices. Another example of organic farming reform in Andhra Pradesh was also highlighted. There was also counterpart view by an MD of a leading pesticide company, who said that the adverse use of pesticide is exaggerated. At the end of the show, Aamir Khan had general discussion with the audience on this topic. The show ended with Aamir Khan asking viewers to vote on their views on government encouraging organic farming. ==Episode 9: Think before you Drink== Air Date:- 1 July 2012 The show highlighted the issue of alcoholism in Indian society. The audience of the show were the group of people who were under 30 years. Most of them at some point of their life had been under the influence of alcohol. Some thought it to be a social necessity and some took it to celebrate some occasion. The show started with Aamir khan inviting a reputed news editor to the show. The guest is very successful in his professional career now but ten years back his condition was not the same. He narrated on how he lost his family life, social reputation, financial stability under the influence of alcohol. The show then proceeded with inviting a psychiatrist who explained on how alcohol effects the person's life. Other guest to the show were Javed Akhtar, who was also under the influence of alcoholism at one point in his life. He also narrated on how he never touched it for past 21 years. ==Episode 10: Dignity for All== Air Date:- 8 July 2012 The show discussed the social ills of casteism and untouchability. Aamir and the guests spoke about discrimination made in Indian society on the basis of caste, and the kind of treatment that is meted out to people belong to the Dalit community. Though untouchability is a criminal offence in India, and the state has, since independence, adopted affirmative action for the benefit of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, incidents of caste based discrimination are reported from across the country on an everyday basis. The first guest to speak on the topic was Dr Kaushal Panwar, a Sanskrit professor with Delhi University. Dr Panwar, who belongs to the Dalit community, faced caste based discrimination right from her childhood and continues to face prejudice even today. She talked about her early childhood and her first brush with casteism when she was asked to wear a different uniform to differentiate her based on her caste. The prejudice continued right through her childhood and did not stop even after she joined the elite Jawaharlal Nehru University. Even though Dr Panwar is now a professor in one of India's best universities, she is time and again made to feel inferior because of her caste. Despite facing enormous hardships, Dr Panwar was determined to challenge the existent social norms. It was her will and her father's constant encouragement that made her the person that she is now. The show then featured Balwant Singh, a Dalit and a former bureaucrat, who resigned from the Indian Administrative Service after facing regular humiliation, even from his subordinates. The discrimination is so deep-rooted that even elected members of parliament are rendered helpless. PL Punia, Chairperson of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, recollected how priests of the Kali temple in Orissa locked up the sanctum sanctorum when he tried opening up the temple gates for Dalits. The second guest on the show was documentary filmmaker Stalin K, who has produced a film titled 'India Untouched'. He cleared the misconception that casteism is not only prevalent among the Hindus, but is apparent among the Muslims, Christians and Sikhs too. Aamir showed a few clips from Stalin's documentary to show the prevalent practice of caste based discrimination across religious lines. Stalin advocated inter-caste marriages as a possible solution to end this ill, which runs deep in the Indian psyche. Next story to feature on the show was from Samarthpura village in Rajasthan, where a Dalit, Rampal Solanki, challenged the exclusive right of upper castes to ride a horse during wedding processions. Facing threats, Rampal approached the Station House Officer (SHO) of the nearest police station. The SHO, Manvendra Singh Chauhan, despite belonging to an upper caste himself, decided to uphold the law of the land. The wedding procession was provided police protection and a regressive social custom was eventually broken. The show then played host to Justice CS Dharmadhikari, a veteran freedom fighter and former judge. Born in a Brahmin family, Justice Dharmadhikari disassociated himself from the customary practices followed by his community, for which he suffered social exclusion from other members of his caste. He narrated an incident when his nephew's life got saved by a Dalit person's blood. He raised an important question to everyone – When the blood of a Brahmin and a Dalit is not different by virtue of their castes, why is the society hell bent on segregating people on the basis of their birth? Justice Dharmadhikari emphasised that the only way to stop caste-based discrimination is to refuse the existence of a caste system. He received a standing ovation from the audience. The last guest on the show was Bezwada Wilson, son of a manual scavenger who took upon himself to create awareness against this inhuman occupation and uplift people who were \\"traditionally\\" into the occupation. It was due to his, and his team's effort, that the Indian government eventually passed the 'Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1993'. The implementation of this act, however, has been unsatisfactory. Wilson accused the Indian Railways of employing manual scavengers to clean up railway tracks on platforms. The general consensus on the show was that casteism can only be eradicated if both the backward and the forward communities join hands together. The issue needs to be acknowledged and dealt with on an urgent basis. Real development of the nation can only take place if citizens treat each other equally and do not consider any person inferior on the basis of birth. The audience question of the episode was – \\"Do we wish to see an immediate end to the practice of manual scavenging, or cleaning of others' excreta by hand?\\" The charity proceeds from the episode will be given to 'Association for Rural and Urban Needy', a society working for the welfare of manual scavengers. The show ended with the song 'Kabir Vani', Kabir's poetry rendered into lyrics by Munna Dhiman, set to music by Ram Sampath and sung by Keerthi Sagathia. ===Reception=== The show did not generate as much interest as some of the earlier episodes. Part of it could be because the issue of casteism is not a topic unknown to most Indians. Some people alleged that the show generalised the entire Brahmin community of being casteist. Others felt the episode was long and the lack of intensity made for dull viewing. ==Episode 11: Sunset Years, Sunshine Life== This episode was telecast on 15 July 2012. The show discussed the conditions of senior citizens. Nonagenarian adventure sportsman N. K. Mahajan was amongst those interviewed on the show. ==See also== *Satyamev Jayate (TV series) *Satyamev Jayate (season 2) *Satyamev Jayate (season 3) ==References * Official site Category:2012 Indian television seasons Category:Satyamev Jayate ","title":"Satyamev Jayate (season 1)"},{"id":"35883551","text":"Chantel Dawn McGregor is a British blues rock guitarist and singer-songwriter. ==History== Chantel McGregor attended Leeds College of Music where she achieved a number of awards, including the Leeds College of Music Prize for Outstanding Musicianship.

One of its founders was Tony Flannery who, in April 2012, was disciplined by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for questioning whether Jesus Christ had instituted the priesthood. His brother Frank Flannery is a former General Secretary of the Fine Gael party. Its lay, sister organisation is the Association of Catholics in Ireland. ==Theology== The ACP says that it accepts the Creed and that it does not seek to overturn the defined teaching of the Catholic Church but these are questionable claims given its attempts to undermine settled Church teaching on issues like adultery and contraception.

During the latter referendum, the ACP spoke out against priests allowing 'No' campaigners to address congregations during Mass. ==Vocations== In June 2014, the issue of vocations was discussed at the Irish Catholic Bishops Conference in Maynooth. The ACP called for the Church to have a plan for vocations. Father Sean McDonagh says that the Church is \\"facing an implosion in terms of vocations to the priesthood.\\". In this regard, the ACP advocates the appointment of female deacons. According to McDonagh: > \\"It’s fairly clear historically that women have served in the Church, > despite every effort to silence their voices since the 4th century.\\" The ACP also called for men who left the priesthood to marry to be called back to ministry in some form. McDonagh claimed that if the ACP’s recommendations were not acted on, parish churches could be forced to close down. In October 2019, former President of Ireland Mary McAleese spoke at a conference organised by the Association of Catholic Priests, which was titled 'Women and the Church: Equality of Opportunity?'. ==Communion== The report of the Apostolic visitation to Ireland expressed some concerns about the communio (communion or unity) of the Church. The ACP claims \\"We cherish and we value and we wish to further the unity of all our people, with our fellow clergy, with Religious, with our bishops and with the Successor of Peter.\\" ==Censure== Members of the association have been censured by the Roman Curia. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) placed restrictions on the association's founder, Fr Tony Flannery who is a member of the Redemptorist Congregation. He was advised by Rome to go to a monastery where he might \\"pray and reflect\\" on his heterodox views and his role with the association. His monthly column in the congregation's monthly magazine, \\"Reality\\", has been discontinued. Restrictions have also been imposed on the magazine itself and its editor, Fr Gerard Moloney.Irish Times, Vatican moves to quell internal dissenting voices\\", 6 April 2012.

Since that time, it has emerged that three other priests have also been silenced: Marist priest Fr Seán Fagan, Capuchin priest Fr Owen O'Sullivan and Passionist priest Fr Brian D'Arcy. At a conference organised by the ACP in Dublin's Regency Hotel, Fr Brendan Hoban told the gathering \\"that clamping down on \\"wayward\\" opinions was not the way to deal with issues\\".\\"Silencing us won't solve Catholic Church's problems, say priests\\", Belfast Telegraph, 8 May 2012.

The meeting, was attended by about 200 people and resulted in the establishment of a new lay organisation for Irish Catholics with an interim title of the \\"Association of Catholics in Ireland\\". The new association committed itself to \\"the renewal of the Catholic faith in the changed and changing circumstances of the 21st century and to the reform of the institutional church which, at this time, is experiencing conflict, crisis and lack of credibility\\".Irish Times, \\"Lay organisation for Catholics to promote 'spirit of Vatican II'”, 28 July 2012. Retrieved 29 July 2012 In November 2012, at a meeting attended by over 300 people, the objectives of the Association of Catholics in Ireland were formally approved. ==Criticism== The Association of Catholic Priests has been criticised by conservative Catholics, with social and religious commentator David Quinn describing it as a \\"sub- section of priests who want the Catholic Church to adopt the failed project of liberal Protestantism.\\" Michael Kelly, editor of The Irish Catholic disputed the suggestion by the ACP that the ordination of married men and women would reverse the decline in vocations for the priesthood, citing the steep decline in membership and vocations in the Church of England and mainstream Protestant denominations in Northern Europe, all of which ordain married men and women. American Traditionalist Catholic news organisation Church Militant has referred to the ACP as a \\"group of dissident priests\\". ==ReferencesSee also== * We Are Church * Call To Action ==External links== * *Catholic Encyclopedia: Canon Law *Document establishing the 1983 Code of Canon Law * Home page of Sean O'Conaill * Association of US Catholic Priests Category:Catholic Church in Ireland Category:Volunteer cooperatives Category:Catholic organizations established in the 21st century Category:Catholic dissident organizations ","title":"Association of Catholic Priests"},{"id":"35883580","text":"This is a list of notable individuals born in Italy of Lebanese ancestry or people of Lebanese and Italian dual nationality who live or lived in Italy. ==Entertainment== *Bob Azzam, singer *Antonella Lualdi, actress ==Sciences== *Luca Turin, biophysicist ==Sports== *Bruno Carmeni, judoka ==Writers== *Gad Lerner, journalist ==See also== *Italian Lebanese *Italy–Lebanon relations *List of Lebanese people *List of Lebanese people (Diaspora) Italy Lebanese * Lebanese ","title":"List of Lebanese people in Italy"},{"id":"35883583","text":"Cyril Bernard Fordham (22 September 1906 – 22 April 1988) was an English cricketer.

Rih lake) is a natural lake located in northwestern Chin State in Myanmar. It lies at about 3 kilometers from Zokhawthar, the nearest village situated at an Indo-Burma border. It has a heart-shaped outline. It is about 1 mile in length, half-a-mile in width, about 3 miles in circumference and about 60 feet in depth. Rih Dil occupies an important status in the traditional religion and folktales of the Chin people including Zomi, Laimi, and Mizo. According to the ancestors of these tribals, the lake was a corridor to their heaven called Pialral. All souls destined to Pialral must pass through the lake. Due to its cultural importance is often referred to as \\"the largest lake in Mizoram is Rih Dil, which is but in Burma (Myanmar).\\" == History  Mythological account === The name of Rid Dil is said derived from a Mizo folktale of a girl named Rih-i. According to legend, Rih-i and her younger sister had a cruel stepmother, who persuaded their father to get rid of them. The father killed the younger sister in a forest. Upon finding her decapitated sister, Rih-i found was inconsolable. A good spirit known as Lasi found her and took pity on her. She revealed her a magical tree having a single leaf with which Rih-i revived her sister back to life. To quench the thirst of her younger sister, Rih-i turned herself into a small pool of water using the same leaf. Later, Rih-i was compelled to change herself into a white mithun, and wandered around in search of a safe place. Her urine formed rih-note (smaller lakes) wherever she went. It is believed that such lakes can still be found in the Vawmlu Range, Zur forest near the village Natchhawng, a place above Bochung village, and the area of Khawthlir village, all of which are in Myanmar. She wandered to Sanzawl village, followed the river Run. But the demon spirit of the river threatened to suck her dry. She migrated westward into Mizoram but found even the valley of Champhai unsuitable. A little further southeast she found the present location, and the lake became Rih Dil. === Traditional account === However, in another local version,Thang San Mung, “Sialkidul Li,” in Zolus Journal 17 (Yangon, Myanmar, 2013): 150-157. the lake was originally called “Sialkidul” in reference to its shape of the head of a mithun (little similar to gayal) when viewed from far mountain top. After two generations of human settlement in the region, the tradition says that many black-faced people (maivom in native language) invaded the surrounding land and called the lake “Sri,” which later became transliterated to “Rih” or “Li”. The Maivom people settled there for two consecutive harvest-times (two years). The then Guite chief Mangsum I of Ciimnuai ordered them to bring in annual taxes but they refused and started attack some Guite habitations at Geeltui and Losau instead.For more on this account, please, see Ngul L. Zam, B.A. Mualthum Kampau Guite Hausate Tangthu (History of Guite Chiefs the Sovereign of Three Mountain Regions) (Amazon/CreateSpace, United States, 2018), 44-46, . Therefore, the chief organized a warfare operation against the Maivom and drove them westward across the Tio. In commemoration of this event, local war songs are still in use in the region. Some of them are: ::Tuanglam tungah tangpa khau bang ciah’ng, khuhva na tong sia e, tuaklo dawn kawi aw e; khuhva tongsuah tang ka sinlai zen, lumsuang ka tuun kaal in, tungkhai mu’n tuah inla, awi kawi na’ng e. (Gendongh, c. AD 1300) ::(Translation): ::On my way back from the conquest, heard a dove hanged on the tree above, likely laughing at me; when angrily I picked up some stones to throw them to it, a hovering eagle suddenly snatched it away on my behalf. ::Kuansuk ta’ng e, Tiopi dung zui in, Tiopi ah sehtak ah Ciinmang umtui bang ka khuai hi e; namtem tawi in sulzui ta’ng, Tio ii gaal ah pasal lian lu khai ing e. (Vunghsan, c. AD 1300) ::(Translation): ::Through the stream of Tio, walked down along the bank but sadly lost my brave brother’s life on the sand; holding my sword firmly to avange for his life crossed the other side of Tio, and now on my way back home with honor of my captives. == Transportation == Rih Dil is difficult to access due to its remote location. In Myanmar, travelers may use a bus service from Yangon to Monywa in Sagaing Division, from there they can get a 33-seat mini- bus, which is more compatible with the tricky roads of Chin State. Visitors from India can enter from the Indo-Myanmar border gate through Champhai, from where it is 22 km. They pay gate-pass fees of Rs. 10 for a person and go directly to the Rih Lake by public buses. == References == Category:Lakes of Myanmar Category:Chin State ","title":"Rih Dil"},{"id":"35883703","text":"Kael-Florent Montout (born 21 November 1991) is a Guadeloupean footballer.

It originally aired on NBC on April 12, 2012. The teleplay of the episode was written by executive producer Howard Gordon and Evan Katz, from a story by series creator Kyle Killen; the episode was directed by Adam Davidson. \\"Ricky's Tacos\\" earned a Nielsen rating of 0.9, being watched by 2.68 million viewers in its initial broadcast. The episode has generally received positive reviews, with critics commenting on its storylines. The show centers on Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs), a detective living in two separate realities after a car accident. In one reality, in which he wears a red wristband, his wife Hannah Britten (Laura Allen) survived the accident, and in another reality, in which he wears a green wristband, his son Rex Britten (Dylan Minnette) survived. In this episode, Britten goes to Ricky's Tacos, where the voice at the drive-thru says that he cannot go to Portland, and \\"it all starts with the Westfield case\\". However, he fails to find anything unusual about the case. Later, Britten and Bird (Steve Harris) deal with a case with a girl who had died off a hotel ledge. Soon after, they find out that, the father John Ferris (Christopher Cousins) had been sexually assaulting her and her younger daughter. This had caused the daughter to get pregnant, and she had looked for a good guy to raise her, before she committed suicide, due to this. Meanwhile, in the \\"red reality\\", Britten and Efrem Vega (Wilmer Valderrama) deal with a case with a dead man Pablo. Later, they find out that his brother Jose Cabrera (Lombardo Boyar) had killed him and took his identity. Captain Tricia Harper (Laura Innes) and Captain Carl Kessel (Mark Harelik) discuss Britten's accident. \\"Ricky's Tacos\\" continued key thematic elements to the series that were originally introduced in \\"The Little Guy\\", the second episode of the series. The themes of the episode were criticized by The A.V. Club and HitFix. == Plot == Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs) is with his wife Hannah (Laura Allen) in the \\"red reality\\" talking to a real estate agent (Maura Soden) about selling their house and moving to Oregon. Later, Britten stops at Ricky's Tacos to order at the drive thru speaker, he hears the attendant (Barrett Shuler) say Britten cannot move until he solves the Westfield case. However, when Michael replies, the attendant has no idea what Britten is talking about. Britten drives to the Westfield Distribution Center and discovers that it is abandoned. He talks to the owner (Loren Lester), and explains that he was investigating a case there four months ago. The owner says that he is now leasing out the space and he does not know where the previous distribution owners went. While Britten is searching, he finds a Ricky's Tacos bag in the unit. In the \\"green reality\\", he speaks to Dr. Judith Evans (Cherry Jones), who claims that his subconscious is trying to stop their move to Oregon. Britten states that there was a case shortly before the accident. At the station, Britten speaks to Bird (Steve Harris) about the case. Britten starts to go to the records room. However, the detectives are sent on a new case. Sabrina Ferris jumped to her death from a hotel room, and landed on a car. They speak to Tim Wax (Charley Koontz), who witnessed the jump. He explains that they were lab partners and Sabrina invited him over to study and he did, and then they had sex, and shortly after, Sabrina jumped off the ledge. Sabrina's father John (Christopher Cousins) tries to attack Wax, automatically assuming that he pushed her. Back at the station, Dr. Banks (Chris McGarry) warns Bird and Britten that they found signs of rape. Britten talks to Tim in the interrogation room, where Tim claimed that he did not want to hurt her. After transferring into the \\"red reality\\", Britten speaks to Captain Tricia Harper (Laura Innes) about the storage unit, however she wants him to work on cases that have not been closed. Efrem Vega (Wilmer Valderrama) and Britten investigate at a hotel site that was being cleared for new construction. The workers found a man buried in the foundation. Banks shows them the site and the corpse, which has a fractured skull. Banks has managed to identify the victim as Pablo Cabrera. Britten speaks to his brother Jose (Lombardo Boyar), and notices a tattoo of the college logo of Tioga College in the other reality, on Jose's arm. Back in the \\"green reality\\", Britten goes to the impound lot and finds the parking pass with the tiger logo. At the station, he tells Bird that it was stamped two days ago and Sabrina drove 300 miles there and back without telling anyone. Britten decides to drive to San Diego, and at the college, Michael goes the room of the ex, Chris Chapman (Chris Brochu) to break the news, and Chapman noted that Sabrina had diary with she kept all personal information. Britten and Bird observe that she had a pregnancy to hide. In the \\"red reality\\", Michael drives back to Westfield Distribution and discovers that the doors are locked to look for more evidence, unaware that Detective Ed Hawkins (Kevin Weisman) is watching him. Hawkins notifies Captain Carl Kessel (Mark Harelik), and Kessel phones Harper to speak about it. Vega and Britten track down one of the foremen from three months ago, but does not recognize Pablo. In the \\"green reality\\", Britten goes to the distribution center, who tells him exactly what he said in the \\"green reality\\". Later, Bird calls to tell Michael that the autopsy report shows that Sabrina was four weeks pregnant when she killed herself. The partners go to see John at his home and explain that new information has come up revealing that Sabrina was pregnant. The father takes them to the bedroom to find the diaries and Michael notices something in a dresser. He asks John to get him a glass of water and then shows Bird how the dresser was moved to barricade the door. When John comes back with water, Britten takes him to the station. John had sexually molested her daughters. When she became pregnant, she tried to use Chris and then Tim to cover the pregnancy, but finally killed herself out of shame. To find evidence, Harper meets with Ally (Brighid Fleming) to get her to confess. She does confess, and John is led away and Wax is released from prison. In the \\"red reality\\", Britten realizes that Jose had a tattoo of a tiger put over his original tattoo of a devil. Michael and Vega go back to Jose's home and hear him run out the back. They give chase and Michael goes after him while Vega goes around and gets ahead to capture him. At the station, Britten says that Jose is really Pablo, due to the evidence, and Jose admits it. Britten tells Harper that he is moving to Oregon, and Harper calls Kessel to tell him that Britten resigned. == Production == Series creator Kyle Killen wrote the episode's story. The teleplay of the episode was written by executive producer Howard Gordon and Evan Katz, from a story by series creator Kyle Killen; the episode was directed by Adam Davidson. It was Gordon and Katz's second credit, and Killen's fourth writing credit in the series; it was Davidson's first credit. The installment is rated TV-14 on television in the United States. == Themes == Although it did not directly impact the ongoing storyline of Awake, \\"Ricky's Tacos\\" continued key thematic elements to the series that were originally introduced in \\"The Little Guy\\", the second episode, with a fast food attendant telling Britten that he cannot go to Oregon due to the Westfield case, and Kessel and Harper discussing their involvement, like in \\"The Little Guy\\". The A.V. Club claimed that \\"Ricky's Tacos\\" introduces a \\"deeper connection to our hero via some unexplained conspiracy\\". According to The A.V. Club, there was \\"conspiracy talk\\" in the episode that was previous in \\"The Little Guy\\". Due to this, they stated that the show is being into \\"integrated\\", with tons of cases in both realities. He thought that it is like \\"two different series working at once\\". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix observed that the episode is devoting \\"time to establishing Harper as more than just a mysterious conspirator\\", and claimed that \\"the show probably fumbled things by revealing both the existence of the conspiracy and Harper's role in it so early, rather than letting us get to know her before smacking us in the gut with the discovery.\\" == Broadcast and reception == \\"Ricky's Tacos\\" originally aired on NBC on April 12, 2012. The episode's initial broadcast was viewed by approximately 2.68 million viewers. \\"Ricky's Tacos\\" earned a Nielsen rating of 0.9, with a 2 share, meaning that roughly 0.9 percent of all television-equipped households, and 2 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. In the United Kingdom, the episode was first broadcast on Sky Atlantic on June 15, 2012, and obtained 223,000 viewers, making it the third most-viewed program for the channel behind Hit & Miss and Smash. \\"Ricky's Tacos\\" has generally received positive reviews from television critics. == External links == * \\"Ricky's Tacos\\" at NBC.com * * Category:Awake (TV series) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"Ricky's Tacos"},{"id":"35883924","text":"Domoxin (INN) is a hydrazine derivative monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant which was never marketed. == See also == * Monoamine oxidase inhibitor * Hydrazine (antidepressant) == References == Category:Antidepressants Category:Benzodioxans Category:Hydrazines Category:Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ","title":"Domoxin"},{"id":"35883936","text":"The 1984 Thayer Tutt Trophy was the second edition of the Thayer Tutt Trophy.

They fought off competition from Benfica and Braga to capture their twenty-sixth league title in their history. Six games from the end of the season, Benfica were one point ahead of Porto. The next four games for each side proved to be vital. From gameweek 24 to 27, Benfica managed seven points from a possible twelve whilst Porto capitalized on Benfica's mistakes of dropping points and managed to capture maximum of 12 points from 12. The pivotal win which clinched Porto the title was a 2–0 away win against Marítimo, where the following day Benfica drew their game away to Rio Ave which resulted in Porto capturing their second consecutive league title. Académica qualified for their very first Supertaça by winning the 2012 Taça de Portugal Final, beating Sporting CP 1–0 in the final at the Estádio Nacional. En route to the final, Académica de Coimbra defeated teams from the Primeira Liga, Liga de Honra and the Portuguese Second Division. Académica started their cup campaign defeating Oriental, 1–0. The most notable win en route to the final saw them face their opposition of the 2012 Supertaça in the fourth round, where they defeated the Dragons, 3–0 at the Estádio Cidade de Coimbra. Following their most notable win in their cup run, they went on to defeat Leixões 5–2 and the Desportivo das Aves 3–2 in the next two rounds. The draw for the semi-finals saw them draw Oliveirense of the Liga de Honra. The semi final was contested over two legs with Académica winning the first game 1–0 and drawing the second game at the Estádio Carlos Osório 2–2. Académica would win the semi final 3–2 on aggregate and therefore book their place in the cup final for the first time since 1969. A fourth-minute goal from Marinho in the 2012 Taça de Portugal Final saw them capture the Taça de Portugal for the first time since 1939. ===Officials=== The match officials for the game were confirmed on 7 August 2012. Olegário Benquerença of Leiria was named as referee. Benquerença had previously officiated the 2005 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira between Benfica and Vitória de Setúbal at the Estádio Algarve. Aside from the Supertaça, Benquerença had also officiated two Taça de Portugal finals in 2008 between Porto and Sporting CP and in 2002 between Sporting CP and Leixões. Benquerença was assisted by João Santos of Porto and Luís Marcelino of Leiria, while the fourth official was Jorge Tavares of Aveiro. ===Venue=== The Portuguese Football Federation announced in June 2012, that the 2012 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira was to take place at the Estádio Municipal de Aveiro in Aveiro. Académica's Estádio Cidade de Coimbra was also considered in contention to host the Supertaça but was not selected as a result of Académica qualifying for the competition. The Estádio Municipal de Aveiro hosted the Supertaça competition for a fourth consecutive year in a row after previously hosting the 2009, 2010 and the 2011 editions of the Supertaça. All of these four finals all consisted of Porto winning the competition. The Estádio Municipal de Aveiro is the home stadium of Beira-Mar. It holds a capacity for 30,127 spectators. The stadium was built in 2003 and replaced the Estádio Mário Duarte which was Beira-Mar's home stadium from 1930 until 2003. The stadium was used for two games at UEFA Euro 2004. ==MatchTeam selection=== Porto went into the 2012 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira with several players who were doubtful due to injury as well as players missing due to other commitments. In the weeks building up to the match, Porto had several players who were doubtful for the game but fully recuperated for the match. This was the case for Eliaquim Mangala and Marc Janko. Newly acquired forward Jackson Martínez was included in the squad after receiving international clearance for him to join Porto from Mexican team Chiapas. Porto's Alex Sandro, Danilo and Hulk missed the Supertaça due to being a part of the Brazilian national under-23 team who were participating in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Vítor Pereira's squad selection for the match saw him leave out Argentine midfielder Juan Iturbe and centre forward Marc Janko despite being recovered from an injury. Pereira's selection also saw him leave out Álvaro Pereira, who was on the verge of signing for Inter Milan. Pereira's squad selection for the Supertaça saw him include two newly acquired players; Fabiano and Jackson Martínez. Porto's starting line-up would see Miguel Lopes and Eliaquim Mangala start the game in the full back positions after first- team regulars Alex Sandro and Danilo were unavailable for the game. The surprise choices in the starting line up saw Steven Defour start over João Moutinho and Christian Atsu start over Silvestre Varela. Académica went into the 2012 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira with no injuries to any of its players. Pedro Emanuel selected a squad of 19 players for the Supertaça. His squad selection for the Supertaça saw him include ten newly acquired players: Afonso, Bruno China, Cleyton, Edinho, Henrique, John Ogu, Magique, Makelele, Rodrigo Galo and Salim Cissé. Of those ten, Afonso, Cleyton, Makelele, Galo and Cissé would start the game. Ogu and Magique were later used in the game as substitutes. The surprise choice in Pedro Emanuel's starting eleven saw first- team goalkeeper Romuald Peiser be replaced by Ricardo. ===Summary=== Porto dominated possession early on and created several chances which tested Académica's defense. The first major chance of the game saw Miguel Lopes receive the ball inside the eighteen yard box and pass it to James Rodríguez who fired the ball into Ricardo's hands. Porto's dominance continued with Maicon's free kick being parried by Ricardo and on the follow up, Ricardo blocked Christian Atsu's shot. The first half would remain goalless. Porto entered into the second half dominating possession just like they did in the first half. The first major goal scoring chance of the second half saw Lucho González play the ball into Académica's penalty box where Jackson Martínez couldn't capitalize off Académica's defense frailties when he shot the ball over the bar. As the score remained goalless, Vítor Pereira brought on Djalma and João Moutinho. Pereira's substitutions were paying off, as Porto started to create more chances and provide more attacking threat. Porto's next major threat on goal saw Nicolás Otamendi's bicycle kick be saved by Ricardo from a resulting James Rodríguez corner kick. As the game drew closer to the end, it seemed that the Supertaça would be settled on overtime but in the ninetieth minute of the game, a right wing cross found Jackson Martínez in the box who headed the ball past Ricardo to grant Porto a nineteenth Supertaça. ===Details=== { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK1  Helton - RB13  Miguel Lopes - CB4  Maicon - CB30  Nicolás Otamendi  - LB22  Eliaquim Mangala - DM25  Fernando - CM3  Lucho González (c)   - CM35  Steven Defour   - RW10  James Rodríguez - LW27  Christian Atsu   - CF9  Jackson Martínez  - colspan=3Substitutes: - GK24  Fabiano - DF14  Rolando - MF6  André Castro - MF8  João Moutinho   - FW20  Djalma   - FW17  Silvestre Varela   - FW11  Kléber - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Vítor Pereira } valign=\\"top\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=center colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK12  Ricardo - RB22  Rodrigo Galo - CB35  Reiner - CB13  João Real - LB55  Hélder Cabral  - DM4  Flávio Ferreira (c) - CM8  Makelele - CM20  Cleyton - RW7  Marinho   - LW77  Afonso   - CF92  Salim Cissé - colspan=3Substitutes: - GK1  Romuald Peiser - DF2  João Dias - DF23  Henrique - MF14  Bruno China - MF18  Magique   - FW30  John Ogu   - FW36  Edinho - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Pedro Emanuel } } {  style=\\"text-align: center; margin: 0 auto; width: 20%\\" - !2012 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira Winners - Porto 19th Title } { style=\\"width:100%; font-size:90%\\" -  style=\\"width:50%; vertical-align:top\\" ;Man of the match * Jackson Martínez (Porto) ;Match officials *Assistant referees: **João Santos (Porto) **Luís Marcelino (Leiria) *Fourth official: Jorge Tavares (Aveiro)  style=\\"width:50%; vertical- align:top\\" ;Match rules *90 minutes *Penalty shoot-out if scores level after 90 minutes *Seven named substitutes *Maximum of three substitutions } ==See also== *2011-12 Primeira Liga *2011-12 Taça de Portugal *2012 Taça de Portugal Final ==References== Category:Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira Category:FC Porto matches Category:Associação Académica de Coimbra – O.A.F. matches Category:2012–13 in Portuguese football ","title":"2012 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira"},{"id":"35883966","text":"José-Ricardo de Jesús (born 7 May 1960) is a Puerto Rican former swimmer who competed in the 1976 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Puerto Rican male swimmers Category:Male freestyle swimmers Category:Male medley swimmers Category:Olympic swimmers of Puerto Rico Category:Swimmers at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Swimmers at the 1979 Pan American Games Category:Central American and Caribbean Games gold medalists for Puerto Rico Category:Competitors at the 1978 Central American and Caribbean Games Category:Central American and Caribbean Games medalists in swimming ","title":"José-Ricardo de Jesús"},{"id":"35883981","text":"Carbenzide (INN), also known as carbazic acid, is a hydrazine derivative monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant which was never marketed. == See also == * Monoamine oxidase inhibitor * Hydrazine (antidepressant) == References == Category:Antidepressants Category:Carboxylic acids Category:Hydrazides Category:Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ","title":"Carbenzide"},{"id":"35883982","text":"\\"Timeless\\" is the first single from the 3rd Studio album by the German band Queensberry. ==Formats and track listings== ;CD single #Timeless (Single Version) - 3:19 #Timeless (Karaoke Version) - 3:19 ;Gold Edition #Timeless (Single Version) - 3:19 #Timeless (Instrumental Version) - 3:19 #Timeless (Plastic Funk Mix) - 5:42 #Timeless (Miami Inc Mix) - 3:42 ==Charts== German Singles Chart #90 ==References== Category:2012 singles Category:Queensberry (band) songs Category:Warner Records singles Category:Songs written by Ryan Ogren Category:2012 songs Category:Songs written by Nick Bailey ","title":"Timeless (Queensberry song)"},{"id":"35883991","text":"Francisco \\"Paco\\" Luis Canales (born 20 July 1957) is a Puerto Rican former swimmer who competed in the 1976 Summer Olympics.

It aired on ABC on May 2, 2012 and was written by Paul Corrigan & Brad Walsh and directed by Michael Spiller. In the episode, Phil wants to buy a new car and despite knowing Claire would not be happy with it, he gets a two-seat convertible. Surprisingly, Claire does not react to this only because she hopes Phil will realize his mistake on his own. On a ride with Lily with the subway, Cameron and Mitchell lose her favorite stuffed rabbit. They try to convince her to choose another toy to be her favorite but she refuses, forcing them to go back to the subway and find it. Jay has to attend a college reunion and wants Gloria and Manny to go with him so he can show off his new wife to his friends, something that Gloria has no idea about. Gloria though, is afraid to travel with a helicopter and Jay is forced to drive them to the reunion. The episode received mixed reviews from the critics. ==Plot== Phil (Ty Burrell) wants to buy a new car and he takes his friend Andre (Kevin Hart) with him who convinces him to buy a two-seat convertible instead of his regular Cadillac. Despite his fear of Claire's (Julie Bowen) reaction, he decides to do it anyway. Phil gets back home in his new car. Luke (Nolan Gould) is excited seeing it but he asks if mom would be OK with it, so does Alex (Ariel Winter). Haley (Sarah Hyland) is also excited seeing the car because she believes her dad bought if for her since he is too old for that car. Surprisingly Claire does not criticize Phil's decision and hopes he will realize buying the convertible was a mistake on his own. Due to the convertible only being a two-seater, Phil is forced to switch cars with Claire for work. Phil has to also drive/pick up the kids from school because he has the big car. Phil is mad at the fact he had to switch cars with Claire but he soon realizes that driving the kids to school and picking them up, leads to learning things about them. Claire decides to ditch her chores and to take the convertible to the coast for some time to herself to calm down. She soon loses the keys on the beach and Phil later arrives with a spare. The two spend time together and agree to make time for one another from now on. Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) and Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) decide to take Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) to a ride with the subway to the Chinatown but they lose her favorite stuffed rabbit. They try to get Lily to choose a new favorite out of her other toys, but she refuses. Cameron and Mitchell are therefore forced to go to desperate lengths to get the stuffed rabbit back, including putting up flyers in the subway and offering a reward for its safe return. They soon decide that Lily will have to deal with her loss when they discover the stuffed animal has been in the care of a homeless man. Meanwhile, Jay (Ed O'Neill) is ecstatic to take Gloria (Sofía Vergara) and Manny (Rico Rodriguez) on a trip to his college reunion as he claims he was considered somewhat of a legend by his fellow students. Jay is irritated when he is forced to drive them there due to Gloria's refusal to ride in a small airplane. On their way there, one of the tires punctures and they are once again forced to find an alternative way to travel to the reunion. Gloria is hesitant to go and wants to return home until she realizes Jay is so excited to go because he wants to show his new family off to his old friends, who all used to think that Jay would not amount to much. Gloria agrees to go with him, happy to play the trophy wife role. ==Reception Ratings === In its original American broadcast, \\"Planes, Trains and Cars\\" was watched by 10.06 million; slightly down from the previous episode, with an adult 18-49 rating/share of 4.0/11. === Reviews === The episode receive mixed reviews from critics. Wyner C of Two Cents TV gave a good review to the episode saying that it was awesome. \\"This was an awesome episode!!! The first 15 minutes had so many one-liners! I don’t know how to choose my favorite. Great episode!! I laughed out loud at least 5 times.\\" Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C rate, bemoaning the lack of a unifying theme between the three stories, and called the Mitchell and Cameron storyline \\"horrifyingly realistic\\". Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.5/5, summing up the overall episode by saying \\"coming off of an episode that I personally was not a fan of, I can honestly say that, while not sidesplittingly hilarious, this outing did leave me with a smile\\". Christine N. Ziemba of Paste Magazine gave the episode 6.6/10 saying that the episode was overall \\"mediocre\\". She criticized the character of Gloria, stating that \\"we know that Gloria has often used her, ahem, assets to get what she wants, but it’s a little degrading to watch her objectified\\". Ziemba was also critical of Manny's role in the episode. She said \\"Manny wasn't quite himself either, turning from a sensitive old soul, who’s wise beyond his years, into a snotty brat\\". Michael Adams of 411mania gave the episode 7/10. \\"I liked Mitchell this week. [...] The Cam/Mitchell story was minimal, however, it was very funny and touching and Mitch had a lot of great lines. [...] I also loved Mitchell's response when he thought Cam was yelling at him for calling the guy homeless. Good stuff. I think Jesse Tyler Ferguson will get an Emmy nomination this year, however, I don't think they've given him enough good material for the win.

In this species, the background color is overlaid with dark-brown, red-brown, or blackish mottling. The rear area of the gill cover has a prominent dark patch which probably inspired its Latin name auriculatus, meaning \\"eared\\". This blotch may become faint in larger specimens. Stripes of red-brown, brown, or orange radiate back from the upper jaw and eyes. Brown rockfish in Puget Sound and off central California commonly have coronal spines, while in southern California waters, these spine are generally absent. The brown rockfish often resembles the copper rockfish, but the latter lack the dark patch on their gill cover and have lighter areas along their lateral line. The brown rockfish may also be confused with the vermillion rockfish in deep water, and the grass rockfish in shallow water. Along the Pacific coast of the United States, more than one population of these fish may exist. The brown rockfish can grow to about in length, with the females being potentially larger than the males. Both sexes have similar growth rates and life spans, and are known to live to at least 34 years of age. ==Distribution and habitat== The brown rockfish is native to the northwestern Pacific. Its range extends from Bahia San Hipolito in southern Baja California to Prince William Sound in the northern Gulf of Alaska. These fish are most abundant in the central and southern parts of Puget Sound and from southern Baja California to Bodega Bay in northern California. Brown Rockfish live in places that have a source of light. ==Biology== Juveniles and subadults are thought to have relatively small home ranges. They commonly live at shallow inshore depths of 396 ft. (120 m), and can occasionally be found as deep as 444 ft. (135 m). The adults and subadults are commonly found near the sea bottom over both high and low terrain, and sometimes among eelgrass or other vegetation. Pelagic juveniles are at shallower depths of about 120 ft. (36 m). They live alone or in small groups and are found in waters more turbid than many other rockfishes. In shallower waters off southern California, brown rockfish are abundant around some oil platforms. The juveniles are prey to harbor seals and king salmon. The brown rockfish feeds primarily at night on small fishes, crab, shrimp, and other small invertebrates. During the day this fish tends to lie on the seabed among seaweed or next to rocks or in other hidden locations. Its spines are venomous and can cause painful injuries to the unwary. == References  * Brown rockfish at National Marine Fisheries Service Category:Sebastidae Category:Fish described in 1854 Category:Fish of the Pacific Ocean ","title":"Brown rockfish"},{"id":"35884103","text":"Josh or Joshua Williams may refer to: ==Sports== * Josh Williams (American football) (born 1976), former American football player * Josh Williams (Australian footballer) (born 1998), Australian rules football player for North Melbourne * Josh Williams (soccer) (born 1988), American soccer player * Josh Williams (racing driver) (born 1993), American professional stock car racing driver ==Other== * Josh Williams (Gowalla), American Internet entrepreneur, founder and former CEO of Gowalla * Joshua Williams (legal writer) (1813–1881), English barrister and legal author in the field of property law * Joshua Williams (1837–1915), New Zealand lawyer, politician, Supreme Court judge and university chancellor ==See also== * Joss Williams, special effects supervisor ","title":"Josh Williams"},{"id":"35884105","text":"Salvador Vassallo Salvador Vassallo (born 16 September 1968) is a Puerto Rican former swimmer who competed in the 1988 Summer Olympics.add biographyphoto wikipedia Salvador is the youngest of five sons of industrialist Víctor Vassallo and Daysi Anadón.

It was mainly used by Greek immigrants from Asia Minor and in classical Ottoman music. The instrument was also used earlier for popular music, such as early \\"Smyrna- Style\\" Rebetiko and played till nowadays. It has become the main bowed instrument of Ottoman classical music since the mid 19th century. ==Etymology== The name Kemençe derives from the Persian Kamancheh, and means merely \\"small bow\\". The name lyra derives from the name of the ancient Greek lyre and was used in medieval times, see Byzantine lyra. == Playing == It is played in the downright position, by resting it between both knees or on one knee when sitting. It is always played \\"braccio\\", that is, with the tuning head uppermost. The kemenche bow is called the yay () and the doksar (), the Greek term for bow. The strings are stopped by touching them by the side with the nails, like for many folk fiddles from Southeastern Europe to the Indian sub-continent, including the Indian sarangi. == Construction == R. Eskenazi, A. Tomboulis (Athens, 1930) Its pear-shaped body, elliptical pegbox and neck are fashioned from a single piece of wood. Its sound-board has two D-shaped soundholes of some 4x3 cm, approximately 25 mm apart, the rounded side facing outwards. The bridge is placed between, one side resting on the face of the instrument and the other on the sound post. A small hole 3–4 mm in diameter is bored in the back, directly below the bridge, and a ‘back channel’ (‘sırt oluğu’) begins from a triangular raised area (‘mihrap’) which is an extension of the neck, widens in the middle, and ends in a point near the tailpiece (“kuyruk takozu”) to which the gut or metal strings are attached. There is no nut to equalize the vibrating lengths of the strings. The pegs, which are 14–15 cm long, form a triangle on the head, the middle string being 37–40 mm longer than the strings to either side of it. The vibrating lengths of the short strings are 25.5–26 cm. All the strings are of gut but the yegâh string is silver-wound. Today players may use synthetic racquet strings, aluminium- wound gut, synthetic silk or chromed steel violin strings. Formerly the head, neck and back channel might be inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl or tortoise shell. Some kemençes made for the palace or mansions by great makers such as Büyük İzmitli or Baron had their backs and even the edges of the sound holes completely covered with such inlays with engraved and inlaid motifs. ==Related instruments== The Byzantine lyra (Latin: lira) was a pear-shaped bowed string instrument. The Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911) was the first to describe the Byzantine lyra as a typical Byzantine instrument (Margaret J. Kartomi, 1990). Variations of the instrument (sharing the same form and method of playing) exist through a vast area of the Mediterranean and the Balkans. Examples are the Bulgarian Gadulka, the Calabrian Lira in Italy, the lyra of Crete and the Dodecanese, the Lijerica of the Croatian Adriatic. == Notable kemençe virtuosi == * Fahire Fersan (1900–1997) * Tamburi Cemil Bey (1873–1916) * Derya Türkan * Sokratis Sinopoulos * Labros Leontaridis * İhsan Özgen * Cüneyd Orhon * Ruşen Ferit Kam ==See also== *Byzantine lyra *Cretan lyra *Gadulka *Gudok *Ghaychak *Gusle *Rebab *Kamancheh *Kobyz *Rebec *Igil *Byzaanchy *Huqin *Violin family == References  Bibliography == * Margaret J.

It educates Jews about pornography-use habits, Internet addiction, and other problems that can result from Internet usage. == Technology Awareness Group == The Ichud HaKehillos has founded a sister group called the Technology Awareness Group (TAG). It provides various services to its target market, including installing and configuring Web filtering and monitoring software on computers, smartphones and other devices. TAG is a nonprofit organization staffed by volunteers, and there is no fee for any of its services. TAG has offices in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia and elsewhere; TAG also provides certain services worldwide using remote desktop software. In total, TAG fields about 1000 phone calls from around the world every day. As of January 2020, TAG operates 40 offices in 16 countries and territories, staffed by over 400 volunteers. TAG operates 6 offices in the UK, as well as 3 offices in Israel; other similar Israeli organizations include OutNet and the היעוץ המקצועי שעל ידי ועידת הרבנים לביצור חומת הדת technology advice hotline. == Gatherings == To help promote awareness of the issues at hand, the Ichud HaKehillos has organized some gatherings. On September 27, 2005, a gathering was held in Lakewood, NJ, shortly before Rosh Hashana. The leaders enacted a policy that children with Internet access are subject to being dismissed from any private Orthodox Jewish school in Lakewood. ===Internet Asifa=== Internet Asifa, or Kinus Klal Yisrael, was a rally organized by Ichud HaKehillos LeTohar HaMachane on May 20, 2012 to raise awareness about the negative consequences the internet and related technology was having in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish religious community, to discourage the usage of the internet, and to promote the use of internet filters when the internet was being accessed. The rally was held at Citi Field and Arthur Ashe Stadium, New York City, and attended by over 60,000 people. Women were not allowed to attend the rally due to religious modesty concerns but were able to watch from closed circuit television at satellite locations. The media was also barred from entering due to stated \\"homeland security concerns,\\" as per the rally's spokesman. The rally was widely discussed in Orthodox Jewish online blogs and forums. Much discussion centered around the irony of how the internet was utilized by event attendees and members of the Orthodox Jewish community to promote an event which explicitly discouraged usage of the internet. Further discussion centered around speculation that some of the organizations sponsoring and promoting the event had ties to internet filter companies and had financial incentives from the relgioius promotion of internet filters. == See also == * Atzat Nefesh: An Israeli organization which also offers help to pornography users. * Comparison of content-control software and providers: Mentions Qustodio, X3Watch, K9 Web Protection, Norton, OpenDNS, other filtering tools, and other monitoring tools, some of which are free for home use. * . * NoFap: A (basically irreligious) online community for those who want to abstain from pornography and/or masturbation. * Opposition to pornography * Pornography addiction: The article also discusses overuse of pornography. == References  Further reading == * This is an article which speaks about the Technology Awareness Group. * 100 pages.

The park, which contains over 120 species of trees, is popular with dog walkers. The park is roughly rectangular. Molteno Dam borders the park to the south, with the other three sides bordered by roads. There are four tennis courts belonging to the Gardens Tennis Club in the South West corner. In summer, the park hosts free outdoor concerts on Sunday afternoons. ==History== De Waal Park was Cape Town's first and largest public park, after the Company's Gardens, when it was opened in 1895. De Waal Park ca. 1900 vs 2015 In 1877 the City Council of Cape Town purchased land from the Van Breda family who owned the farm Oranjezigt. They divided the land into three parts, first building the two smaller reservoirs below Camp Street and then building the Molteno Reservoir below Belvedere Road which also provided the city with electricity. The land in between formed a natural park. David Christiaan de Waal, who was the city councillor at the time and also a member of the Legislative Council of the Cape Colony, decided to develop the park. At his instigation thousands of trees were planted in Cape Town and especially in the park. As Mayor of Cape Town, 1889-1890, he developed the park further and it was opened to the public officially in 1895. At one stage it was called Jubilee Park but it soon reverted to the name it bears today. Two gates with brick piers and wrought-iron arches in Art Nouveau style at the lower corners and a wall along Camp Street were built in 1899 and the wall was extended up Upper Orange Street in 1900. Molteno Road was extended down to meet Camp Street at about this time and it was decided to fence off the park on that side by planting a hedge of Kei apple. The bandstand was built in 1904/5 for the Cape Town Exhibition which was held in Green Point and moved to the park after the exhibition was over. It was used for public performances for some years. The Victorian fountain in De Waal Park is a natural artesian well and feeds the Lower Reservoir No. 2 in Oranjezicht. On 22 March 1968 the park was proclaimed a National Monument to be maintained in perpetuity as public gardens and it is now listed as a Provincial Heritage Site. ==Gallery== File:De Waal Park with toilet building.jpgNorth East Corner File:De Waal Park circa 1898.jpgDe Waal Park ca. 1898 File:De Waal Park Walkway with Fountain.jpgCenter of the park 2015 File:De Waal Park circa 1880.jpgBandstand and Signal Hill ca. 1905 File:De Waal Park Bandstand.JPGThe Edwardian bandstand in 2012 File:De_Waal_Park.JPGNorth West Gate ==References== Category:Parks in Cape Town Category:South African heritage sites Category:Art Nouveau architecture in South Africa ","title":"De Waal Park"},{"id":"35884376","text":"The Curzon Memories App is a locative media mobile app based at the Curzon Community Cinema, Clevedon, UK. The cinema celebrated its centenary in April 2012 and is one of the oldest continuously operating independent cinemas in the UK. The app was developed as part of an academic practice-based research project by Charlotte Crofts in collaboration with the Curzon's education officer, Cathy Poole and was funded by the Digital Cultures Research Centre and an Early Career Researcher Grant from the University of the West of England. The app draws upon the extensive Curzon Collection of Cinema Heritage Technology and contains audio and video dramatisations and oral histories of employees and patrons recounting their experiences throughout the life of the cinema, including Julia Elton (daughter of Sir Arthur Elton, a pioneer of British documentary) and Muriel Williams, who was in the cinema on the night it got bombed during the Bristol Blitz January 1941. Visitors to the cinema are invited to download the free app, from iTunes or Google Play, and access those experiences in the locations where they actually happened. QR Codes are discreetly placed around the cinema, which act as triggers for these memories. The App also contains a walk around the exterior of the building which includes memories and rephotography of archive photographs triggered by GPS signals as the participant takes the walk. For those who cannot get to the Curzon Cinema, there is a manual interface, and the QR codes are available at the official website. The app was built using the AppFurnace authoring system, made by Calvium, and is available on both Apple iOS and Android. ==Projection Hero== One of the unique features of the Curzon Mermories project is Projection Hero, an Internet of Things installation developed by Charlotte Crofts, in collaboration with Tarim at Media Playgrounds, which comprises a miniature cinema which can be operated via any web-enabled smartphone by scanning the QR code on the cinema screen, either from within the Curzon Memories App or using any QR Reader. The installation also works by typing in the accompanying URL into a web browser. This takes the user to an interface which enables the user to manipulate the cinema. The smartphone effectively becomes a \\"remote control\\" allowing the user to dim the lights, open the curtains and play the movies, using a combination of Arduino circuit and actuators connected to the Internet via an H bridge. The installation features interviews with retired projectionists Maurice Thornton and Pete Stamp, discussing the art of projection in the digital age. The installation is on permanent display at the Curzon Cinema, Clevedon, and has also been exhibited at the Watershed Media Centre, Bristol. ==Reviews== The Curzon Memories App was selected to pitch in front of industry judges at AppCircus London Google Campus and won the Media Communications and Cultural Studies Association Annual Conference, MeCCSA 2012 Poster prize. The project was featured on BBC Radio 4's You and Yours in an item on AppCircus where one of the jury, Facebook's Simon Cross said “You take the concept of what they did which is to bring the history of this old cinema to life, they could’ve stopped at videos and text, but connecting it to something physical such as a screen you can control from your phone, that’s a completely different experience … it just feels like you are connected to it, because your phone is controlling it … that feels pretty cool to me”. The app has also been featured in the following press: The Guardian Apps Rush: \\"More location-based UK goodness with this app, based on the Curzon Community Cinema in Clevedon. It gets people to scan QR codes around the building to hear stories from local people. There's a manual interface to access everything if you're not in Clevedon too\\", Wired UK Magazine, Film Studies For Free, The Pervasive Media Cookbook, Imperica. ==Research== This app was developed as part of an academic research project based at the University of the West of England to explore how new media can be used to enhance cinema heritage.

He was the son of Petrus Camper is known today primarily for his paleontological work in collaboration with his father, causing several fossil holotypes to be named after him, such as the Puppigerus P.

He himself wrote several books on paleontology, including a catalog of his collection of fossils and minerals.Books by Adriaan Gilles Camper on the Google Books Library Project His daughter Frederica married one of his pupils in Franeker, the Dutch geologist J.G.S. van Breda (who later became curator of the Teylers Museum in Haarlem). Van Breda wrote a biography of father-in-law, in which he describes him as the home-schooled wunderkind who entered the University of Franeker at age 14 already learned in natural history and modern languages from his close association with his father.Levens-schets van Adriaan Gilles Camper by J.G.S. van Breda on Google books Three years later, in 1776, his mother died, and his father was so struck by the loss that he undertook a leave of absence from the university to travel to Paris and the young Adriaan went with him. There due to the fame of his father, they were received with open arms by the various learned societies such as the French Academy of Sciences and consorted with Louis, Antoine Portal, Jacques-René Tenon, Julien-David Le Roy, the Count Jean-Charles de Borda, the Marquis de Condorcet, and Benjamin Franklin (the American liberator).
