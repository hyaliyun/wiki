Born in Changnyeong, Korea, Kim was among the first of a generation of Korean artists who moved to the United States in the 1950s and is one of the earliest-known Korean artists to permanently work and reside in New York City. Having received both Western and Eastern artistic training, he developed his own unique fusion of both traditions and continuously explored various styles throughout his career, from Abstract Expressionism in the 1950s, to realist still-life drawings in the 1970s and large-scale Neo-Expressionistic figurative and allegorical works from the 1980s onward. Shortly after his death a critic called him \\"artist who found great inspiration in his identities as a Korean, an American, and a New Yorker,\\" and said, \\"Po Kim‚Äôs artistic career was characterized by an ever-evolving style, and an eagerness to seek out new areas of inspiration.\\"  Early life  Po was born in 1917 in the south-east corner of the Korean peninsula. Shortly after his birth his father died of flu causing the family to descend into poverty. Because his mother disapproved of his early interest in art, Kim painted in secret. Late in life he said his early passion persisted as he grew up and resulted in a commitment to make art whether or not it received critical recognition or sales. At nineteen he left home to study in Tokyo. Over the next seven or eight years he studied at the as well as the Meiji University Law School and the Imperial Commercial School. In 1946 he returned to Korea and established the Department of Fine Arts at Chosun University, where he served as chairman and professor until 1955. During the political confrontations prior to the Korean War he was subjected to imprisonment and torture by both left-wing rebels and government forces. Due to his political neutrality, he suffered torture, arrest and surveillance committed by both political sides of the Korean War. In 1955 he was invited to a fellowship at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which he accepted, afterwards moving to New York in 1957 and eventually becoming a US citizen. He did not return to Korea for more than 30 years.  Career in New York City  Arriving in New York during the height of the Abstract Expressionist movement, Kim immersed himself in the period's dynamic avant-garde environment, interacting with many of the New York School artists active in Downtown Manhattan at the time. Within this circle he met his future wife, the artist Sylvia Wald. Together with the artist Lenore Tawney, they purchased a house at 37 East 4th Street, which they renovated with artist studios and gallery. In 1978, Kim and Wald purchased the building at 417 Lafayette Street, where they lived and worked until their deaths. They established the Sylvia Wald and Po Kim Art Gallery, a non-profit art foundation, which is still located there today. Po Kim, Untitled, 1958, oil on linen, 60 x 72 inches Kim's first work was in the then-dominant Abstract Expressionist style. His paintings, in the words of one critic, were \\"suffused with the aesthetic of his Korean heritage.\\" The untitled painting of 1958, shown here to the left, is an example of this work. Po Kim, Abstract 412, 1961-62, oil on paper, 18.5 x 24 inches During the 1960s his paintings showed some influence from the Color Field artists of the time. Kim's Abstract 412 of 1961-62, at right, is an example of his work in the 1960s. Po Kim, Pear, 1975-77, colored pencil on paper, 13. 5 x 12.5 inches In the 1970s he made realistic still life drawings that were said to be \\"remarkable for their technical proficiency, and the sense of Zen-like concentration that [he] brought to bear on their creation.\\" Pear of 1975-77, shown to the left, is an example of these still lifes. Po Kim, Daydream in Studio II, 1981, oil on canvas, 78 x 60 inchesThereafter he worked out an abstract-realist synthesis in a manner referred to as \\"expressionist figuration.\\" These large canvases show animals, humans, and nature containing \\"mysterious alternative realities.\\" Daydream in Studio II, at right, shows this late style. Po Kim in his studio, 2011 The photo of the artist at left shows him working on a large canvas near the end of his life. In 2013 a critic noted that Kim's \\"journey, in a sense, recapitulated all of the artist's experience with forms, images, techniques, and conceptual approaches.\\" Works from Kim's six-decade career have been featured in numerous solo and group exhibitions in distinguished institutions throughout South Korea, Europe, and the U.S. His works are also held in national and international collections, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, National Museum of Contemporary Art in South Korea, Seoul Art Center, and the in South Korea. In 2000, Chosun University awarded Kim an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in honor of his life accomplishments and contributions to the artistic community. In 2002, the Chosun University Art Museum in Gwangju established the Po Kim and Sylvia Wald Art Museum to house their permanent collection of more than 300 works by Kim.  Critical notice  Critical notice of Kim's paintings increased gradually during his career and expanded dramatically after his death. In his work he was seen to have gradually come to terms with the tragedies of his life in Korea and, in the end, to have achieved a peaceful resolution of early traumas. He was also seen to have merged the Japanese training and Korean cultural influences with distinctly American expressionist technique. In 2012 he gave an interview in which he recapitulated his artistic career, concluding by stating, \\"Painting is my life. There is nothing else.\\"  Notes   References  Category:1917 births Category:2014 deaths Category:20th-century American artists Category:Chosun University faculty Category:People from Changnyeong County Category:South Korean emigrants to the United States ","title":"Po Kim"},{"id":"57844075","text":"The Bullock County Courthouse Historic District is a historic district in Union Springs, Alabama which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

He lost and set a record for the length of a fast. The fast In 1965, Barbieri, then a 27-year-old from Tayport, Scotland, checked into the Maryfield Hospital in Dundee. Initially only a short fast was planned, due to the doctors believing that short fasts were preferable to longer ones. Barbieri insisted on continuing because \\"he adapted so well and was eager to reach his 'ideal' weight\\". For 382 days ending on 11 July 1966, he consumed only vitamins, electrolytes, and zero-calorie beverages such as tea, coffee, and sparkling water, although he occasionally consumed small amounts of milk and/or sugar with the beverages, especially during the final weeks of the fast. He quit working at his father's fish and chip shop, which closed down during the fast. Barbieri's starting weight was recorded at and he stopped fasting when he reached his goal weight of . After his weight loss, he moved to Warwick and had two sons. Barbieri died in September 1990.

He is most noted as commanding general of 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade during Cuban Missile Crisis and later served as commanding general of 1st Marine Division. Fairbourn was later known as Nuclear arms race activist. Early years William T. Fairbourn was born on June 28, 1914, in Sandy, Utah, as the son of William Reuben Fairbourn and his wife Violet Veneda Jensen. His father served as Sheriff Deputy in Sandy and young William attended high school there. He then attended University of Utah in Salt Lake City and graduated in June 1935 with Bachelor degree. While at University, Fairbourn was a cadet colonel of ROTC unit and also was regimental honor graduate. He was subsequently commissioned second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on July 10, 1935, and ordered to the Basic School at Philadelphia Navy Yard for further officers education. With 124 students, it was the largest Basic School class to that date. This class provided two future Marine Corps Commandants (Leonard F. Chapman Jr. and Robert E. Cushman Jr.), five lieutenant generals (Lewis J. Fields, Frederick E. Leek, Herman Nickerson Jr., William J. Van Ryzin, Richard G. Weede), five major generals (William R. Collins, Fairbourn, Bruno Hochmuth, Raymond L. Murray, Carey A. Randall) and six brigadier generals (William W. Buchanan, Odell M. Conoley, Frederick P. Henderson, Roy L. Kline, John C. Miller Jr., Thomas F. Riley). Fairbourn completed the school in March 1936 and was attached to the 10th Marine Artillery Regiment, 2nd Marine Brigade at Marine Corps Base San Diego, California. He was ordered for the course at Army Field Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where he graduated in June 1938.

World War II Fairbourn was attached to the heavy cruiser USS Chester as commanding officer of Marine detachment and was promoted to the rank of captain in April 1941. He was aboard that ship, when Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and subsequently took part in the actions on Tulagi, Coral Sea or Midway. He was detached from Chester in June 1942 following the promotion to the rank of major and returned to San Diego, where he served until March 1943. During that period, Fairbourn was attached to the 12th Marine Artillery Regiment, 3rd Marine Division as Regimental Operations officer under Colonel John B. Wilson. The 12th Marines took part in the intensive training at Camp Dunlap, California before sailed to New Zealand in March 1943. Fairbourn was stationed with the regiment in Auckland until July 1943, when he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and sailed with the regiment to Guadalcanal for amphibious training in the jungle. The 12th Marines then moved to the island of Efate, New Hebrides in October 1943 in order to prepare for upcoming landing on Bougainville. The 12th Marines landed on Bougainville as a part of 3rd Marine Division under Major General Allen H. Turnage on November 1, 1943, and took part in the Battle of Piva Forks. General Turnage praised the effectiveness of the artillery on Bougainville and Fairbourn received the Bronze Star Medal with Combat \\"V\\" for his service there. Following the campaign, Fairbourn sailed with the regiment back to Guadalcanal for rest and reequipment and spent next eight months with training. He took part in the recapture of Guam in July 1944 and received his second Bronze Star Medal and Navy Unit Commendation. Fairbourn subsequently succeeded lieutenant colonel Donald M. Weller in command of 2nd Battalion of his regiment and remained on Guam during the mopping up operations against the small scattered groups of Japanese soldiers. The units of 3rd Marine Division under Major General Graves B. Erskine were ordered for Iwo Jima and landed on February 24, 1945. Fairbourn landed later in the afternoon of that day and following the deployment of his batteries, his battalion began supporting 21st Marine Regiment during the attack on Motoyama Airfield. The Iwo Jima was declared secured at the end of March 1945 and Fairbourn sailed together with 12th Marines back to Guam. He was decorated with the Legion of Merit with Combat \\"V\\" and Navy Presidential Unit Citation for his service on Iwo Jima. Postwar service Fairbourn returned to the United States in May 1945 and assumed duty at Marine Training Command at Camp Lejeune under Major General John Marston and served in this capacity until June 1946, when he assumed duty with the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations under Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. He served in the latter capacity until August 1949, when he was ordered for the instruction at Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Upon the graduation in June 1950, Fairbourn was ordered to Norfolk Navy Yard, Virginia and attached to the headquarters of Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic. He served under Lieutenant General LeRoy P. Hunt and later under his divisional commander from Iwo Jima, Graves B. Erskine as assistant chief of staff for intelligence and later as assistant chief of staff for operations and was promoted to the rank of colonel in January 1951. He was detached from Norfolk in July 1952 in order to attend Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, and completed the Strategy and Tactics course in June 1953. Fairbourn then served for two years on the college staff until he was ordered to Camp Pendleton in July 1955 as commanding officer of 11th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division. Colonel Fairbourn served as chief of staff, 3rd Marine Division under Major General Francis M. McAlister in Okinawa, Japan from November 1957 to March 1958 and returned to the United States one month later. He then served as director of First Marine Corps Reserve and Recruitment District with headquarters at Garden City, New York. Fairbourn was ordered to Washington, D.C., in November 1959 and promoted to the rank of brigadier general. He was subsequently appointed deputy director of Marine Corps Reserve at Headquarters Marine Corps under Major General William W. Stickney and finally succeeded him at the beginning of January 1960. Fairbourn was transferred to Camp Pendleton, California in July 1962 in order to be appointed assistant division commander, 1st Marine Division under Major General Herman Nickerson. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, Fairbourn was appointed commanding general of 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade detached from 1st Marine Division and sailed for Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba.

He was appointed commanding general of 1st Marine Division in April 1963 and promoted to the rank of major general in August of that year. Fairbourn was relieved by his assistant division commander, brigadier general Edward H. Hurst in July 1965 and ordered to Washington, D.C., for duty as deputy director for Plans within Plans and Policy Directorate, Joint Chiefs of Staff under Admiral Tom Moorer. Because of his radical about-face on the nuclear weapons issue, some of Fairbourn's comrades, including Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Admiral Moorer, who say the retired general has simply \\"jumped from the frying pan into the fire\\". Fairbourn was ordered for temporary duty as special assistant to the chief of staff, Headquarters Marine Corps in August 1967 and promptly retired on September 1, 1967, after 32 years of active service. Fairbourn later commented: Retirement Grave of William T.

A German tank, which was standing next to the Saardom, attracted American fire, which caused additional damage to the church: Vaults had partially collapsed, stones broken out, windows burst by explosion blasts. Grenades had torn large gaps in the front entrance. The vestibule with the figurine frieze and the crowning crucifixion group, the large rose window and the overlying arcade with the final triangular pediment were shot to pieces.Barbara Schwarz: Kriegstagebuch, hrsg. von der Dillinger Geschichtswerkstatt, Dillingen 1995.

It includes Todt Hill on Staten Island, which is the highest point along the Atlantic Seaboard south of Maine, at 410 feet above sea level. \\"Todt\\" is a Dutch word meaning \\"dead.\\" This hill perhaps received its name from the Dutch settlers because the hilltops overlooking The Narrows consisted of scattered treeless rocky exposures. The chemical character of the bedrock was, in part, the reason for this. Much of Staten Island is covered by the Harbor Hill moraine, the terminal moraine of the last Wisconsin Stage glacier. However, ledges of bedrock consisting of serpentinite are exposed throughout the upland areas on Staten Island. Grymes Hill, the second highest point on Staten Island and just a few miles from Todt Hill has similar bedrock characteristics. Serpentine, the dominant mineral in serpentinite, is rich in magnesium, an element that most plants cannot tolerate in high concentrations. The enrichment of magnesium in the thin serpentine soil covering the glacier-scoured hilltops is probably responsible for the original barren exposures on Todt Hill. The serpentinite has a bluish to greenish gray color, and consists of serpentine (mostly the variety antigorite), with accessory minerals of chrysotile (a form of asbestos), magnetite, and talc. Serpentinite is derived by the metamorphism of ultramafic rocks (rocks rich in the minerals olivine and pyroxene) in a water-rich environment. The probable original setting for these rocks was within the igneous crust beneath the Iapetus Ocean. The occurrence of serpentinite in the core of Staten Island is an indication that the allochthonous basement rocks consisting of oceanic crustal material were thrust landward onto the eastern margin of the continent during the Taconic orogeny. The occurrence of serpentinite is consistent with the interpretation that Staten Island is east of Cameron's Line.

It is their first single in six years. It was the first song released following singer Tim Lambesis' incarceration in 2013 and the first to feature Phil Sgrosso playing alongside Nick Hipa, Jordan Mancino and Josh Gilbert since Sgrosso's departure from Wovenwar in 2016. Background In 2013, Tim Lambesis was arrested for attempting to solicit a hitman to murder his wife. Upon the arrest, the rest of the band distanced themselves away from Lambesis both personally and professionally, going on to start the band Wovenwar with Oh, Sleeper vocalist Shane Blay. Wovenwar would go on to release two albums, Wovenwar and Honor Is Dead, before Sgrosso left in 2016 between tensions between himself and Nick Hipa stemming from coping with the public aftermath and fallout of Lambesis' arrest. In December 2016 Lambesis was released on probation after which he began reaching out to the members of the band to make amends and apologize in person. After several months of apprehension the band eventually all met up individually with Lambesis and all noted positive changes within his personality which led Sgrosso to reach out to Hipa and rekindle their friendship. In 2017 there were reports that Lambesis planned to restart As I Lay Dying with all new members which proved to be false. On June 7, 2018 the band released a music video with the song appearing on all streaming services the following day. The minimalist video featured the band playing on a white soundstage. On June 16, 2018, the band published a video on their YouTube channel detailing the terms of their reunion and suggesting that \\"My Own Grave\\" was the only new song the band wrote following reuniting. Reception The release of the song garnered polarizing reactions. Criticism was primarily targeted at Lambesis' arrest, subsequent release and the moral implications of supporting him considering his crime. Metal news and gossip website, MetalSucks, published an article stating that they will not be covering any future As I Lay Dying news with a few other publications voicing their support. Singer Jamey Jasta of Hatebreed explained on his podcast that he is reluctant to support Lambesis given the nature of the crime. The song itself however was very well received with critics and fans praising both the song and the band's return. The music video reached 1 million views on YouTube within a few days of release.

The event took place on September 30, 2018 at the Walter Pyramid in Long Beach, California. It was the fifth event produced by NJPW in the United States. Wrestlers from U.S. promotion Ring of Honor (ROH) - with which NJPW has a partnership - also appeared on the card. Production Background On July 6, 2018, NJPW announced their return to the United States to host two events in the state of California: Fighting Spirit Unleashed, in Long Beach, on September 30 and Lion's Break: Project 1, in Anaheim, on November 10 and 11. The event will be broadcast in the United States on AXS TV, airing October 5, 2018 on delay. As the usual AXS TV commentator Josh Barnett will be unable to attend the event, commentary will be provided by Jim Ross and his replacement Kevin Kelly. Worldwide, the event will be streamed live on NJPW's streaming service, NJPW World. On August 28, 2018, New Japan Pro-Wrestling announced several wrestlers for the event with soon-to-be-announced matches at Fighting Spirit Unleashed. Storylines Fighting Spirit Unleashed will feature eight to ten professional wrestling matches that will involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portray villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. On the final day of the G1 Climax, Cody pinned the IWGP United States Heavyweight Champion Juice Robinson and got the victory in a tag team match featuring he and Hangman Page versus Robinson and David Finlay. Afterwards he proceeded to challenge Robinson for his title, setting up the match for this event. At the G1 Special in San Francisco, Kenny Omega defeated Cody in a singles match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. It seemingly ended the civil war within their stable, Bullet Club, that had originated on the second day of The New Beginning in Sapporo. After the Young Bucks (Nick and Matt Jackson) stepped into the ring to congratulate Omega, the Guerrillas of Destiny (Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa) and their father King Haku appeared on the stage and turned on various other Bullet Club members, including Hangman Page, Marty Scurll, Yujiro Takahashi, Chase Owens and Cody, forming a new Bullet Club subgroup in the process: Bullet Club OG. On the final day of the G1 Climax, the Bullet Club OG (Tonga, Loa and Taiji Ishimori) defeated the Bullet Club Elite (Nick Jackson, Matt Jackson and Marty Scurll) to win the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. The Young Bucks will now defend the IWGP Tag Team Championship against the Guerrillas of Destiny. At the G1 Special in San Francisco, the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion Hiromu Takahashi injured his neck in a title defense against Dragon Lee. He was forced to relinquish the title, with a four-man tournament being announced to crown a new champion. Will Ospreay will face Marty Scurll in the second semifinal, with the winner advancing to the final to be held at King of Pro- Wrestling to face the winner of the first semifinal, Kushida or Bushi).\\"The Junior IWGP throne is vacant.

Medlicott worked at the Board of Trade for the first year of the Second World War before being selected by Sir Keith Hancock to be a member of the Cabinet Office Historical Section. Medlicott published the results of his research in his two-volume work The Economic Blockade. From 1945 to 1953 he was Professor of History at the University College of the South-West and in 1953 he was elected to the Stevenson Chair of International History at the University of London. Medlicott succeeded in transforming it into the largest and most successful department of its type in Britain. In his works he sought to interpret twentieth-century international relations in relation to strategic and economic factors. In 1968 he was appointed to deliver the Creighton Lecture, published a year later as Britain and Germany: The Search for an Agreement. He was also secretary and president of the Historical Association for six years and was prominent in the Royal Institute of International Affairs.

The letter was discovered \\"among a collection of Sallustian speeches and letters probably originally produced in the first or second centuries A.D\\". In the letter, Mithridates requests Parthian aid against the troops of Lucullus, and in a series of arguments, Mithridates asks the Parthians to join an alliance with Mithridates and Tigranes (king of Armenia), against the Romans. The letter, assigned to Sallust, is considered to be an important source on the Pontic‚ÄìParthian relations at the time. According to Prof. Dr. Marek Jan Olbrycht, the letter suggests \\"a genuine document found by the Romans in the personal archives of Mithridates\\". According to Dr. Eric Adler (associate professor), the composition of the letter by Sallust, is largely the result of his own invention. Adler states that \\"A few scholars have asserted that the EM (Epistula Mithridatis) owes its origin to a document culled from the archives of Mithridates, which Sallust somehow acquired and translated or adapted into Latin. Some claim that Pompey discovered this epistle in a secret archive after the Third Mithridatic War, and then presumably brought to Rome. Others have supposed that the EM is an expression of authentic Pontic propaganda, and thus based on arguments that are not Sallust's own. (...) We can be reasonably certain, then, that the EM is the creation of Sallust and is the product of a Roman historian's attempt to reconstruct the likely arguments of an anti-Roman Eastern king\\".

Igneous crystalline basement rock continued to emplace through the Proterozoic, interspersed with sediments and volcanic materials. Large limestone and shale deposits formed during the Paleozoic, during prevalent shallow marine conditions, followed by red beds during terrestrial conditions in the Triassic. The Western Interior Seaway flooded the region, creating vast shale, chalk and coal beds in the Cretaceous as the Laramide orogeny began to form the Rocky Mountains. The Black Hills were uplifted in the early Cenozoic, followed by long-running periods of erosion, sediment deposition and volcanic ash fall, forming the Badlands and storing marine and mammal fossils. Much of the state's landscape was reworked during several phases of glaciation in the Pleistocene. South Dakota has extensive mineral resources in the Black Hills and some oil and gas extraction in the Williston Basin. The Homestake Mine, active until 2002, was a major gold mine that reached up to 8000 feet underground and is now used for dark matter and neutrino research. Stratigraphy, tectonics and geologic history The oldest rocks in South Dakota date to the Archean eon of the Precambrian, over 2.5 billion years ago. The Archean crystalline basement rock formed with the intrusion of the Little Elk and Bear Mountain granites, with interceding periods of volcanic activity, mountain building and shale deposition. Marine sandstones and clays and deposited during the Proterozoic and the Harney Peak granite emplaced around 1.71 billion years ago. The Neoproterozoic was marked by a long period of erosion in the stratigraphic record. Paleozoic (541‚Äì251 million years ago) In the Cambrian, at the start of the Paleozoic in parallel with the rapid proliferation of multi-cellular life, terrestrial erosion continued in the region. The area was flooded during a large scale marine transgression in the Late Cambrian through the Ordovician, as limestone, sandstone and shale deposited. The Sioux quartzite was likely the only point of high topography, rising above a flat plain which was invaded with seawater. The Deadwood Formation formed during this period, exposed as a 400-foot thick unit in the walls of the Spearfish Canyon, ranging to 50 feet thick by Wind Cave. Cambrian rocks are only exposed in the Black Hills and disappear in boreholes drilled to the south of Wind Cave, beyond the ancient shoreline. However, the Deadwood Formation reaches a thickness of 700 feet in wells in the northwest. The Deadwood Formation is beach sand and gravel at its base, but as the ancient shoreline moved eastward, thin layers of mudstone and limestone formed in the west, in deeper waters. The formation contains trilobite fossils and tracks left by worms, exposed at low tide. Intraformational conglomerate is also common, resulting from fragments of limestone broken up in waves The Silurian and Devonian were marked by more carbonate deposition, particularly within the Williston Basin, east to central South Dakota. During the Mississippian period of the Carboniferous, widespread terrestrial erosion affected all but the north-central part of the state. Additional limestone deposits formed in the Early Mississippian. A marine environment prevailed in the Pennsylvanian, as sandstones, carbonates and evaporites deposited. Sea levels receded in the Permian, marked by erosion in the east and continued marine deposition in the west. Mesozoic (251‚Äì66 million years) Red beds formed throughout the west, during the Triassic, at the start of the Mesozoic. The region returned to terrestrial conditions in the Jurassic, with extensive erosion, and then returned to a shallow marine environment in the Cretaceous, depositing thick sequences of black Pierre shale‚Äîthe thickest and most widespread sedimentary unit in the state. Originally, the shale ranged between 2500 feet thick at the Wyoming line and only tens of feet thick in the east, although erosion stripped it away in the Black Hills. The Laramide orogeny began the uplift of the Rocky Mountains during the Cretaceous. West of the Missouri River, the Niobrara chalk formed in the inland sea during the Cretaceous, which contains mosasaur and plesiosaur bones. Tepee buttes form as small, conical hills in the Pierre shale landscape, from lenses of more erosion resistant limestone. Beach sand coal sequences left behind as the up to 200 feet thick Fox Hills Formation after the Western Interior Seaway began to recede, 15 million years after the Pierre shale first started to form. Low permeability shale yielded a poorly drained landscape, cut streams and rivers, which brought in large amounts of sediment‚Äîclay, silt and sand up to 500 feet thick‚Äîwhich deposited as the Hell Creek Formation. The formation contains thin lignite beds, triceratops and tyrannosaurus bones. Like many other locations around the world, South Dakota preserves the inch thick boundary clay, left by the asteroid impact of the K-Pg mass extinction 66 million years ago. Below the boundary clay, fossil pollen from large fields is common, but pollen is uncommon for a long period in the record afterward. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) Following the retreat of the Cretaceous inland sea, the Black Hills were uplifted, accompanied by igneous activity in the Paleocene at the start of the Cenozoic. The Pierre shale east of the Black Hills eroded into an undulating plain. The Ludlow Formation is up to 350 feet thick and in the northwest contains no obvious break in continental deposition at the time of the mass extinction, except for being sandier and less well-cemented. Further east, the formation contains the subsidiary Cannonball Formation, deposited during a brief resurgence of the inland sea and bearing fossil oysters, snails and clams. The 300 feet of sandstone and lignite of the Tongue River Formation overlies the Ludlow Formation, getting thicker to the east and holding some of the major coal deposits found in northern Wyoming. In the northwest, the Ludlow, Cannonball and Tongue River formations are categorized as the Fort Union Group, with thick sandstone layers source from the Rocky Mountains. Throughout the Eocene, the Black Hills eroded, shedding debris into the east, during a period with sub-tropical temperatures. Iron pyrite in shales oxidized, becoming bright red and yellow iron oxides. Sediments did not accumulate in the region until the end of the Eocene, as large streams carried material away to the ocean. Volcanic rocks from the Eocene preserve petrified trees. The Oligocene brought a shift in the climate to arid conditions, transforming the region into a vast alluvial desert plain. Up to 600 feet of sands and clays, buried the Black Hills within 2000 feet of their crests in western South Dakota, forming the White River Formation, while some erosion occurred in the east. Gravel deposits contain crocodile bones and land snails, tortoises and hackberry seeds are also common in the fossil record. Bird bones and even fossil duck eggs have been found in association with clams, snails and the remains of algal mats in temporary ponds. Since the 1800s, geologists have debated how to subdivide the White River Formation. The Chadron Formation is the lower unit, covering over the oxidizing Eocene erosion surface and reaching up to 180 feet thick. The thickness of the formation varies widely, where it fills into pre-existing valleys or blankets hills. It contains light- green bentonite clay, with a high shrink-swell capacity, as well as lenses of limestone containing snail, clam and algae remains from ponds. Titanotherium fossils and other large mammals have been found in the formation. Due to the high concentration of clay and the ease with which it erodes, the Chadron Formation tends to form gentle sloping hills and buttes. The overlying Brule Formation encompasses clay laid down by water, windblown sand, silt and volcanic ash, with a maximum thickness of up to 450 feet. Desert caliche soils are sometimes preserved as lime nodules and small clay buttes are often capped by well-cemented channel sands and gravels. The Brule Formation erodes into the jagged pinnacles of the Badlands. By the late 1990s, paleontologists had discovered 150 genera of mammals, ranging between rodents and rhinoceroses, as well as horses and camels. At the end of its five million year deposition, the formation was capped with the brilliantly white Rocky Ford ash, the windfall from powerful rhyolite eruptions in the Western Cascades in Oregon. Smaller volumes of light-colored sand and clay deposited in the Miocene, but the period came with a return to warm and wet conditions. Revitalized streams carried away large amounts of sediments, wiping out much of the White River Formation. Hundreds of feet of younger sediment cover the White River group in southwest South Dakota. Miocene sandstones, which often form cliffs, often overly the White River Formation. A period of erosion occurred in South Dakota during the Pliocene. Particularly in western South Dakota, the mobilization of coarse sediments formed the Ogallala aquifer. In the Pleistocene ice ages, South Dakota experienced multiple sequences of glaciation. The oldest glacial drift deposits are in the southeast, at Sioux Falls and Newton Hills, overlain by deeply weathered Illinoisan, or potentially pre-Illinoisan age material. A large expanse of till fills the James River lowland and beyond the Missouri River, with an uncertain age, often thought to be the Wisconsin glaciation. The Brookings till plain is a belt of heavily weathered ground moraine, running through Brookings. Dating to the Illinoisan, it escaped burial by the Wisconsin ice sheet. A narrow strip in the central Prairie Hills holds the Toronto till plain, the oldest definitively Wisconsin drift, while the Bemis stage on the eastern edge of the hills formed a belt of moraines. Although the ice did not advance east of the Prairie Hills, it left a remaining moraine ridge, known as the Altamont stage, which encroaches the western side of the hills. Late in the Wisconsin, the ice sheet divided at the Prairie Hills, extending the Des Moines lobe to the east and a western lobe along the James River valley. A final advance of the glacier, known as the Big Stone stage, traced the Minnesota River lowland in the northeast. Natural resource geology The Black Hills were extensively explored and periodically mined for silver, gold, mica, tungsten, feldspar, bentonite, beryl, lead, zinc, uranium, lithium and sand, as well as oil, beginning in the 1870s. The Homestake Mining Company, which managed the Homestake Mine until its closure in 2002, merged the Deadwood, Golden Terra, Father DeSmet and Caledonia gold mines around 1900. Its employees used emerging pneumatic drill technology and cyanide processing, creating the Ross Shaft and Yates Shaft‚Äîboth 5000 feet deep‚Äîby 1941. Mine activity was suspended during World War II and resumed. By the mine's centennial in 1976, it was 8000 feet deep and had produced 31 million ounces of gold, seven million ounces of silver and 115 million tons of milled ore. After its closure, the location was deemed a Superfund site, although the shafts are now reused for the Sanford Underground Research Facility, the largest underground laboratory in the US, used for dark matter and neutrino research. Southwest of Lead, South Dakota, there is still an active open pit gold mine, run by Goldcorp. South Dakota has oil and gas production in the Williston Basin in the northwest, although it produces only one percent of the US total, primarily from traditional vertical wells. One hundred wells produce 1.6 million gallons of oil annually. Almost all production is centered in a 400 square mile area within Harding County, relying on the Red River Formation.

His term as mayor was controversial due to his methods of dealing with crime and illegal drugs in the city. On July 2, 2018, he was killed during a ceremony after being shot through the chest by an unknown gunman. Business career Prior to pursuing a political career, Antonio Halili was a businessman. He established ANC Halili Group of Companies (ANC HGC), a fully Filipino-owned conglomerate with subsidiaries participating involved in the real Estate, information technology, and private emission & drug industries. ANC HGC runs 60 emission testing centers in Luzon alone. Political career Mayor of Tanauan Halili became mayor of Tanauan, a city in the province of Batangas in the Philippines, in 2013. During his term as Mayor, he gained notoriety for his treatment of suspected criminals, namely those involved in drug-related crimes. In 2016, Halili became the center of newfound attention after he ordered drug suspects to be paraded around the city, in a campaign that was dubbed the ‚Äòwalk of shame‚Äô. Suspected criminals were forced to wear cardboard signs that read, ‚ÄúI'm a pusher, don't emulate me‚Äù. His campaign was criticized by human rights groups and other politicians. Later on in his term, Halili himself would be accused of having drug related ties, an accusation he denied. In October 2017, he had his supervisory powers over the local police stripped from him. Assassination On July 2, 2018, during a flag raising ceremony, Halili was shot by an unidentified sniper. The bullet hit a mobile phone in Halili‚Äôs pocket and pierced his chest. Halili‚Äôs bodyguards fired back towards a hill where the bullet appeared to have come from. The police searched the hill but failed to find anyone. Bystanders were shocked, and began panicking and taking cover. Halili was driven to the Reyes Memorial Hospital and was declared dead less than an hour after the bullet was fired. Philippine National Police Chief Director General Oscar Albayalde said that a regional special task group had been convened to investigate the killing, and was considering the suspect parades a motive. One day later, another Philippine mayor, Ferdinand Bote of General Tinio, Nueva Ecija, was also shot.

Career Ed began in the newsroom of WEDR in Birmingham, Ala at the first black-programmed radio station (white-owned) which had problems with the KKK in 1949. The locals kept taking down the broadcast antenna to deter broadcasting. Program director Shelly (the Playboy) Stewart felt that ‚Äòmass‚Äô communication came before ‚Äòclass‚Äô and stuck with the R & B format, which gained traction in the black community. Unlike other negro themed stations at the time, the voices heard did not sound like typical radio (read: white) announcers, but had the deeper voices that would come to dominate the speaking stream with the advent of Black appeal radio. Castleberry was one deep voice that became associated with the format and the station's mail began to reflect that popularity in 1950.Black Radio ...

The Austro-Russian army successfully captured the Gotthard Pass after stiff fighting on the first day. Suvorov's main body was assisted by a Russian flanking column led by Lieutenant General Andrei Rosenberg and a smaller Austrian flanking column under General-major Franz Xaver von Auffenberg. The next day, Suvorov's army fought its way north along the upper Reuss River valley past the Teufelsbr√ºcke (Devil's Bridge) in Sch√∂llenen Gorge. By 26 September the army reached Altdorf near Lake Lucerne. Suvorov's offensive was part of a misbegotten Allied strategy that planned to unite the Russian armies of Suvorov and Lieutenant General Alexander Korsakov near Zurich. Together with Austrian and Swiss forces led by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze, they would sweep General of Division Andr√© Mass√©na's French Army of Helvetia from Switzerland. However, on 25‚Äì26 September, Mass√©na drubbed Korsakov in the Second Battle of Zurich and General of Division Jean-de-Dieu Soult defeated Hotze in the Battle of Linth River. Two smaller Austrian columns were also turned back by French forces. Instead of advancing to help Allied forces, Suvorov's army was marching into a mountainous country controlled by French troops. Background New strategy On 15 August 1799 at the Battle of Novi, the Austro-Russian army commanded by Field Marshal Suvorov defeated a French army led by General of Division Barth√©lemy Catherine Joubert, who was killed. Aside from capturing the fortress of Tortona from the French on 11 September, Suvorov did not exploit his victory. He blamed the Austrians for not providing enough wagons and food, but in fact the Allied army had suffered serious losses at Novi. The Austrians alone sustained 6,050 casualties, while the Russians lost at least 1,880 and possibly as many as 2,700. Soon there were reports that Lecourbe had captured the Gotthard Pass to the north. Suvorov sent some troops in that direction, but they returned after it was determined that the French did not intend to follow up their success. In mid-1799, Allied strategists made a monumental strategic miscalculation. William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville was the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs serving with Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. Grenville authored a scheme in which Korsakov with 45,000 Russians would be joined in Switzerland by Suvorov and 20,000 Russians advancing north from Italy. Suvorov would take command of the combined army and drive Mass√©na's French army from western Switzerland. In a second impulse, Suvorov would invade Franche-Comt√©, an area of France sparsely defended by frontier fortresses. Once Korsakov was securely in position in central Switzerland, Feldzeugmeister Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen would march his 60,000 troops north into Germany, leaving 18,000 Austrians under Hotze to cooperate with the Russians. Charles would thrust across the lower Rhine from southern Germany into France while a second Austrian army under General der Kavallerie Michael von Melas would invade Savoy from Italy. On the North Sea coast, an Anglo-Russian army would land in the Batavian Republic, a French satellite. Meanwhile, British agent William Wickham would raise an army of 20,000 pro- Allied Swiss troops. On 8 June 1799, the plan was sent to Emperor Paul I of Russia, who approved it. Emperor Francis and his foreign minister Johann Amadeus von Thugut accepted the plan because it came to them from Emperor Paul and it was a convenient reason to get Suvorov out of Italy. Cracks were appearing in the alliance as Russia and Austria became mistrustful of each other's war aims. Grenville's plan was revealed to Archduke Charles on 7 August. Anxious about Korsakov's Russians, Charles stated, \\"I don't know how they will manage, especially if we take ourselves off any distance\\". Korsakov was alarmed when the plan was disclosed to him on 12 August. The Russian general remarked that he had 28,000 fit troops rather than the 45,000 presumed by the strategists. On 25 August Suvorov received his orders from Emperor Francis to take his army into Switzerland. The Russian commander requested a two-month delay, but Francis demanded that Suvorov move immediately. Thugut also insisted that Charles take his army out of Switzerland at once. Hotze underestimated Massena's numbers at 60,000 French and Swiss troops; in fact, there were 76,000. The Army of Cond√© with 6,000 French Royalists was on the march from Russia but would not be available until 1 October. Wickham was only able to recruit 2,000 Swiss soldiers. Historian Christopher Duffy judged that the \\"strategy foundered on crucial issues of numbers, geography, direction and timing\\". Bad timing proved fatal to the enterprise. Charles left Switzerland too early and Suvorov arrived in Switzerland too late. This left Korsakov and Hotze in a vulnerable position to face Mass√©na's French army. Plans Alexander Suvorov In early September, the Allied generals began planning to implement their governments' strategy. At that time, Korsakov's 28,000 Russians held Z√ºrich and the east bank of the Limmat and Aare Rivers as far as the Rhine River. Hotze's command was split into two divisions. He personally accompanied 8,000 troops along the lower Linth between Lake Zurich and the Walensee. The second 10,000-man division under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Friedrich von Linkin was farther south and east. Linkin's command was split into three brigades under General-majors Franz Jellacic, Joseph Anton von Simbschen, and Franz Xaver von Auffenberg. According to Duffy, Jellacic with 4,500 soldiers held Sargans, Simbschen with 3,500 troops was along the Vorderrhein valley, and Auffenburg with 2,000 was at Disentis. Linkin accompanied Simbschen's brigade and Auffenburg was detailed to help Suvorov. Colonel Gottfried von Strauch led a 4,570-man Austrian brigade that was at the foot of the Gotthard Pass. This brigade belonged to Karl Joseph Hadik von Futak's corps from the Allied Army of Italy. Historian Ramsay Weston Phipps credited Strauch with 6,000 soldiers and Auffenberg with 3,180 men. On 24 September 1799 in the Battle of Gotthard Pass, Suvorov's main body attacked from Airolo toward Hospental while Rosenberg's corps advanced west from Disentis toward Andermatt. Auffenberg's brigade moved north from Disentis into the Charstelenbach valley to threaten Amsteg. There were several routes that Suvorov's army could take to intervene in Switzerland. Farthest east was the route past Lake Como and over the Maloja Pass, though it involved a large detour. The next route farther west was over the Spl√ºgen Pass at elevation. Both of these routes could accommodate wagons and cannons. The route farthest to the west was across the Simplon Pass. The good road over it was not built until 1805. Suvorov decided to take the Gotthard Pass because it offered a well-known and direct route to a rendezvous with Korsakov and Hotze. The pass had a pack road which could be used by a mule train, but wagons and medium cannons were out of the question. The Gotthard Pass was known to be occupied by the French and it appealed to \\"Suvorov's instinct for direct action\\". The Allies hoped to assault the Gotthard Pass as early as 19 September. The Allied plan included the accumulation of ten days of food and 1,429 mules at Bellinzona by the Austrians. But even these would only provide Suvorov's army a few days of supplies. Suvorov counted on Korsakov and Hotze amassing supplies for his troops in Switzerland. For the expedition, Suvorov took Lieutenant Colonel Franz von Weyrother as his chief of staff as well as eight additional Austrian staff officers. On 7 September, the Russians prepared for their march to the Gotthard Pass. A French sortie delayed the Russians for a few days, but they soon began a force march that took them as far as Taverne on 15 September. The Austrians managed to gather the required number of mules, but someone failed to send sufficient funds to pay the muleteers and another officer mistakenly held up a mule train at Pavia. Without pay, the muleteers deserted with their animals so that there were only 340 mules collected at Bellinzona. After days of enforced idleness, Suvorov accepted Grand Duke Constantine's idea to dismount 1,500 of his Cossacks and use their horses as pack animals. This was a difficult choice because the Cossacks' mounts were their own property, not army issue. Suvorov organized his army into two corps under Generals Wilhelm Derfelden and Andrei Rosenberg. Derfelden's 8,591-man corps consisted of General-major Pyotr Bagration's Advance Guard (2,394), Lieutenant General Yakov Ivanovich Povalo-Schveikovsky's infantry division (4,360), and 1,837 Cossacks. Rosenberg's 10,901-man corps included General- major Mikhail Miloradovich's infantry division (5,339), Lieutenant General Ivan Ivanovich F√∂rster's infantry division (2,982), the Kashkin J√§ger Regiment (697), and 1,883 Cossacks. For the assault on the Gotthard Pass, F√∂rster's division would temporarily act with Derfelden's corps. The artillery was armed with 25 Piedmontese light 2-pounder cannons. Unable to traverse the Gotthard Pass, the Russian artillery convoy took the Maloja Pass route according to Duffy or the Spl√ºgen Pass according to Phipps. On 19 September, Rosenberg's corps left Taverne for Bellinzona. On 21 September, these troops turned right into the Blenio Valley at Biasca. Rosenberg's troops crossed the Lukmanier Pass on 23 September and reached Disentis in the Vorderrhein valley. The troops marched in heavy rain and a number of both men and horses were killed in falls when crossing the pass. Rosenberg's column numbered 6,000 troops and 10 light cannons. Derfelden's corps left Bellinzona on 22 September amid heavy rains, after having started from Taverne the previous day. At Biasca, the column continued up the Ticino valley and by the evening of 23 September reached the town of Faido. Strauch's Austrians joined Derfelden's column along the way. Battle 24 September The photo shows Airolo and the Ticino valley at the foot of Gotthard Pass. The hamlet of Cima del Bosco is just beyond the hairpin curve. Lecourbe's division consisted of three brigades under Generals of Brigade Charles-√âtienne Gudin de La Sablonni√®re, Louis Henri Loison, and Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor. By Duffy's reckoning, Gudin's brigade numbered 3,801 men and consisted of the 67th and 109th Line Infantry Demi- brigades and three grenadier companies. Loison's brigade was 2,980-strong and was made up of the 38th and 76th Line Infantry Demi-brigades. Lecourbe was in Altdorf at the northern end of the upper Reuss valley with the 720-man divisional reserve of nine grenadier companies. Molitor's brigade was far to the east near Glarus on the upper Linth River. The 67th Line defended the Gotthard Pass, the 109th Line held the Oberalp Pass and the village of Andermatt, and Loison's brigade was posted near Amsteg in the center of the upper Reuss valley. Phipps credited Gudin with 4,294 soldiers and Loison with 4,366 men. Claude Lecourbe Massena ordered Lecourbe to advance east on 25 September as part of a general offensive against the Allies. Suvorov was about to assault Lecourbe from the south, catching his opponent off-balance. As early as 5 September, rumors reached the French that Suvorov was coming north with 25,000 troops, but Lecourbe discounted the stories. His patrols detected Strauch's Austrians in the Ticino valley and from 20 September there were even reports of Russian soldiers nearby. Lecourbe put Gudin's brigade on alert, but did not budge from his headquarters in Altdorf. In previous campaigns, Lecourbe proved himself a capable general in mountain fighting, but this time he found himself poorly prepared for Suvorov's impending attack. Suvorov's plan of attack for 24 September called for the main effort by Derfelden's Russians and Strauch's Austrians against the Gotthard Pass. This thrust would be assisted by a right-hook by Rosenberg's Russians across the Oberalp Pass that would seize Andermatt north of the Gotthard. Auffenberg's Austrians would make a deeper right hook and block the upper Reuss valley at Amsteg. The 67th Line with 1,861 soldiers was divided into three groupings, at Airolo, at the hamlet of Cima del Bosco near the entrance to the Val Tremola, and at the pass itself. The attackers must climb from Airolo to the pass. This hike might take an unencumbered person two and a half hours, but the Russians and Austrians would have to carry a musket, ammunition, battle gear, and full haversack with French firearms blazing in their faces. The advance to the foot of the Gotthard Pass fell badly behind schedule so that the attack did not start until 2:00 pm. The French quickly abandoned Airolo and established themselves in improvised defenses on the slopes above. For the assault on the Gotthard, Suvorov split the main body into three columns. The right column consisted of Bagration's advance guard followed by Schveikovsky's division. It climbed the right side of the valley, aiming for Cima del Bosco. Bagration's orders called for detaching four battalions over the mountain to gain the pass by a flanking move. The center column was made up of F√∂rster's division and two battalions of the Austrian Wallis Infantry Regiment. It advanced directly up the Val Tremola. The left column was formed from the Russian Veletsky Infantry Regiment and the remainder of Strauch's Austrian brigade. Its assignment was to block the valley leading west to prevent any interference from French troops under General of Division Louis Marie Turreau. The modern road zig-zags up the Val Tremola toward the Gotthard Pass. The assault ran into fierce French resistance at once. The 250 Russian J√§gers forming the apex of the attack lost 150 men as casualties. Schveikovsky's division inexplicably veered downhill into the valley and the Russian attack stalled. Seeing his soldiers falter, Suvorov lay down in a ditch and asked to be buried. He announced, \\"You are no longer my children, and I am no longer your father. There is nothing left to me but to die.\\" The nearby Rosenberg Grenadiers rallied and insisted on continuing the attack. The story was denied by some, but it was just the sort of theatrics that Suvorov often used to inspire his troops. Strauch's brigade was recalled from the valley and sent uphill to give greater weight to the assault. The French finally abandoned Cima del Bosco and withdrew in good order up the Val Tremola. The French defenders waited behind cover until their attackers got close before emptying their muskets and falling back to the next position. The Allies finally fought their way to the top of the pass only to face the strongest defenses. Fortunately for the Allies, General-major Mikhail Semenovich Baranovsky with the Miller J√§gers and Baranovsky Musketeers appeared above the pass, having scaled the steep slopes to the east. Fearing capture, the French quickly evacuated their positions and retreated to the north. The bitter fighting cost the Allies 1,200 casualties. That day, Rosenberg's corps and Auffenberg's brigade marched from Disentis at dawn, heading west. The Austrians soon turned north to cross over the mountains and reach the Maderanertal, an alpine valley which led west to Amsteg. For the crossing, Auffenberg's brigade split into three separate columns, of which the middle one crossed the Chr√ºzli Pass. One battalion of the 109th Line defended the Oberalp Pass, with its main defense on the north side of the Oberalp Lake. Rosenberg sent the Mansurov Musketeers looping to the right. Miloradovich led the Kashkin J√§gers to the left on a steep climb along the south side of the lake. Three regiments under Lieutenant General Maksim Vladimirovich Rehbinder made the main push in the center. Badly outnumbered, the French conducted a fighting retreat so that Rosenberg's troops did not reach Andermatt until the evening. The Russians claimed to have killed 180 Frenchmen and captured 41 at the cost of 150 killed and badly wounded. The 109th Line evacuated Andermatt and retreated southwest to Hospental. That evening, Russian J√§gers and Cossacks pursued the French across Gotthard Pass and down into the valley on the other side. At 9:00 pm, the Russians occupied Hospental. In the dark outside the village, Gudin assembled the 67th and 109th Line. He briefly sent his grenadiers against Hospental, but the Russians quickly pushed them back. With his retreat route to the north blocked by Rosenberg's troops, Gudin's only escape route led southwest toward Furka Pass. First, he bombarded the Russians with his two cannons and one howitzer before abandoning the guns and setting out for the Furka. Suvorov sent the Veletsky and Tyrtov Musketeers to follow Gudin until he was out of the area. It was important for Gudin to block the Furka and Grimsel Passes, but the move took his brigade out of the next two days' battle. Suvorov left Strauch's Austrians to defend the Gotthard and the valley at its base. 25 September Nikolay Kamensky Suvorov's troops set out from Hospental at 6:00 am, heading north toward Andermatt where they met Rosenberg's corps. A short distance north of Andermatt was the Sch√∂llenen Gorge, a canyon so narrow that if the French had been present in sufficient strength, they might have held their ground indefinitely. One feature of the gorge was the Urnerloch, where in 1707, the Swiss dug a tunnel long and wide. The road from Andermatt led through the Urnerloch to the Teufelsbr√ºcke (Devil's Bridge), built in 1595, which spanned the deep gorge. At 9:00 pm on 24 September, unaware that the Gotthard had already fallen, Lecourbe wrote a letter to Mass√©na, \\"I have just heard that the enemy are attacking us at Airolo. I imagine it is no more than a reconnaissance.\\" He soon learned the truth. Leaving Altdorf the next day at 7:00 am, he arrived at the Devil's Bridge two hours later, where the battle was in progress. Painting by J. M. W. Turner shows the Devil's Bridge in 1803‚Äì1804. In order to seize the Devil's Bridge, one battalion of the Rehbinder Musketeers under Colonel Vasily Ivanovich Svishchov and 200 men from the Kashkin J√§gers crossed to the west side of the gorge and climbed the B√§xberg heights to reach a path that led to the Devil's Bridge. General-major Nikolay Kamensky led the two battalions of the Kamensky Musketeers up the slope farther south, then followed the contour to come in on Svishchov's left. Finally, Colonel Iosif Petrovich Trubnikov took 300 men from the Mansurov Musketeers up the N√§tschen Mountain on the right. General-major Mansurov led the remainder of the Mansorov and Rehbinder Musketeers directly against the Urnerloch, chasing the French skirmishers through the tunnel. The French blasted the Russians emerging from the tunnel with canister shot from a 4-pound cannon near the bridge. At 11:00 am, Lecourbe received warning that an enemy column was menacing Amsteg in his rear; it was Auffenberg's Austrians. The French general announced, \\"This body comes from Disentis. We must attack it. It is the left wing of Hotze. We are cut.\\" On 24 September, Auffenberg's brigade made a very strenuous hike across the mountains. One of his columns did not make it to the rendezvous by the evening, so the Austrian general decided to wait until the next day to move against Amsteg. The next morning, Auffenberg's men worked their way down the Maderanertal unopposed until within a half-hour march of Amsteg, when they bumped into two companies of the 38th Line. Amid the rocky course of the Charstelenbach stream, the French held up the Austrians for four hours. Finally, the Austrian infantry seized the bridge across the Charstelenbach. Auffenberg occupied Amsteg with two battalions and posted the other two battalions on the lower slopes of the Bristen Mountain, south of the stream. Auffenberg only partly damaged the bridge probably because he wanted to slow down the French when they retreated his way, but did not want to keep Suvorov from repairing it when the Russians arrived. Once alerted to Auffenberg's threat to his rear, Lecourbe took 1,600 soldiers back to Amsteg. This detachment fatally weakened Loison's position at Devil's Bridge. The first French troops to appear near Amsteg were one battalion of the 76th Line and the grenadier reserve. They attacked the Austrians on Bristen Mountain. Unable to dislodge them, the French crossed the bridge and cleared the Austrians out of Amsteg with the help of the two companies of the 38th Line. Soon, the French were joined by two battalions of the 38th Line retreating from the Devil's Bridge. Auffenberg's brigade lost 18 killed, 56 wounded, and 155 captured on 25 September. At Sch√∂llenen Gorge, Svishchov's men on the west bank drove back the French to the bridge. At this, the French on the east bank rolled the 4-pounder into the gorge and fell back across the bridge. Farther down the west bank, the French demolished part of the roadway and this held up the Russian advance until a passage could be improvised. Kamensky pressed the pursuit so that some French troops of the 76th Line were forced to retreat west from G√∂schenen into the mountains. The Russian pursuit ended at nightfall when the soldiers went into bivouac south of Amsteg. That evening Lecourbe burned the Amsteg bridge and retreated north to Seedorf. The elaborate Allied strategy was wrecked on 25 September 1799. On that day, Massena attacked Korsakov in the Second Battle of Zurich and drove the Russians back into the city. That evening Korsakov found that his ally Hotze was dead and his force beaten in the Battle of Linth River by Jean-de-Dieu Soult's division. Korsakov and his generals appear to have \\"lost their heads\\" when they decided to break out of Z√ºrich the next day and make for Eglisau on the Rhine. Suvorov had ordered Korsakov and Hotze to \\"stand like a wall\\", but Korsakov and Hotze's successor Franz Petrasch rapidly retreated to the north, ending near Lake Constance. The abandonment of the area would allow Mass√©na to turn against Suvorov. 26 September Andrei Rosenberg Suvorov's leading units under Miloradovich joined Auffenberg's troops at Bristen Mountain at 6:00 am on 26 September. The battalion of the 76th Line that formed the French rearguard was unable to hold back the Allies who crossed the remnants of the Charstelenbach bridge at Amsteg. There was another skirmish in front of Altdorf before the French retreated to Seedorf on the west bank, covered by an attack from a column of grenadiers. Lecourbe worried that Suvorov's soldiers might break out of the upper Reuss valley to the west in an attempt to reach Lucerne. Therefore, he tried to keep the Allies confined to the east bank of the Reuss. He maintained two cannons in a small redoubt on the east bank near Seedorf. Lecourbe posted the 2nd Battalion of the 38th Line at Erstfeld and burned the bridge there and at Attinghausen. He even sent Loison with some troops west across the Surenen Pass to Engelberg. The Austrian Gradiscaner Grenz Infantry were ordered to cross the Reuss at Erstfeld but they found it impossible. Rosenberg and Auffenberg entered Altdorf around noon where they pulled down the French flag - the \\"Tricolor of Liberty\\". Suvorov himself reached Altdorf at 6:00 pm where he was blessed by the priest. That night he slept in one of the few buildings in the town that survived a conflagration in April. Since leaving Taverne, the Russian army had marched a distance of in five days across extremely difficult terrain. Suvorov had every right to take pride in his achievement so far, but the Russian logistical arrangements were starting to break down. A depot of flour found at Andermatt was used up by Rosenberg's corps within one day and the all food stored at Altdorf was eaten by two battalions. The famished Russian soldiers were seen trying to chew on discarded animal skins. An attempt to requisition food in the neighborhood rounded up only 15 cattle. Suvorov determined to turn east from Altdorf up the Sch√§chental and then north across the Kinzig Pass to Schwyz via Muotathal. He hoped that he would find a supply depot at Schwyz set up by Korsakov and Hotze. Jellacic's Austrian column left Sargans on 24 September and marched south of the Walensee to seize Mollis. The following day, his troops tried without success to dislodge Molitor's brigade on the upper Linth River. On 26 September, Molitor launched a determined counterattack on Jellacic. When he found out about Hotze's defeat, Jellacic began a retreat which ended at Bad Ragaz in the Rhine valley. Meanwhile, Linkin's Austrians crossed the Panix Pass into the Sernftal and captured Schwanden on 26 September. Hearing of this second incursion, Molitor suspended his pursuit of Jellacic and hurried to deal with Linkin. Thus, the forces that Suvorov counted on to help him were being eliminated one by one. For his part, Mass√©na received a report from Lecourbe on 26 September that Suvorov captured the Gotthard Pass and would soon be at Altdorf. He immediately ordered General of Division √âdouard Mortier to march to Schwyz with 7,800 soldiers and Soult's division to block the Linth valley. Aftermath In the operations from 24‚Äì27 September 1799, the French and Allies forces each sustained losses of 2,000 killed, wounded, and missing. In addition, the French lost 10 guns when they were thrown into the Reuss River to prevent capture. On 27 September, Suvorov's army began crossing the Kinzig Pass to Muotathal where Bagration's advance guard wiped out a company of the 38th Line. Rosenberg's corps stayed in the upper Reuss valley to protect the train of mules and Cossack horses that were carrying the supplies. To keep the French off balance, Rosenberg mounted a feint against Erstfeld. At 5:00 pm that day, Lecourbe attacked Altdorf with seven companies, driving out the Fertsch Musketeers. Rosenberg soon counterattacked with the Tyrtov and Mansurov Musketeers, evicting the French from the town and clearing them from the east bank of the Reuss. On 28 September, Rosenberg's corps began crossing the Kinzig Pass in rain and snow while his rearguard under F√∂rster held the Sch√§chental behind him. Early on 28 September, 300 Cossacks led by an Austrian staff officer were sent from Muotathal up the Pragel Pass on a reconnaissance. They encountered a French outpost and the Austrian captain demanded its surrender. To his amazement the French replied that the Cossacks ought to surrender since Mass√©na had won a great victory and captured 20,000 Allied troops. Back in Muotathal, other disturbing reports were coming in and it was soon clear that Suvorov's army was marooned in Switzerland amid a victorious French army.

He was the second son of Tilemann Heshusius and Hanna von Bert, two well-educated and influential German Lutherans from Wesel on the lower Rhine.  Early life and education  Heinrich was born in 1556, raised in the household of an important Lutheran clergyman, and he was strongly influenced by his father's itinerant movements and polemical struggles with Reformed (Calvinist) churchmen and Roman Catholic opponents. Heinrich eventually followed his father into Lutheran schools and the ministry, and became well-connected in Gnesio-Lutheran clergy networks in North Germany. In 1594, Heshusius earned a doctoral degree in theology from the University of Rostock, which was paid for by the Hildesheim town council. Heshusius worked for a period of up to ten years with his father as a philosophy (liberal arts) professor at the University of Helmstedt, where he served as an instructor and a private tutor for bachelor of arts students headed into the ministry or government service.  Ministry  In 1591, Heshusius took his first permanent pastoral assignment in Tonna, near Erfurt, and served the community as a pastor and superintendent. In Tonna, Heshusius had a close relationship with the counts of Gleichen and the Ernestine rulers of Electoral Saxony, and he founded a school there at the behest of a local countess. He also began a successful publishing career, printing many sermons and an innovative catechism based on the Psalms that would become influential in Lutheran circles. In 1593, Heshusius was transferred to Hildesheim by Polycarp Leyser, when Nicholas Selnecker vacated the post, and Heshusius became the lead pastor at St. Andreas Church, as well as superintendent of the city's Lutheran churches. Heshusius became a significant leader in Lutheran circles, corresponding with peers and mentors throughout the region, and working closely with civic leaders in Hildesheim. Along with the town council, Heshusius supported the Formula of Concord. He used his new platform to publish catechetical sermons, devotional books, and a municipal report with conspicuous polemic. Most of these publications sought to protect the Lutheran community from what Heshusius perceived as the inroads of confessional rivals in the region such as Calvinists, Jesuits, Anabaptists, and Jews. His rhetoric has been studied as an aspect of late-Reformation confessionalization in the German lands. In the mid-1590s, Heshusius attacked the levirate marriage of Jews in his community, and he worked aggressively to expel thirteen Jewish families from Hildesheim. Heshusius also tried to expel Jesuit leaders from the city, who were forming a Latin school and reviving the historic Roman Catholic cathedral, but these efforts were also unsuccessful. Heshusius's masterwork, a two-volume catechetical sermon collection entitled Psalmocatechesis, was published in 1594. It was based on the content and pedagogy of Luther's Small Catechism and the Psalms, and it became influential in the developing genre of Lutheran catechetical preaching.  Death  In 1597, Heinrich Heshusius died of the plague in Hildesheim with his wife Gesa and the couple's four children.  Legacy  Heinrich Heshusius contributed to the consolidation of German Lutheranism in the age of early Lutheran orthodoxy. His catechetical works and preaching influenced a generation of Lutheran churchmen. Church historian Joachim Lauenstein wrote that had Heshusius not died prematurely at 41, the brilliant theologian would have been among the greatest Lutheran reformers in the region.

It is found in all states and territories of Australia with the exception of Tasmania. Description Chenopodium spinescens is a multi-stemmed dense shrub to high, with branches often ending in spines. The leaves are alternate or opposite, and mealy, looking grey green to almost whitish from their covering of saucer- shaped/spherical hairs. The leaf shape is ovate to triangular, and are long and wide. The leaf petiole is about half the length of the lamina. Male and female flowers are usually on different plants. The flowers have five perianth segments that are tiny and all alike, and five stamens. The ripe fruit are red and succulent. The inflorescence is a panicle or spike, with the flowers' perianth being densely mealy on the outside. The male flowers are globular and 0.5‚Äì1 mm in diameter, with their filaments united into a smooth saucer-shaped disc. The female flowers are larger (about 1 mm) and globular to top-shaped. The fruit is a depressed globular pink or red succulent berry, and the seed is approximately in diameter with a reticulate coat. In the Northern Territory, it flowers and fruits from February to December, while in Victoria, it flowers from January to April. Differences from closely related species > Rhagodia spinescens differs from R. parabolica, in having smaller leaves > (mostly 5-17 mm long, cf. mostly 15-30 mm long), a narrower inflorescence > and a preference for non-rocky sites. It differs from R. eremaea in having > leaves that are alternate or opposite (cf. consistently alternate), often > spade-shaped, equal length and width or slightly longer than wide (cf. > distinctly long relative to their width), with round saucer-like vesicles on > the undersurface (cf. irregular-shaped vesicles) and have a fishy or foetid > odour. Taxonomy Chenopodium spinescens was first formally described Robert Brown in 1810 as Rhagodia spinescens and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. In 2012, Susy Fuentes Baz√°n and Thomas Borsch moved all species of Rhagodia to Chenopodium within the broader family, Amaranthaceae. a change accepted by Govaerts, et al. However, the assignation of this plant to the genus, Rhagodia, and to the family, Chenopodiaceae, is the taxonomy accepted by the Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria (CHAH), Habitat In the Northern Territory, it occurs on sandplains, alluvial plains, intermittent sandy watercourses, on sandy edges of salt lakes, and rarely on gravelly hillslopes. In Victoria, it is usually found on heavy, saline or subsaline soils at the edges of lakes, on flats, and in dune swales. Distribution It is found in the IBRA bioregions of Burt Plain, Central Ranges, Channel Country, Coolgardie, Finke, Flinders Lofty Block, Gawler, Great Sandy Desert, Great Victoria Desert, MacDonnell Ranges, Mitchell Grass Downs, Nullarbor, Riverina, Simpson Strzelecki Dunefields, Stony Plains, and Tanami. (Bioregions from Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales may not be included.) Propagation The advice for propagation is to take soft, current season growth tips from actively growing plants; store and transport wrapped in wet newspaper and sealed in a plastic bag, and plant after trimming cuttings to a length of and dipping in 3000 ppm IBA rooting hormone.

The Galperine brothers wrote the music for the 2017 film Loveless after hearing a synopsis of the story, but not seeing the film or reading the screenplay. Evgueni Galperine said the piece \\"11 Cycles of E\\" was written as an interpretation of a parent's thoughts, with the parent only being able to think about how a missing child must be found. Critic David Ehrlich named Evgueni and Sacha Galperine's score as the ninth best cinematic soundtrack of 2017, particularly praising \\"11 Cycles of E\\" as \\"striking\\".

In addition to original written content, the site produces podcasts, videos, original webcomics, and covers news related to politics, gaming, movies, television, and music. ComicsVerse uses comics to address social issues including minority representation in popular culture and politics. The website is minority owned and operated and has 78% women in upper management positions.  History  Founded in 2012 by Justin Alba, ComicsVerse was incorporated in 2016. Alba and colleague, current Assistant Editor at Marvel, Kathleen Wisneski, co-organized the ComicsVerse podcast alongside the site following a class at Columbia University in 2012 entitled ‚ÄúComic Books and Graphic Novels as Literature.‚Äù In his Open Letter, Alba writes that ‚Äúcomics saved my life‚Äù by teaching him how to cope with severe bullying and develop self-confidence. Alba notes that ComicsVerse's goal is to ‚Äúhelp people like me who went through challenging and turbulent times‚Äù by engaging in a community of comics fans and creators. ComicsVerse immediately treated comics as an art form, rejecting the tendency in academia to dismiss comics as anti-literary. Since its inception, ComicsVerse has expanded its discussion of mainstream comics like Marvel and DC to include comics from smaller and independent publishers, as well as comics-related television and film, and politics and culture outside of comics. ComicsVerse also features a Special Edition series on New York Comic Convention, focusing on creator interviews and character analysis in Marvel, DC, Image and indie comics.  Purpose  ComicsVerse defines its mission to use ‚Äúcomics as a platform to discuss social issues of our time like race, sexuality, gender and inequality‚Äù ComicsVerse investigates diversity in comic books and pop culture in order discuss representation, social justice, and build a community. ComicsVerse writer and current Lion Forge editor Kat Vendetti spoke to the BBC in 2018 regarding Ms Marvel, Captain America, and the first Muslim women superheroes. ComicsVerse has also discussed racial diversity in X-Men and New Mutants The website's Feminist Voices and Queer Voices pages gather articles related to social equality for women and people who identify as LGBTQ+ In 2017, ComicsVerse was recognized by the Southern Poverty Law Center‚Äôs Hatewatch for its story on The Dangers of Normalizing the Alt-Right.  Podcast  The ComicsVerse podcast has an international audience. The podcast has earned attention for its in-depth discussion of politics, human rights, and social justice as well as character analyses, creator interviews, and coverage of comics-related events like the New York Comic Con.

Distribution C. propinquus is found off Antarctica, southern Africa, and southern South America. Ecology Life cycle and reproduction Reproduction occurs from October to March. In February, the population of C. propinquus greatly increases. During this time, the population is mostly concentrated in the top of the sea. The next month, the population shifts, with stages I through III found from sea level to in depth. The females, on the other hand, are usually found deeper than . In the Southern Hemisphere autumn, some stage III through V copepodites migrate to overwinter below depths of (probably in diapause). Most of these copepodites, however, stay at the surface, overwintering in an active state. During October and November, most of the population is found between of depth. The lipid content of this species changes throughout its lifecycle. The highest concentration of lipids are found in adults, with lipids making up about 40%, on average, of the dry weight of females during the summer. It has the highest lipid content during the autumn, and the lowest during the spring. These stores decrease as its gonads develop. Most of the accumulated lipids are triglycerides, contrasting with other calanoid copepods that primarily use wax esters. This is partially achieved through the elongation of 11-Eicosenoic acid into erucic acid, which serves to concentrate the energy found. C. propinquue primarily uses triglycerides likely because most individuals are active during winter. The percentage of lipids that are triglycerides increases as the copepod ages; about 42% of the lipids in stage II copepodites are triglycerides, whereas in females, this increases to about 91% of the total lipid content.

Minsk has the largest number of police officers among the post- Soviet republics. It is also one of the most active police forces in Belarus due to Minsk being the center of many protests and arrests. History The department was founded as the Main Directorate of the Workers 'and Peasants' Militia of the Socialist Soviet Republic of Belarus on November 30, 1920. On July 10, 1934, the directorate was transformed into a branch of the newly formed People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), which was formed that same day in Moscow. One of the main tasks of the NKVD directorate in Minsk was to enforce the communist ideology imposed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In March 1946, the NKVD was replaced with the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR. By order of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Belarusian SSR of June 2, 1947, No. 00130, two new branches were set up in the police department of the militia department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to guide the peripheral police bodies along the lines of combating the theft of state and public property. On June 5, 1991, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Belarusian SSR issued an order which placed the directorate under the Ministry of Internal Affairs' jurisdiction. Organization Patrol Unit The operations unit has taken part in the suppression of peaceful protests, including protests of Independence Day. State Traffic Inspectorate The State Traffic Inspectorate ensures road safety on the streets of Minsk. The unit currently uses three types of motorcycles, including a German-made BMW which was purchased in 2017. The inspectorate has been known to have been involved in many scandals, including a situation in August 2017 in which a police officer broke the window of a vehicle and dragged the driver out onto the street. Criminal Investigations Unit The Criminal Investigations Unit is responsible for the investigation of violent crimes. The unit commonly works with the FBI and the FSB in order to combat technologically advanced crimes. Security and Protection Unit The Security and Protection Unit provides security during public events in the capital. Since 2013, police officers of the department have been required to learn English. Minsk GUVD Band The Minsk GUVD Brass Band has been operating in the directorate since October 10, 1964. It is similar in nature and purpose to the NYPD Police Band. In Soviet times, the band traveled all over the USSR and often performed in places that have experienced hardship, including Chernobyl in July 1986 and Leninakan in 1989. It gave its first performance as a Belarusian band in Germany in 1993.

Jewett initially published poetry under the pseudonym Ellen Burroughs (borrowed from her mother's name). Her first book under her own name was The Pilgrim, and Other Poems (1896). Jewett wrote in various poetic forms, including the rondeau, the sonnet, and the ballad. Fellow poet Richard Watson Gilder called her a true poet with a golden gift. In addition to original poetry, Jewett undertook translations, including a version of the complex Middle English poem The Pearl in the original meter and selected lyrics such as a \\"Nativity Song\\" adapted from the work of Jacopone da Todi. A collection of southern European ballads translated by Jewett from several languages was edited by the author and literary scholar Katharine Lee Bates and published posthumously.

It is located at Gitna St., Brgy. Bignay, Valenzuela City.  History  With the DepEd and former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo‚Äôs initiative to have a school in every barangay, the principal of Bignay Elementary School spearheaded the establishment of a secondary school for Barangay Bignay in 2003. In consultation with the previous schools division superintendent, the new high school became an annex of Valenzuela National High School. The Valenzuela National High School ‚Äì Bignay Annex began its first year of operation in 2004. The opening of the school was realized through the efforts of the barangay officials and the Bignay Elementary School Principal Mr. Eduardo Q. Lita. The school was funded by the City Government of Valenzuela through then-Mayor Jose Emmanuel L. Carlos. Its initial enrollment was 67 (Bridge Program) and 154 1st year (regular) students; and 221 2nd year and 3rd year students. There were five high school teachers during that time. Dr. Vicente Tablate was designated as Teacher-In Charge and the school was located in the vicinity of Bignay Elementary School. In its second year of operation (SY 2005-2006), the high school was separated from the elementary with Mrs. Lagrimas Bayle as its Officer-in-Charge from May to August 2005. The enrollment ballooned to 885 students because of the relocation of the families along the railways of Caruhatan, Malinta, Dalandanan, and Malanday due to the government's Northrail Project. The number of teachers had increased from 5 to 14. Mr. Cesar C. Villareal took office as Officer-In-Charge from August 2005 to March 2006. In June 2006, Ms. Grace L. Pascua was assigned as the new OIC. During her term, the number of teachers have increased by 6 and by the start of SY 2007-2008, Bignay High School had 24 teachers. In 2008, the enrollment increased to 1127 with 10 academic classrooms and 29 teachers. At present, Bignay National High School is located at Gitna, Bignay Valenzuela City with its 7,733 sq.m. lot area. This was realized by virtue of Resolution No. 004, S. 2007, passed by the Ciy Government, allowing the purchase of the lot for the school. Through the leadership of former Mayor Win Gatchalian, the 17-classroom building was built. For its facilities, the City Government also provided the school with 50 computer units, a spacious activity center, and a new canteen. Through the years, two additional buildings were built inside the vicinity of the campus to cater the growing population of Bignay and its neighboring barangays. On July 17, 2009 former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed the Republic Act 9660, converting VNHS-Bignay Annex into an independent national high school to be known as Bignay National High School. Bignay National High School is one of the first public high schools in Valenzuela that offered Senior High School starting S.Y. 2016-2017. On December 2016, Bignay NHS had its first annex campus located at Disiplina Village - Bignay, which was named Bignay National High School - Disiplina Village Annex. On July 3, 2018, Mrs. Ma. Christina C. Salonga, the former principal of Valenzuela City School of Mathematics and Science, became its new principal. On August 23, 2018, BNHS-Disiplina Village Annex became an independent national high school as Disiplina Village - Bignay National High School as per Republic Act 11074.

The RWCHR's name and mission is inspired by Raoul Wallenberg's humanitarian legacy. The RWCHR pursues justice by mobilizing advocacy and advising foreign policy in Canada and around the world. The first Raoul Wallenberg All-Party Parliamentary Caucus for Human Rights was launched in Canada in 2017. The RWCHR was founded by renowned international human rights lawyer and former Canadian Minister of Justice Irwin Cotler in 2015.  Themes  The RWCHR's mission is to mobilize a \\"unique international consortium\\" of academics, activists, lawyers, jurists, Parliamentarians, NGOs, citizens and students in the pursuit of justice. The RWCHR's mission statement is organized around five themes, each of which reflects Raoul Wallenberg's humanitarian legacy. Each theme is co-chaired by a leading jurist/parliamentarian/advocate/citizen in the country of Wallenberg's Honorary Citizenship. The Honorary Co-Chairs are Elie Wiesel (US ‚Äì in memoriam), the Honourable Justice Rosalie Abella (Canada), the Honourable Meir Shamgar (Israel) and the Honourable G√∂ran Persson (Sweden). All of the RWCHR's activity relates to one or more of the below themes.  Heroes of Humanity  The RWCHR believes that we have a ‚Äúmoral imperative and historic responsibility‚Äù to pay tribute to the heroes of humanity who put their livelihoods on the line to defend us. Notable heroes of humanity that the RWCHR has made efforts to commemorate are Raoul Wallenberg, Boris Nemtsov and Elie Wiesel. Raoul Wallenberg According to the RWCHR, Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish non-Jew who saved 100,000 Hungarian Jews during the Holocaust, represents how one man with the 'compassion to care and the courage to act' can save more lives than the entire international bystander community. Wallenberg can also be said, according to the RWCHR, to have foreshadowed the foundational principles of international human rights and humanitarian law. Further, Wallenberg serves to highlight the plight of political prisoners because once the Red Army arrived to liberate Hungary, Wallenberg, a liberator himself, was imprisoned never to be heard from again. Wallenberg's fate remains unknown due to Russia's unwillingness to reveal KGB archives. Determined to uncover the fate of this hero of humanity, the RWCHR's Chair, Irwin Cotler, served as the Chair of the International Commission on the Fate and Whereabouts of Raoul Wallenberg writing a 1,200-page report which presented ‚Äúincontrovertible‚Äù evidence that Wallenberg did not die in 1947 (as the Soviets claimed), ‚Äúcompelling‚Äù evidence that he was alive in the 1950s and 1960s, and ‚Äúcredible‚Äù evidence that he lived until the 1970s and 1980s. More recently, the RWCHR joined a legal action to appeal a Russian court ruling that denied Wallenberg's family access to documents that may reveal the hero's fate. The RWCHR's team has also authored recent Op-Eds, like the ones in The Times of Israel and The Jerusalem Post, on the need to remember this hero of humanity. According to Canadian Senator Sheila Finestone and House of Commons proceedings, the RWCHR's Chair was consequential in getting the Canadian Government to adopt a Raoul Wallenberg Commemorative Day, which is held annually on January 17, the day Wallenberg was captured by the Red Army. The RWCHR also co-sponsors the annual International Raoul Wallenberg Roundtable. Boris Nemtsov Boris Nemtsov, a Russian liberal politician that vehemently opposed Vladimir Putin, was assassinated on February 27, 2015 in central Moscow weeks after expressing concern that Putin would try to assassinate him. Nemtsov was a harsh critic of Putin's corruption and his annexation of Crimea and a strong advocate for democracy and the adoption of the Magnitsky Act. The RWCHR has taken steps to commemorate this hero of humanity. On February 8, 2018, the RWCHR co-hosted a screening of the documentary \\"Nemtsov\\" at Queen's Park, Toronto, Canada, preceding a discussion with the RWCHR's Chair, Vladimir Kara-Murza and Peter MacKay. On March 9, 2016, the RWCHR co-sponsored the first annual Boris Nemtsov Memorial Russia Freedom Forum. The RWCHR has also co-authored an Op-Ed in the Ottawa Citizen urging the Canadian Government to follow the United States and Lithuania's lead in adopting Nemtsov commemorations by doing such things as renaming a park or bridge. Elie Wiesel Elie Wiesel is a Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner who dedicated his life to giving a voice to victims of the Holocaust and speaking out against recent genocides in Rwanda, Cambodia, Bosnia and Darfur. Wiesel famously said, \\"there may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest\\". The RWCHR's Chair worked closely with Wiesel for over 50 years helping to, after Wiesel's death on July 2, 2016, create Elie Wiesel Park at the busiest intersection in C√¥te- St-Luc, Qu√©bec. The RWCHR has also written numerous Op-Eds and participated in events and galas dedicated to commemorating this hero of humanity.  Holocaust & Genocide  The RWCHR seeks to prevent atrocities similar to the Holocaust by remembering and acting upon the lessons related to it. Accordingly, on May 4, 2016, The RWCHR and the International March of the Living co-chaired the International Nuremberg Symposium at Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w, Poland on the ‚ÄúDouble Entendre of Nuremberg: the Nuremberg of Hate and the Nuremberg of Justice‚Äù. The ‚ÄúNever Again‚Äù Declaration, which highlights some of the following universal lessons, was unanimously adopted at the Symposium: the danger of forgetting and the responsibility to remember, the danger of genocide denial and the responsibility to speak truth to power and repudiate false witness, the danger of impunity and the responsibility to bring war criminals to justice, the danger of the betrayal of the elites, the danger of assaults on the vulnerable, the danger of state-sanctioned incitement to hate, the danger of the bystander community and the danger of silence and indifference in the face of evil, the responsibility to act, prevent, protect and intervene, the responsibility to pay tribute to the rescuers, and the responsibility to respect the legacy of survivors. The RWHCR has mounted an advocacy campaign to highlight these universal lessons. Accordingly, numerous Op-Eds have been written by RWCHR staff members relating these universal lessons to past and contemporary atrocities. Examples include articles in the National Post and Huffington Post about the lessons of the Rwandan genocide, implementing the lessons of the Holocaust to combat anti-semitism, and the international community's failure to invoke the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) in Syria. The RWCHR hosts, organizes and participates in many events that pertain to the Holocaust and genocides more generally. For example, on March 1, 2018, the RWCHR co-organized an event with the Montreal Holocaust Museum, the McGill Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism and the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies featuring a discussion with Payam Akhavan and Bob Rae to raise awareness and discuss the responsibility to protect the Rohingya, victims of mass persecution in Myanmar. On the celebration of the 150th anniversary of Canada's confederation, the RWCHR endorsed and participated in an event which saw the Armenian, Ukrainian, Jewish, Rwandan and Greek communities of Canada come together at the Armenian Community Centres in Montr√©al, Toronto and Vancouver to discuss the role Canada should play in human rights today. Other examples include the RWCHR partnering with Vanier College to host the 25thand 26th Annual Vanier Conference on the Holocaust and Genocide.  Democracy  The RWCHR is dedicated to protecting liberal democracy by fighting against the global resurgence of authoritarianism and illiberal populism that threaten it, and by consequence, human rights. Accordingly, on May 26, 2017, the RWCHR became a signatory to the Prague Appeal for Democratic Renewal, a declaration issued by the International Coalition for Democratic Renewal which calls for the mobilization of a coalition of conscience in defence of democracy. The RWCHR is also a major sponsor of the Magnitsky Act [see below]. The RWCHR hosts, organizes and participates in many events that pertain to the protection of democracy. Since 2016, the RWCHR has been a co-sponsor of the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy. At the 10th Annual Geneva Summit, the RWCHR's Chair gave the summit's closing remarks and presented Vladimir Kara-Murza with the Geneva Summit 2018 Courage Award. The RWCHR also participated in the 2017 Oslo Freedom Forum discussing \\"Democracy and the Rule of Law\\". In May 2017, the RWCHR joined forces with the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies, Amnesty International Canada and the United Committee of Armenian Organizations of Quebec to host Rights City/Montr√©al, ville des droits humains, which comprises three major events to celebrate Montreal's role in advancing human rights and democracy. To discuss the threat illiberal populism and authoritarianism pose to academic freedom, the RWCHR and its Chair participated in the Canadian Science Policy Conference in Ottawa alongside Home Hoodfar and Viviana Fernandez. In August 2017, the RWCHR helped host Vietnamplify, a conference that highlights the fight for human rights in Vietnam. On October 7, 2017, the RWCHR played a role in highlighting the humanitarian crisis caused by the turn to authoritarianism in Burundi by inviting Pierre-Claver Mbonimpa to Ottawa for a press conference and meeting with Parliamentarians.  Political Prisoners  The RWCHR mobilizes international advocacy in concert with other international human rights bodies, governments and NGOs to defend political prisoners around the world. According to the RWCHR's Chair, the ‚Äúplight of a political prisoner [serves as a] looking glass into the human rights violator country that imprisons them‚Äù. The RWCHR serves as international legal counsel to the following political prisoners: Raif Badawi, a Saudi blogger imprisoned for exercising his right to freedom of expression; Leopoldo Lopez, a leader of the Venezuelan democratic opposition currently under house-arrest; Dr. Wang Bingzhang, a Chinese pro- democracy dissident currently languishing in a Chinese prison; Sun Qian, a Falun Gong practitioner imprisoned for her spiritual faith; Saeed Malekpour, a Canadian permanent resident imprisoned in the notorious Evin Prison in Iran for developing a computer software; Ayatollah Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi, imprisoned in Evin Prison for advocating for separation of religion and government; the Baha'i Seven, imprisoned in Evin Prison for practicing the Baha'i faith and promulgating religious freedom. In 2017, the RWCHR used Human Rights Day to co-host a press conference with the Raoul Wallenberg All-Party Parliamentary Caucus for Human Rights to highlight the cases of political prisoners.  Women's Rights  The RWCHR believes that advancing women's rights is essential to achieving a more peaceful and prosperous world built upon principles of justice and dignity. The RWCHR has accordingly begun to host events and engage in public advocacy intended to help women exercise the self-determination they are entitled to. Examples include an Op-Ed authored by the RWCHR and published in the Huffington Post on International Women's Day on the need to continue advancing women's rights. On March 20, 2018, the RWCHR co-sponsored an event with UN Watch parallel to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women with the goal of shining a spotlight on the role of women in defending democracy and pursuing justice. Participants of the event included Wai Wai Nu, Mahnaz Afkhami, Maria Corina Machado and Ketty Niviyabandi.  Activity   Magnitsky legislation  The Magnitsky legislation is a series of laws that give governments the power to levy sanctions on corrupt officials who have grossly violated internationally recognized human rights. The legislation is named after Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian tax accountant who was imprisoned, and later murdered, for uncovering and reporting the theft of $230-million by Russian state officials. The U.S. Magnitsky Act was originally intended to sanction the corrupt Russian officials involved in the wrongful imprisonment and murder of Sergei Magnitsky, it began a global movement to pass similar sanction laws that supports human rights advocates by combating a globally pervasive culture of corruption, criminality and impunity. The RWCHR and its Chair played a relatively significant role in helping create the global movement for Magnitsky leguslation. After tabling a Magnitsky-inspired private member's bill in Canadian Parliament in 2011 that failed to pass in the CPC-led government, the RWCHR's Chair ignited a parliamentary process in 2016 to pass Canadian Magnitsky legislation inviting Bill Browder, Vladimir Kara-Murza, and Gary Kasparov to testify before Parliament. This, coupled with a major campaign engaged in by the RWCHR to get the Canadian Foreign Affairs Committee to submit a report calling for a framework for human rights sanctions created enough momentum for the Canadian Magnitsky legislation, officially titled the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act, to unanimously pass in the House of Commons. Following this, the Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and Bill Browder credited the RWCHR and its Chair with the passing of the Canadian Magnitsky legislation. On November 1, 2017, the RWCHR, along with Bill Browder and other Parliamentarians held a press conference with Nikita and Natalia Magnitsky, the son and wife of the late Sergei Magnitsky, to celebrate the passing of Magnitsky legislation in Canada. On December 14, 2017, Bill Browder, Gary Kasparov and the RWCHR's Chair testified in Washington before the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as the U.S. Helsinki Commission, to examine the implementation of the Magnitsky Act and its impact on the Russian government and members of Putin's inner circle. The RWCHR, with the help of their Raoul Wallenberg All-Party Parliamentary Caucus for Human Rights, have been urging the Canadian government to support the global Magnitsky legislation movement by persuading other countries to adopt similar laws. The RWCHR has also taken matters in their own hands attempting to use their influence to sway other countries to adopt Magnitsky legislation. To this end, two RWCHR lawyers, Irwin Cotler and Brandon Silver, visited the Netherlands in February to meet with Martijn Van Helvert and other Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee to encourage them to pass Dutch Magnitsky legislation.  Russia  Much of the RWCHR's work regarding combating human rights violations in Putin's Russia involves promoting the Magnitsky Act, both in Canada and abroad [see above]. The RWCHR also devote significant time to honouring Boris Nemtsov, a hero of humanity who was murdered for his criticism of Putin's corruption and criminality [see above]. In both of these regards, the RWCHR has partnered with Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, who has been de facto exiled from Russia for his promotion of the Magnitsky Act. The RWCHR has also been engaged with the case of Alexey Pichugin, evidenced by his mention in an Op-Ed in The Hill authored by the RWCHR's Chair.  Iran  In 2013, the RWCHR's Chair launched Iran Accountability Week, a major advocacy initiative held annually in the first week of May by the Canadian Subcommittee on International Human Rights to highlight the domestic repression and rights-abuses perpetrated by Khamenei's Iran. A centrepiece of Iran Accountability Week is the Global Iranian Political Prisoner Advocacy Project whereby Parliamentarians and Senators ‚Äúadopt‚Äù political prisoners and engage in sustained public advocacy, partly by co-authoring an Op-Ed, on their behalf. The cases of Saeed Malekpour, Ayatollah Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi and the Baha'i Seven have been advocated for in this regard. The cases of the political prisoners held in Iran's notorious Evin Prison were also highlighted by the RWCHR in a demonstration conducted on Parliament Hill the day before September 1, 2017, a day of solidarity with political prisoners held in Iran officially remembered due to the 1988 massacre of political prisoners in Iran, an event that Canada was the first to recognize as a crime against humanity thanks to the leadership of Irwin Cotler, amongst other individuals. At the gathering, RWCHR's Chair reminded everyone that there is no statute of limitations for crimes against humanity and that, as a result, Canada should push to establish an international tribunal, such as the ones created in response to the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides, to bring perpetrators to justice. The case of Saeed Malekpour was further highlighted by the RWCHR in 2017 when staff members spoke alongside Homa Hoodfar and Alex Neve at an event held at the University of Toronto. The RWCHR also uses the media to mount their public advocacy campaign authoring numerous Op-Eds intended to bring attention to the particular cases of political prisoners. For example, Op-Eds written by the RWCHR in the Huffington Post and The Jerusalem Post discuss the imprisonment of Nasrin Sotoudeh, Ayatollah Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi and the Baha'i Seven respectively. Iran Accountability Week also pays particular attention to the persecution of the Baha'is in Iran. During the 5th annual Iran Accountability Week, the RWCHR's Chair personally testified before the Subcommittee on International Human Rights calling the persecution of the Baha'is in Iran a \\"litmus test\\" of the country's human rights violations. During the 6th annual Iran Accountability Week, the RWCHR and RWCHR All-Party Parliamentary Caucus on Human Rights hosted a public panel in Canadian Parliament discussing many of the Islamic Republic of Iran's human rights abuses, with particular focus on the Baha'is. Participants and attendees at the 6th annual Iran Accountability Week included Payam Akhavan, Maziar Bahari, Mark Dubowitz, Corinne Box, Michael Levitt, Judy Sgro and Marilou McPhedran. The RWCHR also participated with Senators and Parliamentarians in panel discussions hosted by the Canadian Friends of a Democratic Iran to discuss, among other things, the persecution of the Baha'i. On November 22, 2017, the RWCHR, the Raoul Wallenberg All-Party Parliamentary Caucus for Human Rights, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha‚Äôis in Canada and the University of Ottawa's Human Rights Research and Education Centre co-hosted a screening of ‚ÄúThe Cost of Discrimination‚Äù, a documentary which draws parallels between life under Apartheid in South Africa and life for the Baha‚Äôi in today's Iran. An Op-Ed highlighting the plight of the Baha'i was also written in the National Post by RWCHR staff members. In attempt to sanction the Iranian officials that have perpetrated, and are complicit in rights abuses, in 2016 and 2017 the RWCHR participated in an event for the Canadian Coalition Against Torture with RWCHR's Chair testifying before the Canadian Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade regarding the need to pass Bill S-219, an Act to deter Iran-sponsored terrorism and human rights violations through the levying of sanctions. In addition to Parliamentary testimony, the RWCHR has used the media to lobby the Canadian and U.S. governments to use the power vested in the Magnitsky Act to sanction Iranian officials complicit in rights abuses.  Saudi Arabia  Much of the RWCHR's work regarding human rights in Saudi Arabia relate to Raif Badawi, a prisoner of conscience sentenced to 10,000 lashes and 10 years in prison for exercising his right to freedom of expression. The RWCHR serves as Raif Badawi's international legal counsel. To secure his freedom, the RWCHR has mounted a public advocacy campaign which has entailed pushing for Badawi to receive honorary Montreal citizenship, leading a rally on the eve of the 5th anniversary of Badawi's imprisonment, and writing Op-Eds in the Huffington Post, Time and The Hill , which were used to point out that Badawi's imprisonment is a violation of Saudi and international law. The RWCHR also organized a 'Tweetstorm' on the occasion of the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists in 2018, with participants including the likes of J.K Rowling, and Hillel Neuer. The RWCHR has also engaged in many behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts. In March 2018, when Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman was in Washington, D.C., the RWCHR's Chair handed him a legal brief on Badawi's case based on Islamic and Saudi Arabian law. The Crown Prince said he would consider the brief. The RWCHR has also heavily criticized the Canadian government's decision to sell billions of dollars of militarized armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia. The RWCHR's Chair authored an Op-Ed in the Montreal Gazette criticizing the Canadian government for saying that the sale was \\"consistent with Canada's foreign and defence policies, including human rights\\" given the \\"appalling state of human rights in Saudi Arabia\\". The RWCHR was adamant in saying that the arms deal, which the Saudi government said was awarded to Canada to cement the friendship between the two countries, should have been leveraged to secure the release of Raif Badawi who has a strong connection to Canada given that his family resides in Sherbrooke, Quebec.  Venezuela  In September 2017, the Secretary General of the Organization of American States appointed the RWCHR's Chair to an expert panel intended to investigate whether Venezuela should be referred to the International Criminal Court for the possible commission of crimes against humanity. In December, the RWCHR co-hosted a civil society roundtable with several NGOs, academics and Parliamentarians which, according to the Government of Canada, helped inform Canada's strategy in dealing with the crisis, especially regarding the government's approach to the Lima Group. In April 2018, Brandon Silver, a member of RWCHR's legal team, attended a roundtable discussion with Canadian Parliamentarians and government officials submitting constructive proposals for dealing with the Venezuelan crisis. On May 30, 2018, the RWCHR held a press conference in Ottawa with an all-party group of Parliamentarians and Senators to discuss the report, which did indeed find the Maduro regime to have committed crimes against humanity since 2014. To intensify the advocacy against the Maduro regime, on April 2, 2018, Brandon Silver, published an article in The Hill Times calling out the regime's human rights abuses. On June 21, 2018, the RWCHR's Chair testified before the European Parliament to discuss the need to refer Venezuela to the International Criminal Court. Finally, on September 25, 2018, several state parties to the Organization of American States ‚Äì Argentina, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Peru ‚Äì jointly referred the situation in Venezuela to the International Criminal Court, marking the first time state parties to the International Criminal Court referred another state party for investigation. The work of the RWCHR and its members were central to making this joint referral happen. The RWCHR also serves as legal counsel to Leopoldo Lopez, the leader of Venezuela's democratic opposition. In May 2016, RWCHR's Chair received a Special Award by the Standing Committee on Foreign Policy, Sovereignty and Integration of the Venezuelan National Assembly for his work on this matter. In May 2017, the RWCHR spearheaded Leopoldo Lopez's wife's meeting at Canadian Parliament hosted by federal party leaders Justin Trudeau, Rona Ambrose and Tom Mulcair.  China  During his time as a Member of Parliament, the RWCHR's Chair spent significant energy attempting to redress the targeting and forced organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China, who have been the victims of state-sanctioned persecution since the 1990s. In 2013, one of his last years in Parliament, the RWCHR's Chair tabled a private member's bill (Bill C-561) to amend Canada's Criminal Code and Immigration and Refugee Protection Act in attempt to render it a criminal offence to partake in any aspect of the organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners. Now, his efforts have been taken up by Garnett Genuis, a member of the Raoul Wallenberg All-Party Parliamentary Caucus for Human Rights, who has resurrected Bill C-561 in Bill C-350. To continue highlighting the plight of the Falun Gong, the RWCHR engages in public advocacy. In 2015 and 2017, the RWCHR and its Chair participated in the World Falun Dafa Day Celebration on Parliament Hill. The RWCHR and the Raoul Wallenberg All-Party Parliamentary Caucus also co-hosted the screening of Anastasia Lin's \\"Bleeding Edge\\", a film about a Falun Gong practitioner imprisoned and repeatedly tortured in China while being a candidate for execution and organ harvesting. The RWCHR acts pro bono as international legal counsel to Sun Qian, a Canadian citizen and Falun Gong practitioner who has been detained in China since February, 2018 being subject to mental and physical torture. The RWCHR also acts as international legal counsel to Dr. Wang Bingzhang, a Chinese dissident currently languishing in a Chinese prison for doing nothing other than promoting democracy. To highlight his case, the RWCHR sponsored the screening of \\"Inside These Walls\\", a documentary about the plight of Dr. Wang Bingzhang, at Concordia University's Cinema Politica. The RWCHR has called on the Canadian government to use the Magnitsky Act to impose sanctions on Chinese regime officials involved in the aforementioned. The RWCHR's Chair argues that \\"caring about the human rights situation in China is [in fact being] pro-Chinese people. In any country where human rights violations exist, and the people who commit those violations are not brought to justice, the people suffer from that impunity.\\"  Mauritania  In the words of the RWCHR's Chair and Executive Director, Irwin Cotler and Judith Abitan respectively, \\"Although Mauritania claims that it has abolished slavery, it actually remains one of the world‚Äôs only bastions of slavery.\\" Accordingly, the RWCHR acts pro bono as international legal counsel to Biram Dah Abeid, a leader of the international anti-slavery movement and founder and president of the Initiative for the Resurgence of the Abolitionist Movement in Mauritania (IRA-Mauritania). In December 2018, a few months after the RWCHR announced that they had taken up Biram's case, he was released from prison. Biram has since declared himself a presidential candidate in the June 2019 elections. Cameroon In 2019, the RWCHR worked together with the Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa (CHRDA) in documenting human rights violations during the Anglophone crisis, a civil war involving the Southern Cameroons region of Cameroon that started in 2017. The CHRDA had earlier, in August 2018, published a list of 106 villages that had been raided and burnt down by Cameroonian government forces since October 2017 in the context of the Anglophone crisis. Citing eyewitness accounts, videos and photos as evidence, the CHRDA claimed that the 106 villages had been \\"attacked, burned down partially or completely and deserted either completely or partially\\". In May 2019, the RWCHR and CHRDA together claimed that human rights violations in the Anglophone crisis constituted crimes against humanity.

He is a ten-time Australian King's Cup champion, an Olympian and a medalist at World Rowing Championships. State and club rowing Colvin was educated at Melbourne Grammar School where he was introduced to rowing. He steered that school's second VIII to a victory at the Victorian schools' Head of the River in 1979. His senior club rowing was initially from the Banks Rowing Club in Melbourne starting in 1980, and from 1988 at the Mercantile Rowing Club. Colvin was first selected to cox the Victorian men's eight contesting the 1985 King's Cup at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships. Between 1985 and 2000 he coxed twelve Victorian King's Cup crews. This was a particular period of Victorian state dominance with the Victorian eight seated with members of the Oarsome Foursome and other national oarsmen. Consequently of the twelve times he contested the event, Colvin steered ten Victorian eights to King's Cup victory. International representative rowing Colvin made his Australian representative debut in a coxed four at the 1990 World Rowing Championships in Lake Barrington, Tasmania. He coxed that crew to an overall ninth placing.Colvin at World Rowing In 1991 he steered the Australian men's lightweight eight to their fourth place finish at the 1991 World Rowing Championships in Vienna. At the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, Colvin made his Olympic debut. He coxed the Australian men's eight who made the Olympic final and finished in fifth place. He held his seat in the stern of Australian eight into 1993 and competed at the 1993 World Rowing Championships where the eight placed fourth. Colvin's chief selection rival during his representative career was his Mercantile club-mate Brett Hayman who competed with Colvin for the coxswain's seat in the Australian men's senior eight during the 1990s. In 1995 Colvin was again in a national representative boat steering the men's coxed four who finished in fifth place at the 1995 World Rowing Championships in Tampere. 1997 saw Colvin back in the Australian eight. As an Australian Institute of Sport selection eight they contested and won the 1997 Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. The 1997 Australian eight then raced at two World Rowing Cups in Europe before contesting the 1997 World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette where they took a bronze medal. In 1998 he again coxed the Australian men's eight and at the 1998 World Rowing Championships in Cologne they raced to a six placed finish. It was his last Australian representative campaign. Coaching and administration A long term Mercantile clubman, Colvin was club captain from 2000 to 2004. He has coached women's crews at club and state representative level since 2002. He coached the Victorian representative women's lightweight quad in 2004, 2006 and 2007 including their 2006 Victoria Cup victory. Between 2008 and 2013 he was the co-coach of five Queen's Cup winning Victorian women's eights at the Australian Rowing Championships.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History The current Great Northern Hotel opened in February 1938. It is the third hotel of the same name to occupy the site, its predecessors having been in operation since 1863. The hotel was designed by Sydney architects Rudder and Grout and built by contractors Kell & Rigby. The hotel was a prominent feature of Newcastle nightlife through the twentieth century. It has been described as \\"once Newcastle's grandest and most luxurious hotel\\". Actress Susie Porter was a barmaid at the hotel while studying at university. Owners during the 1970s and 1980s struggled with the cost of upkeep of the heritage hotel. The hotel was then damaged in the 1989 Newcastle earthquake, after which the upper levels of the hotel were closed. The hotel closed in 1993 after a dispute between the owner and council over fire regulations, and suffered significant damage due to vandalism in the subsequent years, with most items of value stripped from the building. A multimillion-dollar refurbishment under a new lessee began in 1996, which after delays due to disputes with the council over incentives and assistance eventually saw the ground floor of the hotel reopen as an Irish- themed pub in November 1999. In March 2000, the NSW Heritage Council took legal action against the lessee, claiming that unauthorised works had been undertaken on two bars on the lower level and the lobby. It was the first time criminal proceedings had been launched under the Heritage Act, though the power to use them had existed since 1977. The developer delayed plans to refurbish the first floor of the building as a result of the litigation. In January 2001, the lessee opened a linked nightclub in the adjacent former Tattersall's Club building. In March 2001, the owners lost the Heritage Act case, resulting in the lessee being discharged without a conviction, but facing a $5000 fine and $13,000 in court costs. In 2002, a dispute between the hotel owner and lessee wound up in the New South Wales Court of Appeal, with the owner attempting to have the lessee evicted. The owner won on both first instance and a September appeal, resulting in the hotel's closure on 31 October 2002 after the lessee was formally evicted. The hotel was subsequently sold to Kurt Braune. The hotel reopened under new ownership on 28 March 2003, having been stripped of the Irish pub fitout. The owners proposed the refurbishment of the upper levels in 2005 and got development approval in 2008, but were delayed by the Global Financial Crisis. The hotel was described in 2007 as having been \\"allowed to fall into a state of significant disrepair\\". It reopened under new lessees after another period of closure and repairs on New Year's Eve 2009. Braune sold the hotel to Sydney developer Bass Elhashem in 2013, but remained involved with the refurbishment as project manager. In October 2015, Elhashem announced another proposal to refurbish the hotel. The proposal hit a problem in 2017 when the owners were informed that they would have to build a substation in order to connect power to the upper floors, but was resolved by an agreement to share facilities with an adjoining building. In January 2018, the owners applied to build a cantilevered swimming pool over Scott Street as part of an extension to the building. It had been announced that the refurbished building would reopen at Easter 2018; however, as of July 2018 it remains closed with works ongoing. Description The Great Northern Hotel is a six-storey Art Deco hotel consisting of a central wing and two side wings (initially five-storey, later increased to six). It is a dominant element of the townscape. It has a rare \\"Jazz style\\" interior.

It is a personal memoir looking at McCain's last ten years or so in the Senate, and his historic 2008 campaign for the presidency against Barack Obama. As such it is the final volume of an autobiographical trilogy that also comprises Faith of My Fathers (1999) and Worth the Fighting For (2002). It also covers his work on behalf of democracy and human rights in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The work's title comes from the second line of the naval hymn \\"Eternal Father, Strong to Save\\", reflecting McCain's career as a naval aviator. Contents It contains 10 chapters including Arab Spring and Regular Order. The full list of chapters are: * No surrender * Country first * About us * In the company of heroes * Arab Spring * Fighting the good fight (with and against Ted Kennedy) * Nyet (know thine enemy) * Know thyself (defending the West) * Part of the main (American exceptionalism) * Regular order Making reference to one of the subjects of the book, McCain writes of President Donald Trump: \\"His lack of empathy for refugees, innocent, persecuted, desperate men, women, and children, is disturbing. The way he speaks about them is appalling, as if welfare or terrorism were the only purposes they could have in coming to our country. \\"He has declined to distinguish the actions of our government from the crimes of despotic ones. The appearance of toughness, or a reality show facsimile of toughness, seems to matter more than any of our values. The world expects us to be concerned with the condition of humanity. We should be proud of that reputation. I‚Äôm not sure the president understands that.\\" About his own political philosophy, McCain writes, \\"Last but not least, I was [at the time of entering Congress] a Republican, a Reagan Republican. Still am. Not a Tea Party Republican. Not a Breitbart Republican. Not a talk radio or Fox News Republican. Not an isolationist, protectionist, immigrant-bashing, scapegoating, get-nothing-useful-done Republican. Not, as I am often dismissed by self-declared 'real' conservatives, a RINO, Republican in Name Only. \\"I'm a Reagan Republican, a proponent of lower taxes, less government, free markets, free trade, defense readiness, and democratic internationalism.\\" Background The book was begun as a collaboration between McCain and Salter regarding foreign policy and national security. Agreement with the publisher was reached in February 2017 but no public announcement was made. The tentative title was It's Always Darkest Before It's Totally Black, one of McCain's trademark sardonicisms. But McCain's July 2017 diagnosis of glioblastoma changed that, and it became more of a reflective, contemplative, personal memoir.Bash, Dana (May 21, 2018). \\"Speechwriter helps John McCain say his piece in 'Restless Wave\\". CNN. As Salter said, \\"He wanted it to be more personal, and to convey just how fortunate he believed he was for being able to serve this country for 60 years. What America means to him and what he thinks America means to the world, and what he hopes it will continue to mean to the world after he's gone.\\" Salter traveled to McCain's ranch outside Sedona, Arizona to work on a memorable speech McCain gave forth unto the Senate floor, as well as the book. The audiobook version, which runs 14 hours 15 minutes, is mostly read by actor Beau Bridges, with McCain only strong enough to record the introduction and conclusion. Due to his illness McCain did no publicity for the book, but co-author Salter did do some interviews. On his final page, McCain returns to the model of the Ernest Hemingway character he calls his hero, Robert Jordan of For Whom the Bell Tolls. That novel ends with Jordan lying wounded on open ground, armed to fight one last battle that he knows will end with his death. \\"The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for,\\" Jordan says to himself, \\"and I hate very much to leave it.\\" To this, McCain adds his own response: \\"And I do too. I hate to leave it. But I don't have a complaint. Not one. It's been quite a ride. ... I made a small place for myself in the story of America and the history of my times.\\" Commercial reception The book sold over 33,000 copies in its first week of availability. It debuted atop The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Sellers of 2018 for the week of June 10. It spent four weeks on the list itself. The audiobook also appeared on the appropriate New York Times list.Audiobook Best Sellers The New York Times, June 2018 Following McCain's August 25 passing in 2018, there was a renewed interest in his life and the book re-entered the New York Times list in the top spot. It then moved to number five and then number three over the following two weeks. Critical response According to The New York Times, \\"One of the striking aspects of this new book is how often McCain ‚Äî who says his dire medical prognosis leaves him 'freer' to speak his mind and vote his conscience 'without worry' ‚Äî insists on playing it safe. The six-term senator from Arizona slips in a few careful mentions of Donald J. Trump, and expresses concern about the rancor that has overtaken the country, but he generally stops short of calling out the president or his cabinet, issuing just a brief eyeroll at the 'thoughtless America First ideology' now ascendant in the White House.\\" In contrast, ABC News declared that \\"In his memoir, McCain has blistering criticisms of Donald Trump's presidency, from his lack of empathy for immigrants and refugees to his praise for 'some of the world's worst tyrants.'\\" In his review for The Guardian, Lloyd Green stated that \\"McCain is dying of cancer but he won‚Äôt leave this earth without one more fight.\\" It is skeptical regarding some of McCain's conclusions regarding the Iraq War, stating \\"Turning to the Middle East, McCain is ever the warrior, romantic and proponent of regime change ‚Äì a volatile brew.\\" Industry stalwart Publishers Weekly opined, \\"Despite flashes of the 'straight talk' for which McCain has become known, this book meanders into navel-gazing detail and sometimes skirts meaningful examination. McCain lists President Trump‚Äôs moral and political failings, but hedges ... Rather than a response to extraordinary times, this fine memoir reads more like a requiem of a long, patriotic life.\\" Kirkus Reviews characterized the work as \\"sometimes rueful, sometimes defiant, always affecting. Even McCain‚Äôs political opponents should admire the fiery grace with which he‚Äôs exiting the world.\\" Jason Hamill of The American Community Journals localized chain concluded, \\" All said the book reads as the man‚Äôs final chance to set the record straight on a myriad of tough political decisions over the last several decades of his incredible career. His no- nonsense demeanor comes across in the pages as a refreshing counter-balance to most of the politick one hears on a daily basis and is most certainly recommended.\\" Terri Schlichenmeyer of The Pantagraph of Illinois wrote, \\"Like nearly every political biography ever released, there‚Äôs a lot of chest- thumping and assertions of correctness inside The Restless Wave, and astute readers will note more than just a little repetition. Moreover, though, this book fairly rings with a sense of leave-taking that, despite what we know, imparts an oddly-faint feeling of surprised disbelief not unlike losing a distant relative you barely knew.\\" References External links * Official publisher page for book Category:Books by John McCain Category:Books by Mark Salter Category:2018 non-fiction books Category:American political books Category:Political memoirs Category:Books about John McCain Category:Books about politics of the United States Category:Simon & Schuster books Category:Literary collaborations ","title":"The Restless Wave (book)"},{"id":"57846178","text":"thumb The Argentine National Time Trial Championships is a cycling race where the Argentine cyclists compete to decide who will become champion in the time trial discipline for the year to come.

It was a sub-area command under the Commander-in-Chief, The Nore from 1914 to 1921 and again from 1939 to 1945. History In World War One Brightlingsea naval base was in charge of the protective anti-torpedo net barrier around the Swin Anchorage, used at various times by the 3rd Battle Squadron, the Dover Patrol, and other naval units. It installed, maintained and finally dismantled the booms and nets, patrolled around them, and also patrolled the local Essex river estuaries and coastline, using trawlers, drifters, Motor Launches (MLs) and Coastal Motor Boats. After mid-1916 it was also the base for the steam gunboat . The local shipyards also maintained its craft and some of those from the Dover Patrol. Rear-Admiral C L Napier was in command from late 1914 till Spring 1916, then Commander R Hartland Mahan replaced him. Including the old light cruiser which was attached in 1915‚Äì1916, manpower varied from about 300 to 500. The shore base was initially named HMS Wallaroo (after the ship), then City of Perth (after a net drifter). Unconnected with the Navy was the Army School of Military (Field) Engineering, and from Summer 1916 the Australian Engineer Training Depot (AETD), with a combined strength of up to 1400 personnel. In early 1940 naval personnel and craft from HMS Vernon, Portsmouth, used the harbour to test the newly-invented LL magnetic mine sweep. That June, after their departure, the Navy set up the shore base HMS Nemo, for Essex-coast auxiliary patrol. In the autumn minesweeping drifters and training landing craft were attached, together with naval air-sea rescue craft, and personnel for operating and guarding estuary observation minefields. Manpower ashore and afloat varied from about 200 to 600. A separate Coastal Forces equipping unit was also attached (from 1941), which used the local shipyards to equip and test-run many hundreds of MLs, MTBs and MGBs. The same shipyards also serviced and repaired many such craft from other bases, besides building 16 in the case of Aldous's yard. In 1942 landing craft training was separated out under HMS Helder, which moored its craft (up to 90) in the Creek but had its shore HQ opposite at St Osyth. Location Brightlingsea is a coastal town in the Tendring district of Essex, England. It is situated between Colchester and Clacton-on-Sea, at the mouth of the River Colne, on Brightlingsea Creek. Administration The station was administered initially by the Rear-Admiral, Brightlinsea and later by the Senior Naval Officer, Brighlingsea {  - ! Name !!

MacCormick was influenced by Thomas Mott Osborne as evidenced by the dedication of his book. In his book, The Education of Adult Prisoners it lists for prison education: * Fundamental academic education, designed to provide the intellectual tools needed in study and training in his everyday life. * Vocational education, designed to give training for an occupation. * Health education, designed to teach the fundamentals of personal and community healthy. * Cultural education, embracing the non-utilitarian fields one enters for intellectual or aesthetic satisfaction alone. * Social education, to which all other types of education and all the activities of the institution should contribute.

The League of Women Voters organized two presidential debates: the first on September 21, 1980, and the second on October 28, 1980. The second presidential debate is the second most-watched debate in American history. The Republican nominee Ronald Reagan participated in both debates. Independent candidate John B. Anderson only participated in the first debate, while the Democratic nominee and incumbent President Jimmy Carter participated in the second debate. League of Women Voters-sponsored debates Negotiations The tenative schedule for the debates, reported in August 1980, was as follows: * September 18, in Baltimore, Maryland * October 2, in Louisville, Kentucky (Vice Presidential debate) * October 13, in Portland, Oregon * October 27, in Cleveland, Ohio The 1980 election featured a major third party candidate, John B. Anderson. The League of Women Voters allowed for Anderson to participate in the debate if he polled above 15%. The Carter campaign, believing that a three-way debate between Carter, Reagan, and Anderson would boost Anderson's campaign, tried to push for an earlier debate only featuring Carter and Reagan This plan was supported by the chairs of the Democratic and Republican National Committee. The two-person debate did not materialize, and Carter declined to debate alongside Anderson. The Vice Presidential debate was cancelled on September 29, days before it was scheduled to be held. George Bush and Walter Mondale refused to attend, leaving only Anderson's running mate Patrick J. Lucey accepting the invitation.

The three invitees were Jimmy Carter, John B. Anderson and Ronald Reagan, though Carter refused to attend. Following a strong performance by Reagan, Anderson's poll numbers began to drop; he would not be invited to the second debate. =Format= The debate started at 10:00 p.m. EDT, and lasted for one hour. Anderson and Reagan both received six questions. They were given two and a half minutes to answer each question, as well as one minute and 15 seconds to rebut. Closing statements could be as long as three minutes. Second presidential debate (Music Hall) The second debate was held on October 28 in Cleveland, Ohio's Music Hall. The debate was held only a week before Election Day. Carter and Reagan were the only invitees. CNN attempted to include Anderson from the Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. CNN's Daniel Schorr read the same questions to Anderson. They then aired Anderson's live responses along with tape delay of Carter and Reagan's responses, despite technical difficulties. Reagan's most notable moments include using the phrase \\"There you go again\\" and asking whether or not Americans were better off than they were four years ago. In 1983, Reagan's team came under fire for having access to Carter's internal debate briefing materials. =Format= The second presidential debate started at 9:30 p.m. EST, and lasted for 90 minutes. The debate consisted of two halves, and panelists were only allowed to offer follow-ups in the first half. Candidates Carter and Reagan both received the same 12 questions and the ability to rebut twice for one minute each. =Viewership= Nielsen Media Research states that the second presidential debate garnered 80.6 million viewers.

Developed as a streetcar suburb in the late nineteenth century, today the neighborhood contains many Victorian houses, and about of mixed residential and commercial zoning, as well as Forestdale Cemetery, Saint Jerome Cemetery, Rohan Park, and Holyoke Medical Center.HLY.E, MACRIS, Massachusetts Historical Commission. History The estate of founder-developer Oren D. Allyn in 1891; not pictured here is the houses's extensive rose garden. Though the barn has long since been demolished, the house still stands today, with much of its land developed as subdivisions. Undeveloped prior to the founding of the Hadley Falls Company, Oakdale was originally shown on maps as a series of unbuilt but planned roads and extensions of the Holyoke grid plan, for more than 30 years however, these roads existed solely on paper. Following a town meeting in 1860 the Holyoke Water Power Company set aside a large tract of its lands for the establish a secular burying ground which became Forestdale Cemetery, and around this same time the St. Jerome's Cemetery was established in a tract adjacent. Much of the land at this time was otherwise owned by the Allyn family. The son of Anderson Allyn and nephew of Samuel B. Allyn, prominent members of Holyoke in its founding days, developer Oren D. Allyn first began grading land in the area in the spring of 1885. Up until that time it had primarily been used as farmland by his father. In that same year Allyn, often referred by his initial's \\"O.D.\\", gave the neighborhood its name, Oakdale. With its sloping hills and view of the downtown, he would market it as improved housing for mill workers \\"of moderate means\\", and by the time of his death in 1929 he came to be known as the \\"father of Oakdale\\", as the neighborhood contained some 300 houses he had developed there. One of Allyn's pastimes had been rose cultivation, his own home on the corner of Hampshire and Locust Street attracted hundreds of visitors each summer to see a reported 149 varieties, and was described by the Boston Globe at the time as a tourist attraction of the city. Indeed as a member of the board of public works, Allyn was described as an advocate of the city beautiful movement and it was noted each house he developed had enough yard-space for gardens. Often his family donated or sold trimmings to neighbors who had bought those houses, contributing to a culture of rose gardens once ubiquitous in that part of the city. For many years his wife would host an informal neighborhood social group at the gardens known as the Oakdale Society which, among other causes, raised money through luncheons and tea for children's welfare and health. The area is today characterized by many modest late-19th and early 20th century houses, as well as a handful of estates, the most prominent of which is that of Judge John Hildreth, built in 1882, it is better known today as the former Yankee Pedlar Inn.HLY.1355, MACRIS, Massachusetts Historical Commission. Less conspicuously placed is \\"Pinehurst\\", a large estate surrounded by a stand of conifers, which was constructed by James H. Newton in 1909, then-president of the Chemical Paper Company, one of the last independent paper-mills of the city at that time.HLY.486, MACRIS, Massachusetts Historical Commission.

Plot  In the land of Haranai („ÅØ„Çâ„Å™„Å≤ÂõΩ), King Kentatsuha („Åë„Çì„Åü„Å§„ÅØÂ§ßÁéã) longs for a son and prays to Kannon and is granted a son, Prince Meuon („ÇÅ„ÅÜ„Çí„ÇìÂ§™Â≠ê). Three years later, the queen dies, and when a new queen arrives she falls in love with the prince but is rebuked by him. She grows to despise her stepson and plots against him, but he is saved by monks who are in reality manifestations of Buddhist deities such as Eleven-Faced Kannon and Chiichi-sh≈çnin („Å°‰∏Ä‰∏ä‰∫∫). The king and prince journey to Ise Shrine in Japan by way of Magadha. The king, whose true form (Êú¨Âú∞ honji) is Dainichi Nyorai, resides in the , and the prince, whose true form is Eleven-Faced Kannon, resides in the . The prince's birth mother is Taga-daimy≈çjin, and Chiichi-sh≈çnin is Kok≈´z≈ç of (ÊúùÁÜäÂ≤≥ËôöÁ©∫Ëîµ Asamagatake Kok≈´z≈ç). The main story of the work is followed by an elaboration on the oral traditions and origins of ceremonies related to the tale.  Genre, date and sources  Tensh≈ç-daijin Honji is a work of the otogi-z≈çshi genre. More specifically, it is a honji- mono (Êú¨Âú∞Áâ©), a work elaborating the continental (Indian) Buddhist origins of Japanese deities (kami) in accordance with the ideology of honji suijaku. It is one of a number of works dealing with stepchildren (Á∂ôÂ≠êË≠ö keishi-tan). The work was probably completed by Daiei 2 (1522), as this date is mentioned in the text of the work itself. The theme of a stepmother's immoral love for her husband's child resembles the fourth story in Book IV of the Konjaku Monogatari-sh≈´, as well as the sermon Aigo no Waka. The journey from India to Japan follows the pattern of Kumano no Honji (ÁÜäÈáé„ÅÆÊú¨Âú∞) and others, and the name of the character Chiichi-sh≈çnin resembles that of Chiken-sh≈çnin („Å°„Åë„Çì‰∏ä‰∫∫) in Kumano no Honji. Kazuo Tokuda, in his article on the work for the Nihon Koten Bungaku Daijiten, remarks that these works could be considered a series of tales that elaborate on the religious beliefs and traditions of the Ise- Kumano-Taga, Shiga region.  Textual tradition  Tensh≈ç-daijin Honji is in one book. The work survives in a single manuscript copy in the holdings of the Kei≈ç University Library.  Modern editions  The work was printed in volume ten of the Muromachi-jidai Monogatari Taisei (ÂÆ§Áî∫ÊôÇ‰ª£Áâ©Ë™ûÂ§ßÊàê).

Primarily a violinist, he also played cello and piano, and was a composer. Life Cudmore was born in Chichester in 1787. He developed a talent for music at a very early age. His first instructor was James Forgett, a local organist, under whom he learnt the violin, acquiring such proficiency that at the age of nine he played a solo at a concert in Chichester. About 1797 he was placed under Joseph Reinagle, and shortly afterwards became a pupil of Johann Peter Salomon, with whom he studied the violin for two years. In 1799 he led the band at the Chichester theatre, and in the same year was engaged as a first violin in the orchestra at Italian Opera in London. He returned soon afterwards to Chichester, where he remained until 1808; in that year he moved to London, studied the piano under Joseph Woelfl, and appeared as a solo pianist and violinist at the principal concerts. He also became a member of the Philharmonic Society orchestra. Shortly afterwards Cudmore settled in Manchester, where for many years he led the Gentlemen's Concerts. He was also often engaged at Liverpool, where on one occasion he played at a concert a violin concerto by Pierre Rode, a piano concerto by Friedrich Kalkbrenner and a cello concerto by Giacobbe Cervetto. He was known for his ability in sight- reading; he also was in some repute as a composer of concertos and other works, for his various instruments. His most notable work was an oratorio, The Martyr of Antioch, on Henry Milman's poem of the same name. Selections from this were performed at Birmingham and Manchester, and the work was published by subscription. Cudmore died at Wilton Street, Oxford Road, Manchester, on 29 December 1840. He left a widow and family.

He was born in Saint-Gilles-du-Gard. His family moved to the Chartreux district in Marseille in 1877. Born into a poor family, he apprenticed to a house painter in 1890 but began drawing with the support of the Marseille artist Eug√®ne Giraud. In 1895, he established a studio that he kept for his entire life, at No. 12 rue Fort-Notre-Dame. In 1898, he traveled for the first time to Paris and worked with the decorator Adrien Karbowsky to produce part of the ornamentation of the Salon du bois of the decorative arts pavilion for the 1900 World's Fair. He returned to Marseille in 1900. In 1902, he lost his left eye in an accident. His artistic career began in 1902 with an exhibition at Galeries Braun in Marseille and then, in 1905, an exhibition at the Palace of Architects at the Avenue du Prado.Louis-Mathieu et Andr√© Verdilhan: Deux visages de la modernit√© en Provence, Fondacion Regards du Provence. Retrieved July 7, 2018. He exhibited in Paris in 1906 at the Salon des Ind√©pendants. His early works were painted in a style reminiscent of Monticelli and van Gogh.Chol et al., p. 19. From 1907 to 1913 his work was influenced by Fauvism and German Expressionism.Chol et al., pp. 33, 104. From 1908 he participated regularly in the Salon d'Automne.Chol et al., pp. 94, 95. In 1909, he spent six months in Versailles where he made many paintings. He occupied from 1910 to 1914 a workshop at No. 12 quay of Rive Neuve. Mobilized in Toulon during the First World War, Verdilhan met Albert Marquet and was influenced by his work.Chol et al., p. 12. He also met Andr√© Suar√®s and Antoine Bourdelle. After the war, he resided successively in Aix-en-Provence, Cassis and Toulon. On 16 March 1919, he married H√©l√®ne Casile, the younger daughter of painter Alfred Casile. He exhibited in New York at the gallery Kraushaar. The paintings he made between 1920 and 1926 are characterized by light, flat colors and harmonious forms bounded by simplified outlines.Chol et al., p. 68. In 1925 he painted a mural for the Provence pavilion of l'Exposition universelle. In 1926 he painted a decoration for the Op√©ra de Marseille: this painting represents the festival of 14 July in Marseille and was much criticized during the inauguration of the opera. His palette darkened in the works of his final years. He died of laryngeal cancer on 15 December 1928 in Marseilles.

Following concurrence with the Minister for Local Government with the proposal an Interim Heritage Order was placed over the building. In recognition of its heritage significance a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over Loxton House on 8 January 1982. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  The front facade is stone with projecting quoins and an upper verandah supported on fluted timber columns. The side walls are stuccoed brick and the rear wall is painted brick.

Overwhelmed with remorse, the man then attempts suicide on a boat that is adrift in a tumultuous river. The small boat, however, ends up entangled in the branches of the willows along the shore and Brian meets Judy, a girl who lives nearby and who introduces him to her aunt Sue. The latter, a kind teacher, has a positive influence on Brian who, trying to leave the past behind, becomes another man and even begins to write a book. But when he falls in love with Betty Jo, he arouses jealousy in Judy, who tells her father about her less than exemplary past. The man informs the bank of Brian's whereabouts, but Aunt Sue manages to persuade the bank president - an old student of his - not to pursue him. His wife, who came to find him, drowns in the river and Brian is now free to start a happy life with Betty Jo.

Sier is from Melbourne and played for Marcellin College and Yarra Junior Football League club Banyule. He also played two games for the Northern Knights in the TAC Cup before he was drafted by Collingwood with pick 32 in the 2015 national draft, their first selection. Sier's drafting was described as a surprise due to his inexperience. He played only 18 Victorian Football League games over two seasons because of a string of injuries ‚Äì a broken wrist, a severe concussion, a back injury which ended his 2016 season, and injuries to his hamstring, eye socket and foot. In 2018, he was sanctioned by the AFL with a suspended $5000 fine for betting on AFL events during the 2017 AFL season, although the AFL noted that he was remorseful and fully cooperative with the investigation, and that the bets totalled less than $50. Sier finally broke through at an AFL level in the second half of the 2018 AFL season, when Adam Treloar was sidelined with a serious hamstring injury. Sier debuted in round 15 against the Gold Coast Suns at Carrara Stadium. He averaged 19.5 possessions (including 10.6 contested), four clearances and 4.6 tackles for the year and played in the 2018 AFL Grand Final loss to the West Coast Eagles.

Fedra conceives an insane irresistible passion for her stepson, Ippolito born of a previous relationship of her husband with the queen of Amazons. She tries to kiss Ippolito when he was asleep. Ippolito awaken by the kiss and they had a fight. He rejected her love for him, and made it very clear to her. Fedra, distraught by the passion of love, but at the same time, furious at having been rejected by him. She conceives a feeling of hatred so strong as to make her want revenge. Teseo arrives at the palace just in time to see the son flee, without answering his father who had called him repeatedly. Fedra claimed Ippolito had raped her. Teseo, at first, thinks that his wife's accusation against his son may be a lie, but when Fedra provides him with the proof, Teseo who are blinded by anger invokes Poseidon to have Ippolito die on that same day. Ippolito loses his life that very day near the sea as a result of an accident. He fell from his horse and his head hit against a rock. When Teseo revealed the truth about the accusation, he throws himself against Fedra, announcing her death among cruel torments.

It was written in 1895 by Jos√© Maria de E√ßa de Queir√≥s (1845 - 1900), also known as E√ßa de Queiroz, when he was living in Paris. The novel was published posthumously in Portuguese in 1901 with a final edit and an ending contributed by his friend, Ramalho Ortig√£o. The first English version, translated by Roy Campbell, was published by the Ohio University Press in 1967. A new translation by Margaret Jull Costa, was published by Dedalus Books in 2008, and republished in 2018. Background The story reflects the author's own experiences. For many years he had angled to get the post of Portuguese consul in Paris but, once there, he found the city ‚Äúvery coarse as regards manners and ideas, and it‚Äôs completely black! In 1892 he had inherited an estate in the Douro valley of Portugal, which he found to be very beautiful, while noting the poverty of the inhabitants.‚Äù The Plot Jacinto is well-educated and rich, and mixes with the cream of Parisian society. He lives in an apartment on the Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris in which he has installed the latest technology, much of which has a tendency to go wrong. He has 30,000 books and knows of all the latest ideas on the secrets of happiness, but is not happy. When Z√© Fernandes, a long-time friend and the narrator of the story, visits him after an absence of seven years, Jacinto is starting to find Parisian society boring. His formula for a good life has ‚Äúcontorted itself into a debilitating kind of retail therapy‚Äù. Jacinto finally decides to visit his country estate in Portugal after a landslide occurs that destroys the 16th-century chapel where the remains of his ancestors were housed. However, he cannot travel there without first boxing up many of his Parisian possessions and sending them to the estate. But fate intervenes amusingly during the journey and Z√© and Jacinto arrive there with no possessions. Jacinto enjoys rural living and becomes involved in the management of his estates. He is appalled by the rural poverty, including that experienced by his tenants, and tries to do something about it by improving housing and handing out money. He eventually marries Z√©'s cousin and becomes a father. Half-hearted suggestions that they should visit Paris are conveniently forgotten and Jacinto becomes ‚Äúwell and truly settled‚Äù. Reviews A reviewer in the UK's The Independent considered the novel to be ‚Äúa smart balance of satire, irony and lyric grace ‚Äì the progress of a rich brat who quits the city to find fulfilment in rural life‚Äù. Another review felt that the novel offered a ‚Äúwry take on fin-de-si√®cle life as experienced by two secular, well-heeled young men in the bustle of Paris and in the quietude of the Portuguese countryside‚Äù. However, the same reviewer argued that the book was not particularly profound and was basically a second string work by a major author. This was due not to the quality of the prose, but to the reliance upon the most easily caricatured subjects, unlike the novelist's other books. Several reviewers comment adversely on the end of the book, written by E√ßa's friend, Ramalho Ortig√£o, which is seen as being too flowery, predictable and sentimental for the satirical tone of the novel.

It was built from 1840 to 1845. The property is owned by Muswellbrook Shire Council and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Weidman Cottage lies on a Crown grant given to David Brown on 27 November 1838. He sold the property to Henry Richard Clovell McAlpin, a store and innkeeper. The year of this transaction is not known. Stafford sold the property to Albert Weidman, whom the cottage is named after, in 1891. The property remained in Weidman family hands until 1977 when it was purchased by Muswellbrook Council. However, in 1935 the property was transferred into the name of A.Weidman & Company Ltd, passing out of individual private ownership. The cottage was constructed sometime between 1840 and 1850, and quite probably before 1845, by the original owner David Brown.The building was erected as one of a pair of semi-detached town cottages. The other cottage has since been demolished to make way for the council public library. Brown appears to have erected the buildings as a speculative venture or as a town residence. An inspection of the building suggested that part of the ground floor served as a shop. It is also possible that Brown was the designer, there being no record of an architect having been employed. The property was purchased by another storekeeper, William Corby Thompson in 1867 who sold it to David Stafford in 1882. An adjoining building sharing a common south wall with Weidmann Cottage was later built as a semi detached two storey dwelling similar in all respects to the cottage. Photographs support the possibility that this building was an exact copy of Weidmann Cottage. Albert Weidmann, who purchased both properties in 1891 used the adjoining residence as his butcher shop. Prior to being demolished in 1977, the second cottage was used as a cakeshop. Albert Weidmann was born in Muswellbrook and contributed significantly to the local community over a 50-year period in commercial, pastoral and sporting interests. In addition to his contribution to the Upper Hunter community, his brother Alexander was one of the founders of the Muswellbrook Colliery and his eldest son, Leslie Albert Weidmann left sufficient funds on his death to facilitate construction of the Weidmann Memorial Wing at Muswellbrook District Hospital.  Description  Weidman Cottage is located on gently rising ground on the western side of Bridge Street, the town's main thoroughfare and has been incorporated within the precinct of the public library, which is at its rear. The two-storey stone section of the building and its projecting top verandah contribute greatly to the streetscape of Bridge Street and in particular, their relationship to nearby Loxton House. The building consists of a predominately symmetrically- designed monolithic structure constructed of sandstone, probably quarried from \\"Ravensworth\\". The building comprises a 2-storey main structure of four rooms with the remains of an original one room stone wing extending on the west side at the south end. A typical colonial middle / working-class house of the period - a merchant's townhouse. The building has a colonnaded verandah along the east facade, a light timber framed outbuilding on the western side at the northern end and a cellar. All these appear to be original except for the ground floor terrace brick coping walls which were built in the 1920s. The building is constructed of quarried sandstone and fieldstone and the south wall of quarried rubble. Internal walls are of similar rubble masonry finished with hair plaster and painted. The roof is corrugated galvanised iron. The double storeyed verandah and posts had a simple infill balustrade at first floor level, evident today.  Condition  As at 13 August 1997 the physical condition of the building was fair; and the archaeological potential assessed as medium. Externally the building has not been substantially altered except for the rear western elevation and removal of the semi-detached building at the south end. Internally, apart from general deterioration, the cottage generally remains as it would have bee,  Modifications and dates  Modifications to the structure include:Parsons & Stapleton 1981 *-1914 - Large timber framed and weatherboard sheeted extension added. * - Verandah altered *Post 1910 - Back wing reconstructed *Back skillion possibly contemporary.  Heritage listing  As at 28 September 2009, Weidmann cottage was a sturdy, monolithic structure of symmetrical proportions and reflects the type of architecture and design of a typical colonial middle/working-class house of the period - a merchant's townhouse. The two storey stone section of the building and its verandah contribute greatly to the streetscape of Bridge Street and in particular, their relationship to nearby Loxton House. Weidmann Cottage was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The building is a good example of a typical merchant class townhouse and as such is an important element in both the streetscape of Bridge Street and the ongoing social history of the community. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The building is a well proportioned, symmetrically designed middle-era colonial town residence typical of the reasonably affluent middle/working class merchant housing. It exhibits an interesting and very broad use of solid masonry walls devoid of moulding and utilising stone lintels in otherwise rough hewn stone walls. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The building is a typical merchant class townhouse.

Early life Sahag was born in Beirut, Lebanon, to Armenian parents. Sahag's father, Atum, was a couturier. Sahag began working in a salon when he was 7 years old. When he was 9 years old, his family (including his three brothers and sister) moved to Australia, where Sahag grew up.San Diego Union Tribune, July 5, 2005 Career When he was 18 Sahag moved to Paris, where he met Bernard M√©riatt, a renowned French salon owner who worked with L'Or√©al and Maniatis. Sahag signed a six-year contract with M√©riatt and managed to feature on the cover of Vogue Italia. He appeared as a hairdresser in the cult thriller The Eyes of Laura Mars alongside Faye Dunaway in 1978. In the late 1970s, Sahag was associated with Shaun Casey, creating a stir by cutting her hair extremely short and bleaching it white for a Helmut Newton cover of French Vogue (magazine).Heroes: John Sahag, V Magazine. \\"John was like the mad professor of hair\\", said Edward Tricomi, owner of the Warren-Tricomi salon, who along with Sahag advocated a shift to dry-cutting in the late 1970s because it gave greater command of how a style would ultimately look. As Sahag regularly travelled to New York he decided to open his own salon there. In 1985 Sahag opened his first salon on Madison Avenue in New York City. Here he gained a number of celebrity clients that included Gwyneth Paltrow, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston, Debra Messing, Mick Jagger and Jon Bon Jovi. Brooke Shields, who cut the ribbon for his first salon in 1985, was quoted in the Workshop opening press release saying, \\"John is totally creative, in every situation. Plus he looks sensational in black.\\" Some of Sahag's best known cuts included Demi Moore's 'boy cut' for Ghost and Paltrow's crop, worn in Sliding Doors. Sahag became well known as innovator of the Dry Cut Technique. His work appeared in many different advertisements including Lancome's Isabella Rossellini ads and Calvin Klein Jeans as well as many different fashion shows, notably Issey Miyake in Paris. His work appeared in fashion and beauty magazines, in the photographs of Helmut Newton, Irving Penn, Hiro, Albert Watson, Richard Avedon, and many others in a variety of international fashion and beauty magazines.

It was designed by John Horbury Hunt and built in 1878. It is also known as Christ Church Anglican Cathedral Hall. The property is owned by the Anglican Diocese of Newcastle. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In 1882, the church's Parochial Council accepted John Horbury Hunt's ambitious plans for the Christ Church Cathedral. At the same time, they requested Hunt design a pro-Cathedral to be built on the opposite side of Church Street to house the congregation while construction was underway. This building was also to replace the old Christ Church School, which had been purchased by the Dept of Public Instruction in 1882. The then pro-Cathedral was built in 1883‚Äì84. As construction of the cathedral was delayed numerous times, the pro-Cathedral housed the congregation for eighteen years until 1902. It was subsequently used as a Cathedral Hall, and later became part of Newcastle Grammar School. The dean and chapter at Christ Church Cathedral continue to own the hall, while it is managed by the school. It was restored in 2003‚Äì04, although damage to the mortar, internal plaster and stone wall has occurred since. All of the alterations and additions to Horbury Hunt Hall have impacted or compromised the interpretability of the significant fabric of the building to varying degrees. Generally, the changes have occurred for functional reasons with minimal consideration given to architectural significance. Whilst the design of the building was criticised as \\"severely plain\\", and \\"barn like\\" in appearance at the time of its construction, these sentiments are more a reflection of the conservative Victorian taste of the public, than a true acknowledgement of the technical innovation of Hunt's design. Joan Kerr describes Horbury Hunt Hall as being a mixture of Hunt's normal style of groups of lancets, single stepped buttresses, string courses and simplate tracery with late Victorian details like shingled clerestory walls, wooden mullioned and transomed domestic windows in clerestory and proch, an American stick style interior arcade and a low pitched roof to nave and butting aisles.  Heritage listing  Horbury Hunt Hall is a significant tangible reminder of the 1868 Newcastle Cathedral project. It played an essential part in accommodating the Anglican community in the period between the dismantling of the old Christ Church and the erection of the current Christ Church Cathedral. For 18 years Horbury Hunt Hall was the Cathedral of the Anglican Diocese of Newcastle. However, Horbury Hunt Hall is not only significant for its role in the construction of Cathedral, but also for the history it reveals of its own construction. The contrasting designs of the exterior by Hunt and the interior by Menkens provide pertinent evidence of Hunt's dismissal by Selwyn before the completion of the building. Horbury Hunt Hall is regionally significant for its associations with the Anglican Diocese. It is locally significant for its use by the Cathedral parish and Newcastle Grammar School, and its location in The Hill area of Newcastle. Horbury Hunt Hall remains an invaluable source of history and is integral to the curtilage of Christ Church Cathedral and the saga of the construction of both buildings. Most of all Horbury Hunt Hall is significant for its design and clear associations with the architect John Horbury Hunt. It is therefore considered of high state significance. Anglican Cathedral Hall, Christ Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Horbury Hunt Hall holds significant importance for its association with the architects John Horbury Hunt and Frederick B Menkens. Hunt was a very well known architect within Australia, and Menkens was well known within Newcastle. Hunt designed many significant buildings and was of enormous stature in the architectural world. Horbury Hunt Hall sits very well in Hunts broader collection of works in the Hunter Valley and the whole of NSW. It therefore has state significance by way of its association and design by John Horbury Hunt. The Hall is additionally associated with The Rev. Arthur Selwyn, the incumbent of Christ Church from 1867 until his death in 1899. He held considerable influence over the building of the Pro-Cathedral and the current Cathedral. His life, conflicts with Hunt and his death, are an integral part of the historical significance of Horbury Hunt Hall. Selwyn was possibly the most influential player in the drama of the Cathedrals' early history and Horbury Hunt Hall is testament to his influence and therefore hold Local significance for his association with it. The animosity between Selwyn and Hunt is reflected in the fabric of Horbury Hunt Hall. At the time of construction it was not well received and so disliked that Hunt was dismissed and German immigrant architect Frederick B Menkens was given the task of decorating the interior. Work by Menkens in Newcastle is well known and highly regarded; as such Horbury Hunt Hall has Local significance for its association with Menkens. The contrast between Hunt's design for the exterior of the building, and Menkens design for the interior, provides a significant attestation to the conflicts between Selwyn as Dean of the Anglican Parish and Hunt the architect. Horbury Hunt Hall therefore holds significant for its substantiated connections with the historically important persons Selwyn, Hunt and Menkens. For its associations with Hunt alone, Horbury Hunt Hall is considered to be of State significance. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Horbury Hunt Hall has landmark qualities and is important in terms of the curtilage of the Christ Church Cathedral. During its time as the Pro-Cathedral, it held landmark qualities with its views of the whole of Newcastle. However, since the construction of the current Cathedral and the growth of Newcastle, Horbury Hunt Hall's views of the city are considerably diminished and with it, its quality as a landmark. Horbury Hunt Hall is architecturally important in demonstrating a high degree of creative achievement, being a pioneering example of federation arts and crafts architecture in Australia. Its aesthetic qualities are notable because the art and crafts elements of the design are in fact a precursor to the federation style. Whilst the design of the building was criticised as \\"severely plain\\", and \\"barn like\\" in appearance at the time of its construction, these sentiments are more a reflection of the conservative Victorian taste of the public, than a true acknowledgement of the technical innovation of Hunt's design. Hunt was in fact 20 years ahead of the architectural style of the time with the design of Horbury Hunt Hall. It was a prelude to the arts and crafts and federation styles, which dominated, in the following century. Horbury Hunt Hall is associated with the technical innovation of the construction of the cathedral, however, in terms of its architectural characteristics it stands on its own merits as a building of aesthetic significance at a State level. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Horbury Hunt Hall's use as the Pro- Cathedral is largely forgotten, overshadowed by the planning and building of the current Christ Church Cathedral. Although Horbury Hunt Hall has not enjoyed interest as close to that for the cathedral, the ceremony for the opening was described as a success that would be long remembered in Newcastle. Horbury Hunt Hall served as the parish church until November 1902 when the current Cathedral was occupied. In the 18 years that Horbury Hunt Hall served as the Pro-Cathedral, it was of significant importance to the Newcastle Anglican Parish. Whilst it was intended to provide temporary accommodation during the construction of the current Cathedral, it was of significant importance to the Newcastle Anglican Parish. Whilst it was intended to provide temporary accommodation during the construction of the current Cathedral, it was nonetheless a place of considerable spiritual importance for some time. Historically, Horbury Hunt Hall is of spiritual significance to the Newcastle Anglican Parish and Diocese. It functioned as the Cathedral of the Newcastle Dioceses for 18 years as a place of worship. Therefore, it played a significant role in the spiritual, social and cultural life of Newcastle. Furthermore, it has broader regional social and spiritual significance for those it served - the community and the Anglican Church. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Horbury Hunt Hall is integral to the curtilage of the Christ Church Cathedral and the Newcastle Grammar School and the story that the two site and buildings tell. It is an important reference site upon which the tangible history of the Cathedral project and the relationship of Cathedral, Parish, Diocese, and Newcastle Grammar School may be interpreted and understood.

Plot  In the reign of the Engi Emperor (Âª∂ÂñúÂ∏ù), there was a minister by the name of Sugawara who was of low birth but had tremendous favour and influence with the emperor. There was at this time also a minister named Tokihira whose skill and influence were less than the Sugawara Minister's. Jealous of the Sugawara Minister, Tokihira set a fire inside the palace grounds, and cast the blame on his rival. The emperor commanded Tokihira to arrest the Sugawara Minister, and Tokihira obliged, capturing and tying up his rival. The Sugawara Minister climbed Mount Hiei and bid a tearful farewell to his teacher before travelling by sea into exile in the Dazai-fu. His servants were murdered by Tokihira after seeing their master off. The Sugawara Minister bemoaned his lonely exile in poetry, but then the miracle of the ' occurred, and when he prayed to Bonten and Taishaku proclaiming his innocence, with a crack of lightning a slip of paper fell from the sky proclaiming Namu taisei itoku tenman dai-jizai tenjin (ÂçóÁÑ°Â§ßËÅñÂ®ÅÂæ≥Â§©Ê∫ÄÂ§ßËá™Âú®Â§©Á•û), and he passed away. Kan Sh≈çj≈ç appeared to H≈çsh≈çb≈ç on Mount Hiei and told him not to interfere with his revenge. The apparition ate a pomegranate before blowing down the door and bursting into flames. In a single night, Kan Sh≈çj≈ç, in the form of a white-haired figure, attacked the palace with lightning, and Tokihira was kicked to death. The emperor, terrified, summoned H≈çsh≈çb≈ç to court. H≈çsh≈çb≈ç descended from the mountain, crosses the Kamo River as it flooded and surged with waves, and arrived at the palace. The monk prayed, causing Kan Sh≈çj≈ç to rise up to heaven. From this point on, Kan Sh≈çj≈ç was worshipped as .  Genre and date  Tenjin no Honji is a work of the otogi-z≈çshi genre, a short prose narrative written in Japan's medieval period; specifically it is a honjimono, a work describing the deeds of a divinity during their human lifetime and the origin of one or more religious sites associated with them. Literary scholar Manabu Murakami, in his article on the work for the Nihon Koten Bungaku Daijiten, dates it to \\"perhaps the end of the Muromachi period\\".  Sources and themes  The work is clearly based on the Kitano Tenjin Engi, in particular those texts in the Anrakuji-bon manuscript line, and transforms the religious text describing the origin of the god Tenjin into a narrative tale. Compared to the Engi, Tenjin no Honji includes a lot more waka (poetry in classical Japanese) and fewer kanshi (poetry in classical Chinese). The Kitano Tenjin Shrine was an important focus for the religious practices of the people of Kyoto in the (the twelfth to sixteenth centuries), and per Murakami this work seems to reflect that popular religious sentiment. Murakami further speculates that it may also have been created on commission from a temple.  Textual tradition  Tenjin no Honji is in two scrolls, although it survives in numerous copies of different formats. A two-scroll copy traditionally attributed to Ichij≈ç Kanefuyu is in the holdings of the Tenri Central Library, which also possesses a one-scroll emaki edition, a damaged one-scroll miniature emaki edition, and a two-volume Nara-ehon edition. A one-scroll emaki edition is in the possession of Toyoko Takasu (È∑πÂ∑£Ë±äÂ≠ê).

Shiva is worshiped as Kameeswarar, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as KokilambaAmman. The temple complex covers an area of two acres and all its shrines are enclosed with concentric rectangular walls. The temple has a number of shrines, with those of Kameeswarar, his consort KokilambaAmman and Ranganathar being the most prominent. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 6:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and many yearly festivals on its calendar. Brahmotsavam, the prime festival during the Tamil month of Aadi (July - August) is the most prominent festival celebrated in the temple. The original complex is believed to have been built by Cholas, with later additions from different ruling dynasties. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Puducherry. Legend and history The main shrines of the temple As per Hindu legend, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva appeared as a flame, and challenged them to find his source. Brahma took the form of a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship. He also asked Brahma to build a temple on the banks of Mutharu River in Thondaimandalam. Brahma built the temple and got relieved of the curse. The original structure is believed to have been constructed during 12th century, while the later additions are believed to have been built by Medieval Cholas and Vijayanagar Empire, while the present masonry structure was built during the 16th century. There are inscriptions from Raja Narayana Sambuvarayar (1339‚Äì63), who is believed to have donated around to the temple and it was irrigated by Ossudu Lake. As per the census of 1961, the value of jewellery in the temple was valued at . Architecture A gopuram of the temple Kameeswarar temple is located in Villianur, a village on Puducherry - Villupuram main road. The temple has a flat entrance tower facing South, and all the shrines of the temple are enclosed in concentric rectangular granite walls. The central shrine is approached through pillared halls. The central shrine facing East houses the image of Kameeswarar in the form of Lingam (an iconic form of Shiva). The shrine of KokilambaAmman, facing South, is located in separate shrine around the first precicnt. The central shrine is approached through a Mahamandapam and Arthamandapam. As in other Shiva temples in South India, the shrines of Vinayaka, Murugan, Navagraha, Chandekeswara and Durga are located around the precinct of the main shrine. The second precinct has the temple tank and a garden around the periphery of the compound wall. Religious importance and festivals The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed three times a day; Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 a.m. and Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for Kameeswarar and Gnanambigai. Unlike other shiva temples, anointing with oil is not performed in the temple. There are weekly rituals like ' (Monday) and ' (Friday), fortnightly rituals like pradosham, and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. Brahmotsavam, the prime festival during the Tamil month of Aadi (July - August) is the most prominent festival celebrated in the temple.

It was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott and built from 1864 to 1869 by Edmund Blacket, supervised by John Horbury Hunt. It is also known as St. Alban's Anglican Church and St Albans Church. The property is owned by the Trustees of the Anglican Diocese of Newcastle. The church was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In 1981 the National Trust classified the St Alban's Church precinct. Within the precinct are St Alban's Church, the Gothic fence, the bellcote, the Rectory and the Sunday School Hall with attached residence. The church is the only known design for a church executed in Australia based on the designs of Sir George Gilbert Scott. The construction was supervised by John Horbury Hunt on behalf of Edmund Blacket. The church is a superb example of English, Victorian Gothic Revival. Complete with 19th century plantings, fence and bellcote. The precinct \\"is closely identified the artistic and religious patronage of the White family, which was responsible more than any other, for much of the 19th century development in the Hunter Valley. The Rectory was built and for many years was the residence of Mrs Jane Wilson, sister of the Archdeacon W. E. White, Rector of the Parish from 1860-1900. It was acquired by the church in 1937 and now forms an essential element of the precinct. It is a good example of late 19th-century romanticism, featuring a complexity of gables, hipped roofs, tall chimneys and a semi-circular, single storey wing. The Sunday School and Hall, erected in 1874 as the St. Alban's School, was the first non-ecclesiastical building undertaken by Horbury Hunt. It was in pious memory of Sarah White, and Francis, her son, to the glory of God. Special features of this building are bellcote on the roof ridge, a triple arch porch, multiple gables and high chimney stacks. It is constructed of warm red sandstock bricks recovered from the original St. Alban's (). The attached residence was initially for the schoolmaster, later for the schoolmaster, later for the organist and currently for the curate. In 1934, a kindergarten room, stage and porch were added in a style compatible with Hunt's concept. The rear room was dedicated in memory of Lillian Luke, cousin of Mrs Jane Wilson.  Description  St Alban's Church is constructed of stone quarried at Atienne and has a slate roof, with a square north-east tower. The interior construction features, chancel with scissor-truss roof and original polychrome application. Carved limestone reredos by Harry Hemes of England designed by Pirie and Clyne, Aberdeen, Scotland. Floor tiles throughout the church were made by Minton and Hollins. Needle point kneelers and cushions were possibly made by early Rector's wife, Mrs Beedle. Chancel arch supported by short shafts and volute corbels. Four bay with south aisle and arcade. Scissor and collar truss with braced principals and polychrome decoration. A complete set of stained glass windows by Howard Bros. of Frome, Somersetshire, England. Original oak pews.

It was named after Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers (1758 ‚Äì 1840), a doctor and astronomer from Bremen. Location and transport connection The planetarium is located within the City University of Applied Sciences Bremen. From the main station tram 4 (Arsten), 6 (Flughafen/Airport) and 8 (Huchting) as well as bus 24 (Rablinghausen) pass the stop ‚ÄòWilhelm-Kaisen-Br√ºcke‚Äô. It is another 400 meters by foot to reach the planetarium. The planetarium is well connected to the historic town centre which features the Bremen City Hall, the Bremen Cathedral, B√∂ttcherstra√üe, the Schnoor and the Schlachte promenade. Olbers- Planetarium location in Bremen via Openstreetmaps  Events and Shows  The planetarium offers shows 365 days a year. During the school holidays in Bremen the planetarium is running a holiday programme. All shows are held in German, however it is possible to request shows in a different language. Shows usually last about one hour.  History  The planetarium opened its doors on 23 January 1952. Back in the day it was part of the nautical college in Bremen, now the City University of Applied Sciences and its primary cause was to train nautical students in Celestial navigation. The first projector in place was the ZKP 1, which the German Hydrographical Institute, now called the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany) funded. It was originally developed for the navigational institutions of the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe. In 1958 the nautical college moved to Werderstra√üe 73 where the planetarium is still located today. In 1979 a more modern projector, the ZKP 2 was introduced. Dr. Erwin M√ºcke had applied for funding from the German Research Foundation. The same year they also received a solar system projector, funded by the senat for Education and Science. The old ZKP 1 was sold to the college in Nordenham where it is still in use today. Since 2015 a hybrid system is in use. The main projector was upgraded with parts from a more recent model.  Research In the 1950s ornithological research was conducted at the Olbers- Planetarium. Dr. Franz and Dr. Eleonore Sauer from the Zoological Institute of the University of Freiburg observed the orientation of Warblers using artificial night-skies. In 2017 the Lund University in Sweden published a paper on Dung beetle orientation. The scenes for that particular research project were amongst other places, taken at the planetarium.  Cooperation with the Olbers Society The Walter Stein Observatory is run by the Olbers Society, named in honour of Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers. In the winter months from October to April, the observatory is open on selected days. The Olbers Society occasionally uses the planetarium for guest talks. The observatory and the planetarium are located in the same building.  Congress  In 2018 the International Astronautical Congress is held in Bremen and the Planetarium is part of many projects as part of the astronautical year.

The area, along with most of the temples situated there, was submerged in 1959 as a consequence to the construction of a dam across Damodar river at Panchet in Dhanbad district, then in Bihar.  Geography  Location Telkupi is located at Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map.  History  Formerly known as Tailakampi, Telkupi is the capital of Rudrasikhara, a local ruler of the area in 11th century, who helped Pala king, Ramapala, to recover Varendra from Bhima. The royal chronicle of Panchkot Raj of Shikhar dynasty mentions that Rudrashikhara rose to power in 1098 AD. India historian Niharranjan Ray assumes that he ruled from 1070 to 1120. Sandhyakar Nandi in his poem Ramacharitam comments that like a wildfire, Rudrasikhara, was an expert in warfare, crushed the pride of the rulers of rivers and mountains. Tailakampi was a commercial hub in 10th to 13th century.It is believed that most of the temples were funded by the 'Banik' or business people.  Temples   Description by Beglar  In 1878, an Armenian-Indian archeologist Joseph David Beglar, gave the first ever description about the temples of Telkupi in his report to the Archaeological Survey of India. According to his report, the place was full of temples and the number was higher than any other place in the Chota Nagpur Plateau region. The temples were divided into three clusters, the largest group among them was situated to the north of Telkupi village near the Damodar river, the second group to the west of the village and the third group to the south-eastern part of the village. = First group of temples = * No. 1: This south-facing temple, made of stone, was situated in the northernmost part of the first cluster, consisting of a single cell, with a lingam as the deity of worship inside, situated below the still of entrance.

It was also known as Hillcrest Hospital. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Ridge was built in 1861 by Edward Christopher Merewether, who had arrived in Newcastle as the General Superintendent of the Australian Agricultural Company, and his wife, whose family owned two land grants in the area now known as Merewether.Newcastle Local Studies website, 2006 It was later used as a maternity hospital owned by the Salvation Army, but fell into disuse by the late 1970s and, in the early 1980s, a development consortium applied to demolish the house. However the NSW government intervened by permanently protecting it with a permanent conservation order. It then passed into private ownership and has been restored by the owners.  Description  left The Ridge is one of the most historically significant buildings in Merewether for its associations with the Merewether family from 1861, and its subsequent use as a hospital by the Salvation Army. It has landmark qualities perched on the edge of the Merewether ridge, with its steeply pitched gable roof. At the beginning of the 21st century the house forms a visually prominent built form within an area now well known for its large modern mansions. It also has interiors of historical interest.

It killed a young woman and injured 60 other people. The apparent target was the offices of the Lebanese newspaper Al-Watan al-Arabi. Background Relations between France and Syria were generally excellent until the assassination of the French Ambassador to Lebanon, Louis Delamare, on 4 September 1981. Delamare was shot in West Beirut nearby a Syrian Army roadblock during the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. An investigation from the Al-Watan Al-Arabi newspaper, which is anti-Syrian, found that Lebanese Shi'ites acting on behalf of the Syrian special services were responsible. This account was soon spread throughout the French press. In March a high speed Le Capitole train in France was bombed, killing five people. On 4 April 1982, Israeli diplomat Yacov Barsimantov was assassinated in Paris, apparently the work of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) or the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions (LARF). Motives The bombing was also speculated to be linked to two comrades of Venezuelan international terrorist Ilich Ram√≠rez S√°nchez, also known as \\"Carlos the Jackal\\" - Bruno Br√©guet and Magdalena Kopp - who were both facing trial that day after being arrested on 16 February in Paris. The Al-Watan Al-Arabi reportedly annoyed Syrian President Hafez el-Assad. Carlos, Br√©guet and Kopp had already been granted asylum in Syria. It is thought Br√©guet and Kopp were already attempting to bomb the offices that day as 5 kg of nitropenta explosives were found in their car when they were arrested. According to French prosecutors in 2011, Carlos masterminded the attacks partly to force the authorities to free Br√©guet and Kopp. Aftermath After the bombing, the French government expelled two Syrian diplomats and recalled its ambassador from Damascus for consultation. Interior Minister Gaston Defferre stopped short however from blaming the Syrian government on the bombing. The Syrian Foreign Minister Abdul Halim Khaddam's visit to France scheduled that night was cancelled. Syria denied any link with the bombing and responded by ordering out two French diplomats and recalling its envoy from Paris. On 25 May 1982, a car bomb inside the French Embassy in Beirut killed 11 people. Br√©guet and Kopp were charged in court, but were given lighter sentences following threatening letters from Carlos to French authorities. They were later paroled in 1985.Holy war. Wilhelm Dietl. Macmillan, 1984. , . p. 150 In 2011, Carlos was tried for involvement in the attack. He denied any connections with the attack, including the Capitole train bombing in March and other attacks in 1983.

It was built from 1875 to 1895. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The land on which both Edinglassie and Rous Lench are located was the original Portion 4 of the Parish of Brougham in the County of Durham. This comprised an area of 1280 acres the deed of grant for which was issued to George Forbes on 1 August 1839. Like many grants of the period the land had been occupied for many years before it was officially surveyed and the deed grant issued. The Italianate homestead is a low cottage constructed of rendered brick and corrugated iron featuring a roof ridge extended to form small gables, four panel doors, large four-pane sash windows, panelled ceilings, and gunstock stiles on French windows at the side. A photograph dating from the 1880s showing the first part of Edinglassie adjacent to an earlier hipped roof house indicates that the original house was demolished and/or rebuilt when the present Edinglassie was completed in . It is therefore not likely that Rous Lench is the original homestead. The homestead was designed by John Horbury Hunt.  Description  The homestead is a low cottage constructed of rendered brick and corrugated iron featuring a roof ridge extended to form small gables, four panel doors, large four-pane sash windows, panelled ceilings, and gunstock stiles on French windows at the side. A photograph dating from the 1880s showing the first part of Edinglassie adjacent to an earlier hipped roof house indicates that the original house was demolished and/or rebuilt when the present Edinglassie was completed in . It is therefore not likely that Rous Lench is the original homestead.  Heritage listing  As at 31 July 2007, the Edinglassie property including the Edinglassie homestead, associated buildings and Rous Lench cottage are closely associated with the earliest European occupation of the area and collectively represent one of the earliest land grants of the initial settlement of the Hunter Valley. The Edinglassie property demonstrates various phases of human activities such as settlement and clearing, water supply and management, sheep and cattle running, development of specialist cattle breeding activities, recreation, viticulture and horse breeding. The Edinglassie homestead with its associated outbuildings and Rous Lench cottage are good architectural examples of their type and style. The Edinglassie property demonstrates an excellent application of the Arcadian design approach to the siting of structures and elements in the landscape which is rare in the region. The place is also significant because it is associated with George Forbes, the original grantee, who was one of the \\"gentry\\" settlers in the early settlement of the area. It is associated with a prominent family, the Whites, a leading pastoral dynasty, who were synonymous with the opening and development of the region. It illustrates the degree of opulence achieved and lifestyles led by the leading pastoral families in the area. It is associated with a significant Australian architect, John Horbury Hunt. It is a well known landmark, and has provided a community focus over a number of generations form the turn of the 19th century. It has extant and potential intact archaeological evidence capable of helping interpret past occupation and lifestyles of the area. The siting of the homestead is intrinsic to its significance.

Two Americans were killed and 23 people, including Germans, were injured. The blast was powerful caused debris and damage to the base including to 30 vehicles, trees and windows. The attack was orchestrated by the left-wing Red Army Faction (RAF) and the French Action Directe groups. It was the worst attack on an American installation in Germany since Ramstein Air Base was bombed in 1981, also by the RAF. The attack came less than two months after the Frankfurt airport bombing, although the two were not related. In preparation for the attack, RAF members lured and killed American soldier Edward Pimental in Wiesbaden. They used Pimental's identification to gain entry into the air base the next day where they carried out the attack. The bomb was placed in a Volkswagen Passat with fake American military plates. Victims One of the fatal victims of the attack was 19-year-old Airman Frank H. Scarton from Woodhaven, Michigan, who was on temporary duty in West Germany and normally serving at Charleston Air Force Base in South Carolina. The other victim was Becky Jo Bristol of San Antonio, Texas, the wife of Senior Airman John Bristol, who served at the Rhein-Main base. Aftermath A White House spokesman called it a \\"shameful attack\\". Eva Haule, leader of the RAF, was arrested in 1986. In 1993, by now already serving a 15-year prison sentence for other terror offences, she was tried for the Rhein-Main base attack. Her defending lawyer claimed the attack was a ‚Ä≥legitimate means of resistance against American imperialism‚Ä≥. She was released on parole in 2007.

She was best known to television audiences for her starring roles in the Chilean telenovelas La Colorina (1977) and Machos (2003). In 1992, Ross was honored with the title Knight of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by the Italian government.Los riesgos de una medalla ‚Äì Liliana Ross Biography Early life Ross was born Liliana Piera Marina Brescia Clerici in Genoa, Italy. She was raised in Pegli, a neighborhood in Genoa. Her first language was Italian. She emigrated to Chile with her parents when she was six-years old to escape World War II. She later recalled witnessing bombs falling on an Italian beach as her father ordered her to hide under a boat. Career In Chile, Ross appeared in more than twenty telenovelas and television dramas on four major networks ‚Äì Canal 13, Televisi√≥n Nacional de Chile (TVN), Mega, and Chilevisi√≥n (CHV). In 1977, Ross was cast in the lead role on TVN telenovela, La Colorina, which aired for 88 episodes and launched her professional career. Ross became best known to domestic and international television audiences for her starring role in the 2003 Canal 13 telenovela series, Machos. Ross portrayed Valentina Fern√°ndez, the matriarch of the Mercader family and mother of the seven Mercader brothers ‚Äì √Ålex (Jorge Zabaleta), Ariel (), Alonso (), Antonio (Pablo D√≠az), Ad√°n (Gonzalo Valenzuela), Amaro (Diego Mu√±oz), and Armando (). In contrast to her role on the show, Ross had three daughters and no sons in real life. In one of the show's most memorable scenes, Ross' character died surrounded by her on-screen husband, played by H√©ctor Noguera, and their sons. The episode, considered a landmark in Chilean television history, was watched by an entire generation of Chilean viewers. Ross' last television credit was the 2012 telenovela series, La Sex√≥loga. In a July 2014 interview with Radio Cooperativa to promote her new comedic radio series, Sexitosas, Ross remarked that she would have loved to continue working in television, but she was no longer being offered roles in that particular medium. She told Radio Cooperativa at the time, \\"I've asked for a job, but I have no idea why they have stopped calling me.\\" However, she continued to appear in several Chilean films throughout the 2010s, including Qu√© pena tu boda in 2011, Qu√© pena tu familia in 2012, and Mam√° ya crec√≠ in 2014. Aside from television, much of Ross' work centered on the theater as an actor, director and producer. For example, Ross directed a 2000 Chilean stage adaptation of The Full Monty, which starred Gonzalo Valenzuela. Honors and other work In 2001, Ross teamed with her daughter, Daniela Miller, and photographer Pia Cosmelli to open a photography studio in Santiago called De Cuerpo y Alma (Body and Soul), which offered nude photography sessions to ordinary people. The premise of the project, which accepted clients of all shapes and sizes, was that \\"there are no ugly bodies,\\" according to Ross. Ross was honored by both the Chilean and Italian governments, as well as several publications, for her contributions to the arts. In 2003, the magazine Cara named honored Ross as its woman of the year. The Asociaci√≥n de Periodistas de Espect√°culos, Arte y Cultura de Chile awarded Ross, and nine other prominent actresses, with the Premio APES award in 2011. Notably, the Italian government named Ross to the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 1992. Later life Ross began to suffer from cognitive difficulties in 2016 and 2017, which led to her retirement from acting. She was later diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, though both she and her family kept the diagnosis a private matter. Liliana Ross died at her home in Santiago, Chile, on June 10, 2018, at the age of 79. Her funeral was held at the Inmaculada Concepci√≥n de Vitacura. Personal life Ross met her first husband, director Hugo Miller, while both were students at Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. The couple in 1963 had three daughters ‚Äì Daniela, Vanessa and Moira. Like Ross, two of her daughters, Vanessa Miller and Moira Miller, became professional actresses. Hugo Miller died in 1997. In 2003, married her second husband, theater producer Raoul Pinno. They remained together until her death in 2018.

Among its members are the Umbrella organisation of Dutch universities (VSNU), the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), the National Library of the Netherlands (KB), and the like. The Platform brings together the parties that have initiated, formulated, or support the National Plan Open Science, that has been presented to the Dutch government in the beginning of 2017.National Plan Open Science (English version) thumb  Ambition  NPOS aims to promote open access to scholarly literature and re-use of research data, and has appointed the ex- Rector Magnificus, Karel Luyben, (President, or in the UK also Vice- Chancellor) of the Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands as National Coordinator Open Science. The organisation aims furthermore to reform the manner in which researchers are assessed in such a way that the assessment actually stimulates open science. NPOS notes a lack of openness in the scientific culture demonstrated, for instance, by published articles describing research paid for by public funds and of interest to a wide audience habitually being behind paywalls, or access to them being otherwise encumbered. In addition to that, the publish or perish culture prevalent in science incentivises researchers to publish, as much as possible, in journals with a high citation score. And finally, the organisation is drawing attention to the lack of research data stewardship, as a result of which valuable data sets regularly are being lost, research cannot be replicated, or experiments need to be carried out again without the benefit of being able to use what has been done before. thumb  Background  The ideal of open access to scientific research results is a worldwide ambition in the scientific world and has been around for a few decades, but progress is considered too slow, as the Budapest Open Access Initiative was already launched in 2001 followed, in 2003, by the Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing and subsequently by a whole series of other, similar, declarations. The issue is gradually reaching the agendas of government policy in countries, states, and supra- national organisations such as the EU, and in 2013 this was the case in The Netherlands, where the government declared that open access to published results must be the standard for scientific research carried out in the country. Letter to Parliament on open access to publications (2016) In 2016, during its stint as EU chair, the Dutch government organised a conference on open science, upon which a report was published entitled Amsterdam Call for Action on Open Science.'Amsterdam Call for Action on Open Science', (2016) (in English)  See also  *Official website (English version)  References  Category:Open access projects Category:Academic publishing Category:Electronic publishing Category:Scholarly communication Category:Free culture movement Category:Open access journals ","title":"National Platform Open Science"},{"id":"57848640","text":"Hugh Henry James Gray (1921 - c.2003) was Archdeacon of Ossory and Leighlin from 1983 to 1992.

Its chief geographical features are Carn Lough, small streams, a dug well and spring wells. Kilnacross is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 110 acres.

There are a lot of reasons to doubt the above account. Firstly it is a copy of a similar miracle performed on by Saint of Fenagh, County Leitrim. page 119 Secondly it is also a copy of a similar miracle performed on by Saint Berach of Termonbarry. paragraph 65 Thirdly the had no presence in County Cavan until about two hundred years after the time lived. It is evident the fable was a 14th century fabrication by the Augustinian monks of the nearby Drumlane monastery. They used it to extort tribute from the O'Rourke and O'Reilly clans by pretending the ancestor of those clans, , had promised tribute to Drumlane. In the D√∫chas folklore collection a similar tale is told to explain the name of Kilnagross townland in County Leitrim.

In the Plantation of Ulster King James VI and I by grant dated 27 June 1610, granted the Manor of Keylagh, which included one poll in Killnagrosse, to John Achmootie, a Scottish Groom of the Bedchamber. His brother Alexander Achmootie was granted the neighbouring Manor of Dromheada. On 16 August 1610 John Aghmootie sold his lands in Tullyhunco to James Craig. On 1 May 1611 James Craig leased, inter alia, \\"1 poll of Killingrosse to Eugene mac Cahell McKernan\\". On 29 July 1611 Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester and others reported that \\"John Auchmothy and Alexander Auchmothye have not appeared at the lands awarded to them.

The Roman Plague of 590 was an epidemic of plague that affected the city of Rome in the year 590. Probably bubonic plague, it was part of the first plague pandemic that followed the great plague of Justinian, which began in the 540s and may have killed more than 100 million Europeans before spreading to other parts of the world and which lasted until the end of Late Antiquity. The plague was described by the bishop and chronicler Gregory of Tours and later chronicler Paul the Deacon.  History  The winter before the plague broke out, many of Rome's granaries were damaged when the Tiber flooded in November 589. Gregory of Tours recounts that portentous serpents and dragons were seen in the waters. The epidemic began in early 590; Gregory's narrative is not specific but death came rapidly to infected patients and the chronicler describes the disease as a 'plague of the groin' (), factor which aid its identification as bubonic plague. Bishop of Rome Pelagius II died of plague in February 590 and Pope Gregory I, then a deacon, was elected his successor. Gregory was previously praefectus urbi before becoming a monk. Gregory had previously served as an apocrisiarius, a kind of papal ambassador to the East Roman Empire, where he had likely been influenced by Byzantine practices. The imperial capital of Constantinople, consecrated to the protection of the Mother of God (the Theotokos), had a practice whereby processions of the faithful through the city streets chanting psalms and kyrie eleison to allay God's wrath. Gregory had likely witnessed these processions during his stay in Constantinople.Andrew J. Ekonomou. Byzantine Rome and the Greek Popes. Lexington Books, 2007,  Papal processions  When the plague was in Rome in 590 and Gregory was still a deacon, he organized such a procession to take place in Rome wherein seven groups would hold processions through the streets of the city and ending at the basilica of Mary Major to ask for the Virgin Mary's protection. The processions took place on April 25, 590. The Marian aspect of the procession was perhaps unusual at the time, since Rome was traditionally associated with St Peter's protection, but it may have been a result of Byzantine influence, since Constantinople was often put under the Theotokos's protection during times of crisis. The seven processional groups were: 1) clergy, 2) abbots and monks, 3) abbesses and nuns, 4) men 5) married women 6) widows and 7) children (also perhaps including the poor of Rome). The reason for the processions was because plagues and other national disasters were typically interpreted at the time as being the chastisement of God for sinfulness, and therefore to appease God's wrath, these measures were taken. Eighty people collapsed during the procession as a result of being infected by plague.  Pope Gregory's Vision  Statue of St Michael on Hadrian's Mausoleum, by Peter Anton von Verschaffelt (1753) According to later legend, Pope Gregory saw a vision as the procession approached the mausoleum of the Roman emperor Hadrian, on the right bank of the Tiber near the Vatican Hill. The pope beheld St Michael the Archangel brandishing and then sheathing his sword atop the monument, which was interpreted to signify that God's wrath had been turned back, and the plague supposedly stopped at that moment, following which the faithful thanked the Mother of God. The 2nd century AD imperial tomb, which became a fortress in late Antiquity, subsequently became known as . In the 18th century, a bronze sculpture was set on the summit of Castel Sant'Angelo to commemorate the legend, portraying the winged archangel in Roman armour and designed by Peter Anton von Verschaffelt in 1753.

Based on the British sitcom the Grimleys, it starred Michael Cera as Mitchell Grubb, Randy Quaid as his father, and Carol Kane as his mother. It would have premiered on November 3, 2002, but was cancelled two days before its planned premiere. History The Grubbs was announced by Fox in May 2002, and was intended to premiere on November 3 of that year in Fox's 9:30 PM Sunday time slot, right after Malcolm in the Middle. The series was co-produced by Granada Entertainment USA and 20th Century Fox Television, in a partnership with Universal Television. In a statement when the series was originally announced, Granada Entertainment USA president Antony Root said, \\"With vivid characters, sharp writing and irreverent humour, The Grubbs has all the makings of a great success for Fox.\\" But although Fox had originally ordered thirteen episodes of the series, in September 2002 they announced this would be reduced to eight, and the series ended up being cancelled in November 2002, two days before the show would have premiered. Although no episodes of the Grubbs were ever aired, the series did help Cera land an audition for the sitcom Arrested Development, in which he played George Michael Bluth. The Grubbs also served as Cera's debut playing a role on American network television. Plot Like The Grimleys, The Grubbs revolved around an underachieving, blue-collar family. But while The Grimleys was set in Dudley, West Midlands, England in the 1970s, The Grubbs was set in the present day in the fictitious American town of Hackville. Joshua Sternin, the Grubbs executive producer, said that Hackville is located in America's \\"Steel Belt\\". He also said that Hackville was inspired by the western part of Pennsylvania and by the state's city of Allentown. Cast {  - ! Actor !! Character in the Grubbs !!

It was ranked the worst new fall series of 2002 in a Daily Variety poll of television critics.

It seems to have been named for Iphistius, an obscure hero, with the alternative form, Hephaestiadae, arising from the mistaken assumption that it was named after the god Hephaestus, a much more familiar figure. The two names misled the geographer William Martin Leake to identify Iphistiadae and Hephaestiadae as two separate demes. Iphistiadae is mentioned in the Ethnica of Stephanus of Byzantium, and the lexicon of Hesychius of Alexandria.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, vol. I, p. 326 (No. 29, \\"Iphistiadae or Hephaestiadae\\"). Plato owned an estate at Iphistiadae, which by will he left to a certain youth named Adeimantus, presumably a younger relative, as Plato had an elder brother or uncle by this name. Diogenes La√´rtius describes the provision: > \\"These things have been left and devised by Plato: the estate in > Iphistiadae, bounded on the north by the road from the temple at Cephisia, > on the south by the temple of Heracles in Iphistiadae, on the east by the > property of Archestratus of Phrearrhi, on the west by that of Philippus of > Chollidae: this it shall be unlawful for anyone to sell or alienate, but it > shall be the property of the boy Adeimantus to all intents and purposes > ...\\"Diogenes La√´rtius, \\"The Life of Plato\\", 41. According to this passage, Iphistiadae was home to a Heracleion, or temple of Heracles, from which the modern municipality of Heraklion, corresponding to the location of ancient Iphistiadae, derives its name. Thus, Iphistiadae was about five miles northeast of Athens, two miles west of Athmonon (modern Marousi), and three miles southwest of Cephisia (modern Kifissia).

Worried Vedashree Rathod seeks help from her friend Divya Sharma, a psychic wizardess and a reevaavanshi (member of a clan of monster-hunters) who wards off the evil eye by slashing Mohana's plait, rendering Mohana powerless. Once cornered, Divya seals Mohana in a temple enchanted by Mantras. Divya goes missing soon after. Vedashree and Shekhar adopt Ansh and Kajal. =18 years later= Ansh and Kajal grow up with their cousins, Neha and Rishi in Mumbai. Ansh discovers his superpowers, but is unaware that he is a daavansh, the hybrid offspring of a daayan/daanav and a human. He can be saved from turning to the dark side only by a girl who has Durga's trishula symbol as her birthmark, and is referred to as daivik (divine conduit). Divya's daughter Piya Sharma, has that symbol behind her neck. Separated from her parents in a very young age, Piya comes to Mumbai in search of her missing mother. Sparks fly between Ansh and Piya. Piya finds her father, Nishant Sharma who happens to be her college professor. Mohana sends a puppet daayan, Ruby, with a fake daivik symbol to marry Ansh, so she can return. Ansh and Vedashree fall under Ruby's control, during which Ruby and Ansh are married. Mohana is released from the seal and regains her powers. Mohana returns back to Ansh and he learns about his real mother. Piya's childhood friend and obsessive lover, Naman, attempts to marry her by taking advantage of his unwell mother, and Piya's guardian, a visually-impaired priestess, but Ansh stops the wedding. Fearing Ansh's budding romance with Piya, Mohana sends a message summoning Ruby's father, Bhaisasur, an asura from Paataal Lohk to scare away Piya. Bhaisasur attacks Ansh instead of Piya, much to Mohana's horror. A distressed Piya invokes Devi-Maa for help. She enters into a religious dance and kills Bhaisasur with her trident. Everyone learns that Piya is the real Daivik. Nishant realises that Piya is his daughter. Ansh learns about his Daavansh self and that Mohana and Vedeshree are half-sisters. Piya's sister, Saavi is hypnotised by Mohana and releases Dilruba, a chudel, to separate Piya and Ansh. Dilruba casts a raakhchakra, (hex) to capture Piya and Ansh, but Piya saves Ansh and finds herself trapped inside Dilruba's hex. Ansh fools Dilruba due to which her hex breaks, freeing Piya. Mohana agrees to Ansh and Piya's marriage and frees Divya, who is later revealed to be a Sarpika(serpent). Connecting the dots, Divya realises Mohana's intentions. Mohana kills Divya but Divya outsmarts Mohana by transferring her serpentine powers to Piya. Ansh and Piya are married. Piya learns Mohana's real motive of wanting to feed on Ansh on the day of red moon eclipse: to become immortal. The churel makes Piya fall into an eternal sleep. With Piya gone, Ansh turns to the dark side and becomes an extremely powerful Daavansh who cares for no one but himself. Piya returns with the help of trinetra-mani, a gem powered by Shiva's third eye and brings Ansh back to his senses. Piya exposes Mohana's intentions to the Rathods, after which Ansh expels Mohana. Later, Piya and Ansh consummate their marriage. Dola, Mohana's twin sister and Ruby's mother, a two-headed daayan who rules the Swapna-Lohk (Dream World) unleashes horror and threatens to kill Ansh. The Rathods manage to kill Dola, but she is revived by Mohana. The sisters fool Piya into transferring her serpentine powers to Ansh. Believing that Piya is devoid of powers, the sisters try to burn her alive using Tharal- agni a Daayan fuel. Piya invokes Devi-Maa for help and her daivik powers return. Mohana and Dola are turned into stone statues, but are freed by Ruby. A Sarp (snake-man) hypnotises Ansh and steals his Sarpika powers. He disguises himself as Ansh and targets Piya's Trinetra-mani gem. Ansh and Piya combine their powers and defeat the Sarp. Mohana feeds on the serpent disguised as Ansh during the muhurta of the red moon eclipse and becomes a Sarpayan possessing combined powers. Dola sees Mohana's horoscope, which predicts that Ansh's child will put an end to her. The Rathods celebrate Piya's pregnancy. Ansh learns about Mohana's intentions to kill Piya and their unborn child. Realising the danger he poses, Ansh heavy-heartedly separates from Piya until the baby is born. After six months, Piya gives birth to a baby boy in an abandoned Shiva temple. Mohana tries to kill the child several times, but fails. =Six months later= Piya and Ansh are overwhelmed to see the superpowers of their son, Aditya Rathod. Mohana has still not given up her mission of killing Aditya. She kidnaps him and pushes him off a cliff, but Aditya is saved by Ansh. Aditya smites Mohana dead with a trident. The Rathod family discard her ashes in a river. Vedashree starts becoming evil and becomes fond of heavy jewellery and things that a daayan appreciates. Piya grows suspicious about Vedashree's changed behaviour and finds out that she has become a daayan. Vedashree successfully converts Piya into a daayan, but the daayan's power cannot overpower the divine powers within her. Piya succeeds in convincing Vedashree about the kindness within her. Vedashree removes her daayan plait and throws it into the same river where Mohana's ashes were thrown before. Mohana acquires a mermaid's body and returns for revenge when she reacquires her plait. Mohana tricks Piya into becoming a mermaid so that she can return. However, Mohana is threatened to be taken back to Kohra-Lohk, the graveyard of all evil powers and realises that only a Daivik can save her. Mohana helps Piya regain her human form under the condition that Piya must help her in return. Shalaka, the queen of Kohra-Lohk poisons the Rathods and upon realising her mistake, she gives the Kohrayan dagger to Ansh which has the power to push a person back to their past life. Ansh stabs his family and himself sending everyone back to the past. Rathods travels two years back in time. Ansh touches Piya's earring and remembers everything. He finds Piya, makes her remember the past and the two reconcile. The Rathod family reach Pravesh Dwar. They jump through it, and return to the present. = Two years later = The Rathod family return to the present. Naman becomes a better person and trains himself to become a Revavanshi. He marries Dilruba. Ansh discovers he has a twin brother, Karan (Harsh Rajput) who is handicapped but possess magical powers. Karan, manipulated by Mohana, assumes that it was Divya who made his wife, Maansi and their child, Krish into stone statues, comes back to take revenge on Divya's family. Karan convinces Rathods to help him save his wife and child without revealing that Piya and Adi will turn to stone, while Piya is suspicious about Karan since she knew that Divya can never attack innocent people. Nishant and Ansh learn Karan's motives but they couldn't save Piya and Adi. Karan reveals his magical wings and knocks out Ansh. Maansi and Krish are freed from their stone form but it is revealed that Maansi is a daayan and a puppet of Mohana; Mohana had sent Maansi to obtain Karan's magical wings. Ansh and Karan team up and attack Mohana and Maansi. Karan makes a tough decision to turn Maansi, Krish and himself into stone in order to save Piya and Adi, leaving Ansh heartbroken, but before leaving, Karan transfers his magical wings to Ansh. The family celebrates Adi's first birthday. Mohana turns Vedashree into her puppet, to get her things done. Vedashree tries to tarnish Piya's image in front of Rathods, especially Ansh. Piya accidentally throws Vedashree off the terrace, who gets hospitalised while Mohana transfers Vedashree's life into a \\"Praan- Pyala\\" and threatens Piya to leave the Rathods forever by breaking Ansh's heart. Piya acts cold towards Ansh and leaves the House without Adi. Nishant and Saavi follow Mohana and find that the Praan-Pyala is hidden in a daayan- island floating in the sky. Mohana demands Piya to leave the city; she agrees on the condition that she needs her son along with her. Mohana agrees and helps her to get Adi but intentionally leaves Piya's earring in Ansh's room to mislead him. An enraged Ansh goes to Nishant's office to get Adi back, however he learns that Piya is innocent. Ansh and Piya reach the Daayan island but Mohana flees from the place with Vedashree's Praan pyala. Piya gives a part of her life to Vedashree to save her, but starts to lose her strength. Nishant brings his sister-Trishila, a Revavanshi, who has the power to give life to the dead. Trishila promises the family to save Piya, and succeeds, while Ansh is suspicious about Trishila's intentions. Ansh finds out that Trishila is here for some other purpose and eventually finds out that she has come back to bring Piya's mother, Divya back to life so that Divya can forever put an end to evil powers. Divya creates a sword named Pralay-Talvar. Divya and Mohana hear a disembodied voice which reveals that once the Pralay-Talvar is released, the Pralay-Yuddh / war between divine powers representing Divya and Evil powers representing Mohana will begin. The one whose blood flows first will be defeated and the entire clan of theirs will get destroyed. Rathods learn about the war and tries to stop it. Ansh and Piya tries to destroy the sword but in vain. Divya, sacrifices her life by stabbing herself with the Sword to save a poisoned Ansh and to kick start the war. The Pralay-Yuddh starts with all the supernatural evil entities at one side and all the Revavanshis, Rathods and Ansh on the other side. To value her mother's sacrifice, Piya transforms into the MahaKali Avtaar and destroys the evil forces and vows to destroy the world. Mohana flees, while all other evil entities gets burned to death. After Piya comes to her senses, she regrets not supporting Divya and realises that Divya was right and her actions were for the benefit of the coming generation. Piya burns Divya's pyre and she and Ansh sacrifice their powers to stay away from evil and live a normal life. They diminish Adi's powers. However, Piya is still able to use her powers and harms Adi by mistake, angering Ansh and believes that Piya did not sacrifice her powers purposefully. Piya gets tired of justifying herself and Ansh's accusations and leaves the house. Piya realizes that she is pregnant again, and that her powers are those of her unborn child. Piya goes to confess to Ansh, but he doesn't give Piya a chance to speak. Later a heartbroken Piya returns to her home to stay with Guru Maa. =Six years later= Ansh and Piya live separately with Adi (Diaan Talaviya) and Pari (Kisha Arora), the latter possesses daayan powers. Mohana conjures a monster called Bhasmika (Sana Amin Sheikh) who has the powers of all the evil entities. Mohana names the monster Urvashi, who enters the Rathod household to marry Ansh and bear his child. Adi sees through the true form of Urvashi but is bullied anyway. Piya brings Pari to Mumbai for her studies. Adi and Pari become friends at school. Once they realise they are siblings, both try to make their parents reconcile. Urvashi constantly attempts to kill Adi as he is a major hindrance between her and Ansh. During the Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations, Urvashi, in an attempt to kidnap Adi, kidnaps Pari by mistake. Piya returns to the Rathod household after six years and demands the release of her daughter. The Rathod family learns that Pari is Piya and Ansh's daughter. The Rathods capture Mohana in the same temple at Bandap. Adi reveals Urvashi's true form and gets kidnapped with Pari on an island. Ansh and Piya regain their powers and with the help of their children they defeat Urvashi and return to the Rathod house. The Rathod family wants Ansh and Piya to reunite, but Piya is reluctant due to Ansh's mistrust, her six-year separation from Adi, and being abandoned during her pregnancy. Meanwhile, the ghost of Bhasmika rises from the ashes and possesses Piya to get intimate with Ansh. Ansh realises this and stabs her with the daivik dagger. Bhasmika successfully gets her deeds done, creates a pearl and leaves while Piya's soul ascends to Namah Lohk. Shiva and Narayan invite her to ascend to heaven but her soul is reluctant. Ansh sacrifices himself, reaches Namah Lok where his love is tested by the Gods, and retrieves Piya's soul. Ansh and Piya reunite and the family celebrates with the occasion of Pari and Vedashree's birthday which fall on the same day. Mohana returns to her daayan form after sucking all the life force out of Bhasmika and acquires Bhasmika's powers. Nishant, Naman, and Saavi realise the pearl has grown into an egg. Pari falls under Mohana's spell and helps her come out of captivity using the evil powers of the egg. Mohana whisks the egg off to its right place to hatch. Out of the egg comes the first Ekayaan of the world, known as Prathmayan/Prathima (Salina Prakash), who is the birth mother of Vedashree, Mohana and Dola. She is the source of all evil entities in the world. Her primary goal is to turn her younger daughter Vedashree into an Ekaayan instead of her elder daughter Mohana, as the latter's shrewd and extremely cunning nature pose a danger for her. To achieve her motive, she wants to defeat the good represented by Goddess Durga with the evil at Dussehra. Pratima, Mohana and Pari start forming an evil army of human beings with the help of Prathmayan mantra, Naman, too, comes under Prathmayan's spell. Nishant prepares a potion that prevents them from falling under the spell of the prathmayan mantra. Naman and Pari break out of the spell and join their family to fight Prathmayan. Piya uses divine energy to invoke Goddess Durga's blessings and powers to kill Prathmayan using a Rama Setu arrow which they created with the help of information written in Divya's diary. After Prathmayan's departure, Piya is unable to fix her daivik dagger. She immerses it in water where the dagger is refixed by another Daivik Dev (Stavan Shinde). Dev reaches the Rathod House during the anniversary celebrations of Ansh and Piya disguised as Ruchi (Piya's cousin)'s fianc√©. Dev wants to win Piya at any cost and he implants a Daivik raksha dravya on Piya's body to prohibit intimacy between Ansh and Piya. On the day of Karva Chauth Dev attacks Ansh and leaves him for dead. He hypnotises all the family members to allow him to marry Piya in order to save Ansh. Mohana saves Ansh and helps him to save Piya. Dev eventually abducts Piya and forcefully ties his Kalasutra around her neck to enslave her. Piya outsmarts him and turns him into an ice statue. Ansh and Piya return home safely with their children on Diwali. Mohana get an opportunity to re-enter the Rathod's house as a return of her favours for helping Ansh and saving Piya. During the Diwali celebrations, Chaitali goes to the new neighbour's house to greet them. She learns that the new neighbour is in fact Vedashree's twin sister and a daayan, Kalashree (Ritu Chaudhary). Her motive is to unite with Vedashree to become a daayanjod, or a mahadaayan. Mohana constantly tries to warn the Rathods regarding the presence of a daayan in the neighbourhood, but her warnings are dismissed and she is imprisoned in a patal ketki dome. As Vedashree refuses to agree to Kalashree's demands, the latter targets the Rathod family and locks them into a daayan mirror. Everyone but Adi and Pari are locked inside the daayan mirror and Vedashree learns of her twin sister's actions. With the help of Daayan gem obtained from Mohana Adi Pari and Nishant brings the family back from the mirror. Vedashree, who had agreed to Kalashree's demands in her helplessness turns into ash. Mohana cautions the Rathod family about the dangers of the ash and demands that they dispose of it. The Rathods disagree in the hopes of bringing back Vedashree to life. Meanwhile, Naman becomes a chudail and faces much trouble to continue as a Reevavanshi. Saavi gives him the task to capture a evil power in order to continue being a Reevavanshi. Dilruba misreads the Naman and believes that Naman is in love with Saavi. Nishant discovers that Kalashree needs Prathmaayan's vow to become a mahadaayan, which is sent to her through the latter's hair. Piya, with the help of Mohana stops mahadaayan from being born. Mohana helps the Rathods in reviving Vedashree. In return, Mohana demands the Rathods support her in her alliance with Angad (Malhar Pandya) whom she fell in love with, unaware of his true identity. Angad is a Singha (a creature who is the sworn enemy of supernatural entities). Mohana loves Angad deeply and becomes a good person. Ansh on learning Angad's intentions, kills him on the day of her wedding to protect Mohana and his family. Mohana is traumatized after Angad's loss which makes her return to the dark side and swears to take revenge on Ansh. Mohana forgets all that she had promised herself when she had been in love, as her heart fills with hatred and turns vengeful. Ansh submits himself in front of Mohana so that his family is protected from Mohana's vengeance. Nevertheless, Mohana outsmarts him and transfers Pari's life force into a Praan-Pyaala. Ansh and Piya manage to save Pari through the help of Dilruba who sacrifices herself after giving birth to Dafli (Naman and Dilruba's daughter). However, Mohana had already mixed her blood into Pari's Praan-Pyaala which allows her to live inside Pari. Mohana executes her revenge in the Rathod house and manages to hurt Vedashree and frame Piya. Piya gets arrested by a CBI officer named Abhay. On the other side, Naman is amazed to discover the supernatural powers of his newborn daughter. Ansh saves Piya from jail and holds a Christmas party in house and tells Abhay the truth. Barkha (Mohana's lookalike) enters and shocks everyone. Nishant learns that Mohana wants to drink a potion \\"2 Chaand raat Ras\\", which is available only during a night with two moons. The Rathods and Reewawanshis trusts Barkha and set a trap for Mohana but the latter kills Abhay and Barkha in the process and escapes with the potion. Mohana tricks Ansh into drinking the potion which makes Ansh, the King of Evil Powers, who becomes evil than ever before. Piya's long lost brother, Ayush (also known as Adrishi) appears. With the help of Adrishi, Piya successfully brings Ansh back to his senses, however the potion enters into Ayush, making him evil. Mohana and Ayush team up to put an end to Rathods. They plan to send Rathods to moom, but Ayush returns to his senses and realises Mohana's intentions. Ayush forcefully takes Mohana to the moon with him. Mohana escapes from Ayush but loses her mental stability. The Rathods take advantage of her loss of powers to cure Piya, but Mohana regains her powers and learns about a future of her death by the hands of Ansh. She tricks Piya into promising to help kill her murderer, who is Ansh, in exchange to leave their lives forever. In the end she finally reveals that it was Ansh who would be her murderer. Ansh jumps into lava created by Mohana to save Piya from Mohana's trap but she follows him. Just as Mohana is crowned queen of the witches, Ansh and Piya rise from the dead, and Ansh kills Mohana for good.

On August 2019, the storyline of the series took a leap of six years. In the first week of February 2020, producer Gul Khan confirmed the end of season 1 and production of season 2 of the series. On 14 February 2020, the teaser of season 2 was released featuring Mona Lisa. Later, the promo featuring Mona Lisa and Sheezan Mohammad was released. Due to COVID-19 outbreak, on 19 March 2020 the shootings were stalled until 31 March 2020 before lockdown was announced. However, on 25 March 2020 lockdown was announced for 21 days then was extended till 3 May and again extended and the shootings could not resume after it. On 20 March 2020, the series was halted airing and was supposed to return after lockdown. But, as the lockdown was extended longer than expected and shootings were stalled indefinitely, in May 2020 the series' cancellation was confirmed. It was due to the high budget of the series causing losses. Reception Critical response India Today stated, \\"Although there is no dearth of chudails, dayans and shaitans in Indian TV, Gul's dayan stands apart. The character is loud and over the top, but is well-written and has a fascinating back story. Mona Lisa as Mohona is impressive, and the show is able to hold the interest of the viewer despite being a daily.\\" After its premiere, it received negative criticism from The Times of India which stated, \\"Right from the beginning to the end, the show fails to hold you as it is highly dramatic, and the background music adds to the woes. The railway station, the forest and the havelis are typical elements used in a supernatural thriller. They bring no novelty. The plot is incoherent as the background of the characters is not explained well. The show is painfully slow, the story is patchy and so are the scenes. Dialogues are retro and filmy. The list can go on. Monalisa and Harsh Rajput disappoint as actors. They play their parts with zero efficiency. The supporting cast is again average at its best.\\" However, speaking about the success of the series, The Times of India stated, \\"The majority of the scenes are shot using chroma and the makers add special effects that add to the quality of the episodes. The makers have made a make-believe world with Mohana's story and it's quite an enchanting and exciting one just like your dadima's childhood 'evil vs good' stories\\". Ratings The first season opened to a TRP of 1.8 and 4.2 million impressions featuring in top 20 shows. Soundtrack Nazar's soundtrack is written by Divy Nidhi Sharma and composed by Sanjeev Srivastava.

Bolles, Representative Women of Colorado, 1914 Jenette H. Bolles (1862 or 1863‚Äì1930), also known as Nettie Bolles, was an American medical doctor. She was the first woman to study and have a career as an osteopath and the first osteopath in the state of Colorado. She held a number of positions in the medical field and was a suffragette. Early life and education Jenette Hubbard was born on September 12, 1862 or 1863 in Douglas County, Kansas. Her parents were Martha Jenette (Merrill) Hubbard and David Hubbard. She attended public school in Olathe, Kansas before studying and graduating from Kansas State University with a B.S. degree in 1885. Bolles became interested in osteopathy based upon the treatment her family received by Dr. Andrew Still. Her father had been seriously wounded by gunfire and left for dead during border skirmishes in the 1850s and Still removed the bullet and restored her father‚Äôs health. She was also satisfied later by the treatment that her mother received after she was paralyzed from a fall. She then decided to further her education by studying osteopathy. She graduated from the American School of Osteopathy in Kirksville, Missouri in 1894. In 1908, she received a master's degree from the University of Denver. She was a member of the Pi Beta Phi sorority. Career Upon graduation from the School of Osteopathy, she was accepted as a member of the faculty and became a professor of anatomy. She established a career as an osteopath and was the first woman to sustain her career. There were other women in her graduating class, but she was the only woman to pursue a long-standing career. She practice osteopathy, wrote about it, and taught it. She was also the first female educator in the field of osteopathy. She specialized in diseases of the urinary system, bladder, and kidneys. She was the first editor and publisher of the Journal of Osteopathy. In 1896 she moved to Denver, becoming the state's first osteopath. Bolles founded the Western Institute for Osteopathy in 1897. The school, a charter member of the Associated Colleges of Osteopathy, maintained a course of four-five month terms. She was the president and her husband was the dean. It was named Bolles Institute of Osteopathy after her husband received his degree in 1898, and then in 1900 it was named College of Osteopathy. The school was transferred in 1904 to the American School of Osteopathy in Missouri. She held state and national positions in the medical field. In 1910, she addressed the National Association at San Francisco. Bolles served on the Colorado Board of Medical Examiners, the first osteopath to do so. She was offered the appointment to the State Medical Board by Governor John F. Shafroth, but she turned it down because they did not recognize osteopathy. She was a member of the national, state, and local osteopathic associations. She was the founding president of the American Colleges of Osteopathy in 1898. The prior year, she was the vice president of the American Association for the Advancement of Osteopathy, now known as the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). She became the first woman to be nominated for president of the AOA in 1917. She received the AOA Distinguished Service Certificate for \\"Pioneering in Osteopathy as a Profession for Women\\" in 1925. Bolles helped found the Osteopathic Women's National Association and served as president three times. Personal life She married Newton A. Bolles in 1887, who was also a graduate of the School of Osteopathy and received his degree in 1898. They had two daughters, Helen Louise, born in 1898 and Ester, born in 1900. Bolles was an active member of the Mother‚Äôs Congress, now called the Parent Teachers Association, and served on the Child Hygiene Committee. She served as the representative for Colorado at the final International Congress of Child Welfare in Washington, D.C.. She was a suffragette, Congregationalist, and a Republican. She died on February 23, 1930. Her daughter Ester, her son-in-law C. Robert Starks, and grandson C. Robert Starks Jr. all became osteopaths.

Origin and variants  Trenholm is a habitational name from the village of \\"Trenholme\\" near the market town of Stokesley in the county of North Yorkshire in the North of England. According to the Oxford Dictionary of English place names, it is derived from the pre-7th century Old Norse words \\"trani\\" meaning \\"crane,\\" and \\"holmr,\\" (\\"holm\\") meaning \\"islet\\" or \\"flat lands\\". Retrieved 7 July 2018.

First found in Yorkshire, the first bearers of the surname would have been from the village of Trenholme where they would have adopted the name as a habitational marker to identify themselves as natives of the village. Retrieved 7 July 2018. This practice became very common as people started to leave their original homes to move to more distant locations, especially as the use of fixed surnames gradually became a legal necessity after the introduction of personal taxation. A relatively rare surname, it is historically concentrated in the county in and around the districts of Hambleton, Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough, and Stockton-on-Tees. Outside of England, variants of the surname can most commonly be found in Canada (most common) and the United States. Retrieved 8 July 2018. Until the gradual standardization of English spelling in the last few centuries, English lacked any comprehensive system of spelling. Consequently, spelling variations in names are frequently found in early Anglo-Saxon and later Anglo-Norman documents, meaning that a person's name was often spelled several different ways over a lifetime. As such, different variations of the Trenholm surname usually have the same origin. Retrieved 7 July 2018.

It is the terminus of the San Diego Trolley's Orange Line and is located adjacent to the new San Diego Central Courthouse in Downtown San Diego, on C Street between State and Union streets. The station opened on April 29, 2018, after nearly a year of construction, replacing America Plaza station as the Orange Line's western terminus. History After construction of the new San Diego Central Courthouse began in 2013, the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) approved plans to build a new light rail station to serve the building. The new station was also intended to become the terminus of the Orange Line, replacing the overcrowded America Plaza station near the Santa Fe Depot, which also serves the Blue Line. The station's location, directly in front of the courthouse, was opposed by county court officials and the sheriff due to potential security risks and disruptions to court operations. The MTS declined to move the station, but cooperated with the court to add shared CCTV and security features. MTS received a $31.9 million grant from the state government's cap and trade program in 2015 to fund the Courthouse station project and a vehicle replacement program. Construction on the station began in August 2017, requiring multiple weekend shutdowns of the Orange Line. Courthouse station was dedicated by local officials on April 27, 2018, and opened to passengers on April 29; it is the first new station on the trolley system since 2005. Station layout Orange Line trains at Courthouse station board and alight passengers using a single track leading to a side platform, while Blue and Silver line trains use two passing tracks.

Formed in the closing stages of the Caucasus Campaign, it protected the local Greek population from attacks by Muslim militias and the Ottoman army. It was disbanded a year later as a result of the Treaty of Poti. Background Caucasus Greek officer from the Kars Oblast The earliest artifacts belonging to the ancient Greek civilization ever found in Pontus date back to 1,000 BC. Most Greek colonies were established on the Pontus coast around 800 BC, with settlers originating from Ionia. By the time of the foundation of the Persian Mithridatic Kingdom of Pontus in 281 BC, the area had been thoroughly Hellenized. The conquest of the Pontic kingdom by the Roman Empire and its subsequent transition into the Byzantine Empire led to the Christianization of the region. Pontus was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1461 following the fall of Trebizond. Up until the middle of the 17th century the Ottomans focused on consolidating their power, granting Pontic Greeks a certain degree of autonomy. The following period that lasted until the end of the Russo- Turkish War (1768‚Äì1774) was marked by the implementation of the Chiflik system of land management and religious persecution of Christians, through forced conversions to Islam. The Russo-Turkish wars that followed led to unforeseen demographic changes, previously ethnically homogeneous due to its remote location and rough terrain, Pontus was to welcome thousands of Caucasus Muslims fleeing violence and persecution, notably the Circassian genocide. At the same time, Pontic Greeks fled to the Russian Empire to escape the repression and punitive measures enacted as a response to the Greek War of Independence. By 1914, the Greek population of the Russian Empire reached 650,000. Despite the challenges they faced, Greek and Armenian merchants came to dominate the Black Sea trade by the middle of the 19th century. Numerous Greek schools were founded in south Russia, where liberal and nationalist ideas flourished and a new Intelligentsia arose. More and more Pontic Greeks embraced the nationalist Megali Idea ideology, while many Ottomans were influenced by emerging Turkish nationalism. Turkish nationalists regarded Greeks as an internal threat to the empire, yet believing that they were resistant to Turkification and should be ethnically cleansed. The solution of the \\"National Problem\\" that was put forward by the Young Turk Committee in 1911 and implemented in 1913, marking the beginning of the Greek genocide. The Pontic Greeks responded by forming insurgent groups, with weapons salvaged from the battlefields of the Caucasus Campaign of World War I or obtained from Russia. During World War I, the eastern Pontus was captured by Russian troops, who recognized the autonomous Provisional Government of Trebizond, formed by Metropolitan Chrysanthus. The February Revolution that broke out in March 1917 halted the advance of the Russian army on the Caucasus Front. Soldiers and civilians formed soviets (revolutionary committees) which elected four commissars to rule over Kars, including one Greek. In May, a Caucasus Greek National Assembly convened in Tiflis, during which its delegates decided upon nationalizing Greek schools and issuing a Greek language newspaper. A separate agreement with national assemblies of other Caucasian nationalities resulted in the establishment of autonomous rule over areas populated by a Greek majority and the formation of an armed unit composed of ethnic Greeks to safeguard them. The outbreak of the October Revolution resulted in the dissolution of the Russian army on the Caucasus Front and its withdrawal from the front. The power vacuum was filled by the Ozakom, a four-man committee composed of representatives of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. History On 15 November 1917, Ozakom delegates met in Tiflis and agreed to create a unified army of ethnically homogeneous units, Greeks being allotted a division consisting of three regiments. The new units were to protect south Armenia, Georgia and Pontus from the Ottoman Army, the Bolsheviks and Muslim irregulars, while hierarchically belonging to the Army of the Provisional Government. The Greek Caucasus Division was formed out of ethnic Greeks serving in the Caucasus, recruits from among the local population including former insurgents and the incorporation of Greeks serving on the Eastern Front was also planned. Its three regiments were stationed at Tiflis, Kars and Tsalka respectively. Each regiment had three battalions of four companies each. The division included an autonomous battalion stationed at Ardahan and a reserve regiment in Batumi. The unit was commanded by former Russian Army Colonel Michael Ananiadis (Michael Ananiev) and his deputy, former artillery Colonel Demosthenes Pandazidis. Several units were commanded by Russian officers due to a shortage in experienced ethnic Greeks. Equipment was drawn from the 4th Russian Division which was in the middle of demobilization. The Armistice of Erzincan was signed at Erzincan on 18 December, suspending hostilities between Russia and the Ottomans. Fearing that Russia would drop out of the war, the Unified Allied Command issued a declaration supporting the formation of national volunteers units in the Russian Army, on 23 December. France and Britain also divided the Pontus into zones of responsibility, taking over north and south respectively. The Bolsheviks initially supported the retention of areas captured from the Ottomans during World War I and their autonomization, renouncing those claims after the Erzincan truce. Their calls for the immediate cessation of the war attracted many supporters, leading to mass desertions in the disorganized Russian Army. The Greek Caucasus Division, Russian anti-Bolsheviks and a small Georgian unit, were responsible for the protection of all areas between Erzincan and the edge of Russian-held Pontus. Seven hundred soldiers belonging to the division took part in the defense of Trebizond in conjunction with local insurgents and two companies of Russians and Georgians. The defense was hastily organized and the majority of the defenders were poorly trained, resulting in their defeat at the hands of Ottoman √áetes who massacred the Christian population in the city; attacks on Santa and Rodopolis were repulsed. A new recruitment drive was launched on 1 January 1918, since by that time the division existed only on paper, as many men had defected to the Bolsheviks or served in a tangled web of armed militias. Many members of the Greek community opposed its formation as they feared that it would provoke massacres akin to that in Trebizond. Most recruits originated from villages near army bases or enlisted in order to immediately defect to the Bolsheviks after stealing weapons and equipment. By early March, the division numbered at most 3,000 men, while suffering shortages in weaponry and experienced officers. It did not engage in any battles, limiting its operations to defensive skirmishes while protecting Greek villages and refugees convoys. In February 1918, having encountered limited resistance, the Ottoman Army captured Trebizond and Sarƒ±kamƒ±≈ü. On 24 February, the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic declared independence, initiating peace talks with the Ottomans on 8 March, to renegotiate the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that was signed three days earlier. The treaty between the Central Powers and the Bolsheviks had granted Kars, Ardahan, Pontus and Batumi to the Ottomans . Negotiations broke down over a lack of unity inside the Transcaucasian government, caused by territorial disputes between Georgians and Armenians. The Greeks of Kars were also divided, civilian leaders advocated retreating deeper into the Caucasus and military officials insisted on fighting back against Muslim encroachment. Supplied with information from Turkish intelligence, Kurdish irregulars attacked Giola, Zavod and Ardahan against Greek and Georgian troops. The Kurds signed a truce with the defenders of Ardahan only to break it in a sudden attack, resulting in the disarmament of 200 Greek soldiers and the dissolution of the battalion defending the town. The regiment stationed in Kars prevented the massacre of the local Muslim population by an Armenian militia, then dissolved under the influence of local politicians. Greeks fled Pontus en masse, the remnants of the Greek Caucasus Division protecting them from Turkish and Armenian militia. On 25 March, the division clashed with the army of the Armenian National Congress after the latter attempted to seize their equipment at Karakilisa. On 14 April, the Ottomans occupied Batumi after overrunning a Greek company. On 25 April, the Ottomans seized Kars from the 2nd Greek Regiment and on 15 May, the 2nd Greek Regiment (down to 750 men) was defeated at Alexandropol. Aftermath Realizing the futility of further resistance, the commander of the 2nd Regiment disbanded it and ordered his men to flee to Tiflis. Remnants of the Greek Caucasus Division continued their resistance at Samtret. The Armenians temporarily halted the Ottoman advance after the battles of Karakilisa and Sardarabad. On 26 May 1918, Georgia declared independence from the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. Two days later it signed the Treaty of Poti with Germany, securing its recognition in return for providing the German Caucasus expedition with free movement and bases in its territory. Under the terms of the agreement, all non-Georgian armed units, including the Greek Caucasus Division, were disbanded. A lack of unity in the Caucasus and Pontic Greek communities, in combination with the rising popularity of Bolshevism, led to a failure to organize an independent Greek state in the region.

The studio lineup for the band remained unchanged from their previous album Delusion Rain, with the exception of the departure of keyboardist Beno√Æt Dupuis in 2016 who was succeeded by Antoine Michaud, guitarist in the live band in 2014 and a session musician on Delusion Rain. Production Album title The title of the album went through several changes before it was finally decided to call it Lies and Butterflies. The album had at least two titles before the working title of Butterfly was suggested, which was also the working title for the song \\"Chrysalis\\". Chrysalis was the next working title, and when it was decided not to name the album Chrysalis, \\"Butterfly\\" was renamed to \\"Chrysalis\\". Ultimately, the final title was suggested by drummer Jean- S√©bastien Goyette and finalized the same day. Songs The first track \\"Looking for Something Else\\" opens with the sound of applause and cheering from an audience, which is a recording taken from the end of the band's previous live release Second Home and is intended to act as a continuation. The fifth track on the album, \\"Dare to Dream\\" is the second song in Mystery's catalog for which St-P√®re does not have a writing credit, the first being \\"Virtual Mentality\\" on Theatre of the Mind written by former keyboardist Beno√Æt Dupuis. The music on \\"Dare to Dream\\" was written by Pageau, his first writing credit on a Mystery song, with the lyrics written by Hans Raffelt and Pageau. The song was written many years prior and was one of the tracks considered for Delusion Rain but ultimately it was decided to not release the song at that time. \\"Where Dreams Come Alive\\", the sixth song on the album, is the first to feature a songwriting credit for guitarist Sylvain Moineau, who wrote the music for the song. The closing track \\"Chrysalis\\" saw its beginnings approximately twenty-five years before the release of the album when St-P√®re wrote the beginning and main parts of the song. Cover art The cover art for the album was created by photographer Julie de Waroquier and is entitled Bad News. Release Lies and Butterflies was released on July 14, 2018, the same day the band played in the Night of the Prog Festival in Germany. The album was released on vinyl by Polish label Oskar Records, who previously released Mystery's The World is a Game and Delusion Rain on vinyl.

The organization took part in the coordination of youth organizations in Czechoslovakia, along with the Union of Czech Youth, the Union of Slovak Youth and the Union of Polish Youth, and supported the line of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia to build a unitary youth movement. The core group behind the organization had a Russophile orientation. Initially SMK was led by I. Dzurenda, who was succeeded by A. Yedynak and A. Sushko. As of 1949 SMK claimed to have some 20,000 members, organized in 225 local branches. In the same year, SMK merged with the Czech, Slovak and Polish youth organizations to form the Czechoslovak Youth Union. In midst of the 1968 Prague Spring, there was a failed attempt to resurrect SMK.

He is an only child. His parents found out about his sexuality after an article of an interview had been released. Holland, who was not home at the time, had written a letter to his family after they found out and explained everything to them. His family tearfully accepted him, unaware of the hardships he had gone through because of his sexuality. He is currently a student of Seoul Institute of Arts. He decided to make his debut as a singer to speak out based on his experiences with violent assailants and victims inflicted on sexual minorities. While preparing the album, he tried to sign several agencies for his debut, but the deal was broken when he told the story of the sexual minority through music and expressed his wish to develop a discourse on discrimination against the sex minority on his own. In the end, he produced his first single with the money he saved from his part-time job for about two years without his agency.

Built about 1785, it is a good local example of a Colonial-style Cape, noted for its particularly fine and well-preserved interior. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The Aaron Bronson House stands on the south side of Southford Road (Connecticut Route 67), southeast of the village center of Southbury. Its main block is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a central chimney and clapboarded exterior. A 19th-century ell extends to the rear, with a second, more modern ell, attached to it. The main facade is five bays wide, and is minimally adorned with just a Greek Revival entrance surround. The interior retains virtually all of its original Federal-style finishes, including paneled and pilastered fireplace surrounds, beaded moulding, and builtin cabinetry. With The early history of this house is not known in detail; it was probably built about 1785, based on its traditional Colonial form and early Federal period interior. The property was associated for many years with the locally prominent Bronson family, who were early colonial settlers of the region. Aaron Bronson, who was known to own it in the early 19th century, was a successful cordwainer (shoemaker) and buttonmaker, who left a substantial estate on his death in 1835. His son Augustus sold the house out of the family in 1847.

A 22-minute double-length special episode, it was directed by Joe Johnston and Liz Artinian, and written and storyboarded by Miki Brewster, Jeff Liu, Katie Mitroff and Paul Villeco from a story by Johnston, Matt Burnett, Ben Levin, Kat Morris, Tom Herpich and series creator Rebecca Sugar. It first aired on July 6, 2018 as the final part of the seventh \\"StevenBomb\\", a series of six episodes aired between July 2 and 6. \\"Reunited\\" features the wedding of Ruby and Sapphire, but the celebrations are cut short when Yellow Diamond and Blue Diamond attack the Earth to avenge Pink Diamond's death. The episode merges many storylines developed previously in the series: the true nature of Pink Diamond's death, revealed in \\"A Single Pale Rose\\"; the crisis in Ruby and Sapphire's relationship in the aftermath of that revelation; Lapis Lazuli's departure in \\"Raising the Barn\\" earlier in the season; and the Cluster, last seen in the season three episode \\"Gem Drill\\". It was viewed by 0.974 million people and received critical acclaim. The episode was nominated for a 2019 Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Short- Format Animated Program; it lost to Love, Death & Robots. Plot It is the wedding day of Ruby (Charlyne Yi) and Sapphire (Erica Luttrell), the Crystal Gems that fuse to form Garnet (Estelle). Steven (Zach Callison) helps everyone prepare for the ceremony, singing the song \\"Let's Only Think About Love\\", in which he uses the wedding to distract everyone, including himself, from recent traumatic events and revelations. At the wedding, with Steven's friends in attendance, Ruby and Sapphire say their vows: Ruby says Sapphire allows her to see value in herself, and Sapphire explains how Ruby saved her from her destiny and opened up new possibilities. They kiss and fuse back into Garnet. During the reception, the Gem rulers Blue and Yellow Diamond arrive in their giant arm-shaped spaceships in order to awaken the Cluster, a massive geo- weapon at the planet's core consisting of thousands of Gem shards. Despite Steven's efforts, the Cluster is awakened, manifesting as a giant arm. However, it remains in control of itself and fights Yellow's ship by arm- wrestling it. Meanwhile, Blue Diamond (Lisa Hannigan) lands on the beach, intending to avenge Pink Diamond's shattering. She ignores Steven's attempt to explain to her that Pink Diamond was never shattered, and subdues Steven and the other Gems with her grief-inducing aura. Connie (Grace Rolek) attacks with Rose Quartz's sword, but Blue Diamond stops her and shatters the blade. Garnet is able to distract Blue Diamond long enough for Lapis Lazuli (Jennifer Paz), returning from space, to drop her barn on Blue Diamond, declaring her allegiance to the Crystal Gems. Working together, the Crystal Gems overwhelm Blue Diamond, while the Cluster disables both ships and retreats to rest. The Diamonds regroup, as Yellow Diamond (Patti LuPone) assists Blue Diamond out of the wreckage and destabilizes Peridot (Shelby Rabara)'s body, reducing her to her gemstone. When Steven tries to step forward to explain that he has Pink Diamond's gemstone, Yellow Diamond steps on him, knocking him unconscious. Steven awakens outside his body in an abstract psychic plane, where he watches as Lapis is also destabilized. He discovers that, disembodied, he can interact with people's thoughts, and encourages his friends before attempting to speak to the Diamonds. At first, he is unable to get past their auras, but eventually causes them to sense his presence. They proceed to attack him, but his own aura intensifies, and they stop attacking when they recognize the aura to be that of Pink Diamond. Steven reawakens with the Crystal Gems and the Diamonds standing over him in surprise, as Blue Diamond tearfully says, \\"It's you. Pink!\\" Production This episode was written and storyboarded by Miki Brewster, Jeff Liu, Katie Mitroff, and Paul Villeco. The art was directed by Liz Artinian, with Joe Johnston as supervising director. This episode features the wedding of Ruby and Sapphire, their engagement in the episode \\"The Question\\" reportedly being the first same-sex engagement in a cartoon. The wedding storyline had been conceived early in the series' history, during the production of Ruby and Sapphire's first appearance in \\"Jail Break\\" and at a time before same-sex marriage had been legalized in the United States. After \\"Reunited\\" aired, series creator Rebecca Sugar explained that the two characters were designed to be \\"wholesome\\" in response to pushback about their relationship, so that \\"there could only be one reason you could not show this to kids\\"; their relationship was also intentionally depicted in a way that would receive as little censorship as possible internationally. Some viewers noted that Ruby and Sapphire's gendered attire was reversed for their wedding; the more traditionally masculine Ruby wears a dress while Sapphire, who is usually seen with a dress, wears a suit. Concept art for these designs has existed since 2016. Sugar based Ruby and Sapphire's relationship on the relationship between herself and her partner, Ian Jones-Quartey, and Sugar came out as a non-binary woman days after the episode was released; Sugar would later clarify that Ruby's dress was a reference to her own gender identity, commenting that \\"Ruby in a dress is how I feel when I'm in a dress\\". A wave of Steven Universe merchandise was released following \\"Reunited\\", which prominently featured Ruby and Sapphire's wedding. Sugar has spoken about the influence of classic musical films in the episode's writing. The wedding reception interrupted by violence is a plot element borrowed from Fiddler on the Roof, while the barn being dropped on Blue Diamond is a reference to the farmhouse dropped on the Wicked Witch of the East in The Wizard of Oz. Music This episode features the song \\"For Just One Day Let's Only Think About (Love)\\", sung by Zach Callison as Steven, along with the rest of the main cast. The song was composed by Rebecca Sugar with Aivi & Surasshu, and was released digitally as a single alongside the episode's broadcast. According to Sugar, the structure and style of the song were influenced by songs from musical films such as For Me and My Gal and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Broadcast and reception  Viewership  \\"Reunited\\" premiered on July 6, 2018 on Cartoon Network. Its initial American broadcast was viewed by approximately 0.974 million viewers. It received a Nielsen household rating of 0.28, meaning that it was seen by 0.28% of all households. The special was the fifth and sixth episodes of the seventh StevenBomb event, where a new episode aired every weekday for a week. Critical reception This episode received critical acclaim upon release, particularly regarding the quantity of important events that occurred within a single episode, including Ruby and Sapphire's wedding, Lapis Lazuli's return to Earth and officially joining the Crystal Gems, and the battle between the Gems and the Diamonds. Eric Thurm of The A.V. Club praised the episode, giving it an A-. Thurm felt that the episode was executed in a great way. However, he felt that the first half of the episode was stronger than the second, stating that he enjoyed Garnet's wedding, particularly Sapphire's vows. He also claimed that although the fight scenes in the second half were slightly underwhelming, the episode set up a new era for the show. Palmer Haasch, reviewing the episode for Polygon, called it one of the show's \\"best episodes to date\\", praising its focus on Steven Universes core themes of family, love, \\"and healing, wellness, and growth\\". Also writing for Polygon, Lux Alptraum hailed the episode, and Ruby and Sapphire's relationship more broadly, as an important instantiation of visible queer representation on television. Entertainment Weekly rated it one of the five best episodes of any animated series of 2018. At the 2019 Creative Arts Emmy Awards, the episode was nominated for Outstanding Short-Format Animated Program.https://www.emmys.com/shows/steven-universe References External links * Category:Steven Universe episodes Category:2018 American television episodes Category:American LGBT-related television episodes Category:Same-sex marriage in television Category:LGBT-related animation ","title":"Reunited (Steven Universe)"},{"id":"57849680","text":"Tomato Red is a 2017 Irish-Canadian crime film written and directed by Juanita Wilson and starring Julia Garner.

In 1843, he submitted a petition to the Metropolitan of Moscow Filaret (Drozdov). Original drawings of the temple have not survived, but it is known that the estimate for the construction of the temple was signed by Moscow architect Nikolai Ilyich Kozlovsky. The construction of the temple took longer than originally expected. The Northern chapel of the great Martyr Catherine was consecrated in 1851, the southern chapel of St. Nicholas on January 15, 1856. The chapels of the temple were consecrated in honor of the heavenly patrons Buturlin. It is known that at the time of the inventory of property in 1858, the main assumption throne was not yet consecrated. In October 1989, the Church was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church, after which its restoration began. On March 31, 1990, it was again consecrated by the small priest. On October 30, 2011, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and all Russia made the great consecration of the Church.

The group released their debut album Al Principio in 2001 under Crown Records. The album's release followed Tejano music's post-golden age era, where artists music were indistinguishable from their counterparts, while album sales flattened. Music critics praised Siggno's progressive sounds and entertaining performances during their concerts. Their second album, Por Amor (2002) received a BMI Music Award and Latin Grammy Award nomination. The group's album Six Pack (2008) marked Siggno's first entry on a music chart. Their album Que Harias (2010) provided Siggno their first top 10 album on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Albums chart. In 2014, En Vivo debuted and peaked at number one on the Regional Mexican Albums chart, their first number one album. In 2015, Zodiacal provided Siggno their second number one album. In February 2016, lead vocalist Jesse Turner's son Jacob was involved in a car accident that left him in a coma for four months. Following his recovery, Siggno's Yo Te Esperare (2016) debuted at number one on the Top Latin Albums chart and entered the Billboard 200. The group managed to break audience records at the Go Tejano Day annual event in 2017. They honored their performance to Jacob who continued to receive therapy. In 2018, Siggno became a spokesperson for Bud Light in the state of Texas.  History  Jesse Turner attended a local church in Texas and met his future bandmates. When Turner was 10 years old his father had died and Turner spent his teenage years writing songs as a coping mechanism. Turner founded Siggno in 2000 and released their debut album Al Principio in late 2001. Al Principio failed to impact any music chart during its run. The album was released during Tejano music's post-golden age era under Crown Records. Music promoters found it challenging to shift consumers in buying regional Mexican music albums in big box retail stores as sales in Tejano music had flattened. Music journalists criticized Tejano music artists for their lack of variety in their music as well as recycling the same sound in each track. Billboard called Siggno's \\"Pero Hablame\\" as a \\"sentimental cumbia\\". The group's second album, Por Amor was released in 2002. The album helped Siggno to receive a nomination for a BMI Music Award in 2003, and a Latin Grammy Award for Best Tejano Album. Ramiro Burr of Billboard noted a sense of vulnerability and romantic themes in Siggno's repertoire which distinguished them from regional Mexican boy bands who would rather \\"raise hell\\" with their partners. Music promoters found Siggno's sound to be more progressive, but found that groups like Siggno to be more entertainers on stage than an actual performer. Another critic saw the group as a neo-norte√±o band that was being embraced by music fans. The group was nominated for Most Promising Band and Album of the Year at the 2003 Tejano Music Awards. Siggno released their third album Caminando under Serca Music. The following year, the band signed with Freddie Records and released Amor y Dolor which spawned their hit single \\"Mejor Dimelo\\". Siggno's next two studio efforts Capitulo 5 (2007) and Six Pack (2008) were nominated for a Latin Grammy Award. Six Pack became the group's first recording to enter a music chart. The album peaked at number 44 on the US Billboard Top Latin Albums on the week ending July 5, 2008. The group's next recording En La Radio (2009) marked Siggno's first entry on the Billboard Regional Mexican Albums chart when it peaked at number 19. Elsewhere, En La Radio debuted and peaked at number 33 on the Top Latin Albums chart. Siggno's follow-up Que Harias (2010) peaked at number 27 on the Top Latin Albums chart and gave the group their first top 10 album on the Regional Mexican Albums chart. In 2012, Siggno released Lo Que Me Dejaste which provided the group their first top five on the Regional Mexican Albums chart when the album peaked at number four. The band's first greatest hits album Nuestra Historia (2012) and Lo Que Me Dejaste helped grow the group's touring revenues. Their concert venues began selling out as well as a number of festivals they attended throughout the United States and Mexico as their songs began receiving strong airplay. 2013's El Mundo Se Acabo became Siggno's highest-peaking album, at the time of its release, when it peaked at number four on the Top Latin Albums chart. Their live album En Vivo (2014) broke their record when it debuted and peaked at number three and debuted atop the Regional Mexican Albums chart. Siggno's following recording Zodiacal (2015) provided the band's second number one album. In February 2016, Turner's son Jacob, was involved in a car accident that left him in a coma. Jacob suffered severe brain damage which left him in a coma for four months. A few months later, the group's album Yo Te Esperare debuted and peaked atop the Top Latin Albums (their first number one) and Regional Mexican Albums (their third number one). Turner told Billboard that the album was dedicated to his son following his recovery from the hospital. Yo Te Esperare debuted with 5,000 copies sold in its first week, debuting at number 123 on the Billboard 200 chart, their first entry. The album featured a cover of Nicky Jam and Enrique Iglesias' \\"El Perdon\\", which debuted at number eight on the Regional Mexican Digital Song Sales chart. Siggno became the ninth best-selling regional Mexican artists in 2016, while Yo Te Esperare finished as the 12th best- selling regional Mexican album of 2016. At Go Tejano Day 2017, Siggno and Banda el Recodo broke the all-time paid attendance record at the RodeoHouston when 75,557 people attended. The record was later broken by Calibre 50 the following year. At the event, Joey Guerra of Houston Chronicle found Siggno's performance to be \\"emotional\\". Turner often referenced his son Jacob during the performance. Bud Light expanded their Texas campaign and signed Siggno as their spokesperson in the state and sponsored their 100-city tour in 2018. In April 2018, Siggno visited a 5-year old fan who was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect as an infant, as part of Make-A-Wish. They invited him to their concert and performed the fan's favorite songs. The following month, Nixon High School competed to have perfect attendance to meet Siggno. The band had an open Q&A; and lunch with the students who won.

It is endemic to New Zealand. It is regarded as being uncommon but is frequently confused with Austrocidaria bipartita. Taxonomy This species was first described by Arthur Gardiner Butler in 1879 using specimens collected by Frederick Hutton in Dunedin and given the name Phibalapteryx anguligera. George Vernon Hudson discussed and illustrated this species in his 1898 book as a synonym of Hydriomena gobiata. In his 1928 publication The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand Hudson again illustrated and discussed the species, but under the name Eucymatoge anguligera following Edward Meyrick's placement of the species within that genus. In 1988 John S. Dugdale assigned the species to a new genus Austrocidaria. The holotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. Description Butler described the adult moths of the species as follows: A. anguligera is sometimes confused with A. bipartita, with the latter being the more common species. Distribution This species is endemic to New Zealand. It has been found in Canterbury, Otago, Invercargill, and Otira in the South Island, as well as in Auckland and Wellington in the North Island. Biology and behaviour The adults of this species are on the wing from September to March. They can be found resting on tree trunks or fence posts during the day. Habitat and host species This species prefers scrubby forest habitat. It occurs in a variety of ecosystems from montane to coastal. The larvae of this moth feeds on Coprosma species. Meyrick noted that the adults of this species could be found on the flowers of Senecio species. Hudson stated that the adult moths fed on the flowers of Hebe salicifolia.

They were raised both as solitary stones and in formations, such as the stone ships and few stone circles. Sometimes, they were raised only as commemoration to great people, a tradition which was continued as the runestones. Frostating, with its seat at Tinghaugen in Frosta municipality in the county of Nord-Tr√∏ndelag, was the site of an early Norwegian court. The site is represented by the Frostatinget bautasten. The tradition was strongest in Bornholm, Gotland and G√∂taland and appears to have followed the Goths, during the 1st century, to the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, (now Northern Poland) where they are a characteristic of the Wielbark culture.The Goths in Greater Poland Retrieved on 2008-03-24Poznan Archeological Museum: Jewellry of the Goths Retrieved on 2008-03-24 Norway { class=\\"sortable \\" align=\\"right\\" +Bauta discoveries in Norway by county - bgcolor=\\"#f0f0f0\\" !

The stones are often included as part of a tomb construction. The introduction to Snorre Sagas points out that it was the custom to \\"burn all dead and raise monoliths for them\\" and that this custom was maintained in Norway and Sweden for a long time. As a rule, each grave was marked with a single stone, but there were also instances where several stones were used, including the burial facility De fem d√•rlige jomfruer at Karmsundet in Rogaland, with five raised stones. It is especially prevalent in √òstlandet to find several monoliths arranged in a circle. Sometimes standing stone monuments are unrelated to known graves. It may be that they served as boundary markers. These include several stones in Fana, Bergen that can be linked to an important historical boundary between Sunnhordland and Nordhordland, as it was in medieval times. In Norway, standing stones usually dated to the Migration Period, the Viking Age or early Middle Ages. Sweden In Sweden by the 13th century menhirs were erected as markers for the graves of warriors. The following lines are taken from the introduction of the Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson; :As to funeral rites, the earliest age is called the Age of Burning; because all the dead were consumed by fire, and over their ashes were raised standing stones. :For men of consequence a mound should be raised to their memory, and for all other warriors who had been distinguished for manhood a standing stone; which custom remained long after Odin's time.The Ynglinga Saga Retrieved on 2008-03-24 In the same work, Snorri wrote that the Swedes burnt their dead king Vanlade and raised a stone over his ashes by the River Skyt (one of the tributaries of the River Fyris): :The Swedes took his body and burnt it at a river called Skytaa, where a standing stone was raised over him. The tradition is also mentioned in H√°vam√°l. Switzerland In the French-speaking canton of Vaud in Switzerland, several menhirs form linear patterns in Yverdon-les-Bains. These are situated in Clendy and date back to the third millennium BC. Wales Maen Hir Maenaddwyn, Wales In Welsh, menhirs are called 'Maen H√Ær' and they are scattered throughout Wales. Ireland Punchestown Longstone, Ireland Ireland is rich in menhirs, standing stones which are usually located in farmer's fields and are heavily worn due to poor weather conditions and exposure to livestock. Czech Republic The Menhir Kamenn√Ω past√Ω≈ô (stony shepherd) near Klobuky, Czech Republic A number of menhirs exist in the Czech Republic. These standing stones include the menhir Kamenn√Ω mu≈æ (stone man) near Mrchojedy and the menhir Kamenn√Ω past√Ω≈ô (stony shepherd) near Klobuky. France The Kerloas menhir, the tallest standing menhir in Brittany Brittany stands out in the distribution of menhirs by virtue of both the density of monuments and the diversity of types. The largest surviving menhir in the world is located in Locmariaquer, Brittany, and it is known as the Grand Menhir Bris√© (Great Broken Menhir). Once nearly high, today, it lies fractured into four pieces, but it would have weighed near 330 tons when intact. It is placed third after the Thunder Stone in St. Petersburg and the Western Stone in the Western Wall as the heaviest object moved by humans without powered machinery. A 4.5 meter menhir can be seen on the side of Le Mans Cathedral. It was moved there in 1778 when the dolmen it was associated with was destroyed. Alignments of menhirs are common, the most famous being the Carnac stones in Brittany, where more than 3000 individual menhirs are arranged in four groups and arrayed in rows stretching across four kilometres. Each set is organised with the tallest stones at the western end and shorter ones at the eastern end. Some end with a semicircular cromlech, but many have since fallen or been destroyed.Aviva, Elyn; White, Gary. \\"Mysterious Megaliths: The Standing Stones of Carnac, Brittany, France\\". World and I, Vol. 13, October 1998. The second largest concentration of menhirs in France is at the Cham des Bondons, which is located on high open limestone plain in the granitic C√©vennes. Today, the site is protected by the Parc National des C√©vennes. From the time pastoralism was established, the site was kept open by controlled burning and grazing.\\"Sentier du Pradal \\" (French language). Parc National des C√©vennes. Retrieved 27 April 2007. On the island of Corsica, menhirs are found in Filitosa, a megalithic site in southern Corsica. The period of occupation spans from the end of the Neolithic era and the beginning of the Bronze Age, until around the Roman times in Corsica. Italy Menhir in Sardinia Menhirs are especially common in Sardinia. It is possible to see at least 332 such standing stones on the island, including especially elaborate \\"statue-menhirs\\" that show a human face at the top and other gendered symbols on the flat front sides. Over a hundred examples of this standardized type have been found, most of them around the village of Laconi. In the Sardinian language they are known as perdas fittas or perdas lungas. Portugal In Portugal, there are also found several ancient menhirs. The highest concentration is in the Alentejo region. The menhirs of Meada, the largest of the Iberian Peninsula, Outeiro and Barrocal. Among these megalithic structures is the great Almendres Menhir within the Almendres Cromlech complex near √âvora. Spain In Spain, menhirs associated with the western European megalithic industry are relatively unusual compared to dolmens, but still are common sights in the northern half of the country, where at least 500 menhirs have been reported.https://misterios.co/el- misterio-de-los-menhires-cantabros/ They are particularly common in the Basque Country, Navarre, northern Burgos and Palencia, Cantabria, and the Pyrenees, where they are usually encountered standing alone or in small groups (cromlech) in elevated locations; the Arlobi menhir is one of the most recent examples of a menhir. In smaller numbers, but of great dimensions, some examples are located in Extremadura, very related to the menhirs of Portugal. Most of the menhirs in northern Spain appear to date back to the stone age; they are not usually associated with burials, but in at least one instance (the Menhir of Cuesta del Molino in Burgos) burials dating at least 2000 years after the menhir was originally built have been found. In mediterranean Spain and, particularly the Balearic islands, megalithic structures consisting of standing stones such as the Taulas, but associated with Bronze Age and Iron Age cultures, are also common. Serbia The graves of the \\"Latins\\" and the \\"Jidovs\\" near the village of Balwan (Bovan), north of Aleksinac in Serbia were marked by large boulders. Armenia Numerous menhirs dot the lands across Armenia, where they are called vishapakar (). Vishap translates to \\"dragon\\" or \\"serpent\\" and kar translates to \\"stone\\". The stones are cigar-shaped, and are typically tall. They are often found in the mountains near the sources of rivers or lakes. A large number of them have been carved in the shape of a fish. The earliest known vishapakar is thought to date from between the 18th to 16th centuries BC. An inscription in ancient Urartian cuneiform written upon a vishap at the temple of Garni shows that they were created prior to the Urartian Kingdom (pre-8th century). Israel The Hebrew term for \\"standing stone\\" is masseba, pl. massebot (also written matseva, matsevot). The most famous examples are from the Canaanite High Place at Tel Gezer, comprising a straight row of ten stone stelae and a square stone basin, all erected simultaneously during the Middle Bronze Age. Iran Menhirs in Iran are found in different villages and areas of East Azarbaijan Province, meshkin shahr(pirazmian) and Amlash and Deylaman areas in Gilan. A double menhir is also situated on Kharg Island in the Persian Gulf. Menhirs are called Sang- AfrƒÅsht (ÿ≥ŸÜ⁄Ø‚ÄåÿßŸÅÿ±ÿßÿ¥ÿ™) in Persian, and there are different studies published in Iranian periodicals about the details of the Iranian menhirs, specially in the periodical \\"Barrasiha-yi Tarikhi\\" (Historical studies). Menhir in Senapati District, Manipur, India India Menhirs are found all across India. They can be as tall as 20 to 14 feet (over 4.2 m), and several hundred smaller menhirs scattered all over the agricultural fields, mountains and various geographical areas. Rao and his team visited the menhir site in Telangana on the days of summer and winter solstice and equinox and found that particular rows of stones were aligned to the rising and setting sun on these days. \\"This suggests the megalithic community here was aware of the solar trajectories,\\" he said. Horn of Africa Ancient standing stones are found throughout the Horn of Africa. Several of these old menhirs exist in Qohaito, Eritrea, and date to a period before the founding of the Kingdom of Axum. The Axumites themselves also erected a number of large stelae, which served a religious purpose in pre-Christian times. One of these granite columns is the largest such structure in the world, standing at 90 feet. Axumite standing stones in Qohaito, Eritrea In northeastern Somalia, on the coastal plain 20 km to Alula's east are found ruins of an ancient monument in a platform style. The structure is formed by a rectangular drystone wall that is low in height; the space in between is filled with rubble and manually covered with small stones. Relatively large standing stones are also positioned on the edifice's corners. Near the platform are graves, which are outlined in stones. 24 m by 17 m in dimension, the structure is the largest of a string of ancient platform and enclosed platform monuments exclusive to far northeastern Somalia. Additionally, around 200 stone monuments (taalos) are found in the northeastern Botiala site, most of which consist of cairns. There are a number of rows of standing stones on the eastern side of the structures, which are similar to those at Salweyn, a great cairn-held situated close to Heis. Besides cairns, the Botiala area also features a few other drystone monuments. These include disc monuments with circular, ground-level features, as well as low, rectangular platform monuments. Burial sites near Burao in the northwestern part of the country likewise feature a number of old stelae. Additionally, between Djibouti City and Loyada in Djibouti are a number of anthropomorphic and phallic stelae. The structures are associated with graves of rectangular shape flanked by vertical slabs, as also found in central Ethiopia. The Djibouti-Loyada stelae are of uncertain age, and some of them are adorned with a T-shaped emblem. In Ethiopia, the town of Tiya contains 36 menhirs (standing stones) or stelae. Of these, 32 are engraved with swords and other mysterious symbols. The ancient structures suggest the presence of a large, prehistoric burial complex. The archaeological site was designated a World Heritage Site in 1980. South America Menhirs were erected by the U'wa people of Colombia in their ancestral territory. They believe that the menhirs are the ancients of the U'wa clans who were turned into the stone piers of the world. Menhirs can be found in Chita and Chiscas, Boyac√°. There are 114 menhirs in the Provincial Park Los Menhires in Argentina. They were erected by the Taf√≠ people, an indigenous culture of Tucum√°n province, and were used in fertility rites.

He developed the society's registry and edited the Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation. Brought up on the south side of Chicago and completing early medical training at Loyola University Strich School of Medicine, he spent ten years in heart transplant research at Mayo Clinic School of Medicine, becoming professor at the University of Minnesota in 1980. Kaye was the first director of the ISHLT's International Database for Heart and Lung Transplantation, which became the largest registry of its kind in the world. In 1986, he was a member of the team that performed the first combined heart-lung transplant in the mid-west of America. Subsequently, he was appointed director of research at San Diego and received the ISHLT lifetime service award in 1996. He died in 2017 at the age of 82. Early life Known as Harley at home, Kaye was born to Lithuanian immigrants and spent his early life on the south side of Chicago. He went on to study chemistry at St. Louis University, following which he entered Loyola University Strich School of Medicine and completed a medical degree. Medical career Kaye completed his residency at the University of Minnesota. Here, he met and married Mary and they had five children.

In 1985, he was its secretary and treasurer. In addition, he co-developed and was the first director of the Society's registry, a database for heart transplantation, which subsequently evolved into the International Database for Heart and Lung Transplantation, becoming the largest registry of heart and lung transplantation data in the world. When Jaques Losman retired in 1985, Kaye, in 1986, took over as the editor of the Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation, remaining so for ten years and during which he was key in developing it as an internationally accepted journal. From 1986, the University of Minnesota had put into use a database for cardiac surgery. Developed by both Ed Sweeney and Kaye, it became the prototype for the database soon used by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. In the same year, he was a member of the team that performed the first combined heart and lung transplant in the mid-west of America. In 1989, heart-lung transplant pioneer Stuart W. Jamieson took along Kaye when transferring his [Jamieson's] entire surgical team from Minnesota to San Diego. Here, Kaye was appointed director of research.

The series is based on the DC Comics character Green Arrow, a costumed crime-fighter created by Mort Weisinger and George Papp, and is set in the Arrowverse, sharing continuity with other Arrowverse television series. The showrunner for this season was Beth Schwartz. Stephen Amell stars as Oliver Queen, with principal cast members David Ramsey as John Diggle, Emily Bett Rickards as Felicity Smoak, Echo Kellum as Curtis Holt, Rick Gonzalez as Rene Ramirez, Juliana Harkavy as Dinah Drake, and Katie Cassidy Rodgers as Laurel Lance also returning from previous seasons. Colton Haynes, a principal cast member for seasons two and three and a special guest actor for seasons four and six, was reinstated as a series regular for the seventh season as Roy Harper. They are joined by Kirk Acevedo as Ricardo Diaz, who was promoted to a series regular from his recurring status in the previous season, and new cast member Sea Shimooka. The series follows billionaire playboy Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell), who claimed to have spent five years shipwrecked on Lian Yu, a mysterious island in the North China Sea, before returning home to Starling City (later renamed \\"Star City\\") to fight crime and corruption as a secret vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. In the seventh season, five months after Oliver's imprisonment, Diaz has recruited the Longbow Hunters, consisting of Kodiak (Michael Jonsson), Silencer (Miranda Edwards), and Red Dart (Holly Elissa Dignard) for a new criminal agenda, including seeking revenge on Oliver's loved ones and allies. After Oliver is released from prison, taking down Diaz in the process, he and the former members of Team Arrow are deputized and begin working alongside the police. Another hooded archer, revealed later to be Oliver's half-sister, Emiko Queen (Sea Shimooka), emerges as the new Green Arrow, seemingly to fight crime on Oliver's behalf. However, Emiko is revealed to be the leader of the Ninth Circle, a terrorist group that begins launching several attacks upon Star City, and is seeking to destroy Oliver's legacy as the Green Arrow. Emiko kills Diaz. The season features flash-forwards twenty years into the future to Oliver's now adult son William (Ben Lewis) who seeks out Roy Harper on Lian Yu, where they discover instructions left by Felicity leading them back to Star City. There they discover more secrets, including Oliver and Felicity's hidden daughter, Mia (Katherine McNamara), while they work to save the city from another attack. The series was renewed for its seventh season on April 2, 2018, and filming began in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on July 6, 2018, and ended on April 11, 2019. The season featured the directorial debut of cast member David Ramsey. This season includes the fifth annual Arrowverse crossover with TV series The Flash, and Supergirl. The season was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 20, 2019. The series was renewed for an eighth and final season on January 31, 2019.

On April 2, The CW renewed the series for its seventh season. Marc Guggenheim and Wendy Mericle stepped down as showrunners at the end of the sixth season, with veteran writer Beth Schwartz taking over as sole showrunner for the seventh season. Guggenheim, the series' co-developer, remains involved as an executive consultant. Writing In May 2018, outgoing showrunner Marc Guggenheim revealed that the Longbow Hunters, a villainous organization in DC Comics, would be teased in the sixth-season finale before being introduced in the seventh season. Following the conclusion of the sixth season, which marked the first time in the series' history where the season's main antagonist was still at large, Guggenheim's successor Beth Schwartz confirmed that Ricardo Diaz / Dragon would return and, like his comic book counterpart, establish the Longbow Hunters, \\"a legendary group of assassins Diaz recruits to get back at Team Arrow for toppling his nascent criminal empire at the end of season 6.\\" Schwartz revealed that \\"redemption\\" would be the theme of the seventh season, \\"since last season when Oliver outed his identity, the city is a little bit mixed about how they feel about the Green Arrow.\\" Stephen Amell commented that there is \\"nothing about [Oliver] that's heroic\\" in the season premiere. While Schwartz confirmed that other characters would be influenced by the season's theme, she stated that after Black Siren committed several murders during her partnership with Diaz, she still has \\"a large way to go to redeem herself from last season.\\" The previous season also left off with Team Arrow fractured and divided. This season sees its members redefining their roles and what it means to be heroes to an anti- vigilante Star City, while honoring \\"the sacrifice Oliver made for them.\\" The showrunner named Felicity's storyline as one of her favorites for the season's first half. \\"We played her pretty parallel to Oliver, where she's hiding and not being herself. She's in protective custody, but when someone attacks her family, she can't ignore that, so she has to fight back.\\" Schwartz also said that the season would be \\"grounded\\" and have a \\"dark\\" tone, similar to that of the first season. The seventh season is the first time the series will employ a female-dominated writing staff, with new writers being introduced this season. Schwartz said the seventh season would not be based on David S. Goyer's scrapped film Green Arrow: Escape From Super Max, which would have featured Oliver Queen being arrested, exposed as the Green Arrow, and attempting a prison escape. Amell reported that the season would employ a new storytelling technique. This was later revealed to be sporadic flashforwards, as opposed to the weekly flashbacks of seasons past. Schwartz named Westworld and This Is Us as inspirations for the time structure, and Prison Break as an inspiration for the prison arc. Amell also revealed that he requested that the seventh season be written as if it were the series' last. Casting Main cast members Stephen Amell, David Ramsey, Emily Bett Rickards, Echo Kellum, Rick Gonzalez, Juliana Harkavy, and Katie Cassidy Rodgers return from previous seasons as Oliver Queen / Green Arrow, John Diggle / Spartan, Felicity Smoak / Overwatch, Curtis Holt / Mr. Terrific, Rene Ramirez / Wild Dog, Dinah Drake / Black Canary, and Laurel Lance / Black Siren, respectively. The seventh season is the first not to feature original cast members Willa Holland and Paul Blackthorne, who play Thea Queen / Speedy and Quentin Lance, respectively, as series regulars following both actors' departures during the previous season. They did, however, reprise their roles for the series' 150th episode. On April 9, 2018, it was announced that Colton Haynes would return as a series regular for the seventh season after previously starring in the second and third seasons and making guest appearances in the fourth and sixth seasons as Roy Harper / Arsenal. On October 11, Kirk Acevedo was promoted to series regular status after previously recurring in the sixth season as main antagonist, Ricardo Diaz / Dragon. Sea Shimooka was introduced as a series regular during the season, playing Oliver's half-sister Emiko Queen. Kellum exited the series during the season, with the episode \\"Star City Slayer\\" marking his final appearance as a series regular. Acevedo also exited the series during the season, with the episode \\"Brothers & Sisters\\" marking his final appearance as a regular. On March 30, 2019, Rickards posted on Instagram that she would be leaving the series, making the seventh season her last as a member of the main cast. Series co-creator Greg Berlanti and Schwartz confirmed her departure later that day. On July 21 at the series' San Diego Comic-Con 2018 panel, it was announced that the Longbow Hunters had been cast with Holly Elissa as Red Dart, Miranda Edwards as Silencer, and Michael Jonsson as Kodiak. It was also revealed that Michael Jai White, Vinnie Jones, and Cody Runnels would additionally recur as Ben Turner, Danny Brickwell, and Derek Sampson from previous seasons. On September 21, Katherine McNamara was cast in a recurring role as Maya, though her character was later revealed to be Oliver and Felicity's future daughter, Mia Smoak / Blackstar. Jack Moore returned in the role of Oliver's son William Clayton, with Ben Lewis portraying the character in flashforwards. Joseph David-Jones also recurs as Connor Hawke, John's adoptive son, in flashforwards. David-Jones previously played an alternate future version of John's biological son John Diggle, Jr., who went by Connor Hawke / Green Arrow, in the Legends of Tomorrow first season episode \\"Star City 2046\\". Aiden Stoxx portrays the character as a child in the present. In March 2019, Adrian Paul joined the series in a recurring role as Dante. Filming Production for the season began on July 6, 2018, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In May 2018, Stephen Amell revealed that co-star David Ramsey would direct the eleventh episode of the season, marking Ramsey's directorial debut. Amell also grew a beard during the filming hiatus to accurately resemble the Green Arrow of the comics. Production wrapped on April 11, 2019. Arrowverse tie-ins In May 2018, Stephen Amell announced at The CW upfronts that the next Arrowverse crossover would feature Batwoman and Gotham City. The crossover \\"Elseworlds\\" is slated to launch a 2019 solo series for the character. The episode \\"Emerald Archer\\" featured appearances from Grant Gustin and Caity Lotz as Barry Allen and Sara Lance, respectively, for the series' 150th episode. Joseph David-Jones reprises his role as Connor Hawke from the Legends of Tomorrow episode \\"Star City 2046\\" where the character becomes the new Green Arrow in an alternate timeline. Marketing The main cast of the season as well as executive producer Beth Schwartz attended San Diego Comic-Con on July 21, 2018 to promote the season. Release Broadcast In May 2018, it was announced that Arrow would move to Mondays for its seventh season, a first for the series, due to The CW's programming expansion to Sunday nights. On June 20, the network released its fall schedule, revealing that the series would additionally move from the 9:00 pm time-slot to the 8:00 pm time-slot. The season began airing in the United States on The CW on October 15, 2018, and completed its 22-episode run on May 13, 2019. Home media The season was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 20, 2019 with special features including the fifth annual Arrowverse crossover event titled \\"Elseworlds\\". Reception Critical response The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 88% approval rating for the seventh season, with an average rating of 7.36/10 based on 211 reviews. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Arrow recovers from a creative rut by throwing Oliver Queen in the slammer and letting the series' reliable ensemble blossom into the forefront.\\" Reviewing for Den of Geek, Delia Harrington gave the premiere a rating of 3/5. She opined that Roy's inclusion in the season made his \\"moving sendoff\\" with Thea from last season feel \\"cheap\\" and that she remained \\"cautious\\" about the flashforward structure, but said that the episode was \\"solid\\" nonetheless. She concluded, \\"The Arrow Season 7 premiere manages to both wipe the slate clean and nod in the direction of the show's early glory.\\" IGNs Jesse Schedeen wrote, \\"Arrows Season 7 premiere kicks off the most significant status quo change in the series' history. Some of these sweeping changes are already working in the show's favor.\\" He gave the episode a rating of 7.1/10, adding, \\"Arrows seventh season has a promising start, though the premiere drags whenever Oliver Queen isn't the focus.\\" Both Chancellor Agard of Entertainment Weekly and Allison Shoemaker of The A.V.

Yu. Mitslyansky, presented his sculpture with the \\"Requiem of the Year 41\\", which he devoted to the memory of comrades who died at the front. The pupils of the school offered to install this monument in the schoolyard. The grand opening of the monument took place on June 22, 1971. It was made as a project of graduates of this school - sculptor D. Yu. Mitlyansky, architects E. A. Rozenblum and P. I. Skokan. The monument consisted of five bronze figures of dead volunteers-tenth-graders standing on a pedestal (Yury Divilkovsky, Igor Kuptsov, Igor Bogushevsky, Grigory Rodin and Gabor Raab). The schoolchildren are dressed in greatcoats, with rifles on their shoulders. The inscription \\"Be worthy of the memory of the fallen. 1941-1945\\" is written on the pedestral. At the foot of the pedestal is a marble plaque with the names of 100 pupils and teachers of the school who were killed in the war. In 1993, the monument was vandalized, after which the figures had to be moved to the school museum. To protect the monument from further acts of vandalism, Mitlyansky and Marcus developed a project for its reconstruction. An updated monument was installed on the school wall from the side of Nozhovy Lane. The new monument is a small copy of the old one, and a more accurate quote from Robert Rozhdestvensky's \\"Requiem\\" is put on its pedestal: \\"In memory of the fallen, be worthy.\\"–ú–∏—Ç–ª—è–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –î. –Æ. –ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–µ –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–Ω–∫–∏ 1920‚Äî1930 –≥–≥.

Following seven years teaching science at Toowoomba Grammar School in Queensland he became Director of the Queensland Museum, later occupying several positions culminating in lecturing at the University of Queensland. Early life Ronald Hamlyn-Harris was born in Eastbourne, England on 1 September 1874 to Hamlyn Huntingdon Harris, a retired lieutenant of the 18th Royal Hussars, and his wife, Sarah Wheeler. He was educated in England and Germany and trained as an estate manager, taking charge of his father's estates in Gloucestershire and becoming an expert on keeping bees. He studied further, first in Naples, Italy before receiving his doctorate from the University of T√ºbingen in Germany in 1902. Career Hamlyn-Harris travelled to Australia the following year and took up a teaching post at Toowoomba Grammar School in Queensland. Here he revitalised the science department, organised the raising of money to build a new laboratory and gave public lectures. His enthusiasm for natural history inspired the boys, and he became president of the Field Naturalist's Club in Toowoomba. Under his auspices, the club thrived, increasing its membership greatly. He took an interest in anything that would advance the interests of Toowoomba, and was on the science committee of the Austral Association, which held an annual festival in the city. He married Bertha Hamlyn, n√©e Harris, in 1908; the couple had three sons and three daughters. After seven and a half years at Toowoomba, Hamlyn-Harris left in 1910 to take up the post of Director of the Queensland Museum in Brisbane where he served for seven years. Here he became friends with the Australian ichthyologist James Douglas Ogilby who was involved in fish research and was pleased to be able to pass the museum's administrative work to the new director. In 1911, Ogilby named the purple eagle ray (Myliobatis hamlyni), a fish he was describing for the first time, in honour of Hamlyn-Harris. Hamlyn-Harris left the museum because of ill health, and after five years running a fruit farm, in 1922 he was put in charge of the government laboratory in Brisbane researching hookworms. In 1926 he became the city entomologist before becoming a lecturer at the University of Queensland in 1936. One of the students he supervised at UQ, would also pursue a career in entomology, Elizabeth Nesta Marks. Hamlyn-Harris retired in 1942 and died in 1953.

Biography  He began his career in motorsport at the Crit√©rium des Coeurs in 1898, on a tricycle made by De Dion-Bouton. He won the Levassor Prize for Motorcycles in 1901, and obtained the record of the kilometre in the same year at 33 seconds, at nearly 110 km/h in Ach√®res, thanks to a twin- cylinder engine from Buchet. In 1902, he won the kilometre-long Deauville category for motorcycles at almost 125 km/h, still with the Buchet engine (32CV 4.3L), with the same vehicle still allowing him in November to reach more than 124 km/h in the Parisian region on another kilometer, accomplished in 29 seconds. He then took part in the Paris-Madrid Motor Race in 1903, on a Mors type Z. In 1906, he finished fourth in the Targa Florio in an Itala 35/40HP, becoming one of the official Werner drivers on tri-cars. He then returned to participate in the Italian event the following year on a Berliet, and in 1907 was hired by Darracq Motor Engineering Company. In 1908, he won in Boulogne-sur-Mer the coast races of both Pont de Bainethun and Porte Gayole, on a Cl√©ment-Bayard on the same day. He finished 3rd in the 1912 Grand Prix de France in Dieppe on a Sunbeam, winning the Coupe l'Auto category 3 Litre. He came 4th in 1908 on a Cl√©ment-Bayard, 5th in 1907 on a Darracq, and 7th in 1914 on a Peugeot EX5. He also participated in the Grand Prix of the United States in 1908, and obtained places of esteem at the Cup of Carts where he is often registered. In 1922, he won the C√¥te de Poix (near Amiens in Picardy) on a Panhard 20HP, then that of Saint-Martin (Boulogne-sur-Mer) the following year with the same car, while during the same time Louis Rigal started his own course in motorsport. In 1924, Victor Rigal was appointed the Commissioner General of the Capital Rally of Deauville, organized by the ACO.

It was built in 1927-1929 for the Moscow fine-wool factory named after Peter Alekseev in the constructivist style, designed by the architect L. A. Vesnin. The building had an asymmetric composition of three volumes of simple geometric shapes. In Soviet times it had the status of a monument of architecture. In 1982 the club was rebuilt. In 2010, it was occupied by Jehovah's Witnesses.  History  In the spring of 1927 the Moscow regional department of the trade union of textile workers decided to start building workers' clubs. It was decided to develop 4 types of clubs: type A with a hall for 500 seats and 10-12 club rooms (for factories with the number of workers from 1000 to 3000 people), type B with a hall for 700 seats and 14-15 rooms (for factories with 3000-4000 workers), type B with a hall for 1000 seats and 15-18 rooms (for factories with 4000-7000 workers), type G with a hall for 1500 seats, 20 rooms, a gym and an audience (for factories with more than 7000 workers). In March 1927 the architect LA Vesnin worked out a project for a club of type A. According to this project, clubs were built in Rostokin (24 Agricultural Street), at the Proletary and Savvinsky factories and in Mikhalkov.–ö–ª—É–± –∏–º. –ü. –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–µ–≤–∞ / –ù. –ò. –ë—Ä—É–Ω–æ–≤ // –ê—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç—É—Ä–∞ –∫–ª—É–±–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è. 10 —Ä–∞–±–æ—á–∏—Ö –∫–ª—É–±–æ–≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤—ã / –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∞–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—è –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ–∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è. ‚Äî –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ ; –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥ : –û–ì–ò–ó ‚Äî –ò–ó–û–ì–ò–ó, 1932. ‚Äî 108 —Å., –∏–ª. The construction of the club for a fine-woven factory named after Peter Alekseev in Mikhalkov began in July‚ÄìAugust 1927, was finished in the rough in 1928, and finally in 1929. The architect LA Vesnin did not take part in the construction of the club himself. Taking into account the terrain, Vesnin's project was mirrored along the longitudinal axis. Adifference from the original design was the additional wide entrance from the estate park. The cost of building the building was 26 rubles and 50 kopecks per cubed meter. After the opening of the club, factory workers noted a number of its shortcomings: the auditorium for 450 people was too small and could not accommodate all comers; there was no gymnasium, so what physical education was had had to take place on the stage of the auditorium; and there was no room for a drama circle. In addition, a number of premises of the club was converted into housing for workers.  Architecture  Plan of the first floor of the club The club of the factory in its architecture is very different from most other Moscow houses of culture of that period. Since this is essentially a country club building, the architect was not limited to the small size of the site. For this reason, the club was made not of high-rise, but rather stretched in length. The second floor was originally only a small part of the building. On the first floor there is an auditorium and associated rooms. The foyer of the first floor is quite spacious. It continues into a wide corridor adjoining the wall of the auditorium and is lined with a series of doors. At the end of the corridor are the entrances to the premises connected with the stage. From the street side, the corridor adjoins to an open terrace. From the garden side, the club had a second wide entrance. On the opposite end of the building there was a staircase leading to the second floor, and had a separate entrance from the street. The wardrobe was located in the corner between the main and side entrances. To the right of the main entrance was a toilet, a smoking room, and an administration room. A buffet area was located on the side of the auditorium and had an entrance from the lobby and to the outdoor terrace, where it was possible to set tables in the summer. On the second floor there were club rooms of different sizes. They were located on both sides of a long corridor. Opposite the stairs was a meeting room with access to the flat roof of the foyer. To its left was a library and a reading room. In the corridor of the second floor were also seven small rooms for circles, the portal of the movie screen-box of the auditorium, and an exit to a small balcony. In the basement of the building there is a room originally equipped for a shooting gallery.

Senator Josh Newman (Democrat- District 29), one of the amendment's authors, said it was essential that the new gas tax revenues will be spent \\"only on repairing our aging infrastructure, reducing congestion, and otherwise supporting transportation improvements that foster economic development across the state.\\" Of the 51,000 miles of California highways in 2017, 53% were in fair condition and 6% were in poor condition. Supporters highlight that Proposition 69 can maximize the social welfare function for every community in the state, and guarantee that taxes go to valuable transportation projects. = Opposition = Californians against Proposition 69 argue that the measure doesn't go far enough to protect other transportation fees, such as the vehicle weight fee. California Republicans propelled the \\"No on Prop 69\\" movement. California Senator John Moorlach (Republican - 37th Senate District) and Assemblyman Frank Bigelow (Republican - 5th Assembly District) justified their opposition: \\"state spending will continue to spiral out of control, and it fails to fully protect transportation taxes from being diverted to programs that do nothing to fix our roads and highways.\\"Andrea Seastrand, president of the Central Coast Taxpayers Association, stated: > \\"While this may sound assuring even to those who opposed raising the gas > tax, the reality is that this ballot measure is all about creating a false > sense of security for taxpayers. The gas tax increase was incredibly > unpopular with voters who already felt the burden of some of the highest > fuel costs in the nation. In order to help justify the tax hikes, > Proposition 69 was conceived as a companion measure to make the public think > that they could trust Sacramento this time and transportation funds would > only go to their intended purposes.\\" Opposers contend that the proposition does not go far enough, and fails to fully protect transportation taxes from being diverted to programs that have nothing to do with fixing roads and highways. State lockboxes tend to only be for transportation, but education proponents often oppose them, citing them \\"as a ceiling rather than a floor\\" for education spending.  Fiscal Impact Statement  Upon passage of Proposition 69, there would be no direct effect on the amount of state or local revenues, as the initiative does not alter existing tax and fee rates. The measure \\"could affect how monies are spent,\\" since it ensures that existing revenues will be spent solely on transportation purposes. Finally, the initiative would put California slightly below its constitutional spending limit, since less than one-tenth of spending from the new SB1 revenues would count toward the limit.  Economic Impact   Traffic Congestion  Empirical evidence has displayed that the provision of extra road capacity results in a greater congestion of traffic. An average road improvement has induced an additional 10% of base traffic in the short term and 20% in the long term. Increased traffic occurs on the alternative routes that road improvements are intended to relieve. However, other evidence has shown that in California, there is no conclusive evidence that increases in state highway lane-miles have affected traffic on other roads.  Other States with Lockbox Amendments  Alaska is the only state to not have statutory or constitutional restrictions on transportation revenue diversion. Since 2010, Maryland, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Illinois, and Louisiana voters have all amended their constitutions through ballot measures to enable transportation lockboxes. Twenty-one states dedicate revenues to transportation broadly (such as Rhode Island, Nebraska, and Florida), while twenty-seven restrict revenues only to highways (such as Arizona, Iowa, and Maine). Yet, such amendments also come with risk. While lockboxes ensure that transportation revenues won't get suddenly get cut, they tie transportation to fuel taxes, which inflated or increased fuel economy can erode.  Demand Effect  Claims that road investments spur new travel, known as induced demand, and thus fail to relieve traffic congestion have thwarted road development in the United States. In California, road investments not only stimulated travel demand but respond to it as well. Induced demand effects build over time, as more roads are improved. Furthermore, there are strong reciprocal relationships between road investment and travel demand in California. There is no simple quick fix to achieve road demand reduction, especially in a growing state like California.

Igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rock may have been much older, but was overwritten during the Yavapai and Mazatzal orogenies in the Proterozoic. The Grenville orogeny to the east caused Arizona to fill with sediments, shedding into a shallow sea. Limestone formed in the sea was metamorphosed by mafic intrusions. The Great Unconformity is a famous gap in the stratigraphic record, as Arizona experienced 900 million years of terrestrial conditions, except in isolated basins. The region oscillated between terrestrial and shallow ocean conditions during the Paleozoic as multi-cellular life became common and three major orogenies to the east shed sediments before North America became part of the supercontinent Pangaea. The breakup of Pangaea was accompanied by the subduction of the Farallon Plate, which drove volcanism during the Nevadan orogeny and the Sevier orogeny in the Mesozoic, which covered much of Arizona in volcanic debris and sediments. The Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up created smaller mountain ranges with extensive ash and lava in the Cenozoic, followed by the sinking of the Farallon slab in the mantle throughout the past 14 million years, which has created the Basin and Range Province. Arizona has extensive mineralization in veins, due to hydrothermal fluids and is notable for copper-gold porphyry, lead, zinc, rare minerals formed from copper enrichment and evaporites among other resources. Stratigraphy, Tectonics & Geologic History Precambrian: Before 541 million years ago The oldest rocks in Arizona likely date to the late Archean or early Proterozoic, although evidence of earlier geology was overwritten during the Yavapai orogeny and the Mazatzal orogeny‚Äîmajor mountain building events 1.8 to 1.6 billion years ago. During this period in the Proterozoic, the Yavapai, Pinal and Vishnu schist rocks formed due to intense metamorphism and were intruded with granites. These ancient deformed rocks are found at the base of the Grand Canyon, in Salt River Canyon, and in mountain ranges throughout the state. Arizona's oldest rocks overall are metamorphosed volcanic rocks, including basalt and rhyolite and related sedimentary rocks, that now constitute the bottom of the Grand Canyon and formed beginning 1.8 billion years ago. The Verde district at Jerome, in Yavapai County also preserves rocks from this period. There, ancient submarine hydrothermal vents precipitated sulfides directly onto an ancient seabed, creating massive copper and zinc ore sulfide deposits. The Mazatzal orogeny occurred from 1.7 to 1.61 billion years ago. During this event, igneous rocks that were more enriched in quartz than previous rocks formed the Mazatzal Mountains and the New River area. The Pinal Schist also formed during this period and was intruded by granite and granodiorite. The oldest Proterozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks were intruded with granites and pegmatite between 1.45 and 1.4 billion years ago. The Oracle Granite, near Tucson, the Ruin Granite, close to the Ray- Superior area, and the Zoroaster Granite at the base of the Grand Canyon all contain one to two inch long, pink orthoclase crystals. The orogeny generated the Texas Zone, an area of fractures, fissures and faults in rock, trending northwest from Texas to California. In Arizona, these veins commonly host exotic minerals including beryllium and tantalum, and elements like lithium, bismuth, uranium and tungsten. These minerals were emplaced by hot hydrothermal fluids moving through the weak zones in the rock. The major Grenville orogeny in the east of the Proto-North American continent impacted areas as far west as Arizona, producing large rift basins between 1.2 and 1 billion years ago. Rift basins were structurally related to the formation of copper deposits and the Keweenawan basalt flaws in Michigan, and regionally, the basins filled with thick layers of sediment in Arizona. The Apache Group near the bottom of the Grand Canyon, includes fluvial shale and sandstone, as well as limestone from a shallow sea, exposed in the Salt River Canyon. The limestone contains stromatolite remains, mounds of blue-green algae. The Apache Group was intruded with basalt and diabase between 1.05 and 1.14 billion years ago. The Mescal Limestone metamorphosed, forming asbestos and superheated diabase magma \\"baked\\" the limestone to marble. The 1.07 billion year old limestone, shale, quartzite, sandstone and basalt of the Unkar Group is also found in the Grand Canyon. The Mesoproterozoic formations in the Grand Canyon are overlain by the 850 million year old, Neoproterozoic Chuar Group and Sixtymile Formation sedimentary rocks. The Great Unconformity is a famous gap in the stratigraphic record of the Grand Canyon of 900 million years between Proterozoic granitic rocks and Cambrian marine sediments. For the remaining 350 million years of the Proterozoic, Arizona experienced extensive erosion, with only a few areas of sediment deposition in down-dropped basins. Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago) Throughout the Paleozoic as multi- cellular life became common, Arizona formed the passive western margin of North America. Although the region was tectonically quiet and had no volcanic activity or igneous intrusions, it was impacted by a series of major orogenies to the east. The Taconic orogeny, between 490 and 445 million years ago, the Acadian orogeny, from 410 to 380 million years ago, and the Alleghanian orogeny from 325 to 220 million years ago pushed up towering mountain ranges. Extensive erosion of these mountains shed sediments westward into a shallow sea in Arizona. Limestone formed in the shallow sea contains many of the state's caves, important ore deposits and high-quality mineral specimens such as wulfenite. Invertebrate fossils are common in marine deposits from this period. In the Middle Cambrian, 520 to 488 million years ago, the seashore moved eastward depositing beach-related sandstones. These, in turn, are overlain by sandstone, siltstone and shale deposited under near-shore conditions, which were covered over 515 to 488 million years ago by limestone, traced with worm boreholes, as well as thin beds of conglomerate. Trilobite and brachiopod fossils appear in the stratigraphic record. Due to uplift during the Taconic orogeny, the sea retreated and Arizona returned to continental conditions during the Ordovician and Silurian leaving few rocks from these time periods. During the Devonian, Arizona alternated between marine and continental conditions, as a subduction zone and volcanic island arc appeared in the area of Nevada. The Martin Formation in southern Arizona contains limestone, sandstone, shale and chert deposited in the Late Devonian and laden with fish and invertebrate fossils. A lull between orogenies in the Mississippian period of the Carboniferous resulted in a major marine transgression and the formation of thick limestone. The Redwall Limestone in the Grand Canyon and the Esabrosa Limestone in southern Arizona, both date to this period and contain coral, brachiopod and crinoid fossils. Subsequent erosion has generated large caves in the limestone, including Kartchner Cavern in Cochise County and the Grand Canyon's Vesey's Paradise. During the Pennsylvanian and the Permian, the final assembly of the Appalachian Mountains to the elevation of the Himalayas occurred with the Alleghanian orogeny and the formation of the supercontinent Pangaea. Glaciation of the southern hemisphere raised and lowered sea levels in Arizona, creating the ledge and slope topography common in the Grand Canyon, Sedona and Monument Valley, with alternating layers of siltstone, limestone, sandstone, dolomite and shale. The Kaibab Limestone is a famous formation from this time, covering much of northern Arizona. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) In the Mesozoic, the supercontinent Pangaea began to rift apart in its center to form the Atlantic Ocean. The subduction of the Farallon Plate beneath western North America remains a poorly understood event, although new seismic and computer tomography modeling is shedding light on the event. As the oceanic plate subsided under North America, it generated partial melting conditions that formed volcanoes on the surface in California and Arizona. Volcanic activity commenced in western Arizona around 205 million years ago, kicking off the Nevadan orogeny, which lasted until 145 million years ago, spanning the Triassic into the Jurassic. Granite intrusions 190 million years ago enriched many veins with minerals and generated copper porphyry gold deposits. Bisbee, Arizona, 92 miles southeast of Tucson experienced secondary oxidation and enrichment to form high-quality malachite and azurite. Southern Arizona was uplifted and experienced volcanic eruptions, which deposited high silica ash to the north as the Chinle Formation, which created the petrified wood of Petrified Forest National Park. Through the Jurassic, a large coastal desert similar to the modern Sahara or Namib desert occupied northern Arizona into Utah. Volcanic material is interbedded with dune sandstones in the Santa Rita Mountains, to the south of Tucson and correlate with the Aztec Sandstone and Navaja Sandstone, spanning northern Arizona to Zion National Park. In the Cretaceous, the Sevier orogeny took place further west in California from 140 to 89 million years ago and was also related to the subducting Farallon plate. However, unlike the Nevadan orogeny, there was no significant vein-related mineral formation in Arizona. The region retreated to marine conditions and clam shells built a limestone deposit around Bisbee. Unlike in the past, the marine transgression originated to the southeast and the east of the Western Interior Seaway. Rising and falling seas from the east deposited shale and sandstone, as sediments from the Sevier orogeny shed into eastward. Coal deposits formed in a swampy coastal environment. Many impacts of older mountain building events were overprinted and re-mineralized by the Laramide orogeny, 89 to 43 million years ago, which built the Rocky Mountains. Volcanic activity, magmatism and mineralization shifted eastward into Arizona. Small intrusions and volcanic centers record the first phase of the Laramide orogeny in southern Arizona from 76 to 67 million years ago. Copper-gold porphyry mineralization appeared in western Arizona, as well as in neighboring New Mexico. The main Laramide phase from 79 to 67 million years ago created massive volcanic centers, which erupted huge volumes of andesite and rhyolite ash. These calderas collapsed on themselves, leaving behind remnants such as the Cat Mountain Rhyolite, to the west of Tucson. Cobbles and gigantic boulders, as large as houses form sedimentary rocks in a matrix of volcanic material. Silver, lead and zinc deposited from hydrothermal solutions in radial and ring fractures in the rock. Cenozoic (66 million years ago- present) Due to flat subduction during the final phase of the Laramide orogeny from 54 to 43 million years ago in the Eocene epoch of the Cenozoic, deep intrusion of granite and pegmatite took place, 23 kilometers below the surface. Granitic plutons tended to form near well-developed crush zone and often have tungsten and quartz rich veins in garnet-muscovite granitoids and pegmatite dikes. The Santa Catalina Mountains north and northeast of Tucson contain the Wilderness Granite, which formed as an intrusion 14 miles below the surface. The Colorado Plateau uplifted and began to erode during the Eocene. During the Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene, the Mid-Tertiary igmibrite flare-up, a mountain building event tied to the Farallon Plate, erupted huge quantities of volcanic ash. Many small mountain ranges in western Arizona, including the Superstition, Galiuro, Chiricahua and Tumacacori mountains are predominantly made up of ash flow tuff from these eruptions. The eruptions are believed to have been partly the result of increasing steep slab subduction into the mantle and magmatic activity shifted from the east to the west, bringing with it changes in mineralogy and rock types. Small basins accumulated volcanic debris, conglomerate and lacustrine gypsum, clay and carbonates. Lava flows and granite intrusions built up the Galiuro Mountains and Chiricahua Mountains. Gold and copper veins mineralized in dike swarms, followed by caldera-related batholiths and silver-lead-zinc skarns. Low angle normal and detachment faults deformed sedimentary and volcanic rocks from the final phase of the event. In the last 14 million years of the Miocene, Pliocene, Pleistocene and the current Holocene, the subducting Farallon slab was cut off by strike-slip motion on the San Andreas Fault, coupled with a transform boundary. The slab has continued to descend, but with less force driving it. As a result, steep normal faults formed the horst and graben landscape of the Basin and Range Province. Basalt intruded into the basins and evaporites and other sediments accumulated, including salt beneath Phoenix, clay and zeolites in the Bowie area and gypsum in both the San Pedro and Verde valleys. The Sentinel volcanic field, west of Casa Grande, and the San Francisco volcanic field to the north of Flagstaff both formed in basins, extruded in the last five million years. Additionally, deep peridotite was brought to the surface in basalt flows in the San Bernardino volcanic field in the southeast. Hydrogeology Because of its arid climate and large population, water is critically important in the state of Arizona. Most drinking water is drawn from surface water sources, including Bureau of Reclamation dams and the Central Arizona Project diversion. Much of this surface water is from the Colorado River. Groundwater serves to augment surface water. Between 1915 and 1983, an estimated 81 million acre feet of groundwater was pumped in the vicinity of Phoenix, to complement surface water from the Salt River, Verde River and Agua Fria River. In urban areas, groundwater is now mainly recharged from excess irrigation, urban surface runoff, canal seepage and years of higher than average rainfall. In 1978, the US Geological Survey found a 350-foot decline in the level of the water table. The USGS published research in 1997, examining the Pennsylvanian and Permian age sandstone, limestone and siltstone underlying Flagstaff and the southern Colorado Plateau, which forms a complex regional aquifer with poorly understood groundwater flow. A subsequent in-depth study in 2016 looked into Coconino County and Yavapai County in the north-central part of the state. The area is underlain by the C aquifer and Redwall-Muav aquifer. The C aquifer is a water-table aquifer, with a depth of up to 1500 feet to the water table and is dry in the west, except for perched water-bearing zones. It is underlain by the Redwall-Muav, confined and up to 3200 feet below the land surface. Groundwater was up to 7000 years old in the C aquifer and up to 22,000 years old in the Redwall-Muav, based on tritium and carbon-14 analysis. For the most part, water from these aquifers is high quality although some wells exceed EPA recommendations for arsenic, barium, uranium and lead. Both aquifers have seen extensive pumping increases since 1975. Natural resource geology The Santa Rita Mountains and Tombstone Hills contain silver and lead formed by hydrothermal fluids in fractures, during the Laramide orogeny. Arizona is known as the Copper State because it produces two-thirds of US copper annually. Laramide copper porphyry deposits are common around Tucson and include the Twin Buttes, Sierrita-Esperanza, Rosemont, Silver Bell and Mission-Pima mines, as well as the historical Ajo mine to the west. The Ray, Miami, Pinto Valley, Morenci, Safford, Carlota, Superior and Resolution mines are examples of open-pit extraction sites for copper in east-central Arizona. These deposits typically have a bulls-eye pattern of mineralization ranging from copper and zinc at the center to zinc, lead, silver and gold in the periphery and silver and manganese on the outer edge. Secondary copper enrichment and oxidation have yielded minerals with even higher copper concentrations, including chalcopyrite, chalcocite, azurite, malachite and chrysocolla. Additionally, skarn deposits are common near plutons, where contact metamorphism with granite magma generates garnet or calcium silicate. The Aravapai, Castle Dome, California, Middle Pass, Swisshelm and Ash Peak mining districts all resulted from the Mid-Tertiary mountain building event.

It was used during both the First and Second World Wars. History After the independence and unification of Italy, the Italians were not self-sufficient in arms design and production. Foreign firms such as Armstrong, Krupp, Schneider, and Vickers all provided arms and helped establish local production of their designs under license. In addition to Italy, the design was also produced under license in Japan. Major Pompeo Grillo, a heavy artillery specialist was hired in April 1884 to help the construction of a new artillery plant in Osaka. The description from Brassey's Naval Annual of 1892 reads \\"The howitzer was a 28-cm rifled breech-loader of cast iron, 9 calibers long made at Osaka, from the designs of guns made for the Italians by Sir W.G. Armstrong\\". The Japanese version played an important role in the destruction of the fortifications and sinking the Russian fleet during the Siege of Port Arthur in the Russo-Japanese War. Design In the coastal artillery role, the Obice da 280 was intended to pierce the thin decks of armored warships with high angle plunging fire, rather than piercing their armored belt. The Obice da 280 was a typical built-up gun of the period with an inner steel barrel reinforced with multiple layers of cast iron hoops. Starting in 1890 the Italians produced the design in a number of different lengths and they were designated by their diameter and length in calibers 280/9, 280/10, 280/11, and 280/16. The Obice da 280 was a breech loaded design with an interrupted screw breech, and used separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. In the Coastal Defense role, the Obice da 280 was mounted on a rectangular carriage which consisted of a large diameter geared steel ring set into a concrete slab behind a parapet. The mounts allowed high angles of elevation with 360¬∞ of traverse. The mount pivoted in the middle and was traversed by a worm gear which attached to the base. The recoil system for the consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with hydraulic buffers. When the gun fired the hydraulic buffer slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. World War I In 1908 the Italian coastal artillery analyzed reports from the Russo-Japanese War of the performance of the Japanese guns and found them unsatisfactory. This led to the adoption of two new guns to replace the Obice da 280, the Obice da 305/17 and the Mortaio da 260/9 Modello 16. However, neither fully replaced the Obice da 280 and a number were still on hand when Italy joined the war in 1915. Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Italian Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were coastal fortifications and surplus naval guns. Suitable field and rail carriages were built for these guns in an effort to give their forces the heavy field artillery needed to overcome trenches and hardened concrete fortifications. At the outbreak of the First World War, it is estimated there were 22 Obice da 280's deployed in coastal batteries. 12 guns were deployed near Spart√† and 10 were deployed near Calabria guarding the straights of Messina. For transport, the Obice da 280 could be broken down into multiple wagon loads for towing to the front by artillery tractors and then reassembled onsite on using cranes and winches. Many were removed from their coastal fortifications and were deployed on the Isonzo front in 1917 and were captured by the Austrians in the Battle of Caporetto. What use the Austrians made of the captured guns is unknown? World War II An unknown number survived until the Second World War and were once again deployed in coastal fortifications.

Plot The Kree have initiated a murdering campaign in order to force Black Bolt to join the Kree Empire. This ultimatum causes the deaths of 1,038 Inhumans with the words \\"Join or Die\\" carved into their bodies, which forced Black Bolt to call together the four Queens of the Universal Inhuman tribes to respond to this threat. However, the meeting goes far from as planned, as an Inhuman executioner named Vox, a Super-Inhuman created by the Kree, begins his bloody rampage across the place. When Black Bolt, Medusa, Gorgon, Karnak, Crystal, Triton, and Lockjaw reached the meeting place, they discover the bodies of Oola Udonta, Aladi Ko Eke, Onomi Whitemane and Goddess Ovoe, with the same three words written in their blood on a banner hanging about their corpses and eventually realized that they fell in to a trap as one of the dead Inhumans was wired with an explosive. While most of Black Bolt's group made it out alive thanks to Lockjaw, Triton was not so lucky and was killed in the explosion. Black Bolt then sent Lockjaw to New Arctilan to retrieve his brother Maximus. Unbeknownst to them, Vox and his men had already arrived on New Arctilan and began murdering every Inhuman they come across, old or new like Flagman, Glass Girl, Naja, and Sterilon. Armed with all of the Inhumans‚Äô abilities and no humanity, Vox easily cuts his prey down with his powers or his literal energy scythe. Even Maximus can‚Äôt defeat Vox as he quickly loses an arm for even making the attempt. Soon after, Lockjaw arrives and helps Maximus with his attempt to stop Vox on their own but things don't go so well as Vox fires an enormous blast, ripping a hole in both of them.Death of the Inhumans #1 (July 2018). Marvel Comics. The Royal Family eventually reaches the now burned Kingdom of New Arctilan and mourn the death of its citizens. Karnak, who can see the flaw in all things, is then sent to the Kree Commander to relay a message from Black Bolt, learning in the process that the Kree intend to rebuild Hala and enslave the Inhumans as their intended soldiers and slaves. The Kree Commander explains how they dispatched Ronan the Accuser as leader of the Kree after Hala was placed in ruin by Mister Knife and have begun to forge a new life. When asked to kneel, Karnak doesn‚Äôt. Instead, he does his best to fend off Vox only for the Super-Inhuman is able to subdue Karnak. As Black Bolt arrives, he walks through the halls of the Kree base speaking every name of the fallen Inhumans, making it a song about death. Eventually, it comes down to just Black Bolt vs. Vox who's holding Karnak as a shield. Black Bolt signs to Karnak to have Vox take him instead. Vox apparently accepts the change as he teleports himself behind Black Bolt. Before Karnak‚Äôs very eyes, Vox slits Black Bolt‚Äôs throat.Death of the Inhumans #2 (August 2018). Marvel Comics. The Kree take Black Bolt prisoner and repair the damage done to his throat without using any sedatives or anesthesia to dull the pain which prompted them to think that Black Bolt's great power is gone when he doesn't scream and therefore the prophecy about the Midnight King is no longer a threat to the Kree. However, while being transported, it turns out he still has his voice, but its faint. After killing several Kree, Black Bolt secures a firearm and finds Ronan the Accuser alive. However, he is a prisoner of Vox and having been experimented on alongside the Kree soldiers that are loyal to Ronan. Black Bolt learns of this when he sees that Ronan has been converted to a cyborg. At Ronan‚Äôs request, Black Bolt enables him a mercy killing by whispering \\"You are forgiven.\\" Elsewhere, Medusa and the surviving Inhuman Royal Family members try to recruit Beta Ray Bill in their fight against Vox and the Kree.Death of the Inhumans #3 (September 2018). Marvel Comics. The Inhuman Royal Family are finally taking the battle to the Kree and arrive just in time to save Black Bolt from Vox. Thanks to the interference of Beta Ray Bill, the Inhuman Royal Family are able to overpower and kill Vox, but not before he's apparently able to kill Crystal. They soon realize to their surprise that Vox was actually Maximus in disguise concluding that the Super-Inhuman isn‚Äôt a person. Instead, it is a programmed and it is also revealed that the voice power everyone assumes is vaporizing his targets was actually just teleporting them instead as it was seen after Crystal‚Äôs apparent death, she has been transported to an unknown place where Kree scientists are experimenting on the Inhuman victims who were supposedly killed. While Lockjaw isn‚Äôt seen, Triton appears to be in some kind of stasis tank alongside Naja, Sterilon, and other unnamed Inhumans. Crystal is now doomed to be the next Vox.Death of the Inhumans #4 (October 2018). Marvel Comics. While recapping the deaths that Vox has caused, Black Bolt also recalls the prophecy of the Midnight King. Meeting up with the Inhuman Royal Family and Beta Ray Bill, Black Bolt is told by Karnak of Vox being a programming that transported his \\"victims\\" to the Kree. With the Kree planning to turn any captive Inhumans into Vox, Karnak states that not all of them will be rescued. As Black Bolt has one more scream left, Karnak tells him to make it count. Using his sign language, Black Bolt addresses the others on how he has made mistakes in the past and apologizes to them. After holding a moment of silence, Black Bolt orders Gorgon to turn around. Meanwhile, the Kree Commander speaks with Vox about letting Black Bolt escape. Vox states that Black Bolt will come for his people. A Kree interrupts them stating that a ship is coming at them fast. The Inhuman ship strikes the Kree's base. Vox then pushes a button to activate the Vox-controlled Inhumans. As Gorgon and Beta Ray Bill engage the Kree soldiers, Black Bolt, Medusa, and Karnak arrive at the laboratory where they find Vox-controlled Inhumans like Crystal and Lockjaw. Using a laser, Black Bolt clears the Vox-controlled Crystal and Lockjaw just because they were in his way. Entering one door, Black Bolt signs \\"I love you. I'm sorry\\" before whispering for them to run. As Medusa and Karnak fight the Vox-controlled Crystal and Lockjaw, Black Bolt confronts other Vox-controlled Inhumans like Triton. Knowing the truth about the prophecy, Black Bolt brings ruin to the Kree and unleashes his scream on the Vox-controlled Inhumans, killing them all. This action frees Crystal and Lockjaw from Vox's control. Gorgon and Beta Ray Bill arrive stating that the Kree have fled and see Crystal and Lockjaw still alive. Black Bolt emerges from the room as Medusa orders Lockjaw to take them away from the Kree base. When Crystal asks where they should go, Black Bolt uses his sign language to say \\"home.\\" Lockjaw then teleports them away.Death of the Inhumans #5 (November 2018). Marvel Comics.

It began on 21 July 2018 and concluded with the final in Braga on 26 January 2019. The competition's semi-finals (Benfica v Porto, and Braga v Sporting CP) were marked by controversy involving the video assistant referee (VAR).Conselho de Arbitragem afasta F√°bio Ver√≠ssimo por algumas semanas Renascen√ßa F√°bio Ver√≠ssimo fora das nomea√ß√µes como video√°rbitro nas pr√≥ximas semanas RTP F√°bio Ver√≠ssimo afastado da sala de VAR durante algumas jornadas A Bola √Årbitro do SC Braga-Sporting tamb√©m ficar√° fora nos pr√≥ximos jogos A Bola In the final, Sporting defeated Porto 3‚Äì1 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1‚Äì1 draw, becoming the second team (after Benfica) to both defend their title and win the competition multiple times. Format The 11 teams placed 4th-16th in the 2017‚Äì18 LigaPro (reserve teams from Primeira Liga clubs are excluded) take part in the first round; one-legged ties are played between ten teams, with one team receiving a bye to the next round. In the second round, the six teams advancing from the previous round (five winners plus the one team with a bye) are joined by the 14 teams placed 5th‚Äì18th in the 2017‚Äì18 Primeira Liga, by the two teams promoted to 2018‚Äì19 Primeira Liga and the team placed third in the 2017‚Äì18 LigaPro. Again, one-legged ties were played between 22 teams, with one team receiving a bye to the next round. The third round features the twelve teams advancing from the previous round (eleven winners plus the one team with a bye) and the four best-placed teams in the 2017‚Äì18 Primeira Liga. The 16 teams are drawn into four groups that will be contested in a single round-robin format, with each team playing at least one game at home. The four group winners qualify for the semi-finals, which are played as single-legged ties. The semi-finals and final are played at a neutral venue, set to be in Braga until 2020. {  - !Round !Teams entering in this round !Teams advancing from previous round - !First round (11 teams)  *11 teams competing in the 2018‚Äì19 LigaPro  - !Second round (23 teams)  *14 teams ranked 5th‚Äì18th in the 2017‚Äì18 Primeira Liga *1 team ranked 3rd in the 2017‚Äì18 LigaPro *2 teams promoted to the 2018‚Äì19 Primeira Liga  *5 winners from the first round *1 team that received a bye - !Third round (16 teams)  *4 teams ranked 1st‚Äì4th in the 2017‚Äì18 Primeira Liga  *11 winners from the second round *1 team that received a bye - !Semi-finals (4 teams)   *4 group winners from the third round - !Final (2 teams)   *2 winners from the semi-finals } Tiebreakers In the third round, teams are ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams are tied on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied to determine the rankings: #highest goal difference in all group matches; #highest number of scored goals in all group matches; #lowest average age of all players fielded in all group matches (sum of the ages of all fielded players divided by the number of fielded players). In all other rounds, teams tied at the end of regular time contest a penalty shootout to determine the winner. No extra-time is played.

Third round In the third round, the 11 second-round winners plus Vit√≥ria de Set√∫bal, who were given a bye to this round, joined the four top-ranked teams from the 2017‚Äì18 Primeira Liga: Porto (1st), Benfica (2nd), Sporting CP (3rd) and Braga (4th). These 16 teams were drawn into four groups of four, each group containing one of the four top- ranked Primeira Liga teams who each host their first two group matches. Group matches were played in a single round-robin format, ensuring that each team played at least one match at home. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots based on their league position in the previous season, with the teams participating in the 2017‚Äì18 Primeira Liga being seeded higher regardless of any relegation. The fixtures and match dates were decided by an additional draw. Group A Notes: Group B Group C Group D Knockout phase The knockout phase was contested as a final-four tournament by the four third-round group winners in one-legged semi-finals and final. All matches were played in a neutral venue, decided before the competition starts. As in the first and second round, games tied at the end of regular time were decided by a penalty shootout with no extra-time being played. The first semi-final was played between the winners of Groups A (Benfica) and C (Porto), while the second was played between Group B (Braga) and D (Sporting CP) winners. Groups A and B winners (Benfica and Braga, respectively) were designated as the \\"home\\" teams (for administrative purposes) in their semi-final clashes as was the winner of the first semi- final in the final. If the team that played at home in the appointed neutral stadium was still in competition, in this case Braga, they were designated the home team regardless of which group or semi-final they played. All matches were played at Est√°dio Municipal de Braga, in Braga, with the semi-finals played on 22 and 23 January, and the final on 26 January 2019.

It is located at: St. Stanislavsky, Building 29, Building 1 (Nikoloyamskaya St., Building 60). Attached to the church is the St. Sergius of Radonezh in Rogozhskaya Sloboda.  History  The church in 1883 It is known that on the site of the present temple in the Rogozhskaya Sloboda there was a wooden church, which was first mentioned in 1625 and was presumably built not long before. A chapel of St. Nicholas was built in the wooden church in 1696. The wooden building was replaced with a brick church in 1701. The current building was built by the residents of the settlement in 1748-1751. The main throne was consecrated in honor of the icon of the Theodore of Our Lady, while lateral chapels were consecrated in the name of Alexy the Metropolitan and Nicholas the Miracle-Worker. The authorship of the project is attributed to the architect D. V. Ukhtomsky. In 1778-1779 the walls of the building were painted. In the second half of the 19th century, the church operated an almshouse for ten parishioners. According to information at the beginning of the 20th century, the baroque iconostasis of 1751 and the wall murals of 1778 were preserved in the church.

Since 1966, a factory has operated in the temple for the processing of special alloys, and repair and construction management since 1984. In 1990, the building was occupied by the warehouse of the district repair and construction department. As of that period, the upper part of the bell tower was demolished. The drum, the head and cross of the main temple, and part of the fence were dismantled. A number of extensions were made to the building. In the early 1990s, the church was returned to the Orthodox Church and restoration work began. In 2012, the completion of the main temple was restored.  Architecture  The architecture of the church refers to the mature Elizabethan Baroque. To the quadrangle from the east, there is a semicircular apse. In the west, there is a two-line refectory with a three-tiered bell tower. The walls are evenly dissected by pilasters and completed with wide cornices. Wide arched windows are decorated with figured platbands.

Background In June 2017, Ant-Man and the Wasp director Peyton Reed confirmed that Christophe Beck, who composed the score for Ant-Man, would return for Ant-Man and the Wasp. Beck reprised his main theme from Ant-Man, and also wrote a new one for Hope van Dyne / Wasp that he wanted to be \\"high energy\\" and show that she is more certain of her abilities than Scott Lang / Ant-Man. When choosing between these themes for specific scenes throughout the film, Beck tried to choose the Wasp theme more often so there would be \\"enough newness in the score to feel like it‚Äôs going new places, and isn‚Äôt just some retread.\\" Hollywood Records and Marvel Music released the soundtrack album digitally on July 6, 2018. In April of 2019 Mondo released a vinyl album (2XLP) \\"Featuring 14 previously unreleased bonus tracks.\\" This album is to be the first of several Marvel soundtracks released on vinyl in limited numbers.

Watson and introduced in 1915 and 1924 as a heavy shunter and banker for use on the relatively severe gradient from Kingsbridge to Clondalkin. Design The locomotives were unique as being the only locomotives with eight-coupled driving wheels on the Irish gauge, though Watson had chosen to dismiss drawings for at 0-8-2T prepared under his predecessor R. E. L. Maunsell. The cylinders drove the leading coupled driving axle. Some components were common with GS&WR; Class 362 and 368. Operation They were noted as being prone to derailment on sidings which could have sharp curves and be poorly ballasted, though thin flanges on the middle driving wheels combined with a long wheelbase and additional weight on the leading axle may equally have been factors. Engine 900 was later converted to a [4-6-2T] by removing the coupling rods to the rear driving wheels. Engine 901 was introduced nine years after 900 by J.R. Bazin, and was the only engine to be introduced by the Great Southern Railway which existed for less than two months before being joined with the Dublin and South Eastern Railway to form Great Southern Railways (GSR). The engines were not particularly successful and were regarded as surplus to requirements and withdrawn after a short life by 1931 as it was found their work could be adequately performed by standard locomotives. Model There is a detailed O Gauge model of engine 900 in the Fry model railway collection.

It was the organ of the Ukrainian People's Council of the Pre≈°ov Region, a pro-Soviet structure that appeared at the late stage of World War II. Priashevshchina initially appeared semiweekly, later becoming a weekly. Priashevshchina was the first newspaper for the Ruthenian/Ukrainian population in the area to appear after the liberation of the Presov region. Chief editors of the newspaper were Ivan P'e≈°ƒçak and Fedor Lazoryk.teraz.sk. Obec Becherov vraj dostala meno podƒæa sluhu P'e≈°ƒçak, former parliamentarian of the First Czechoslovak Republic who had called for Rusyn national autonomy in the Pre≈°ov region after the Munich Agreement, had previously published the newspaper Priashevskaya Rus. In addition to political issues, Priashevshchina also promoted local literature and had a positive impact on dissemination of Rusyn literature. The publication was managed by Russophiles, and was mainly printed in standard literary Russian language. However, especially in the last two years of existence, it carried minor pieces in Pre≈°ov vernacular. The newspaper was largely pro-Soviet in this editorial tone and contained reports on life in Soviet Union. But whilst the publication was issued in Russian it addressed political issues from a Ukrainian, or at least localized, angle. In terms of 'Ukrainianism', reflecting the Ukrainian People's Council line, Priashevshchina argued that \\"[o]ne and the same nation lives on the territory of Transcarpathian Ukraine and the Pre≈°ov region. There is no doubt that this nation is a part of the Little Russian-Ukrainian nation. Because the entire Little Russian nation has accepted the name \\"Ukrainian\\" we in the Pre≈°ov region also accept the name Ukrainian to show our unity with the great Ukrainian nation. Once we are the same nation as the nation of Transcarpathian Ukraine, Western Ukraine and Soviet Ukraine, we cannot call ourselves anything different from our brothers.\\" The use of the term 'Ukrainian' sought to repress previous identity markers such as 'Lemko', 'Rusyn' and 'Rusnak'. Over the years, Slovak authorities began to increasingly fear that Priashevshchina and the Ukrainian People's Council, articulated separatist ambitions for annexation of the Pre≈°ov region by the Soviet Union (on similar lines as Transcarpathian Ukraine).PhDr. Michal ≈†migeƒæ, PhD.

Priashevshchina ceased to appear on August 16, 1951, following a resolution by the Ukrainian People's Council in reaction to the formation of a new organization for the Ruthenian/Ukrainian minority (the Cultural Union of Ukrainian Workers in the CSSR). The Ukrainian People's Council, was eventually closed in December 1952, as part of the drive by Czechoslovak authorities to substitute the language of the Ruthenians from Russian to Ukrainian.

His argument that the suppression of the revolt in the Vend√©e by the Revolutionary government constituted a genocide was controversial. Reviewers denounced Secher as anti-revolutionary and anti- republican.D. M. G.

However, Secher's estimate of the Vend√©an casualties was criticised by historians such as Charles Tilly and Michel Vovelle due to objections to Secher's methodology.Tilly, p. 90. Tilly accused Secher of using \\"dubious methods to estimate the losses of population and housing attributable to the counterrevolution and its repression\\".Tilly, p. 93. Fran√ßois Lebrun has argued for a figure of 150,000 rebel dead, while Jean-Cl√©ment Martin estimated rebel casualties as numbering between 220,000 and 250,000.Gough, p. 987. Donald Sutherland of the University of Maryland claimed that Secher's figures have been superseded by the research of Jacques Hussenet, who calculated losses of 165,000.Sutherland, p. 237. Sutherland also argued that the repression of the Vend√©ans did not constitute a genocide and that Secher showed \\"an eye-popping gullibility in crediting every anti-republican atrocity story he can find\\".Sutherland, pp. 236-237.

Early life Barsirian was born to Koitalel arap Samoei in 1882 in Samitu, part of present Nandi County. He was the second born son of Koitalel's second wife, Taparchok chepo Chebwai. His elder brother was known as Surtan Lelimo arap Somoei and he had three sisters known as Titau, Kopot Kiboor and Kopot chepo Siror. Barsirian was initiated into the Nyongi age-set.Nandi Sailor News, Barsirian arap Manyei: Persecuted in life, neglected in death online Father's assassination Barsirian's father, Koitalel arap Samoei, was assassinated on 19 October 1905. The colonial administration subsequently set about banishing, detaining or killing his brothers and sons. Kibeles was installed as Nandi Orkoiyot by the protectorate administration following the 'Muhoroni Conference' in 1909 though he would die shortly after in July, 1912. Following Kibeles death, the Nandi convinced the protectorate administration to appoint Lelimo arap Samoei as heir to his father's office. However, it is reported that the administration sought an informant in Lelimo's court and found one in one of his bodyguards a short while later. Lelimo subsequently found out about this and put the bodyguard to death following which he went into hiding. Orkoiyot of Nandi: 1919‚Äì1923 Barsirian arap Manyei took over the office of Orkoiyot in 1919. Nandi Protest A number of factors taking place in the early 1920s led to what has come to be termed the Nandi ProtestEllis, D. The Nandi Protest of 1923 in the Context of African Resistance to Colonial Rule in Kenya, The Journal of African History, Vol. 17, No 4 (1976) or Uprisings of 1923. It was the first expression of organized resistance by the Nandi since the wars of 1905‚Äì06. A number of factors contributed to the unrest, chief among them; the land alienation of 1920 and a steep increase in taxation, taxation tripled between 1909 and 1920 and because of a change in collection date, two taxes were collected in 1921. Additionally, due to fears of a spread of rinderpest following an outbreak, a stock quarantine was imposed on the Nandi Reserve between 1921 and 1923. The Nandi, prevented from selling stock outside the Reserve, had no cash to pay taxes. The labor conscription that took place under the Northey Circulars added to the bitterness against the colonial government. By 1923, when the saget ab eito (sacrifice of the ox) was to take place, these factors had been contributing to a buildup of antagonism and unrest toward the government for three years. The historically significant ceremony where leadership of the community was transferred between generations had always been followed by an increased rate of cattle raiding as the now formally recognized warrior age-set sought to prove its prowess. The approach to a saget ab eito thus witnessed expressions of military fervor and for the ceremony all Nandi males would gather in one place. Alarmed at the prospect, the colonial government came to believe that Barsirian was planning to use the occasion of the Saget ab eito as a cover under which to gather forces for a massive military uprising. On 16 October 1923, several days before the scheduled date for the saget ab eito, Barsirian Arap Manyei and four other elders were arrested and deported to Meru. Permission to hold the ceremony was subsequently withdrawn and it did not take place.Oboler, R.S, online, Stanford University Press, 1985 Detention Barsirian Arap Manyei was detained from 1923 to 1964 making him Kenya's longest serving political prisoner. He was detained at Meru, Mfangano Island and in Kapsabet. Life after detention Multiple reports suggest that Barsirian Arap Manyei spent his life after detention in penury. It is recorded for instance that on 25 November 1970, Arap Saina, a Kenyan Member of Parliament asked in that body, what action the Government would take to help Barsirian \\"whose age was approaching 90 years, and who had a large family who were all squatters\\". Death Barsirian Arap Manyei died on 10 April 1974. He was buried at his wife's (Taplelei) home at Lemoru Ngeny village in Uasin Gishu County.

First flown in August 1939, only one was completed before World War II. Design and development Like many amateur Polish designers in the 1930s, Adam ≈öcibor-Rylski was interested in simple, low cost machines. A student at the Warsaw Technical University, he began his studies with the ≈öR-1, an attempt to motorize the Wrona basic, open-frame glider. Difficulties in mounting an engine in this structure led to the ≈öR-2 which had the Wrona wing married to a new nacelle. By 1937 he had dropped these projects in favour of a more refined, cabin aircraft. This, the ≈öR-3, was the subject of his diploma. With the encouragement of LOPP and the Silesian Gliding Workshop (SWS) he received government funding. The ≈öR-3 was a wooden aircraft with a high cantilever wing. The wing was a one piece structure built around a single spar and tapered in plan. It was plywood covered apart from a small fabric covered area aft of the auxiliary spar that carried the ailerons. These were unbalanced and operated differentially. It was first fitted with a Avia 4 flat-four engine which failed during ground trials and was replaced by a Sarolea Albatros flat twin with a fuel tank in the wing. Behind the engine the fuselage was a rectangular section, stressed ply skinned structure, with a rounded roof between the wing trailing edge and the tail where the fuselage narrowed strongly in profile. The ≈öR-3's single-seat cockpit was under the wing leading edge and had an upward hinged, one-piece transparent cover. Its empennage was also ply covered and unbalanced, with the tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage. The fin was almost triangular and carried a full, semi- elliptical rudder which operated between the elevators. The ≈öR-3 had small mainwheels mounted close to the fuselage on short, curved V-struts which had a rubber-in-compression shock absorber within the fuselage. Zbiniew ≈ªabski flew the ≈öR-3 on its first flight at the end of August 1939. Though SWS had hoped to produce the ≈öR-3 in both kit and complete forms, the German invasion of Poland a few days after the first flight ended such hopes. The ≈öR-3 was reportedly taken by the invaders and flown by the Dortmund Nazi youth organisation.

Early life  Benjamin Reichwald was born 9 April 1994 in Stockholm, Sweden and was raised mainly in the Skanstull area. It was here where, in 2004, he met fellow Gravity Boys member Zak Arogundade, also known as Ecco2k. The two were classmates and formed a band titled \\"Krossad\\" when Reichwald was 13, which led to Reichwald's interest in music. After leaving school, Reichwald began to get into making music whilst working at a daycare centre.  Career  Reichwald released a few tracks in 2011 under the name Ken Burns, but properly began releasing music in 2012. He eventually became friends with Swedish rapper Yung Lean, who was a friend of Reichwald's brother. Reichwald eventually sent a message to Sad Boys member Yung Sherman on SoundCloud, asking to collaborate, which resulted in a working relationship between his own Gravity Boys collective and Lean's Sad Boys Entertainment. Reichwald and Lean then made \\"Heal You // Bladerunner\\" from Lean's Unknown Death 2002 mixtape, which gave him attention from Lean's fanbase. Reichwald released his debut-mixtape, GLUEE in 2014 on the YEAR0001 label which was described as the \\"summertime anthem for a suburban generation stuck scrolling through Twitter\\". The mixtape was successful on the audio distribution platform SoundCloud, racking up over 2 million plays. This mixtape, coupled with several singles going viral and features on Yung Leans debut mixtape Unknown Death 2002 was able to rocket Bladee into underground hip hop fame. Reichwald released his debut album, Eversince on May 25, 2016. The album received mixed reviews from mainstream outlets, but was well-received by underground and experimental critics. In 2017, Reichwald teamed up with production group Working on Dying to release his second mixtape, named after the group. 2018 saw the release of Reichwald's second album, Red Light. In July 2018, Reichwald and fellow Drain Gang member Ecco2K walked Alyx Studio's S/S 2019 menswear show in Paris, on invitation from Matthew Williams.\\"Alyx S/S 19 Menswear\\", Vogue, Retrieved 6 February 2020 Reichwald's third mixtape, Icedancer, was released December 28, 2018. This album was executively produced by Australian collective Ripsquad featuring production from Whitearmor and PJ Beats.\\"Icedancer\\", Genius. Retrieved on 6 February 2020. In April 2020, Reichwald released EXETER, a nine-song mixtape he recorded whilst in Gotland with Gud. It is the first Bladee project produced by Gud on the YEAR0001 label.\\"EXETER\\", YEAR0001. Retrieved on 8 April 2020. In July 2020, Reichwald released his third album and second project of 2020, 333 via YEAR0001. The album was produced primarily by Whitearmor, with additional production coming from close collaborators Gud, Mechatok, and Lusi, as well as Joakim Benon of the Swedish band JJ. Notable is the absence of any vocal features, especially of longtime collaborator and fellow Drain Gang member Ecco2K, who contributed to the previous 2 Bladee albums.  Musical style  Reichwald's musical style has described his style as \\"pain\\" though saying, as of 2018, he had \\"evolved into some sort of auto-tuned dark angel\\". In a 2019 interview, Reichwald acknowledged that he frequently experiments with his music, and does not like to confine what he does to a single genre.Angell, Jack, \\"Being Bladee\\", The Fader, Retrieved on 6 February 2020. In the same interview, he stated that his music is therapeutic for him, and that he often uses it to vent. In an interview with Reichwald, Jack Angell, a music writer for The Fader, described Reichwald's sound as \\"frostbitten futurism\\" and remarked that Reichwald's music evokes \\"a wide spectrum of emotion\\". He has received widespread attention for his collaborations and live performances with Yung Lean.

The model became particularly popular among millennials in the 2010s, gaining traction through online communities via information shared in blogs, podcasts, and online discussion forums. Those seeking to attain FIRE intentionally maximize their savings rate by finding ways to increase income and or decrease expenses. The objective is to accumulate assets until the resulting passive income provides enough money for living expenses throughout one's retirement years. Many proponents of the FIRE movement suggest the 4% rule as a rough withdrawal guideline, thus setting a goal of at least 25 times one's estimated annual living expenses. Upon reaching financial independence, paid work becomes optional, allowing for retirement from traditional work decades earlier than the standard retirement age.  Background  FIRE is achieved through aggressive saving, far more than the standard 10‚Äì15% typically recommended by financial planners. Assuming constant income and expenses, and neglecting investment returns, observe that: * At a savings rate of 10%, it takes (1-0.1)/0.1 = 9 years of work to save for 1 year of living expenses. * At a savings rate of 25%, it takes (1-0.25)/0.25 = 3 years of work to save for 1 year of living expenses. * At a savings rate of 50%, it takes (1-0.5)/0.5 = 1 year of work to save for 1 year of living expenses. * At a savings rate of 75%, it takes (1-0.75)/0.75 = 1/3 year = 4 month of work to save for 1 year of living expenses. From this example, it can be concluded that the time to retirement decreases significantly as savings rate is increased. For this reason, those pursuing FIRE attempt to save 50% or more of their income. At a 75% savings rate, it would take less than 10 years of work to accumulate 25 times the average annual living expenses suggested by 'the 4% safe withdrawal' rule. There are also two sides to the spectrum of FIRE. Lean FIRE refers to the ability to retire early on a smaller accumulation of retirement income and limited living expenses which will require a frugal lifestyle during retirement. On the other end of this is Fat FIRE, which refers to the ability to retire early due to a large amount of accumulated wealth and passive income with no concerns about living expenses during retirement. A hybrid of these two is known as Barista FIRE, which refers to a semi-retired lifestyle of working part-time for some supplemental income, or retiring fully but with a partner who continues to work. FIRE is viewed as a lifestyle, not simply an investment strategy. A common thread that challenges individuals that subscribe to the FIRE lifestyle is finding partners that share the same fiscal goals.  History  The main ideas behind the FIRE movement originate from the 1992 best-selling book Your Money or Your Life written by Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez, as well as the 2010 book Early Retirement Extreme by Jacob Lund Fisker. These works provide the basic template of combining a lifestyle of simple living with income from investments to achieve financial independence. In particular, the latter book describes the relationship between savings rate and time to retirement, which allows individuals to quickly project their retirement date given an assumed level of income and expenses. The Mr. Money Mustache blog which started in 2011, is an influential voice that generated interest in the idea of achieving early retirement through frugality and helped popularize the FIRE movement. Other books, blogs, and podcasts continue to refine and promote the FIRE concept, including Financial Freedom author Grant Sabatier, who works closely with Vicki Robin and popularized the idea of side hustling as a path to accelerate financial independence. In 2018, the FIRE movement received significant coverage by traditional mainstream media outlets. According to a survey conducted by the Harris Poll later that year, 11% of wealthier Americans aged 45 and older have heard of the FIRE movement by name while another 26% are aware of the concept. 2020 saw the introduction of dating sites and blogs dedicated to bringing partners that share the FIRE lifestyle together. Criticism Some critics allege that the FIRE movement \\"is only for the rich\\", pointing to the difficulties of achieving the high savings rates needed for FIRE on a low income. Another common criticism is the FIRE movement's early retirees have not adequately saved for retirement. Because the retirement phase of FIRE could potentially last 70 years, critics say that it is inappropriate to apply the 4% rule, which was developed for a traditional retirement timeframe of 30 years; this criticism is based on the lack of empirical evidence supporting the 4% rule over a much larger time horizon.

The front row - JW Sauer, Botha, and Abraham Fischer (left to right) - were all present at the National Convention, and JBM Hertzog (far left), FR Moor (second from left), JC Smuts (fourth from right), HC Hull (third from right) and FS Malan (second from right) were also present. The National Convention (Dutch: Nationale Conventie, Afrikaans: Nasionale Konvensie), also known as the Convention on the Closer Union of South Africa or the Closer Union Convention, was a constitutional convention held between 1908 and 1909 in Durban (12 October to 5 November 1908), Cape Town (23 November to 18 December 1908, 11 January to 3 February 1909) and Bloemfontein (3 May to 11 May 1909). The convention led to the adoption of the South Africa Act by the British Parliament and thus to the creation of the Union of South Africa. The four colonies of the area that would become South Africa - the Cape Colony, Natal Colony, the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal Colony - were represented at the convention, along with a delegation from Rhodesia. There were 33 delegates in total, with the Cape being represented by 12, the Transvaal eight, the Orange River five, Natal five, and Rhodesia three. The convention was held behind closed doors, in the fear that a public affair would lead delegates to refuse compromising on contentious areas of disagreement. All the delegates were white men, a third of them were farmers, ten were lawyers, and some were academics. Two-thirds had fought on either side of the Second Boer War. By the end of the convention, the delegates had drawn up a constitution that would, subject to some amendments by the British government, become the South Africa Act, which was South Africa's constitution between 1910 and 1961, when the country became a republic under the Constitution of 1961.  Background  The first attempt to establish a union of the colonies of Southern Africa was in 1858, when burghers of the Orange Free State sent a petition to Sir George Grey, the then Governor of the Cape Colony, requesting the formation of a \\"compact union\\" including the Free State, the Cape, and Natal (but excluding the Transvaal). The Volksraad of the Orange Free State followed up the petition with a resolution requesting the State President, Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff, to communicate with Grey and proposing a conference. When Grey communicated this to the Colonial Secretary, Edward Bulwer-Lytton in London, Lytton replied that the British government was not prepared to resume sovereignty over the Free State, which it had previously controlled as the Orange River Sovereignty between 1848 and 1854. In 1871, the Cape House of Assembly passed a resolution approving of the idea of union, and in 1872 the House of Commons similarly resolved that it would be \\"desirable\\" for a confederation between the colonies and republics of South Africa to be established. In 1874, Lord Henry Carnarvon, who had introduced the British North America Act, sent James Anthony Froude to report on the situation in the region. Froude's presence was, however, resented, due to the South Africans' desire \\"that union should come from within, not dictated by Downing Street\\". Froude's report led to the British Parliament passing the South Africa Act, 1877, \\"for the Union under one Government of such of the South African Colonies and States as may agree thereto\\". It would have modeled the South African union on the Canadian model, but \\"South Africa had hardly been consulted\\" in its promulgation and no Cape parliamentarians were willing to sponsor it locally. The Act expired in August 1882, without being implemented. The First Boer War (1880 to 1881) intervened in the journey toward union, and it was not until 1889 when a customs union was formed between the Cape and the Free State, which were joined in 1899 by the other territories with the exception of the Transvaal. The Second Boer War (1899 to 1902), which the British won, led to the formerly-independent Boer republics becoming British colonies. The customs union was renewed in 1903, now including the Transvaal. In 1907, the High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Lord William Selborne was tasked with preparing a report on the disunion of the colonies, titled Review of the Present Mutual Relations of the British South African Colonies, described as an equivalent of the Durham Report. The report regarded the disunion in the region as artificial, and noted the shared \\"Native problem\\" and fiscal and economic matters. At this time the white population of the four colonies stood at around one million, with natives numbering five million. In May 1908, the Intercolonial Customs and Railways Conference met to discuss the issue of union as well as railway and customs. Frederick Robert Moor, Prime Minister of Natal, was chosen as chairman of the conference. Each of the four self-governing colonies had three representatives: John Xavier Merriman, Jacobus Wilhelmus Sauer, and Francois Stephanus Malan representing the Cape Colony; Moor, Charles O'Grady Gubbins, and Charles Hitchins representing the Natal Colony; Louis Botha, Jan Christiaan Smuts, and Henry Charles Hull representing the Transvaal Colony; and Abraham Fischer, James Barry Munnik Hertzog, and Alfred Ernest William Ramsbottom [af] representing the Orange River Colony. Rhodesia and the Portuguese province of province of Mozambique participated on the understanding that their delegates could not vote on or discuss anything that did not concern their territories directly or which they were not legally competent to address. Lewis Loyd Michell, Francis James Newton, and EC Baxter represented Rhodesia; and TAG Rosado and BM d'Almeida represented Mozambique. The conference unanimously accepted Smuts' motions, which read as follows: > \\"(a) That in the opinion of this Conference the best interests and the > permanent prosperity of South Africa can only be secured by an early union, > under the Crown of Great Britain, of the several self-governing Colonies; > (b) that to the union contemplated in the foregoing resolution Rhodesia > shall be entitled to admission at such time and on such conditions as may > hereafter be agreed upon; > (c) that the members of this Conference agree to submit the foregoing > resolutions to the Legislatures of their respective Colonies, and to take > such steps as may be necessary to obtain their consent to the appointment of > delegates to a National South African Convention, whose object shall be to > consider and report on the most desirable form of South African Union and to > prepare a draft constitution; > (d) the Convention shall consist of not more than (12) twelve delegates from > the Cape Colony, not more than (8) eight delegates from the Transvaal, not > more than (5) five delegates from Natal and the Orange River Colony > respectively, and it shall meet as soon as convenient after the next > Sessions of all the Parliaments; provided that as soon as at least two > Colonies shall have appointed their delegates the Convention shall be > considered as constituted; > (e) the Convention shall publish the draft constitution as soon as possible, > and shall, in consultation with the Governments of the self-governing > Colonies, determine the further steps to be taken in reference thereto; > (f) in the Convention the voting shall be per capita and not by States. A > Chairman shall be elected from the members who shall have the right of > speaking and voting, and in the event of an equality of votes shall have a > casting vote.\\" At this time public opinion was in favor of a union between the colonies, with the business community and especially the mining houses being convinced of the financial and economic benefits union might entail. Disunion was widely blamed as a cause of much of the region's social and economic woes. The Closer Union Society was founded in Cape Town in mid-1908, with former Cape prime minister William Philip Schreiner as its president. The Society's aim was \\"to encourage the formation of similar societies throughout Cape Colony and South Africa and to disseminate information on all aspects and systems of closer Union\\", with several closer union societies being established across the colonies. It published The Framework of Union in 1908 which explained the constitutional structures of the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany and Switzerland, with a view to propagate the idea of union among South Africans.

Contentious issues  The main areas of contention at the National Convention were the following, with the first three being the most controversial: * Whether South Africa would be a federation or a unitary state. * What the franchise of the new union would be, with particular regard to the status of the black and coloured races. * How South Africa would be divided into administrative divisions, especially the provinces. * The status of the two dominant European languages, Dutch (later Afrikaans) and English. * Where the capital city would be located. The convention adopted equality between Dutch and English, with both becoming official languages of the new South Africa. It was also decided that South Africa would have three capital cities: Cape Town would host the national Parliament, Pretoria would host the civil service, and the apex court would be located in Bloemfontein. Natal's consolation prize was securing a lucrative railway agreement for which it had been pressing since 1903.  Federal or unitary?  Leading up to the convention, most sought a federal dispensation. The Transvaal delegation was concerned that the Transvaal would ultimately be financially responsible for all the other provinces, given that its \\"treasury was full and overflowing, and the treasuries of the other three colonies were empty, faced with the problem of balancing their budgets\\". Natal and the Orange River feared that, because they were the two smaller territories, the voting power of the Cape and the Transvaal would negate their representation. Natal, having been predominantly English among its white inhabitants and being the most fervent supporter of federalism, specifically feared that a Dutch culture and language culture would be forced upon it. The Cape sought to protect the qualified franchise it had adopted which allowed black and coloureds to stand for elections and vote. Jan Smuts was the primary sponsor of the idea that South Africa should be a unitary state. He criticized the American federal model as \\"ineffective for the essential purpose of civilized government\\" because individual states could make their own law, and South Africa had by that time already experienced too much legislative confusion, in Smuts' view. A strict federal model could also not respond quickly enough to pressing issues. Smuts also regarded Canadian federalism as emphasizing the jealousies and differences of race and religion, and felt Australian federalism led to too much friction between the states. Smuts believed that a unitary state would allow South Africans to overcome the friction and racial strife they had thereinto experienced. But it was mainly the question of a national native policy that decided the issue, with the \\"unifiers\\" arguing that a strong central government would be necessary for dealing with this problem. South Africa thus became a unitary state with a single central Parliament that has \\"unlimited legislative authority\\". Given this parliamentary sovereignty, the constitution itself could be amended with a simple majority of both houses of Parliament, with the potential exception of two \\"entrenched\\" clauses governing the equality of languages and the qualified franchise in the Cape.  Franchise  Before unification, each of the four colonies that would become South Africa had their own franchise policy. The Cape had a franchise qualified by property and wages. By the time of the convention, there were 22,784 black and coloured voters in the Cape, out of a total electorate of 152,221. Natal had a similar policy, having had 200 black and coloured voters on the roll out of a total electorate of 22,686. In the Transvaal and Orange River, only white men could vote or stand for election. Four potential solutions to the franchise problem were tabled at the convention: * The Cape qualified franchise would be extended to all of South Africa. * A standardized \\"civilization test\\" would be adopted for all voters. * A single \\"colour-line\\" franchise, such as in the Transvaal and Orange River, would be adopted for all of South Africa. * The Cape qualified franchise would be left alone, but the future Union Parliament would be allowed to decide the matter in the future. A standardized \\"civilization test\\" would have meant legal equality between whites, blacks and coloureds in South Africa, which was unacceptable to the conservative electorate in the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal. Furthermore, neither the Cape nor the two former Boer republics were willing to compromise on their respective franchise systems. This led to the fourth option being adopted, with the Cape qualified franchise receiving constitutional protection in section 35 of the South Africa Act until such a time as it is amended by a joint sitting of Parliament with a supporting vote of two-thirds of the members. This victory for the Cape delegation did however not extend to the ability of blacks and coloureds to sit in Parliament or provincial councils. While they could thus continue to vote in the Cape, blacks and coloureds could no longer be elected to legislative office.  Administrative divisions  As South Africa was to be a unitary rather than a federal state, the provinces would have no legislatures of their own, but instead a system of provincial councils wholly subordinate to the national Parliament. No conflict would thus be possible between the councils and Parliament, as the provinces had no exclusive powers - only those assigned to them by the sovereign legislature. In their desire to keep the provincial council non-partisan, the delegates sought to model it largely on that of Switzerland. In this regard, choosing the executive committee of the council was made to be through proportional representation, with the executive Administrator of each province being independently appointed. Education was one of the key areas of jurisdiction added to the provincial council system, primarily for the fears raised by Natal and the Orange River that their language rights would be undermined. Their own provincial councils could thus set provincial language standards in education. This desire for non- partisanship did not come to fruition, however, as every provincial election since the adoption of the South Africa Act would be fought along party political lines.  Adoption  After the draft constitution was formulated, it was tabled before the respective colonial legislatures for approval. Stephen Leacock wrote that its acceptance in the Transvaal was a foregone conclusion, as the dominant political parties in the legislature had both agreed to the constitution beforehand. The Cape Parliament, on the other hand, did propose some amendments, including the scrapping of the proportional representation system as adopted at the convention, the scrapping of which the Orange River Colony agreed with. Leacock continues: > \\"In Natal, which as an ultra-British and ultra-loyal colony, was generally > supposed to be in fear of union, many amendments were offered. The > convention then met again at Bloemfontein, made certain changes in the draft > of the constitution, and again submitted the document to the colonies. This > time it was accepted. Only in Natal was it thought necessary to take a > popular vote, and here, contrary to expectation, the people voted heavily in > favor of union.\\" The Cape submitted 12 amendments, Natal 17 (in another attempt to secure a federal arrangement), and the Orange River three. 40 amendments were subsequently made by the convention between 3 and 11 May 1909 in Bloemfontein. The final approval by the colonial governments happened between May and June. The Natal referendum returned 11,121 votes in favor of the draft constitution and 3,701 against. The various colonial governments, after having approved the draft, agreed with the resolution taken at the convention that the constitution be referred to the British Parliament for adoption, in which would become the South Africa Act. Each colonial legislature appointed delegates to go to London, empowered to agree to changes \\"not inconsistent with the provisions and principles of the draft act\\". In London, 53 amendments were made to the bill, most of which were procedural and not substantive, and Parliament passed the constitution in essentially the same form it had been submitted by the National Convention. It received royal assent on 20 September 1909 and the Union of South Africa came into being on 31 May 1910, \\"exactly eight years to the day on which the Peace of Vereeniging was signed\\".  Legacy  The decision of the National Convention to choose a unitary rather than a federal framework under a regime of parliamentary sovereignty led to the central government, and moreover the central Parliament, not having a specified list of enumerated powers, instead being able to govern essentially as it pleased over the whole of the country. This led to Afrikaners fearing language inequality in the years after the constitution was adopted, despite the equality provisions in the South Africa Act. In turn, this would partly cause Hertzog to establish the National Party in 1912. It also led to the \\"flag controversy\\" of 1926 and 1927, and the imposition of racial apartheid by the National Party from 1948 onward. That the South Africa Act was enacted by the British Parliament also led to controversy in later years, with some arguing that the constitution was \\"foisted on South Africa by a foreign parliament\\". In 1951, the National Party introduced the Separate Representation of Voters Act, which intended to remove coloured voters from the voters' roll. Because Parliament was legally sovereign, and because the Statute of Westminster had already come into effect, government felt it was lawful to change the entrenched clauses without adhering to the requirements of the South Africa Act (i.e. both houses of Parliament must sit jointly and pass an amendment with a two-thirds majority). The Separate Representation of Voters Act thus passed without the requisite two-thirds majority required, and without both houses sitting together, to amend the Cape qualified franchise, plunging South Africa into a constitutional crisis that would continue until 1955. The Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), which transpired between 1991 and 1993 and led to the end of the apartheid system, was the second constitutional convention that occurred in South Africa to draft a new constitution. It led to the adoption of the 1993 \\"interim\\" Constitution, and at the same time the end of the parliamentary sovereignty that had started in 1910 when the South Africa Act came into being.

He has been called \\"renowned throughout the caving and broadcasting world,\\" \\"possibly the greatest cave film maker of all time,\\" and \\"the man who brought caving to the masses.\\" His work has received international acclaim. Early life Perou was born as Sidney Allen Bruce Perou in April 1937 to his father, Sid, and his mother, Harriet (who went by \\"Kit\\"). He was a serviceman in the Royal Air Force. Career In the mid 1960s, Perou worked as a sound recorder at Ealing Studios when it was owned by the BBC. Because of his recreational caving experience, he was assigned to work on the documentary Sunday at Sunset Pot in 1967. The documentary detailed the attempted rescue of caver Eric Luckhurst from Sunset Hole. Perou was initially assigned to work on the documentary as an assistant sound recorder. However, due to the physical and technical limitations of the initial camera operator and Perou's cave experience, he was asked to take over filming operations. This was Perou's first experience filming underground. After Sunday at Sunset Pot, he left his job at the BBC to move to Yorkshire, as he had decided that he wanted to be a filmmaker. In Yorkshire, his first commission was for The World About Us to film The Lost River of Gaping Gill in 1970. As a cinematographer and director, Perou was involved in the creation of over a dozen cave documentaries, and over 50 films in total. He was considered especially talented at lighting the caves so that it appeared as though the only sources of illumination were the cavers' headlamps. In 2010, Perou retired from filmmaking and emigrated from the United Kingdom. Awards and honors Together with Lionel Friedberg, Perou won an Emmy in 1993 for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Informational Programming for his work in Lechuguilla Cave which appeared as part of a 1992 National Geographic special, Mysteries Underground. While Mysteries Underground won the most prestigious award of any of Perou's projects, several other documentaries won regional awards or prizes at cave-related film festivals. The documentary The Lost River of Gaping Gill won Best TV Reportage prize at the 7th Festival International du Film de Sp√©l√©ologie in 1984, Silver Gentian Prize at the 1985 International Film Festival in Trento, the Pye Colour Television Award for Best Regional Production in 1985, and shared \\"best story or adventure film\\" with Hollow Mountains of Mulu at the International Festival Internacional de Cinema Espeleol√≤gic in 1984. The series Beneath the Pennines won the Grand Prix at the International Caving Film Festival in 1978, as well as the Royal Television Society's Regional Programme of the Year Award. In 1999, Perou won the Giles Barker award. Life in media Perou authored a book on his experiences titled 30 Years as an Adventure Cameraman. In 2010, Martin Baines released a documentary on Perou's life titled The Sid Perou Story. Personal life Perou's first marriage was to Alison Wellock, a woman whom he met during the planning of the filming of The Lost River of Gaping Gill. They married on 27 March 1971 and had two children: Martin and Tom. Alison died in 1996 at age 47 after an illness.

He is known for his polemical poem Sametsniero (\\"an enquiry\\"; lit. \\"scientific\\"), an illuminated work distinguished by one of the earliest examples of a Georgian‚ÄìPersian dictionary, and is \\"the earliest Georgian manuscript so far discovered in Iran\\". In his Sametsniero, Tushi criticized Christianity from a Shia Islam perspective, heralded Shia Islam in general (which he refers to \\"as a complete and perfect faith\\"), and praised then incumbent Safavid king (shah) Abbas I (1588‚Äì1629). Author Khatuna Baindurashvili notes that the Sametsniero is \\"one of the most intriguing texts from the Georgian Renaissance period\\" and that the \\"use of Georgian poetry to criticise Christianity from the standpoint of Shia Islam\\" highlighted the complexity of Georgian‚ÄìSafavid relations. Biography Little is known about Tushi's early life except that he was born in Tusheti in the second half of the 16th century and was well-educated by the standards of his time, being well-acquainted with both secular and religious literature. In the early 17th century, he converted to Islam sometime after arriving in Iran proper, where he would spend the remainder of his life, working in the Safavid royal capital, Isfahan. Work The Sametsniero is the earliest known example of Georgian writing to have been unearthed in Iran. According to Baindurashvili, it was written in the 1620s during the reign of king Abbas I (1588‚Äì1629), but not after as the text refers to Abbas I as being alive. It consists of 15 chapters, 280 verses, an appendix containing one of the earliest examples of a Georgian‚ÄìPersian dictionary, and 40 pages of \\"beautifully illuminated text\\". The final part of the manuscript was irrecoverably damaged. In his poem, Tushi discussed biblical stories and criticised Christianity from a Qoranic, particularly a Shi'ite, perspective. Tushi stated in his work that he finds \\"the doctrine of God in three hypostates to be theologically untenable and unacceptable, and he rejects Jesus as Son of God, identifying him instead, in line with Islamic teaching, as one of the great prophets who came before Mohammad, and thus referring to him as Holy Prophet Jesus\\". His assertion rejected the notion that God could assume an incarnate form. Tushi consistently praised the Islamic prophet Mohammad and Ali throughout the work. In line with Shia principles, Tushi considered the Twelve Imams of Twelver Shia Islam to be the disciples of Mohammad and compared them to Twelve Apostles of Jesus's. Tushi also praised Abbas I throughout the work. In the seventh chapter of the work, Tushi referred to Shia Islam, in particular, \\"as a complete and perfect faith\\". He died in Isfahan, possibly in the second half of the 17th century.

Early years Born in Philadelphia, Norman was an only child, the daughter of Stanley and Jeanette Lazarus. Her father worked in the children's-dress-manufacturing business, and her mother was a musician who was trained in Europe. Norman was considered a child prodigy after she sat at a piano when she was 3 years old and played a Mozart sonata by ear. From that experience followed what Norman decades later described as \\"a lifelong love of music.\\" When she was 8, she composed \\"Sad Story\\", a musical work that was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra. When she was 16 years old, she headed to Maine by herself and lied about her age in order to work in summer stock theater. After graduating from Olney High School in Philadelphia, Norman earned a Bachelor of Science degree in early childhood education at Temple University with a minor in radio-TV- theater. While at Temple, she acted in the University of the Air and the Studio Schoolhouse, both of which Temple produced and WFIL radio broadcast. She then became a kindergarten teacher and taught at Shoemaker School in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania.  Television  Having her kindergarten students act out stories and put on plays, and writing songs for the students awakened an interest in a different direction for Norman's career, A meeting with executives at WCAU-TV in Philadelphia led to the creation of Pixanne, a show whose main character was essentially a female version of Peter Pan. Norman explained that the program centered around a pixie because from childhood she had wanted to fly. The children's program eventually branched out from Philadelphia TV into syndication, carried in 75 cities, and lasted 17 years. At one point, the show attracted 61 percent of the viewing audience in the Philadelphia market. Soon after it began, Pixanne's ratings exceeded those of Captain Kangaroo, which preceded it daily. Norman became Pixanne for viewers to such an extent that a newspaper article contained the comment: \\"Pixanne is Jane Norman, and Jane Norman is Pixanne. And while it is possible to separate the two, the quality of each is the catalyst that has created this unique symbol of perpetual youthful innocence.\\" Norman's experience with Pixanne led her to produce The National Kid's Quiz series, which was broadcast on NBC. She and her husband also made 117 episodes of Maintenance Ms., a series of 90-second TV spots designed to help women cope with various aspects of household maintenance.  Writing  Norman wrote the books The Private Life of the American Teenager. and Jane Norman‚Äôs Fix It and Save, a spinoff of the Maintenance Ms. TV spots. Singing While making Pixanne, Norman wrote, produced, and sang on two albums, The Musical Magic of Pixanne and Bloop or Blink. In the 1990s, she launched a singing career, performing in nightclubs and recording. Her first CD, Pixanne Sings for Adults ... In a Christmas Mood, included five of Norman's compositions in addition to seven Christmas standards. That Christmas album was followed by Madly in Love, featuring \\"lush, sensuous standards\\" with accompaniment by a 47-piece orchestra. Personal life Norman was married to television and video producer Jack Beazley. Death On May 13, 2017, Norman died at her home in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. She was 83 years old. Recognition On November 18, 2005, Norman was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia.

Schelling, Sam Schellink, or Schellink Junior) was an autodidact and began his career in Utrecht, where he worked until 1892, when he moved to The Hague. In that same year, he joined N.V. Haagsche Plateelbakkerij Rozenburg as a painter apprentice. He would later go on to be the painter of their eggshell porcelain, for which he would become well-known. During this time, he developed the signature topics of his work which include still life, flowers, birds and, less prominently, landscapes. He remained with Rozenburg until 1914, when they went bankrupt. As a consequence and for a brief period, he focused on painting and entering the art trade. However, in 1918, he joined Tegel en Fayencefabriek Amphora in Oegstgeest, where he again worked as a pottery painter. Schellink's last employer was Plateelbakkerij Goedewaagen in Gouda, where he fulfilled the same role of pottery decorator.

Sain, 372 U.S. 293 (1963), was a United States Supreme Court case wherein the Court expanded the circumstances in which federal courts should hold evidentiary hearings when presented with petitions for habeas corpus by state prisoners following denial of postconviction relief in state court. The Court held that federal district courts must hold evidentiary hearings if the state court did not resolve all material factual disputes in a full and fair hearing supported by the record. The case centered around Charles Townsend, who was convicted of a series of murders and robberies and sentenced to death. The issue heard in the Supreme Court centered around a confession Townsend had given while under the influence of an alleged \\"truth serum\\". Townsend's attorneys argued that the effects of the truth serum had made the confession inadmissible. Townsend appealed the case by filing a writ of habeas corpus against Sheriff Frank G. Sain of Cook County, Illinois. The case made it to Illinois Supreme Court once, and the Supreme Court twice: first in 1959 and again in 1963. The appeals case however did not revolve around the truth serum, but instead procedural questions surrounding a prisoner's right to an evidentiary hearing during the appeal process. The court held that Townsend's writ of habeas corpus should not have been summarily denied, and that the lower court should have held an evidentiary hearing to determine the veracity of Townsend's claims. The court repeated its previous decision that coerced confessions were inadmissible, and theorized that a confession via truth serum would thus be inadmissible; the court was careful to avoid saying whether or not Townsend had actually been given a truth serum. Alongside Fay v. Noia and Sanders v. United States, Townsend is cited as revolutionizing and greatly expanding the use of habeas corpus, leading to it being used as a general purpose appeals tool. However a variety of Supreme Court decisions since then have narrowed its application.  Background  On December 18, 1953, steelworker Jack Boone was robbed and murdered in Chicago. Police arrested Charles Townsend on January 1, 1954. He was charged on the information of Vincent Campbell. Campbell claimed that he saw Townsend near the scene of the attack, but otherwise little physical evidence linked Townsend to the crime. Townsend was an admitted drug addict, after his arrest he began suffering from symptoms of withdrawal. During his questioning he was attended by a doctor who gave him two drugs to help the withdrawal symptoms: Phenobarbital and Hyoscine. Afterward he confessed to the murder of Boone, agreeing that he had robbed him in order to fund his drug habit. Townsend later claimed that the Hyoscine was a \\"truth serum\\" and that his confession was made while he was under its influence, thus making it inadmissible..  Case  The original case went to trial in 1955, where Townsend was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. During the trial, the prosecution brought in the confession of Townsend that had been given while in police custody and suffering from withdrawal. Townsend, via his public defender, objected. Outside the presence of the jury, the court held an evidentiary hearing. Townsend claimed that he had been given a truth serum while being questioned by the police. As a result, he argued any confession gained during the interrogation was inadmissible. However the court denied Townsend an ability to present evidence of such and allowed the confession to be entered. Townsend was subsequently convicted, he would appeal the case repeatedly. The case, as People v. Townsend, eventually made it to the Supreme Court of Illinois, which affirmed the conviction. At this point Townsend was now in jail, and as a prisoner filed a writ of habeas corpus against his jailers, Sheriff Frank G. Sain of Cook County and Jack Johnson, Warden of the Cook County Jail. The case made it to the Supreme Court in 1959. At major issue through every stage of the appeal was whether the confession had been voluntary. The defense argued that it was not, and that the lower courts should have allowed the defense to make that argument, yet disallowed it. The defense argued that although Hyoscine had not been administered with the intent of being used as a truth serum, its unintended effects made it a truth serum by default. Furthermore, they argued that the police had used the drug as leverage and had verbally and physically coerced Townsend. The defense also contended, with the testimony of an expert pharmacologist, that the administration of Hyoscine would have confused Townsend as well as make him extremely tired for the entirety of the confession, as well as the following morning when he signed his confession. The judgement was vacated by the Supreme Court in 1959 without argument, and the case was remanded back to the lower courts.. However the case once again made it to the high court, where it now had a significant legal question which the court allowed for argument in October 1961. However, due to the absence of two justices, the case was reheard in October 1962. The Supreme court ruled in 1963 that since the state court had not given Townsend's claims a proper hearing, the appellate court ought to have. Since the appellate court had failed to do so, the Supreme Court remanded the case back to the district court for a new hearing. The courts decision cemented that the federal court ought have decided what weight to give the habeas corpus hearing, since such hearings are often critical to a prisoners claim. The court also gave appellate courts the power to retry facts, especially if the defendant did not receive a \\"full and fair\\" evidentiary hearing previously. The court's 5-4 split on the issue stemmed from issues of how mandatory a rehearing at the appellate level should be. The Court decided that there were six situations in which a court had to give the prisoner a new hearing. The dissenting minority of the court argued that appeals courts should have greater discretion in hearings, and should not be forced to hold hearings. The court clarified that very few circumstances would deny a prisoners right to a fair evidentiary hearing at the appellate level, and that only a \\"deliberate bypass\\" of the state courts would qualify. Incompetence or negligence by the prisoner's lawyer would not affect how they were treated at the appellate level or disqualify them from a new evidentiary hearing. Additionally the court noted that the medical expert for the prosecution had made a mistake by not noting in layman's terms the fact that Hyoscine could possibly act as a truth serum. The court also confirmed that a confession is inadmissible if it has been coerced from an individual, or if it was \\"not the product of a rational intellect and a free will\\". The court thus surmised that a confession taken under the influence of a supposed truth serum would seem to meet those criteria. However the court was careful to avoid actually determining whether the drug in question was in fact a truth serum, or if the confession had been the result of it.  Legacy  In 1966, responding to the decision of the Court, Congress amended the judicial code with a modified version of the habeas corpus criteria formulated in Townsend. The amendments specified eight circumstances in which the finding of a lower court cannot be presumed and the court must give an evidentiary hearing. They differed in writing and number from the only six cases identified by Justice Warren. However, in cases outside of the eight specified, the burden of proof falls back on the habeas corpus petitioner to show that court fact findings were in error. The Supreme Court heard Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U.S. 1, in 1992, which modified the decision in Townsend that a prisoner is entitled to a new evidentiary hearing in all but intentional bypassing of the state courts. Instead Keeney established that prisoners must show cause, and that negligence on the part of the attorney could now be considered as a factor in denying habeas corpus. The decision was part of an attempt to streamline the overburdened appeals process, since at the time more than 10,000 habeas corpus requests were filed every year, accounting for almost 5% of all civil cases in federal court. The Supreme Court argued that giving a new evidentiary hearing to every prisoner was overkill, and wasted time and valuable court resources. As a result, only cases in which the prisoner had a legitimate cause would be entitled to new hearings.

Dudnik founded the organization in 2003 as a graduate student studying at Harvard University, where she received her PhD in molecular biology.  Education and early career  Dudnik received her Bachelors of Science in biochemistry from Brown University. Between college and graduate school, she worked in agricultural development as a consultant for CGIAR (Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research) in Italy, and then became a Fulbright scholar in Cote d‚ÄôIvoire. After her year in Africa, she returned to the United States to attend Harvard University, where she received her PhD in molecular biology. She did her doctoral work in the laboratory of Dr. Kami Ahmad, where she ultimately published her dissertation, \\"Histone dimers on the move: Nucleosome assembly systems for H2A and H2AV in Drosophila.\\"  Global development work  Dudnik had personally felt the effects of lack of access to scientific resources in developing countries when doing her Fulbright work in C√¥te d'Ivoire, where she was working to breed better varieties of rice. There, she saw a gap between a wealth of scientific talent and a dearth of access to research equipment to put that talent to use. When she returned to the United States to pursue her doctoral degree, she worked to bridge that gap. She led a group of fellow students in collecting surplus biological equipment and supplies at Harvard University to send to labs in developing countries to support the research they were doing at their local institutions. This effort became the basis of Seeding Labs, which formally launched in 2007 when Dudnik was awarded the Echoing Green fellowship. A year later, Seeding Labs was established as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization in 2008. Dudnik and her team have since expanded Seeding Labs beyond equipment transfer, developing exchange programs to train scientists from developing countries in America. She has promoted the organization's vision as a TEDGlobal Fellow, a PopTech Social Innovation Fellow, and at the World Economic Forum. They have received funding and support from a combination of government organizations like the United States Agency for International Development, academic institutions like Harvard University, and multinational corporations like Merck.  Science advocacy efforts  Dudnik has written on the need to build scientific capacity in developing countries to take on the world's most pressing health challenges for outlets like Scientific American, Time, and Quartz, drawing attention to the lack of funding and research support for countries in the global South. After the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, she published an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal underscoring the need to support developing scientific talent within Africa, which could have enabled earlier public health mobilization on the ground and prevented a wider Ebola outbreak without reliance on Western aid. A woman in science herself, Dudnik has also written on issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM fields. She is currently an Advisory Board member for the grassroots nonprofit 500 Women Scientists, which is working to make science open, inclusive, and accessible by promoting women scientists in leadership.

He, his nephew Francesco, and his brother Renato were executed after the Pazzi conspiracy on 26 April 1478. The conspiracy was proposed in Montughi, at Jacopo Pazzi's villa, and it was planned to kill Lorenzo and Giuliano de' Medici and take over the government of Florence. After the conspiracy, Jacopo went home and he found Francesco with a wound in one leg, possibly self- inflicted. With 100 armed men, Jacopo ran through the streets crying \\"Liberty!\\", but when Francesco was dragged from his bed and hanged, Jacopo escaped from Florence. In the village of Castagno he was recognised and sent back to Florence, where he too was hanged. Stefano di Ser Niccolo da Bagnone served as a secretary to Jacopo and tutor to his daughter Caterina. Palazzo Pazzi was commissioned by Jacopo between 1462 and 1472. In popular culture In the second season of Medici: Masters of Florence (2016), Sean Bean appeared as Jacopo de' Pazzi.

He also called New Orleans Saints games, Cotton States League baseball games and the Southwest Conference football game of the week. Biography John Ferguson was born in 1919 in Louisiana. He began his career calling Cotton States League games in El Dorado, Arkansas in 1942. When World War II started, Ferguson enlisted in the army as an Army Air pilot completing 144 missions piloting cargo planes over the Himalayas between India and China, supplying B-29s for their bombing runs. After World War II, Ferguson moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana and when WJBO-AM won the rights to LSU games they asked if he was available and he took the job. After the 1958 season, Ferguson took a break from calling LSU games to do the Southwest Conference football game of the week. Because of this, Ferguson was not the announcer for Billy Cannon's Halloween run versus Ole Miss in 1959. J.C. Politz was the LSU broadcaster from 1959‚Äì1960. In 1961, Ferguson returned to LSU and broadcast men's basketball and football games. For a time, Ferguson was also the play-by-play commentator for the New Orleans Saints. The 1983 season was his last year as radio broadcaster at LSU. In 1984, Ferguson transitioned over to TigerVision, LSU's pay-per-view television network for football games and Jim Hawthorne took over as radio broadcaster for LSU baseball, men's basketball and football. Also in 1984, Ferguson was awarded the Distinguished Service Award in Sports Journalism from the Louisiana Sports Writers Association. He retired in 1987.

Its first issue was published on September 3, 2011. Nuestra Voz also runs a daily digital news operation. Since May 2015, Jorge I. Dom√≠nguez-L√≥pez has been the Editor in Chiefhttps://thetablet.org/the-tablet-names-new-editor- and-managing-editor/. The mission of Nuestra Voz is to evangelize by delivering religious information, analysis, and news of interest to Hispanic Catholics. Its goal is to assist and empower the diverse Hispanic community by highlighting the multiple resources available to them within the Catholic Church and all the religious events they can enjoy in the diocese.  History  In the late 1970s, The Tablet had a pullout called ‚ÄúSuplemento en Espa√±ol.‚Äù There was a steady audience for it, so it evolved into a freestanding publication called Nuevo Amanecer which lasted into the 1990s. On April 23, 2011, an early version of Nuestra Voz was published as an insert in its sister English language publication The Tablet, under the title ‚ÄòLa Reconciliaci√≥n‚Äô (The Reconciliation). Five months later, in September 2011, Nuestra Voz was launched and has been published uninterrupted since then. Originally, the website associated with the newspaper was www.netspanol.net. By September 2013, the website URL was changed to nuestra-voz.org. The paper's motto, ‚ÄúYour faith in your language (T√∫ fe en tu idioma),‚Äù appeared on the front page under the nameplate until the newspaper underwent a major redesign of layout and sections in November 2016 in the issue Year VI, No. 3.  Content  Nuestra Voz is a Catholic-driven journalism force created to showcase a rich faith and the power that its community holds. Because the Diocese of Brooklyn is half Hispanic and one-fourth multilingual, its mission is to do more to inform and empower.  News  Nuestra Voz addresses contemporary issues affecting Hispanic Catholics in the diocese and beyond, including local and national news, politics, health, immigration, family and religion.  Opinion  Nuestra Voz includes ‚ÄúColumna del editor‚Äù (Editor's Column) written by Jorge Dominguez-Lopez, ‚ÄúRemar mar adentro‚Äù (A translation of The Tablet's ‚ÄúPut Out Into The Deep‚Äù) written by the bishop of the Diocese of Brooklyn, Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio, ‚ÄúEn la di√≥cesis‚Äù (In the Diocese) written by multiple writers which contains stories about events happening in the Hispanic community of the diocese, ‚ÄúComunidad Religiosa‚Äù (Religious Community) written by Dar√≠o L√≥pez-Capera which features a different protest or religious sister every month, ‚ÄúDerecho y Vida‚Äù (Rights and Life) written by Monsignor Jonas Achacoso which features straight answers about the Catholic perspective to questions and problems Catholics face in their daily lives, and ‚ÄúHumor‚Äù written by the contemporary Cuban humor writer Enrique Del Risco, or \\"Enrisco,\\" which is a funny yet deep reflection about social and political issues affecting the Hispanic community.  Audience  Nuestra Voz distributes 18,000 copies monthly. Online, Nuestra Voz gets 46,000 unique visitors monthly.  Organization  Nuestra Voz is owned by DeSales Media, serving the people of the Diocese of Brooklyn. DeSales Media has responded to the changing face of the diocese by reaching a new audience of Latinos with the information they can use for the betterment of their communities and their Catholic faith. Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio, the seventh bishop of the Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, is the founder and current publisher of Nuestra Voz.

Over the years, Goldsmith and Mills were joined by a shifting cast of bassists (Damon Webb, Grant Powell, and Wylie Gelber) and drummers (Alex Orbison, Dylan Grombocher, and Griffin Goldsmith). The band drew its name from the middle names of Goldsmith and Mills. Released in 2006, the band's debut album Carnivore received mixed reviews. Simon Dawes broke up in 2007 when Mills left the band.  Dawes (2009‚Äìpresent)  After the departure of Blake Mills from Simon Dawes, Goldsmith formed a new band called Dawes with his former bandmate Wylie Gelber (bass), his younger brother Griffin Goldsmith (drums)‚Äîboth of Simon Dawes' last lineup‚Äîand new addition Tay Strathairn (keyboards). The band's first album, North Hills marked a sharp departure from the punk-inspired tunes of their youth and embraced a subtler folk rock that has been called the Laurel Canyon sound, reminiscent of Crosby, Stills, and Nash and Jackson Browne. Over the years, the band's lineup has shifted a bit, with keyboardist Straithairn leaving and being replaced by Alex Casnoff and later Lee Pardini. Guitarists Duane Betts and Trevor Menear in turn also joined the band for some of its tours. For all seven of the band's studio albums, Taylor Goldsmith has served as the band's front man, lead singer, chief songwriter, and lead guitarist.  Middle Brother (2010‚Äì2011)  In 2010, Goldsmith joined Matt Vasquez of Delta Spirit and John McCauley of Deer Tick to form the band Middle Brother. The band released its first and only album, Middle Brother, in March 2011 to positive reviews.  The New Basement Tapes (2014)  In 2014, Goldsmith was asked by producer T Bone Burnett to join a project called The New Basement Tapes that wrote and recorded songs based on recently uncovered lyrics written by Bob Dylan in 1967. Goldsmith joined Marcus Mumford of Mumford and Sons, Jim James of My Morning Jacket, Rhiannon Giddens of Carolina Chocolate Drops, and Elvis Costello during the recording sessions, which resulted in an album, Lost on the River: The New Basement Tapes, and a Showtime documentary, Lost Songs: The Basement Tapes Continued. Goldsmith received co-writing credit for the songs \\"Kansas City,\\" \\"Liberty Street,\\" \\"When I Get My Hands on You,\\" \\"Florida Key,\\" \\"Card Shark,\\" and \\"Diamond Ring.\\" He was also credited for playing bass, guitar, mellotron, organ, and piano, as well as for singing.  Session work, songwriting, and producing  Apart from his primary projects, Goldsmith has also done work as a session musician. He has performed on albums by Jackson Browne, John Fogerty, Dave Rawlings, Mandy Moore, and Sara Watkins, among others. Goldsmith has also written and co-written songs for other bands, including songs on his wife Mandy Moore's seventh album Silver Landings, Conor Oberst's Salutations, Brandon Flowers' The Desired Effect, and Robert Ellis' The Lights from the Chemical Plant. In 2013, Goldsmith produced his first record, Dad Country by Jonny Fritz.  Personal life  In 2015, Goldsmith began dating singer- songwriter and actress Mandy Moore.

Description Emry applied for the trademark to use as part of a feminist public relations campaign centering on American politics and voting. The name originated from a remark made by conservative commentator, Rush Limbaugh, who called Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke a \\"slut\\" after she testified in favor of contraceptives at a Congressional hearing in February, 2012. Brand name In interviews with journalists, Emry states that \\"she chose to brand the site with the derogatory term in an effort to take it back and turn it into a rallying cry\\". Mission The stated mission of the campaign \\"is to fight the GOP effort to bully, subjugate and silence women. We will wrest the power from the word slut and help women get informed, get involved, get registered and vote.\\" The graphic used by the campaign is a lipstick mark representing a full kiss. The campaign created a website in 2012 that offered assistance in registering to vote and provided templates for people to use to contact their representatives with a focus on rights to reproductive health care. The campaign also launched a Facebook page in 2012. Criticism The founder of the campaign and owner of the trademark, Emry, and another spokesperson, Kimberley A. Johnson, report receiving criticism about the name of the campaign from both left and right. Emry states that some of the harshest criticisms have come from the political right.

As an experienced diplomat, he served as both minister and ambassador to Afghanistan at differing times; his career at the Department of State ultimately lasted more than 40 years. Career After his graduation from Yale University in 1910, he entered the Foreign Service in 1911. After postings in Berlin, Paris, and South America, he was nominated as the American ambassador to Iran in 1939. Due to an incident involving the Iranian minister, who was speeding in Elkton, Maryland, and Elkton police, along subsequent newspaper coverage, the Iranian government recalled their minister in early 1936. The incident caused a diplomatic rupture: all consular matters were transacted through charg√©s d'affaires until 1939, at which time Dreyfus was nominated. While in Iran, Dreyfus reported on the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran to the State Department. Dreyfus also served as Minister to Iceland, both before and after it became a republic; and Minister to Sweden after World War II. He also served as the acting Chief of the Foreign Service Inspection Corps (what later became the Inspector General of the Department of State) from 1947 to 1948, before finally returning to Afghanistan as the United States ambassador from 1949 to 1951, when he was succeeded by George R.

The first game was localized in English under the title Gate of Doom and the second one as Wizard Fire. Gameplay The players control characters from an isometric perspective and must traverse levels while fighting enemies, avoiding traps, and collecting items as well as spells. The game features two-player cooperative play. Ports Like multiple other Data East games, the games were ported to the Zeebo by Onan Games and published by G-Mode in Brazil in 2010. Then in 2018, FTEGames ported both Gate of Doom and Wizard Fire to the Nintendo Switch's eShop as well as Gate of the Doom to the PlayStation 4 as part of their Johnny Turbo's Arcade series of Data East arcade game ports branded with the character of Johnny Turbo, the Turbo Duo mascot and alter-ego of FTEGames founder Johnny Brandstetter. FTEGames lists ports for the Xbox One, Steam and a PS4 port of Wizard Fire as under development. Wizard Fire was also included in the 2010 Wii compilation Data East Arcade Classics by Majesco Entertainment. Reception Both games received positive reviews, with the sequel being considered a noteworthy improvement overall. In Japan, Game Machine listed Dark Seal on their July 15, 1990 issue as being the most- successful table arcade unit of the year. Game Machine also listed Dark Seal II on their June 15, 1992 issue as being the ninth most-successful table arcade unit of the year.

O'Hara was the official nurse to the Mercury Seven astronauts and their families, continuing to support the Gemini Program, Apollo astronauts and Skylab. Astronaut John Glenn, pilot of the Mercury-Atlas 6 space mission, confers with Astronaut Nurse Dolores B. O'Hara, R.N., during MA-6 pre-launch preparations. Early life O'Hara was born on August 9, 1935 in Nampa, Idaho. In 1956 graduated from the Providence Hospital School of Nursing in Portland, Oregon. After graduation, between 1956 - 1957 O'Hara completed coursework in Operating Room Technique in the University of Oregon. She worked as a surgical nurse at the University of Oregon Medical School. Because of back problems, she moved on to work with three diagnosticians in Portland, Oregon, and learned how to do lab work and X-rays. U.S. Air Force Convinced by her roommate, she decided to join the Air Force, which was not common for women to do at the time. O'Hara completed officers' training at Maxwell Air Force Base Alabama at the rank of second lieutenant. In May 1959, O'Hara was assigned to Patrick Air Force Base in Cape Canaveral, Florida, in support of the Mercury Program. In 1963 she was officially assigned as the Office Nurse in Cocoa Beach, Florida. O'Hara resigned from the US Air Force in 1964, in order to move to the manned space center (later the Johnson Space Center) to set up the Medicine Flight Clinic. Space Nurse Ed White and Elliot See in Aero Med, Hangar, 1962 In November 1959, O'Hara became the first Staff Nurse of the Mercury Program. Her job was to set up the Aeromed Lab, the crew sleeping quarters, the exam area for the astronauts in Hangar S, and be with them as their nurse. Colonel George Knauf, Center Commander of Patrick Air Force Base wanted to have a nurse in the Mercury program team because he thought the astronauts would be more likely to share information with the staff nurse than with the flight surgeon who could ground them. Also, the nurse would be around enough to identify when they are not feeling well. O'Hara gained the confidence of the astronauts. She had made a deal with the astronauts that they would not hide information from her, and she would not betray their confidence, unless, she thought it may jeopardize them or the mission. She was the only nurse assigned to the Astronauts. O'Hara became close to the astronauts and their families. Before every launch she performed the pre-flight physicals including height, weight, temperatures, blood pressure measurements. The astronauts would not agree to let anyone else but O'Hara draw blood before launch. O'Hara also helped set up the portable hospital at the Grand Bahama Island to support post flight examination and, if needed, treat injured astronauts after landing (especially in the sub orbital flights). Additional Nurse, Lieutenant Shirley Sineath was assigned as a surgical nurse on the recovery team. In 1964, she moved to Houston to set up the Flight Medicine Clinic at the Johnson Space Center. She was the Occupational Health Nurse until 1967, and the manager of the Preventive Medicine Office between 1967-1971. During the Gemini Program she worked with the astronauts and the families, while she was the only nurse along the five flight surgeons. O'Hara performed all the pre-flight checks, fly down to Cape Canaveral and stayed there until the crew was recovered and brought back to the Cape, to do the post-flight exams. In Houston she performed all the routine check ups and more detailed exams, along with all of the administrative tasks, and taking care of the astronaut families. In addition to taking care of the astronaut families, the clinic also took care of the NASA aircraft operations pilots and all the crew personnel. O'Hara supported the Apollo Program astronauts, though tragedies (like the Apollo 1 fire) and accomplishments (like the Moon landings). Between 1971 and 1974 O'Hara was the manager of the Medical Operations Division in the Flight Medicine Branch until moving to Ames Research Center. She was involved in the decision to ground astronaut Ken Mattingly from Apollo 13 due to the concern he might have contracted German measles. O'Hara participated in every launch in the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs. After Skylab, she was also invited to participate in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Program (ASTP) and the first shuttle flight in 1981. During her time as the Astronaut's Nurse, she received a lot of fan mail. Ames Research Center In 1974, O'Hara moved to the Ames Research Center where she managed the Human Research Facility until her retirement in 1997.

The technique did not end with the empire, but continued to be \\"used on occasion up to the first or second century A.D.\\",Harle, 24 although the presence of the polish sometimes complicates dating, as with the Didarganj Yakshi. According to the archaeologist John Marshall: the \\"extraordinary precision and accuracy which characterizes all Mauryan works, and which has never, we venture to say, been surpassed even by the finest workmanship on Athenian buildings\\".The Early History of India by Vincent A Smith Polished Barabar Caves The Barabar caves are the first known and dated example of Mauryan polish, since they were dedicated by Ashoka in several inscriptions, in the year 12 and the year 19 of his reign. The caves were carved out of granite, an extremely hard rock, then finished with a very nice polishing of the inner surface, giving a mirror effect of a great flatness, as well as an echo effect. Ashoka in Ancient India by Nayanjot Lahiri This large-scale polish directly evokes polishing on smaller surfaces of the Maurya statuary, particularly visible on the pillars and capitals of the Pillars of Ashoka. This know-how seems to have disappeared again after the Maurya period, none of the subsequent caves such as the Ajanta Caves having this characteristic of polished surfaces Indian History At Barabar Caves, some caves where dedicated through inscription by Ashoka (the caves of the Barabar group), as well as by his grandson and successor Dasaratha Maurya (the caves of the Nagarjuni group). Both group of caves have perfectly polished walls, which suggest that polishing techniques were not exclusive to Ashoka, and continued as least for some time after his reign. ;Later Caves After the Barabar Caves, the polishing of cave walls was abandoned, never to be revived, despite the huge efforts at building Buddhist and Jain caves until the 6th century CE. Such grandiose caves as Karla Caves (1st century CE) or the Ajanta Caves (5th century CE) do not have any polishing either. This may be due to the fact that Mauryan caves were dedicated and sponsored by the Mauryan Imperial government, allowing for huge resources and efforts to be spent, whereas later caves where essentially the result of donations by individuals, who could not afford as high a level of spending.Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist architecture, p.99 Pillars of Ashoka A highly polished pillar of Ashoka, Lauriya-Araraj. The pillars of Ashoka, made of sandstone, generally also exhibit a high level of Mauryan polish. Here again the mirror-like polish has generally been considered as an import from the Near-East, but some authors now consider the Son Bhandar Caves might constitute a precedent and an evolutionary step to this type of polish, although these caves are generally dated to a much later period (2-4th century CE).Buddhist Architecture, Le Huu Phuoc, Grafikol, 2009, p.45 The pillars Polished surface of a pillar. All known Mauryan pillars have the characteristic mirror-like polish, although most were left unpolished over the surface of the bottom part meant to be buried in the ground.Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist Architecture, p.36 Inscriptions were made over the polished finish, with the ungainly result that the polished stone is chipped around the letters. Normally, the text should be inscribed first, and only then should the stone be polished if a good result is to be obtained. This tends to suggest that the inscriptions were made as an afterthought, after the pillar has been properly completed. The capitals Some of the capitals of the pillars of Ashoka exhibit mirror-like polish (such as the Sarnath and the Sanchi capitals), while other don't and only have a smooth surface (the Sankissa capital or the Rampurva bull elephant). This, together with epigraphical considerations, has even led some authors to question if these non-polished capital might be of a time prior to Ashoka.John Irwin, \\"The true chronology of Ashokan pillars\\", p.147 These non-polished pillars are also those that displays the highest level of Hellenistic influence: in the case of the Rampurva bull or the Sankassa elephant, the abacus is composed of honeysuckles alternated with stylized palmettes and small rosettes. A similar kind of design can be seen in the frieze of the lost capital of the Allahabad pillar. These designs likely originated in Greek and Near-Eastern arts.

Mauryan statuary The Lohanipur torso, possibly a Jain Tirthankara, 3rd century BCE, discovered in Lohanipur, now in Patna Museum. There are many examples of polished stone statuettes and artifacts from the Mauryan period. One of the them, the Masarh lion, discovered near Patna, is special in that its style is nearly completely Achaemenid, which suggests a high level of artistic influence from Western Asia at the time the statuette was made. The Masarh lion, discovered near Pataliputra and dated to the 3rd century BCE, is carved in sandstone of the Chunar type, like the Ashoka Pillars, and its finish is polished. The sculptural style is also indisputably Achaemenid This is particularly visible with the well-ordered tubular representation of whiskers (vibrissas), and the geometrical representation of inflated veins flush within the whole face. The mane on the other hand, with the tufts of hair represented in ripples, is rather naturalistic. According to SP Gupta, these stylistic characteristics can be described as non-Indian. Very similar examples of sculptures are known in Greece and in Persepolis. It is possible that this sculpture was made by an Achaemenid or Greek sculptor in India and either remained without effect, or was the Indian imitation of a Greek or Achaemenid model, somewhere between the 5th and the 1st century BCE, although it is generally dated from the time of the Maurya Empire, around the 3rd century BCE. According to John Boardman, the lion sculpture of Marsarh is \\"quite Persian\\", although the treatment of the mane is rather of Greek naturalistic style and breaks with the rigid and codified style of the Achaemenid Empire.The Origins of Indian Stone Architecture, 1998, John Boardman p.18. For him, the lions of the Lion Capital of Ashoka at Sarnath represent the next logical and artistic step, and would be the realization of Hellenistic Greek artists to soften and give more naturality to Persian style. There are also a few examples of polished statuary, all dated to the Mauryan period, such as the polished sculpture of a head from Sarnath. The Diamond throne of Bodhgaya is another example. It was established by Ashoka at Bodh Gaya and also exhibits the characteristic Mauryan polish.The Origins of Indian Stone Architecture, 1998, John Boardman pp. 13-22.

Alternatively, it is rather dated to the 2nd century CE, based on the analysis of shape and ornamentation. According to some art historians, the treatment of the forelock in particular is said to be characteristically Kushan. The Didarganj Yakshi, generally dated to Mauryan periods 3rd century BC while some date it to Kushan period Post- Mauryan near abandonment of polishing techniques After the Mauryan period, the general sculptural trend is towards the complete abandon of polishing techniques. This may be due to the high cost involved with polishing. The end of the Mauryan period marked the end of imperial patronage of the arts, which thereafter tended to be financed by the people or the wealthy merchant class thereafter.Le Huu Phuoc, p.45 There are however a few important cases of polishing that seem to subsist. The Parkam Yaksha \\"Manibhadra\\" is made of polished grey sandstone, in the same material as the Pillars of Ashoka. This statue is generally dated to the 3rd-1st centuries BCE, and may be immediately post-Mauryan. It may be a transitional from the Mauryan period to next period including the reliefs of Bharhut, presenting some continuity in the finishing technique, but a real fracture in terms of sculptural style. The Didarganj Yakshi, although claimed by some as an example of Mauryan art is generally dated to the 2nd century CE, based on the analysis of shape and ornamentation.\\"A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century\\" by Upinder Singh, Pearson Education India, 2008 \\"\\"Ayodhya, Archaeology After Demolition: A Critique of the \\"new\\" and \\"fresh\\" Discoveries\\", by Dhaneshwar Mandal, Orient Blackswan, 2003, p.46 \\"A Companion to Asian Art and Architecture\\" by Deborah S.

Achaemenid sculptural art was often characterized by a great level of polishing of the stone (usually sandstone, a very hard material), and it is thought that this polishing influenced the Maurya polishing, as is visible in the architecture of the columns of Pataliputra.Sailendra Nath Sen's Ancient Indian History and Civilization p.118Foreign Influence In Ancient India, by Jairazbhoy, Publication date 1963 p.45 Sandstone is very hard to work, so it is believed that polishing was obtained by the use of emery grains (Mohs hardness index 8) from Naxos and Armenia.\\"The extremely hard emery of Armenia, which was under the Achaemenid hegemony, seems to be the closest natural source for polishing the Persepolis, Pasargadae, and SusƒÅ royal palace stones\\" Hunt, 2008 in \\"Tectonic Evolution, Collision, and Seismicity of Southwest Asia, Rasul Sorkhabi p.33 Stones and polishing grains have been found in the ruins of Persepolis. These polishing techniques were also used by the Greeks, who used the natural Naxos emery grains.\\"For efficient polishing, Greeks used emery (Mohs 8) from the rich deposits of the Cycladic island of Naxos.\\" in A Companion to Greek Art, published by Tyler Jo Smith, Dimitris Plantzos p.242 It is believed that the stone-making techniques employed by the Mauryas may have derived from the techniques of Achaemenid statuary, stone-working and polishing techniques having spread to India after the destruction of the empire by Alexander the Great in 330 BCE and the displacement of Persian and Perso-Greek artists and technicians.Maharashtra, Marg Publications, 1985, Pdf \\"The surface of the inside walls are polished to a mirror-like finish, an exclusive characteristics of Mauryan architecture and sculpture, first derived through the media of Achamenid art after the disintegration of the Persian Empire in AD 330 and the dispersal of skilled Persian and Perso-Greek artisans \\" File: UC Oriental Institute Persian collection item 06.JPG Lion Fragment, Persepolis, Iran.

File: Achaemenid polish.jpg Polished Achaemenid pillar capital (detail). According to Gupta, the polishing of rocks could have a local origin. He invokes the existence of polishing technologies of the neolithic, visible in various stone tools such as axes. There is, however, no trace of evolution from these neolitical tools to polished stone architecture, and the Barabar caves are essentially a sudden technological break with no local history, suggesting the import of these techniques from another culture. Nor are there any known examples of stone architecture in India before the Maurya period.Gupta, The roots of Indian Art, p.194- According to Gupta, the Son Bhandar Caves could be such an intermediate stage, relatively unique, and subject to questioning its chronology, since it is generally dated to the 2nd-4th centuries CE. The polish was achieved by application of agate burnisher which was later applied on pillars and sandstone objects. Some examples of Indus Valley Civilisation statuary (Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro, circa 3000-2000 BCE) do show a certain level of polishing.\\"...the \\"Priest-King's\\" head is so carefully tapered and polished.\\" in Pataliputra Voussoir fragment made of graite stone discovered by K.

Anjalikastra was a personal astra (missile) of King of Gods- Indra. According to Hindu puranas/ithihasas, using this weapon on opponent, this cuts the head of the opponent. In some stories, it is also said that Lakshmana- brother of Lord Rama used same Anjalikastra to kill Indrajit. This astra came into prominence when Mahabharat's hero Arjuna used it to kill Karna. Arjuna kills Karna using Anjalikastra  Ramayana  In some versions of Ramayana, it is said that Meghanada (Indrajit) was killed by the usage of Anjalikastra. Meghanada was granted a boon from Brahma that after the completion of the Yagna (fire- worship) of his native goddess Prathyangira -\\"Nikumbhila yagna\\", he will get a celestial chariot, mounting on which, he will win over any enemy in war and become invulnerable. But Brahma also cautioned him that whosoever would destroy this yagna would also kill him. Indrajit through severe penance convinced Brahma to give him a boon in which it was promised to him that Indrajit would only be killed by such a man who hadn't had sleep for twelve years continuously. Thus Lakshmana was only the person at that time whose life satisfied those conditions and thus he was the only person eligible to kill Indrajit. Knowing this Vibhishana requested Lakshmana to destroy Indrajit's yagna. Lakshmana was very successful in spoiling Indrajit's Nikumbhila Yagna and finally killed Meghanada using Anjalikastra.  Mahabharat  On the 17th day of Kurukshetra war, Karna and Arjuna faced each other and started fighting. As the battle intensified, Arjuna pushed back Karna's chariot 10 steps backward every time by the energy of the arrows, but Karna pushed Arjuna's chariot only 2 steps back. But Krishna praises only Karna. When questioned by Arjuna, Krishna said it is meant to be impossible for any human ever to push his chariot backwards because the chariot of Arjuna contains both Hanuman and Krishna, thus holding the entire weight of the universe, but Karna pushed this chariot 2 steps back, means he pushed the entire weight of universe. Being pushed back by Arjuna, Karna began coming forward but then Karna's chariot wheel was trapped in the mud as a result of the curse he had received earlier from goddess Earth. At the crucial moment, he forgot the incantations to invoke Brahmastra, as a result of his guru Parashurama's curse. Karna got down from his chariot to free the wheel and asked Arjuna to pause, reminding him of the etiquette of war. But Krishna spurred Arjuna to attack Karna reminding the way Karna killed unarmed Abhimanyu- which are against the rules of engagement of the war. Being spurred by Krishna, then Arjuna used Anjalikastra to kill Karna which cut the head of Karna, leading to his death.

By his order, architect F. F. Voskresensky substantially rebuilt the mansion. The former Stebnev's house became its middle part, and extensions were added to its sides.  Architecture  The mansion of L. I. Geltischeva is one of the brightest examples of Moscow's modern architecture. The design widely uses vegetable motifs. The facade of the small building is covered with turquoise glazed tiles. In the frames of the windows, there are many molded decorative details (such as leaves and flowers of burdock). The niche of the main entrance is decorated with columns of the Tuscan order. On the roof, there are roof windows of unusual shapes. Several attics with balloons have been installed on the attic, as well as a decorative torch on the stand. In the center of the main facade is a two-part \\"Italian\\" window, consisting of two semi-circular windows united by an arched niche. Above this window, a mosaic panel is placed on the attic, in which orchids are depicted on a gold background. The monogram of L. Ya. Geltischeva, the owner of the mansion, is visible on the facade. The windows of the basement floor are covered with wrought iron bars with iris flowers. The interior of the building has remained almost unchanged.

Stinson (born 1938) is a retired cardiothoracic surgeon living in Los Altos, United States, who assisted Norman Shumway in America's first adult human-to-human heart transplantation on 6 January 1968 at Stanford University. For over twenty years, Stinson was the principal investigator for the National Institutes of Health programme project in heart transplantation at Stanford. In 1981, he was a founding member of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) and chaired their first international programme. Early career Edward Stinson was born in 1938 in San Diego, CaliforniaEdward B. Stinson, Curriculum Vitae, pp.1-4 and graduated from Stanford University School of Medicine, where he also completed his specialty training in cardiovascular surgery. Experimental surgery In 1965, three years prior to America‚Äôs first adult human-to-human heart transplant, Stinson was part of the research team that published the classic paper which appraised experimental heart transplants at Stanford University Medical Center and demonstrated that the operative procedure could be successful. Of the just over 30 consecutive orthotopic transplants, most survived the operation until either rejection or immunosuppressant toxicity resulted in death. Two particular adaptations in operative techniques were key to surviving the operation itself and were endorsed in the research. Atrial anastomosis was performed instead of joining the individual pulmonary veins and a teflon cuff wrapped around the aortic anastomosis was used as a seal to prevent a blood leak. The research provided the basis of knowledge for the world's first heart transplant by Christiaan Barnard and the later Stanford transplant programmes over the following decades when such programmes were shut down elsewhere. The importance of understanding the physiology of the cardiac homograft and the process of rejection was accepted as fundamental to understanding the best way to detect and treat rejection. The issue of accurately detecting early rejection, of which Stinson was also involved, came later. America's first adult heart transplant Stinson was Shumway's most notable resident and the chief resident in 1968 when he assisted Shumway in performing the first adult human-to-human heart transplant procedure in a 54-year-old steelworker, in the United States. On 6 January 1968, he travelled to El Camino Hospital to bring the donor Virginia White to Stanford with her heart still beating. As soon as the neurologist confirmed White's brain death, surgery began in two adjacent operating theatres. After removing White's heart in room 12, Stinson carried it over in a cold saline filled bowl to Shumway in Room 13. Later, as professor emeritus of cardiothoracic surgery in 2006, he recalled; > After we removed the recipient‚Äôs heart, we stared at the empty pericardial > cavity and wondered what we‚Äôd actually done.....We proceeded with implanting > the new heart. It was pretty exciting to see it start up. Stinson stayed awake for most of the first five nights after surgery, monitoring recipient Kasperak, while the press continued to report on the whole event. Surgery at Stanford Stinson joined the faculty in 1969. During 1970-72 he served as staff associate at the National Heart and Lung Institute Clinic of Surgery while on leave from Stanford. As staff associate, he was responsible for both clinical activity in cardiac surgery in the Clinic of Surgery of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and for intramural research programs addressing cardiac physiology and heart transplantation. Cardiac surgery While training with Shumway, Stinson would perform almost exclusively cardiac surgery, with occasional assignments to general surgery. Noted for his skill and speed at surgery, he was known as ‚ÄúFast Eddie‚Äù in the operating theatre. In 1971, he reported with Shumway, Eugene Dong, D.A. Clark and R. B. Griepp, on the early heart transplants at Stanford. Later, in 1979, with Stuart W. Jamieson and Shumway, he reported on the later successes of heart transplants. This report was one of the developments that helped the recommencement of heart surgery in the UK under Sir Terence English in 1979. On reflection of the worldwide transplants, Stinson stated > Many centers took up clinical transplantation without the laboratory > experience or profound support in clinically related areas such as > immunosuppression. They didn‚Äôt expect the difficulties that occurred after > the operation. A heart transplant performed in 1970 by Stinson was later reported in the 1995 Guinness book of records when the recipient had survived more than twenty years. Organ rejection In 1972, Stinson and visiting Fellow Philip Caves, with the aim of detecting early organ rejection, performed the first heart biopsy after a heart transplant, a procedure based on an adaptation of a Japanese bioptome. The following year, they authored the classic paper on transvenous endomyocardial biopsy, with Margaret Billingham and Shumway. He was later described as \\"academically inspirational\\". In late 1980, he was part of the team that first introduced the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine for heart transplantation. The case of prolonged anoxia Stinson led the donor team in the case of Andrew De La Pena in 1986 when a series of unexpected events caused a prolonged ischaemic time between heart removal from the donor and subsequent restoration of coronary circulation in the infant recipient (De La Pena). Despite this, the transplant was successful. In the week prior to Christmas of 1986 in Fargo, computer software matched a 4-month- old infant donor with Stanford's 5-month-old Andrew De La Pena, who had a rare heart defect. Stanford was more than 3 hours away from Fargo by flight and the maximum time a heart could remain outside the body before it ran out of oxygen, was considered around 4 hours. However, Stanford had the experience of more than 400 heart transplants by this time. The decision to bring the donor to Stanford was not possible as the donor liver was to go elsewhere. Both liver and heart teams were required to travel to Fargo and take back the donor organs to their corresponding recipients and shortly Stinson's team found themselves on a specially co-ordinated flight, complete with a ‚Äúred igloo Playmate cooler‚Äù to Fargo‚Äôs Hector International Airport. After a prolonged operation due to having to remove the liver, an aeroplane breakdown in North Dakota in extreme cold weather in the middle of the night resulted in further delay and prolonged graft anoxia. The whole time the donor heart was kept under strict low temperatures (hypothermia) in the cool box. Stinson was able to arrange from the Governor of North Dakota, George A. Sinner, an F-4 fighter jet (one of 2 stationed in the State) after surreptitiously being given his private telephone number. Further delays occurred attempting to fit the cooler in the jet. Subsequently, the donor heart was flown to Stanford on the 2-seater fighter plane with the pilot only, that is without the donor team. The total anoxic time of the donor heart (Fargo to Stanford) was just short of 8 hours, clearly missing the 4 hour window. The story was published in the New York Times Magazine and then picked up by Reader's Digest and was published in a summarised article in February 1988 entitled \\"A New Heart for Andrew\\". De La Pena survived Hodgkins Lymphoma and Hurricane Katrina and 32 years later, in September 2018, was reunited with the donor parents. Research and later career In 1971, the National Institutes of Health awarded Stanford a National Institutes of Health programme project grant for further research, a venture which spanned more than twenty years. Stinson was its chief investigator. In addition, the American Heart Association awarded Stinson with an Established Investigatorship grant. He became Director of the clinical heart transplant programme and Principal Investigator of the newly awarded programme project grant that provided essential support for clinical and research activities of the transplant programme, including subsequent combined heart and lung transplantation and then isolated lung transplantation. This core programmatic support from the NIH continued until 1993 by which time thoracic transplantation had become generally accepted by Medicare and the private insurance industry as standard therapy deserving of insurance coverage. In addition to transplantation, Stinson was active in the entire spectrum of adult cardiac surgery and developed special interests in the surgical treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, infective endocarditis, and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Stinson continued as Director of the clinical heart transplant programme at Stanford until he retired and entered active emeritus status in 1998. By the year 2000, Stinson‚Äôs directed Stanford‚Äôs programme, supported by Shumway, had formed the foundations of expertise that led to 300 worldwide centres and 50,000 heart transplant procedures internationally. ISHLT In 1981, Stinson was one of the founding members of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) along with other well known names in transplantation research including Michael Hess, Jack Copeland, Terence English, Stuart Jamieson, and Michael Kaye. The first official meeting and international programme took place on 14 March 1981 in San Francisco, California with Stinson and Hess and chairmen. He was also on its council between 1982 and 1984.

They were opened in 1922. The authors of the monuments are the sculptor N. A. Andreev and the architect V. D. Kokorin.  History  In August 1919 the sculptor N. A. Andreev was commissioned to make a monument to the democrat, philosopher and publicist A. I. Herzen on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his death. This monument was supposed to be set January 20, 1920 in front of the building of Moscow State University. Since the monument was originally planned to be installed on the site of the recently restored grid, the People's Commissariat of Education opposed this. Then Andreev suggested making two monuments - to Herzen and Ogaryov, by placing them in the depths of the square on both sides of the entrance. The time allotted to work was very tight, so N. A. Andreev attracted his brother, the sculptor V. A. Andreev, to help. However, even the two of them failed to meet the deadline, and in January 1920, only the laying of monuments took place. The monuments were discovered only on December 10, 1922 within the framework of the Leninist plan of monumental propaganda.  Description  Monuments are made of concrete with marble chips. A. I.

It was built from 1860. It was also known as the Australian Agricultural Company Headquarters. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  This complex of buildings has grown over about 125 years. The original building is believed to date from the 1860s. A second building, joined by a covered way, was designed by Frederick Menkens and built 1903. Additions to this second building were designed by Frederick Menkens and F. G. Castleden in 1907, and by Castleden in 1909 and 1919. Castleden also designed a third essentially separate building in 1912. Recent flat roofed additions served as basic accommodation for the nightclub function. A caretaker's cottage to the west of the existing buildings, designed by Castleden in 1912, was demolished 1970. The complex served as the regional headquarters of the Australian Agricultural Company for many years: the company held a monopoly over coalmining in the Newcastle area from 1829 to 1847, but retaining mining and commercial interests in the district long after that. The complex has subsequently been used as a nightclub, for many years under the name of Fanny's Tavern before reverting to the building's original name of Argyle House in February 2013.  Description  This large complex of buildings, linked in pavilion fashion, covers the entire property and is built to each of the three street alignments. Internal alterations and modern infill development on the Centenary Road side and the Argyle Street corner have been made to adapt the building complex for night club use. All buildings are rendered and painted light cream with label moulds and other features in contrasting colours. The original 1860s building is the most architecturally interesting. It has a high pitched roof with recent terracotta tiles and a narrow boxed eaves, and wall construction is rendered masonry with large stone sills to the window openings. This building is symmetrical to the Argyle Street frontage, where there is a central gabled porch with a central circular timber louvred ventilator surrounded by a raised circle matching the semicircular label mould over the entrance arch. The wide verandah, on both street frontages, has a bullnose corrugated iron roof, cast iron posts, and interesting wrought iron fringe and brackets wrought iron. Exposed rafters on the verandah are curved to follow the bullnose. The section of the verandah south of the entrance has been filled in with boarding, but this would be easy to remove. The verandah floor is asphalt over flagging, while a wrought iron fence with dagger tops and on a rounded stone plinth runs right around the verandah. There is an original double gate matching the fence. Double doors on the western end of the verandah where it abuts another building may be original. Windows are simple double sash, single paned. Wrought iron ventilator grills are a feature. Stone steps form the porch are now tiled and probably raised form their original level. The other early buildings are in keeping with the original one and are joined to it by various additions. The 1912 Castleden building, also fronting Wharf Street has bosses and anchoring points, possibly for a former awning. There is evidence that there was originally a verandah between these two building to match that of the 1860s building. This latter building also has a hipped roof. There is a part hipped, part gabled roof with boxed eaves to the Menkens 1903/Castleden 1909 building. The 1903 Menkens section has two tall, rendered chimneys. Window openings on the Centenary Road facade of the 1909 additions are very plain, the large windows are double sash, single pane. Large exhaust fans and associated ducting mar the roofs of the 1903-09 section and the original building, but could easily be removed. The recent infill sections have lower, flat corrugated iron roofs with a bullnose to street frontages. While there is some original joinery, the interiors have been largely altered and compromised. The condition of the complex was reported as being fair to good as at 13 December 2001. Various additions and alterations have been made (e.g. The terracotta roof tiles and possibly the gabled porch on the east side). These do not reduce the historic significance of the building. They do detract from the integrity of the structure as an historic artifact.  Modifications and dates  * 1860s - Original building built * 1903 - A second building, joined by a covered way, was designed by Frederick Menkens and built * 1907 - Additions to this second building were designed by Menkens and F G Castleden, and by Castleden in 1909 and 1919. * 1912 - Castleden also designed a third essentially separate building. * c 1970 - Recent flat roofed additions served as basic accommodation for the nightclub function. A caretaker's cottage to the west of the existing buildings, designed by Castleden in 1912, was demolished  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Argyle House is a very good example of an early Victorian cottage (the original 1860s building) that has developed with the addition of many sympathetic buildings in a pavilion style of growth.

The Battle  After months of heavy fighting in the Donbass and Don region, the Red Southern Front collapsed, allowing the Volunteer Army to launch a major attack towards the North and West. In June, the Whites undertook a successful offensive in the directions of Yekaterinoslav and Kharkiv. By the second half of June 1919, the main forces of the Volunteer Army (most of the forces of the 1st Army and 3rd Kuban Cavalry Corps, in total 6 infantry and cavalry divisions) under the command of General Vladimir May- Mayevsky approached Kharkiv still controlled by the Red Army, and began to prepare for the assault. The main offensive on the city was developed by forces of the 1st Army Corps of General Alexander Kutepov from the south and south-east. The city was taken after 5 days of heavy fighting.  Results  Denikin and his generals in Kharkiv, 28 June 1919. As a result of the capture of Kharkiv, the Volunteer Army destroyed an important stronghold of the Red Army on its way to Kursk and Moscow. They also captured an important stock of weapons: armored cars, armored trains, machine guns and ammunition, and seized an important industrial center. Thus, AFSR not only captured a strategically important city, but also replenished its resources and got the opportunity to use the industrial potential of Kharkiv. And already on July 3, Anton Denikin promulgates his Moscow Directive and begins the campaign against Moscow.

The party was founded on February 25, 2017. Since September 14, 2019 its leaders have been Anto≈Üina ≈Öena≈°eva and Edmunds Cepurƒ´tis. The Progressives currently do not hold any seats in the Saeima or European Parliament. Ideology and goals The Progressives have stated that one of their main goals is implementing the Nordic welfare model in Latvia (the party's political programme is even called \\"Turning towards the Nordic countries\\"). The party's principles include implementation of a progressive tax system, responsibility towards the environment, fighting against corruption and the shadow economy, an active state role in the economy, dropping GDP as the main measure of development (in favour of others which take the well-being of society into account such as the Happiness index), gender and LGBT equality.  Nationality and Identity  The party wishes to abolish Latvia's non-citizen status, held by over 10% of the national population,Population of Latvia by nationality; Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs 1 January 2020. by gradually granting non-citizens citizenship status. As an initial measure, the Progressives support a policy of automatically granting Latvian citizenship to any child born to permanent residents, regardless of whether or not they have citizenship themselves or whether they were born before or after Latvia's independence. In addition, they want to immediately enfranchise permanent residents to vote in local elections after reaching the age of 16, even if they do not hold citizenship. The party is supportive of dual citizenship among the Latvian diaspora. It supports further state funding for Latvian- language education (as well as a 0% VAT on books published in Latvian) and the granting of free Latvian courses for returning migrants and asylum seekers, while at the same time also supporting minority languages in the school curriculum as a form of cultural diversity. They define themselves as inclusive and oppose ethnic segregation and discrimination.  Foreign Policy  The Progressives subscribe to a Pro-Europeanist ideology and support Latvia's membership in NATO. They are in favour of an EU army and believe that the EU should become a United Nations Security Council permanent member state, while at the same time desiring to abolish permanent members' singular veto power. They condemn what they dub the \\"aggressive policy of the Russian ruling regime\\", while at the same time expressing a desire for improved relations with both Russia and Belarus, which they opine would happen trough \\"democratic processes\\" in these nations. They do not recognize the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and call for an investigation into what they dub as \\"human rights violations in Russian-occupied Crimea\\".  Economy  The Progressives call on the Latvian state to abandon neoliberal economic policies and the \\"Russian-style\\" of restraint toward economic interventionism, instead calling for active state participation in the national economy. They are in favour of trade diversification aimed at reducing Latvia's dependance on Russian cargo and advocate for state funding for small and medium-sized enterprises, start-ups and companies that adhere to their social and environmental criteria. History The Progressives participated in the 2017 Latvian municipal elections in four municipalities. In two of these, Aizpute and MƒÅrupe Municipality, they won seats on the local councils. The Progressives participated in the 2018 Latvian parliamentary election. Prior to the election, they declined to join an alliance with the center to right-wing liberal parties, which was later created without the Progressives as Development/For!. They argued that staying out of the alliance was necessary to ensure that the party's left-wing policies and high standard for political donations were not compromised. The Progressives had a unique gender parity principle on their ballots, with all election list leaders being women. Their candidate for Prime Minister was Roberts Putnis. The party did not win any seats in the Saeima, receiving only 2.61% of the vote, but qualifying for state funding of ‚Ç¨15,000 per year for surpassing the 2% threshold. In 2019, the Progressives participated in the European Parliament election. They ran with the slogan \\"More Europe\\" on a federalist platform, with their main proposals concerning social policy and green politics. Although polling at 4.5% in March and 4.3% in April they ultimately received only 2.9% of the vote. After the election, on 28 May, Roberts Putnis resigned as party leader. That year they also organized a small protest against the Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria in front of the Turkish embassy in Riga, as well as pickets against a labour law reform that was deemed to degrade workers rights and weaken labour unions. In early 2020, Riga City Council was dismissed and a snap election was announced. Because of technicalities and COVID-19 pandemic, it was postponed until August 29. The Progressives formed a common electoral list with the liberal Development/For! alliance. They claimed that ideological differences are not as important on the local level and stressed the importance of changing Riga's ruling \\"Harmony\\" and Honor to serve Riga coalition that had been involved in multiple corruption scandals. The common electoral list won the election with 18/60 seats, from which 9 were members of the Progressives and 2 were independent city activists with ties to the Progressives. The Progressives' member MƒÅrti≈Ü≈° Kossoviƒçs chairs the common City Council group of Development/For! and the Progressives, Edmunds Cepurƒ´tis is the chair of Housing and environment committee and Viesturs Kleinbergs is the chair of Social issues committee.

Objective writing on the history of the Qajars In the years leading up to the year 2000 several individuals were actively but separately looking for a vehicle for the study of the Qajar Era. Among these persons, were, in Europe: Leo Barjesteh, Ali Mirza Qajar, Hans Timmermans,:http://okbn.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/hans-timmermans.pdf Willem Vogelsang, Gillian Vogelsang-Eastwood and Corien Vuurman, in the United States: Manoutchehr Eskandari-Qajar, Farhad Sepahbody and Majid Tehranian,:http://www.toda.org/about/majidbio.html and in Iran: Bahman Bayani, Mansoureh Ettehadieh and Bahman Farman Farmaian. The study and writing on the history of the era had seen its difficulties since the fall of the Qajar dynasty.:http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/historiography-viii In Iran in the 1990s this situation seemed to change and the time to start an association to facilitate a more objective study of the period seemed opportune. Foundation and activities In 2000 the International Qajar Studies Association was founded and registered in Santa Barbara in the United States. May 2000 saw the first meeting of IQSA at the premises of the publishing house (Nashr-e Tarikh-e Iran) of Dr. Mansoureh Ettehadieh in Tehran. An Advisory Board was formed with eminent scholars in the field. The first IQSA conference was held on May 17‚Äì19, 2001. This inaugural conference ‚ÄòReading early photographs: visual sources for the interpretation of Iranian Qajar history‚Äô took place at Leiden University. Since then IQSA held conferences at a large variety of universities and institutes, both in Europe: Leiden University (2002), Cantonal Hospital and Mossadeq Institute, Geneva (2003), Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (2005), CNRS, Universit√© Paris III (2006), with the Fondation Napol√©on at the Biblioth√®que Paul Marmottan (2007), the International Institute of Social History, Amsterdam, and Leiden University (2008), the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna (2009), St Antony's College, Oxford and St Anne's College, Oxford(2010), the International Institute of Social History, Amsterdam, and the National Museum of Antiquities, Leiden (2011), University of St Andrews, Scotland (2011), the HAN University of Applied Sciences and Radboud University, Nijmegen (2013), the University of Bamberg (2014), the Museum the Ursuline Convent ‚Äì International Museum for Family History, Eijsden-Margraten (2015) and again in the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna (2016), and in the United States Santa Barbara City College (2004) and Boston University (2012). At the 2015 conference at The Ursuline Convent the IQSA board decided to continue ‚Äì henceforth ‚Äì with annual Qajar Studies Days (lectures and workshops) on a fixed location (The Ursuline Convent) and with biyearly conferences.

Doug is a skilled professional in the field, but also displays a laid back, deadpan demeanor. He insists on exclusively using .38 caliber handguns because he considers them detective's weapons. His personal vehicle is a modified sports car resembling a DMC DeLorean that is loaded with gadgets and is able to assume a high-speed mode. His signature color is red. ; / \\"Perm\\" / \\"Okappa\\" / \\"Buzz-Cut\\" : : Doug Billingham's new rookie partner, a 20-year-old former police constable with dreams of becoming a hero. Kirill is impulsive, cocky, and dense, contrasting with his partner's cooler personality, with his philosophy for life being \\"don't think, feel so good.\\" Kirill's \\"good luck charm\\" saying is later revealed to be an excerpt of a poem known as \\"Nikai's Prayer.\\" Despite his seeming idiocy, Kirill is surprisingly knowledgeable in the field of genetics, having written a detailed scientific paper on the subject as a teenager to earn a scholarship. He is often confused for a woman because of his slender build and androgynous face. His signature color is purple. All of his nicknames so far have referred to his hairstyle in some manner. ; / \\"Pink\\" : : Seven-O's resident sniper, displaying a somewhat rude and blunt personality and partnered with Katherine. Deana is fiercely independent and quick to break protocol to solve a case, often clashing with her partner's strict insistence on following the rules. Her signature color is pink. ; / \\"Rookie\\" : : A relatively \\"normal\\" woman compared to the rest of the team, with her most eccentric trait being that she is an avid foodie, Katherine is the latest rookie in Seven-O (beating Kirill by a single day), partnered with Deana. The two frequently clash over their opposing personalities, with Kay finding Deana's casual dismissal of rules and protocol exasperating. Her signature color is green. ; / \\"Boxer\\" : : An aggressive and tomboyish Seven-O inspector partnered with Yuri. In her youth, Max was a shy, bookish, and feminine girl who enjoyed crafts and cute things. She adopted her current look as a favor to her transgender friend Connor, who came out at their high school prom and was shunned by their schoolmates, turning to drugs and disappearing after being denied entry. Despite becoming colder and more bitter since then, Max retains many domestic hobbies, including cooking and taking care of plants. Yuri notes that despite her \\"tough girl\\" exterior, Max is still warm and gentle at heart. Her personal vehicle is a bulky, futuristic motorcycle. Her signature color is blue. ; / \\"Robot\\" : : An inspector in Seven-O partnered with Max, displaying a calm and logical, yet warm and friendly personality in contrast to her partner's brasher attitude. Yuri, befitting her nickname, is actually a highly advanced android imbued with incredible strength and computational abilities, a fact that is open knowledge to everyone in the department but Kirill. The department keeps this a secret from him solely to mess with him, finding his attempts to keep her \\"secret\\" entertaining. Her signature color is white. ; / \\"Boss\\" : : The head of Seven-O, a somewhat eccentric man who seems to pick members of his team based on arbitrary quirks. He considers the four female inspectors and Sophie to be \\"Travis' Angels,\\" a name they all find demeaning and sexist. ; : : Seven-O's dispatcher, a young woman who dresses in lolita fashion and behaves in a \\"cute,\\" childish manner. Her signature color is orange. ; / \\"Doctor\\" : : Seven-O's resident technology expert. Apple insists on being referred to as \\"Doctor\\" (though this is usually ignored by everyone in the department but Kirill) and is in charge of creating and maintaining all of the team's equipment. Esperanza A powerful Anthem-related criminal organization and the main antagonists of the series. ; / \\"Z.\\" : : The leader of Esperanza. At first thought to be the lowest member on the organization's A-to-Z hierarchy, it is soon revealed that Zabel is actually the organization's true leader. He murders Agepetus Kroyd, the man thought to be Esperanza's boss, in a plot to throw off law enforcement. Zabel despises those who waste food, demanding his subordinates finish a meal completely before leaving the table. ; / \\"B.\\" : : A high-ranking member of the criminal organization Esperanza. Bamboo Man dresses in a clown-like outfit with rubies replacing his teeth and possesses incredible superhuman abilities that do not come from Anthem usage, including enhanced strength and speed and the ability to change his face. Bamboo Man is later revealed to have assumed the identity of Brian Cooper, a high-ranking member of the Lisvaletta military. ; / \\"A.\\" : The assumed leader of Esperanza, who is killed by Zabel Franken, Esperanza's true leader, in a plot to throw off law enforcement. Other Characters ; : : Doug's former partner. He retires from the police after recovering from being shot on a case to open his own bar. He is noted to not be very good at running the bar, serving patrons canned and frozen food and having no customers beyond Seven-O's inspectors. ; : : Kirill's older brother who works at Derick's bar. For most of Kirill's life, Valery cross-dressed and posed as his sister under the name \\"Milla,\\" his secret only being exposed when Kirill stumbles upon him in the men's restroom of Derick's bar. The deception is revealed to be because Valery and Kirill are escapees from Nikai (Japanese for \\"second floor\\"), the second and brighter sun in Lisvaletta's sky. Valery-as-Milla walking out of Kirill's life and disappearing ten years ago became Kirill's inspiration to join the police force. ; : : Secretary of the Lisvalletta military, who is in fact and native of Nikai and a Genetically Modified Soldiers (GMS). He is aware of Kirill and Valery's past as natives of Nikai and Kirill's ability to provide an antidote to Anthem. ;Anthem Users :Users of the drug Anthem are split into three separate phases: Phase 1 ‚Äì suspected usage, Phase 2 ‚Äì Accelerating usage and Phase 3 ‚Äì Anthem-induced Overdrive. The Seven-O cannot intervene until they determine a users has entered Phase 2 when they develop a distinguishing mark on their neck, and once users enter Phase 3, they can mutate and gain superhuman powers. Users can also attain an even more dangerous transformation via overdose. ;Nikai :Nikai is the name give to the planet's second sun which is in fact a human space colony set up by its human inhabitants who left a wasted planet many years ago seeking a new home. This culminated in a different civilization which developed Genetically Modified Soldiers (GMS), but found the process time-consuming and expensive. A miniaturized and portable version of the active drug was then developed and given the name Anthem, and the Esperanza organization was selected to distribute it on the planet's surface while the military retained the antidote.

With pediatrician Benjamin Spock and psychologist Erik Erikson, she co-founded a counseling center for families and children in Pittsburgh. Professionals from various fields came to the center to learn about child development. McFarland and Spock also established a child development department at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. McFarland met Fred Rogers in the 1950s when she agreed to supervise his work with a child for a seminary counseling course, and she later became a consultant to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. She met with Rogers on a weekly basis and reviewed the content and wording of his scripts until her death, and he cited her as a major influence on his career. Early life McFarland, the youngest of three daughters, was born to Robert and Gertrude (Messer) McFarland in 1905 in Oakdale, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. She had an older sister named Mary. McFarland's father died when she was five years old. She remained unmarried and childless throughout her life, and she attributed that to her father's death. \\"And all of the subsequent phases of what it means to be loved by a male and loving to a male were lost to me. I wanted a kind of fathering,\\" she said. She also noted that she had a very loving mother who gave her a sense of the worth of a child, and she suggested that her upbringing had contributed to her career path. \\"In the end I really wanted to be like my mother,\\" she said. Career After completing an undergraduate degree at Goucher College in 1927, McFarland earned a master's degree at Columbia University the next year. She spent a few years teaching and conducting personality research at the Winchester Thurston School in Pittsburgh and the Hubbard Woods Nursery School in Winnetka, Illinois. When McFarland taught at Hubbard Woods, she worked with the children enrolled in a study by Rose Haas Alschuler and La Berta Weiss Hattwick that resulted in their publication known as Painting and personality: A study of young children. McFarland returned to Columbia to complete a doctorate in 1938. She then worked and taught in Melbourne, where she held leadership positions at the Kindergarten Training College and the Free Kindergarten Union. Returning to the United States in 1941, she was an associate professor of psychology at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts for ten years. During this time McFarland realized the importance of two concepts that defined much of her later work ‚Äì the role of the woman in child development and the utility of creative play in childhood. In 1951, McFarland returned to Pittsburgh where she taught as an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh. In 1953, McFarland co-founded the Arsenal Family and Children's Center with Benjamin Spock and Erik Erikson. The center's goal was that physicians and others would be able to learn more about childhood development. Erikson spent one day a week at the center. \\"He spoke to me in a different way than any of the psychoanalytic literature,\\" McFarland said of Erikson. Erikson was similarly complimentary of McFarland, saying that she \\"knew more than anyone in this world about families with young children.\\" McFarland was the director of the Arsenal Center through 1971. With Spock, McFarland helped in the founding of the Department of Child Development and Child Care at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Mister Rogers' Neighborhood In the 1950s, Fred Rogers began co-hosting The Children's Corner, a television show filmed in Pittsburgh, with Josie Carey. At the same time, he enrolled at the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary with the intent of utilizing religious training to further his television outreach to children. He was taking a seminary course in counseling and McFarland supervised his counseling of a child as part of that class. After Rogers' course ended, they continued to meet with each other each week, and when Rogers began working on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, McFarland became a consultant to the show. McFarland had a significant influence on the ways in which content was presented on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. She reviewed scripts for the show until her death, often suggesting improvements on the material that Rogers had created. She also consulted on Rogers' First Experience book series and his video series on parenting. Rogers said that McFarland was \\"so other-directed that when you were in her presence, you felt you were important.\\" He referred to McFarland as \\"the most major influence in my professional life.\\" Rogers' book \\"Mister Rogers Talks to Parents\\" is dedicated to McFarland. The spin-off series, Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, includes a character named for McFarland. Later life and legacy As of the summer of 1987, McFarland had been diagnosed with a bone marrow disorder called myelofibrosis for about ten years and was having to undergo blood transfusions. Despite having difficulties with her mobility by that time, she was still meeting with Rogers weekly and holding discussions with former students and mental health professionals in her home. She died in a nursing home in South Fayette Township on September 12, 1988. McFarland did not publish much academic literature, but she worked with a number of students who found success in various fields, including early art therapists Judith A. Rubin and Edith Kramer. Rubin characterized McFarland as a \\"creative catalyst\\" and \\"my professional mother\\". Rubin contributed to a Festschrift in recognition of McFarland's work. In the epigraph of a book on children's language, former student Ethel Tittnich compared McFarland to a teacher described in Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet, saying that McFarland led students \\"to the threshold of [their] own minds\\". When McFarland died, Douglas Robert Nowicki, then a priest in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, said that McFarland considered love to be the essential characteristic of a successful teacher. In 2015, the Fred Rogers Center for Early Learning and Children‚Äôs Media at Saint Vincent College established a project to analyze recorded conversations between McFarland and Rogers to learn more about the impact of these discussions on the development of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.

It belonged to Efremov family.  Architecture  The facade of the Ataman Palace in Starocherkassk was designed in Classicist style in the manner of the mansions of Moscow and St. Petersburg nobility. The triangular pediment of the central rizalite is supported by four single and two pairs of doubled smooth half-columns. The colonnade rests on the relief belt between the first and second floors. Straight sandricks adorn the windows of the first and the second floor. The windows of the palace are quite diverse in size: the one that of the lower floor are small, flattened in shape, and the blind platens built of keystone resemble the windows of the house of merchant and cossacks Zhuchenkovs; the windows of the second floor are larger, lighter, have a light frame, and overall bring the appearance of a palace. The Efremov Palace was built at the same time as the house church near it. Numerous reconstructions, especially after the fire of 1848, greatly altered the building. The original appearance was preserved on a sketch of the panorama of Cherkassk made in 1803 by architect Nikolay Lvov, whom Emperor Alexander I sent to the Caucasus and the Crimea \\"for the arrangement and description of various necessities in the warm waters there.\\" Judging by the plan made by Lvov, the building stretched horizontally and preserved the symmetry of the composition and the pilaster parting of the wall. Yet the classic portico uniting the two floors was lost, and, probably, in the 19th century the location of the main entrance, which was on the south side, changed. Later, with the construction here in 1836 of a monastery enclosed by a new stone wall, the front fa√ßade of the building moved to the courtyard. At the same time, the central part was distinguished with a risalite with a colonnade of the second floor, completed with a triangular pediment.  History  Efremov family was one of the most distinguished and richest dynasty on the Don. Its founder, the son of Moscow merchant Efrem Petrov, moved to Cherkassk in 1670 (now Starocherkasskaya), where he successfully engaged in trade and rose to the rank of foreman. In 1756-1761, Efremov built a house church consecrated in the name of the Don Icon of Mother of God in their courtyard. According to legend, its prototype was the church, located in the Middle Caves of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. Indeed, there are some similarities: among them there is a technique of Ukrainian masters: a combination of vertical rectangular and faceted forms, a harmony of rectilinear and curvilinear outlines, a fusion of baroque and classical decor elements. On 27 December 1831, Yevdokiya Ioakimovna, the widow of Efrem Petrov, Ulyana Alekseevna and her son, captain Nikolai Stepanovich, petitioned Don Archbishop Athanasius and asked to build a convent in Starocherkassk. In the petition, the main and the only motive that prompted the members of Efremov family to take such a step, was their faith and desire to perpetuate the memory of relatives buried in Cherkassk land. The decree of Emperor Nicholas I \\"On the establishment of Efremov Convent in the Starocherkasskaya stanitsa of the Novocherkassk Eparchy\\" was issues on 25 January 1837.  Museum  The Efremov Palace is the main object of the Starocherkassk Museum- Reserve. The extensive apartments of the mansion house various exhibitions about the history of Cherkassy and Don Cossacks. Among the exhibits are marble sundials of the 16th century brought by Cossacks from Constantinople, Azov trophies of the 17th century, and the various weapons of Don Cossacks. After reconstruction in 2014, the second floor of the palace was opened for visitors: now there is an exhibition dedicated to Efremov family and Cossack culture. In 2015, the Ministry of Property and Land Relations of Rostov Oblast intended to transfer the building of the Ataman Palace to the Russian Orthodox Church, but the regional court declared the intention of the transfer illegal, and so the museum complex still remains a secular institution.

It was founded in 2015 by Deepika Padukone as a non- profit NGO to bring awareness to mental health in India. In 2016, the organization launched a program called \\"You Are Not Alone\\". Facebook is working with the organization to prevent suicides from being livestreamed. Focus The Foundation focuses on the following objectives: * To create awareness and reduce the stigma around depression * To fund and support community-based mental health projects that can have a sustainable and a large-scale impact on the society. * To support research in the area of mental health in India. The focus of the Live Love Laugh Foundation is to reduce the stigma that surrounds mental health. The foundation spreads awareness and changes the way people look at mental health in general. It provides a platform that enables people who are seeking help to learn more information and connect with mental health professionals. People are able to share and hear others' stories of their own experiences with mental health.  Founder and background  The Live Laugh Love Foundation was founded by Deepika Padukone, an Indian actress who suffers from depression, along with a board of trustees. She created this foundation to bring more awareness to mental health and to reduce the stigma of it in India. One reason Padukone decided to create this foundation is because, ‚ÄúIn India, 90 percent of people who suffer from depression don‚Äôt seek help.‚Äù Padukone uses social media as a tool to encourage others to share their personal experiences/stories with mental illness, using the hashtag, #NotAshamed. The year after Padukone founded the Live Love Laugh Foundation, she launched a campaign called \\"More Than Just Sad\\" to assist general physicians in properly treating patients suffering from depression or anxiety. Padukone is also the brand ambassador for the NGO Indian Psychiatric Society, which is the largest association of Indian psychiatrists. There are currently only 3,500 psychiatrists in India, with even fewer psychologists. This makes a ratio of three psychiatrists to every million people. India has the highest rate of depression at 36%, as well as the highest suicide rate of any country in the world. There are many challenges that people in India face regarding mental health and its stigma. In India, mental illness is seen as a disability and those with a mental illness are discriminated against. It is common for families to be against seeking help for any sort of mental health issue. A sense of denial is another challenge. People may think they are in control of helping themselves which limits them from reaching out to others for help. Receiving therapy is seen as a weakness so it is not common to get help from professionals. Along with this, insurance does not cover issues with mental health, which adds to why people will not seek professional help. Another challenge the people of India face is limited education on mental health. In rural areas, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is seen as demon possession.  Funding  This is a non- profit organization. It is currently being funded by sponsors and volunteers who are able to give their time or others who are able to make donations. Anyone who chooses to donate can also specify where they would like their donation to go. The donations can go specifically to the school program, the rural program, or just a donation to the foundation in general.

The party emerged from a split in the German labour movement in the Czechoslovak Republic and functioned parallel to the Czech Marxist left movement for most of 1921. The party represented a more radical position compared to the Czech Marxist left, and fully supported adherence to the Communist International. It eventually merged into the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Split in DSAP The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (German Division) originated in a split in the German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic (DSAP) 1920-1921. The radicalization among the German socialists in Czechoslovakia could be traced to the influence from refugees from Hungary following the defeat of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. The leftwing elements in the DSAP, centered in Reichenberg and led by Karl Kreibich, took part in the December 1920 general strike. The DSAP party leadership issued a statement on January 8, 1921 condemning the Reichenberg party branch for violation of party discipline. The DSAP left responded by declaring their support for the formation of a Communist Party. DSAP expelled its Reichenberg branch on January 17, 1921, which in turn held a conference on January 30, 1921 and issued an appeal for an extraordinary party conference to be held March 12, 1921. The expelled Reichenberg DSAP branch was joined by other German left- wing social democrats in working towards founding a new party. Founding party conference The founding party conference (Parteitag) of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (German Division) was held in Liberec, Nov√© Pavlovice (Reichenberg, Neu Paulsdorf in German) on March 12-15, 1921. The Liberec party conference unanimously adopted, without any debate, a resolution declaring the founding of the party. The party conference approved the 21 theses of the Communist International and issued a request, without any preconditions, for affiliation to the International. 160 delegates participated in the party conference. The Union of Communist Groups of Stanislav Kostka Neumann attended the conference, and Neumann held a speech to the delegates. Building the party About a quarter of the DSAP membership, over 40,000 people, joined the new party. Kreibich, along with his colleague Alois Neurath, built the party with inspiration from the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). On March 15, 1921 the newly constituted Central Committee of the party elected Kreibich as its chairman, Joska as treasurer and Kreutz as deputy treasurer. The Executive Committee constituted the same day included Kreibich, Alois Neurath, Joska, Kreutz and Sitte. As per the statutes adopted in the founding party conference, the new party was divided into 18 district organizations (Kreisorganisationen): Aussig, Bodenbach, B√∂hmisch Leipa, Br√ºnn, Freiwaldau, Grulich, Karlsbad, Komotau, Krummau, Mies, M√§hrisch-Ostrau, M√§hrisch- Sch√∂nberg, Olm√ºtz, Prague, Reichenberg, T√∂plitz, Trautenau and Warnsdorf. The district organizations were further divided into local branches. The party central struggled with the number of requests from local cadres to set up local branches. Party press The party had a printing house of its own, with four rapid presses, a rotary press and five typesetting machines. Prior to the founding of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (German Division), the organ of the Reichenberg left was the daily newspaper Vorw√§rts ('Forward'). Ahead of the founding party conference the German communists had founded Internationale ('International') as a second daily organ, carrying the subtitle 'communist organ for the North-West Bohemian workers', and a weekly newspaper, S√ºdb√∂hmische Arbeiterzeitung ('South Bohemian Workers' Newspaper', appearing January 5, 1921). On April 2, 1921 another weekly newspaper was launched, Ostb√∂hmische Arbeiterzeitung ('East Bohemian Workers' Newspaper'). On May 1, 1921 a third daily party organ emerged, Kampf (\\"Struggle\\"), with the subtitle 'communist organ for Silesia and North Moravia'. The party launched the publication Weckruf ('Wake-up call') for mass distribution among urban and rural workers. Another party publication was Der kommunistische Gewerkschafter ('The Communist Trade Unionist'), later renamed 'Der rote Gewerkschafter ('The Red Trade Unionist'). National Women's Secretariat Parallel to the founding party conference in Reichenberg, a national women's conference (Frauenreichskonferenz) was held. The party had a National Women's Secretariat (Reichssekretariat der Frauen). The secretariat had a publication of its own, Die Kommunistin ('The Woman Communist'), which had a circulation of 13,000 copies. Merger with the Czech left Notably, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (German Division) was the first communist party in the new republic, with the Czech Marxist left forming their party only in May 1921. Lenin in particular was pushing for the unification of the communist movement in Czechoslovakia into a single party, a move that the Czech leftists had initially resisted. The German communists had taken a more radical stand than the Czech left leader Bohum√≠r ≈†meral, who for tactical reasons hesitated in forming a new party. ≈†meral sought to gather as many left social democrats as possible before formalizing the split in the Czech social democracy, prompting Kreibich to accuse the Czech Marxist left of being a platform for 'centrists' and 'opportunists'. Drawing from the experiences of the building of the KPD, Kreibich sought to utilize the same approach to ≈†meral's group as the Spartacus League had employed in winning over large parts of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany. In April 1921, a meeting between representatives of the Communist International and Czech and German communists from Czechoslovakia was held in Dresden, at which it was agreed in principle to form a unified Communist Party in the Czechoslovak Republic. Kreibich represented the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (German Division) at the third congress of the Communist International, held in Moscow June-July 1921. The dispute between the ≈†meral and Kreibich factions was resolved at this meeting, the Comintern instructed that a unified international Communist Party to be formed in Czechoslovakia within three months (which ≈†meral had resisted) whilst Kreibich was reprimanded for 'leftist deviations'. During the summer of 1921 local joint international communist organizations emerged around the country, gathering Czech, German and (in the case of Ostrava) Polish communists. A unification party conference, merging the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (German Division), was held between October 30, 1921 and November 4, 1921. ≈†meral and Kreibich were the main speakers at the event. All 169 delegates at the conference voted in favour of a unified Communist Party, without any distinction of nationality.

It was first released as a track on De Paul's debut album Surprise in March 1973. Shortly afterwards, a live version that de Paul recorded for the BBC, appearing on the BBC Transcription Services album number 443 in April 1973. It was released as a single later that year in Peru (and possibly other South American countries) with the title \\"Agua\\" but the song was not released as a single in Europe, Japan and the USA. It has since appeared on a number of de Paul compilation albums such as Greatest Hits, The Best of Lynsey de Paul and the Sugar and Beyond anthology. \\"Water\\" has been covered by Japanese singer Nickey on her 2013 album A Taste of Honey, complete with Japanese lyrics. The song has also been sampled by other artists, firstly by Smoove & Turrell, who borrowed from the backing track to \\"Water\\" on their single \\"You Don't Know\\", which was released on 13 April 2009. However, from the arrangement, this version sounds more akin to the live version that de Paul recorded for the BBC. When de Paul heard \\"You Don't Know\\" she loved how they had used her music and personally intervened directly with her record company and publishers to make sure the deal happened. De Paul and Blue also received co-writing credits on \\"You Don't Know\\". As well as being released as a CD single with various remixes, it was included as a track on the album Antique Soul and their 2019 compilation double vinyl and CD album \\"Solid Brass: Ten Years Of Northern Funk.

Vairabchandra Nag undertook the responsibility and introduced two new preparations named Sitabhog and Mihidana. Lord Curzon was surprised to have such unique sweets and praised and thanked Vairabchandra Nag in the certificate given to him saying he never had such sweet ever before.

Over the years the project had 1,500 participants. The project focussed on the Y-chromosomal DNA and at that time was unique as it combined genetic profiles with pedigree lines going back centuries. The first combined DNA-results and genealogies were published in Zonen van Adam in Nederland in 2008. The publication of the book Honderd Schiedamse Families in 2010 led to an accompanying exhibition: Rijkdom van de stad. The exhibition inspired the foundation of a museum for family history.

Many of his most important commissions were undertaken in Shanghai where he lived and worked between 1930 and 1936. Late in 1930 his wife was recruited to work for Soviet intelligence: he supported her espionage related activities in various practical ways till their divorce in 1939, after which he became involved with spying for the Soviets on his own account. By 1943 he had ended up in Tehran where British forces were present in large numbers. Imprisoned successively by American forces and British forces, when he managed to get away he made for the Soviet Union in order to seek asylum. Three days after arriving in Moscow he was arrested. He spent the next ten years in a succession of labour camps, and after a further two years in \\"internal exile\\" was able to leave the Soviet Union in 1955. He moved to Dresden and resumed his architectural career. Rudolf Hamburger is known to students of espionage as the first husband of Ursula Kuczynski, celebrated in some quarters as \\"Stalin's best female spy\\" (\\"Stalins beste Spionin\\").  Life   Provenance and early years  Rodolf Hamburger was born at Landeshut, a small town on the southern edge of Lower Silesia. He was the second of his parents' three recorded children, all of them boys. In 1890 his father, Max Hamburger (1868‚Äì1952), had inherited from an uncle one of the several textile mills in the town. The administration offices and storage facilities were adjacent to the family home. During the 1920s the business employed 850 people. Max Hamburger was for many years chairman of the local chamber of commerce and, unusually for his class, a committed activist in liberal politics. Else Gradenwitz, the boy's mother, was a banker's daughter: she looked out for the women working in the factory and provided a kindergarten for their children. The grandparents all lived in Breslau (as Wroc≈Çaw was known at that time) and vacation stays in the city were frequent. In 1908, inspired by the \\"Krupp settlement\\" in Essen, the firm had built a model housing estate (\\"Siedlung\\") for the workers. Hamburger would describe his upbringing as Liberal Jewish. He was encouraged, as a child, to play with the children of the workers at the factory and, to the extent that he was politically engaged, he shared his father's progressive tendencies. Many years later, after he died, an English friend would describe Rudolf Hamburger as \\"the last Victorian communist\\".  Student years  Rudolf Hamburger was taught to sketch by Friederich Iwan, a local artist, while he was still a boy. He successfully completed his schooling and moved to Munich to study architecture in 1922. The assassination of the Foreign Minister, Walter Rathenau, that year came as a particular blow. Rathenau had been a close personal friend of his father's: the shocking event and the rising tide of right-wing extremism, which was particularly hard to miss in Munich, demonstrated the fragility of the new liberal-democratic political order. Contemporary architects by whom he was particularly influenced during his two years in the Bavarian capital included Theodor Fischer (1863‚Äì1938), Gabriel von Seidl and German Bestelmeyer (1874‚Äì1942). He moved to Dresden in 1924 where he studied for around a year, and met Richard Paulick, a fellow trainee architect who became a close friend. Their careers would frequently become entwined during the decades that followed. In 1925 Hamburger and Paulick moved on to the Technical University of Berlin, where they shared lodgings. They were taught by Hans Poelzig, whom the students idolised. Poelzig renounced traditional teaching methods, instead holding classes in his studios at the Arts Academy, and giving his students tasks from his current commissions. Fellow students, as Hamburger later recalled, included alongside the (relatively) conventional German students, a Croiatian, an Austrian aristocrat, a Japanese who designed interiors in meticulously co-ordinated pastel shades, an anarchist and a Hungarian girl with a completely unjustified belief in her own genius. Often the group round his table also included a tall polite young man, a reticent and likeable youth keen, like the others, to master the architect's craft. The students, and almost everyone else, would learn more about Albert Speer after 1933. Rudolf Hamburger emerged with a degree in 1927. During 1926, while a student in Berlin, Rudolf Hamburger met Ursula Kuczynski, a qualified bookshop assistant. An unusual bookshop assistant, his new friend was also one of the six children of the distinguished demographer Ren√© Kuczynski. She had joined the Communist Party in May 1926 when she was just 19. Ursula was deeply committed politically and possessed of a formidable intellect. The two became friends and then lovers. They married in Berlin in 1929.  Post-qualification  Hamburger stayed in Berlin afer graduating, taking a job as a construction manager with the Prussian Building and Finance directorate (\\"Preu√üischen Bau- und Finanzdirektion\\"). The job was not particularly stellar, but offered the possibility of taking more exams in order to become certified as a \\"master builder\\". In 1928 he took a job with Marie Frommer. There are suggestions that while with Frommer he probably worked on the \\"Hotel Villa\\" project in Berlin- Wilmersdorf. In October 1928 he became a Master Student (\\"Meistersch√ºler\\") at the Arts Academy studios with his former professor, Hans Poelzig. While there, till March 1930 he worked on the administrative building under construction for I.G.Farben at Frankfurt. There was also time for personal projects which earned him very little money, but nevertheless helped win recognition: he set up the \\"Red Bookshop\\" near the G√∂rlitz Station for a friend of Ursula's.  Political awareness  Getting to know Richard Paulick during his year in Dresden had brought Rudolf Hamburger into contact with social democratic ideas. In Berlin his friendship with Ursula introduced him to leftist intellectual circles, and he became familiar with the aspirations of those who believed in a new better society. He found himself drifting away from the conservatism of others in the architectural profession, and drawn towards the optimistic radical pacifist idealism represented by artists such as K√§the Kollwitz. He kept his distance from day-to-day political activism. He joined no political party. But he did join \\"Red Aid\\", a workers' welfare organisation with close links to the Communist Party. Another member was Ursula's father, Ren√© Kuczynski. Hamburger began to read Marx and Engels. \\"I was no longer just an observer. I grasped the nature of the class-based social structure and drew from that the obligation to participate in class struggle. But I still found it difficult to take the next step, to political activism. I was still too strongly drawn to my family's middle class life, with the old prejudices and habits .... Above all I was alienated by the hostile attitude that the Communist Party displayed towards the SPD\\" (\\"Ich wurde nicht nur Betrachter, sondern erfasste das Wesen der Klassengesellschaft und die Verpflichtung, daraus die Konsequenz des Klassenkampfes zu ziehen. Der Schritt zur Aktivit√§t fiel mir dennoch schwer. Zu stark war ich noch dem b√ºrgerlichen Leben durch Elternhaus, alte Vorurteile und Gewohnheiten verbunden. ... Vor allem befremdete mich die feindliche Haltung der KPD gegen die SPD\\").  Shanghai  = Start of the adventure = From a western perspective, in 1930 Shanghai was seen as a dynamic capitalist enclave surrounded by a feudal society. That offered opportunities for foreign entrepreneurs. The authorities were keen to attract investment: labour was abundant and inexpensive. The huge disparities of wealth and poverty also created a febrile political environment. It was in Shanghai that the Chinese Communist Party had been founded in 1921. The economy was hugely dynamic. The political context was defined by massive tensions. The community of expatriates from the west included White Russian √©migr√©s escaping the consequences of the Russian Civil War who would be joined, after 1933, by large numbers of German refugees forced to leave their homeland by Nazi race policies. There were international businessmen driven by conventional commercial and colonialist motives. All the time, there was a Chinese nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek keen to re-assert control over Shanghai. The creation by the government of the \\"Greater Shanghai\\" municipality on 14 July 1927, covering 828,000 hectares, had been a first step in that direction, even though it had been necessary to exclude from it the territory of the foreign concessions. In 1930 Shanghai was the focus of an on-going power struggle between the Chinese authorities and international business, backed by the \\"great powers\\", America, Britain, France and, increasingly, Japan. During the first half of 1930, Rudolf Hamburger responded to a job advertisement placed in a local Berlin newspaper by the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC). His application was successful and in July 1930, armed with a contract to work as an architect with the SMC, he emigrated with his wife to Shanghai. Long distance travel was typically undertaken by sea during this period, but the Hamburgers travelled by train via Moscow and across Siberia to Manchuria, where they switched to a ship for the final part of the journey. One source indicates that this slightly unconventional route was chosen in order to save money, since the SMC had refused to pay their travel expenses. Shortly before they left Berlin Ursula's parents organised a dinner party to which they invited Hellmut Wilhelm, the son of a celebrated (but recently deceased) \\"China expert\\". Wilhelm was able to brief them on some of the basics of living and working in China. It is nevertheless more than possible that the contemporary social and political realities of the situation in Shanghai, the extent to which the city had become a cultural melting pot, and indeed the way in which it had become a magnet for international espionage, only became apparent to the couple once they arrived in their new home-city. = Architect = Shanghai was riding a construction boom in which Rudolf Hamburger was able to participate fully. He found his SMC employment better paid than his private work, and he found that his monthly salary was 50 Taels higher than that of other architects employed by the Public Works Department. This was explained as compensation for the fact that he had been obliged to pay his own travel costs for the passage to China. However, when in April 1933 he opted to extend his contract, the differential was maintained although the differing treatment of those inter-continental travel costs had by that time been more than expunged. The renewed contract kicked in in August 1933 after which Hamburger was the second-best architect employed by the council. Only C.H.Stableford, his department head, was paid more. This, according to his wife, may have reflected the international reputation of modernist German architecture at the time. (Most of his colleagues in the architecture department were from England.) Hamburger's own approach was strongly influenced by his old teacher, Hans Poelzig. In Shanghai, Rudolf Hamburger produced four large buildings and several smaller ones. There were also a very large number of interior designs and examples of furniture design. The interiors were in part produced by the firm he set up and ran in parallel with his work for the council, \\"The Modern Home\\". In addition to the buildings for which he is known to have been directly responsible, scholars detect Hamburger's influence in other contemporary developments, such as the Chengdu Road police station. His first major building, which he was permitted to work \\"quite independently\\", was a nine- storey apartment block to accommodated 70 nurses. It has been described as \\"probably the first modern building in Shanghai\\". It was built by the SMC for the \\"Country Hospital\\", itself housed in a simple \\"classical\\" building opened in 1926 and designed by the young Hungarian L√°szl√≥ Hudec. The block occupied a dominating site directly beside the main road, which it shielded from the less visually challenging hospital building itself. Imaginative design features compensated for the essentially rectangular shape of the building. The high water table and the relatively soft soil meant that the block had to be constructed on 680 wooden piles, each approximately 20 meters long. Reinforced concrete beams were used to distribute the weight of the building's frame structure. The apartments were finished to a high standard, with radiators and insect nets for the windows. The \\"Victoria Nurse Home\\" opened on 23 October 1933 and was widely praised both by senior medical personnel and in the press. Hamburger's second major Shanghai commission was his secondary girls' school in the Singapore Road, designed for approximately 500 pupils. The building was again close to a main road, and the layout in relation to the adjacent road junction meant that a simple rectangular floor plan could not be specified. The two ends of the block featured rounded \\"semi-tower\\" shapes, and alongside the main three-storey classroom block there was a long low \\"pavilion\\" for the housemaster's accommodation. The courtyard incorporated a waiting area for the \\"rickshaw coolies\\" taking the young ladies to and from school. As with all his designs, the school was planned with huge attention to detail and great thought for function. It was a showpiece for modern ideas concerning light, air, sun and ventilation. Hamburger's third major commission, the vast cruciform Ward Road Jail complex, was an entirely different proposition, meeting an entirely different set of requirements and challenges, but Hamburger's imagination and attention to detail, along with his exploitation of modern knowledge and materials, were again on display. = Expat society = By 1930 the number of German nationals in Shanghai had reached perhaps 950. (There were thought to be approximately 4,000 Germans in the whole country.) Rudolf and Ursula became part of the German expatriate community, with links to the consulate and the more important mercantile families. With a construction boom underway, there was also an international network of architects and city planners into which Rudolf Hamburger was quickly integrated. For any German architect it was not unhelpful that Shen Yi, the young director of the city's Public Works Department and the man who had prepared the City Plan Framework (\\"stadtplanerische Konzeption\\") for Greater Shanghai, had received his doctorate at Dresden. A third social grouping, possibly more loosely interconnected than the first two, to which the Hamburgers were drawn was that of the leftwing political activists, Comintern members and other foreigners involved with the intelligence services of the various foreign governments interested in the city. The couple fitted well enough into the expatriate communities, though they received regular confirmation that their leftwing political beliefs were out of line with the mainstream both for the German-speaking business community and with the international architects. One aspect of local custom that troubled then was the extent of gift-giving, whether involving simple cash payments or vast food hampers at Christmas time. Letters home suggest they had trouble deciding what counted as friendliness and what counted as corruption, though Rudolf's architect colleagues were happy to confirm that it was simply a pleasing aspect of normal custom. One expatriate with whom the Hamburgers would have been able to discuss politics without inhibition was the Missouri-born journalist-author Agnes Smedley. The Hamburgers first met Smedley on 7 November 1930, which, as they would all have known very well, was the anniversary of the October Revolution. Smedley had lived in Berlin during the 1920s, mastering German and working as a campaigning journalist committed to equal rights for women and liberation for India. She had travelled to China from Berlin by train, via Moscow, setting off in December 1928 and ending up in Shanghai in May 1929. Here she joined up with a circle of German communists with whom she worked, though she herself never became a party member. Till the end of 1931 she worked as a correspondent for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. In the early part of 1932, the worsening political climate in Germany and complaints lodged with the German consul in Shanghai by Chinese nationalists led the Frankfurter Allgemeine to dispense with her services. Agnes Smedley became involved with Richard Sorge during 1930. Sorge was a co- ordinator for Soviet Intelligence who had arrived in Shanghai at the start of 1930. Sorge left Shanghai at the end of 1932 and it is thought that he and Smedley never saw one another again. Ursula Hamburger and Agnes Smedley started seeing each other every day soon after meeting in November 1930, and Ursula started helping Smedley with her work. They also went to the cinema together and toured the local canals in a house-boat. It was in Smedley's apartment that the Hamburgers met the spy-sociologist Chen Hansheng who regaled them with information about the student movements in Beijing and Nanjing. The Hamburgers and the Chens became frequent visitors to one anothers' homes. Chen had already met Urusla's father, probably when studying for his doctorate (1927) in Berlin. In 1931 Ursula took a share in a language school that Chen's wife, Gu Shuxing opened in Shanghai. Rudolf Hamburger served as an architectural consultant on the project. However, Gu Shuxing refused to pay the usual bribes and the language school was closed down after a few days. Early in summer of 1935, the Chens were forced to flee the city, making their way in a disguise organised by Agnes Smedley to the ship that would take them to relative safety. Rudolf Hamburger would meet up with Chen Hansheng one last time, half a lifetime later, visiting Beijing as an East German tourist in 1964. = Recruitment (Ursula) = In November 1930 Agnes Smedley arranged a meeting between Ursula Hamburger and Richard Sorge. Sorge was working for Soviet intelligence (GRU) in Shanghai while pretending to be living from his work as a journalist. At the time she was also being courted by Comintern which seems to have been operating a rival or complementary operation in Shanghai, also directed from Moscow. In the end, Ursula agreed to work for the group of intelligence activists around Sorge without \\"breaking her head\\" over the identity of the precise agency that employed her. Initially, her role was essentially passive, and simply involved making the couple's apartment available for weekly conspiratorial meetings. The cover story used was that the visitors were her Mandarin language teachers. Sometimes weapons or printed material was hidden in the apartment, unbeknown to Rudolf. It was only when a Chinese comrade had to be hidden in the apartment that Rudolf was made privy to what was going on. Rudolf Hamburger's involvement seems to have evolved more on a step by step basis. A member of the Polish Communist Party, known by his code name as \\"John\\", was working in a shop alongside the North-Szechuan Road, undertaking photographic jobs for the group around Sorge. The shop and its dark room became a secret meeting place and a secret meeting point for couriers. Sorge's deputy, Karl Rimm from Latvia, arrived in Shagnhai during 1931, using the cover name \\"Klaas Selmann\\", and participated in activities at the photography shop. During the final part of 1931 Rudolf Hamburger used his architectural training to plan an extensive refurbishment for the premises. At the end of January 1932, Japanese war ships landed troops in Shanghai. That was followed by an attack of the Chinese quarter of Zhabei, which caused many civilian casualties. Rudolf and Ursula Hamburger worked hard demonstrating solidarity with the Chinese population. It was an extremely active time for the group around Richard Sorge. Ursula became more and more involved in \\"basic research\\". A succession of visits to hospitals and district police stations were designed to create a favourable impression of the Communist Party leadership in Moscow among the Chinese population. Rudolf Hamburger engaged actively in this work. = Friend in need = Alongside his work as an employee of the SMC) city planning office, in 1932 Rudolf Hamburger opened his own company, working on interior design and construction, called \\"The Modern Home\\" (TMC). By the start of 1933, the firm was faced with a growing backlog of orders. Already Richard Paulick, Rudolf Hamburger's friend from their student days, had been studying emigration options. In January 1933 the Nazis took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship, built on the twin populist pillars of hope and hatred. On April 1, 1933, the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses was observed across Germany. Only six days later, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed, banning Jews from government jobs. Richard Paulick was Jewish. The Hitler take-over injected Paulick's emigration planning with a sudden urgency. In Dessau, where he lived and worked, he felt acutely threatened by the gangs of Nazi thugs. Rudolf Hamburger's invitation came at the right time. In Shanghai it was still possible to arrive and work without any special visa, simply with a valid passport. Richard Paulick caught the train to Venice and on 8 May 1933 embarked on board the SS Conte Rosso, arriving in Shanghai on 2 June 1933. He started work with \\"The Modern Home\\" on 6 June 1933. = Maik = The Hamburgers' first child, Maik Hamburger was born in Shanghai in February 1931. Till now the Hamburgers had been living in rented accommodation, but they now acquired a house of their own, moving into a large terraced property at Avenue Joffre 1676, in a notably verdant part of the French Concession in April 1931. Hamburger organised a new facade along with characteristically colourful and comprehensive renovation of the interior. Visitors were impressed, which led to a series of further \\"dwelling house\\" commissions from members of the \\"expat community\\". Maik later became a German Shakespeare scholar. In April 1933 Maik was sent to live with Rudolf Hamburger's parents (now relocating from Germany to Czechoslovakia) when Ursula was sent to Moscow. There had been a concern that if baby Michael had accompanied her to Moscow he might inadvertently have blown her cover later by blurting out words of Russian. = Ursula becomes 'Sonja' = Richard Sorge was recalled to Moscow in December 1932 and drew the attention of his intelligence chiefs to his talented young recruit, Ursula Hamburger. In May 1933 Ursula was invited to Moscow for a training period lasting at least half a year. She was given the cover name \\"Sonja\\", and received appropriate political and technical schooling. After almost a year, in April 1934 she returned to Shanghai accompanied by her new handler, Johann Patra (cover name \\"Ernst\\"), and the two of them then continued on to Mukden (today known as Shenyang) where they had been sent by Moscow. Maik, now aged three, was returned from Europe and went to live with his mother in Mukden. Rudolf Hamburger remained in Shanghai. The impact of fascist government policies in Germany and Japanese aggression drove him ever more uncompromisingly towards Communism. In May 1934 he began to undertake small \\"services\\" for his wife and Johann Patra in connection with their work for the GRU. However, it is clear that at this point his contribution was provided in terms of support for his wife rather than as an intelligence agent on his own account. Ursula Hamburger was providing a communications link to Moscow for Chinese partisan groups engaged in fighting the Japanese occupation of Manchuria. While she was in Mukden Rudolf Hamburger visited his wife two times, delivering spare parts for a radio transmitter. In April 1935 Ursula had to leave Mukden in a hurry after one of her Chinese contacts was arrested and she faced the risk of betrayal. Her Moscow handlers sent her to Beijing where she lived in the home of the sinologoist Hellmut Wilhelm who was in Germany on home leave. They were approaching the anniversary of their arrival and Rudolf Hamburger was also due for home leave: travel costs for his entire family would be funded by his employer. He was also faced with having to decide whether to renew his contract with the SMC for a further five years. His existing contract would otherwise expire in April 1936. Taking account of accrued entitlement to leave, if he did not renew he would be able to leave at the end of 1935. Ursula's handlers had suggested that if she were to travel west she might consider doing so via Moscow in order to discuss her work. Rudolf (according to his wife's subsequently published autobiography) had by now become a convinced communist and was keen not to remain \\"politically inactive\\" for any longer: Ursula informed her Moscow handlers of this development. A poorly timed additional complication presented itself in August 1935 when Ursula decided she was definitely pregnant, not by Rudolf but by her intelligence contact, Johann Patra. Ursula's departure from China took place suddenly, following the arrest of a colleague in Shanghai. Rudolf agreed to stand by Ursula, at least till the birth of her child, despite the extramarital nature of her pregnancy. She had to break with Johann Patra. Moscow, fully briefed on Ursula's situation, now proposed a posting for the couple in Warsaw. For the GRU handlers, organising the documents necessary for a young middle-class architect and his family to move to Poland, and integrating them appropriately in Warsaw, would be far less of a challenge than arranging for the settlement of a single mother with two small children. In 1936 Rudolf and Ursula Hamburger moved to Warsaw. It would later transpire that in 1937 the Soviets awarded Ursula the Order of the Red Banner for her espionage work in China. Without ever wearing a uniform, she now held the rank of colonel in the Soviet military.  Warsaw  The return to Europe at the end of 1935 gave Rudolf Hamburger his first opportunity to stop off in Moscow and meet the leaders of the GRU, for which he had already worked in a succession of difficult situations, without having had direct contact with an intelligence handler. Ursula introduced him. Rudolf was in some ways disappointed: \\"My wish had been to take on independent [intelligence] work in the future, and to receive appropriate training for the purpose. This wish was not fulfilled, but I received promises.\\" (\\"Mein Wunsch war es gewesen, in Zukunft eine selbst√§ndige Arbeit zu √ºbernehmen und zu diesem Zweck vorher eine Ausbildung zu erhalten. Aber dieser Wunsch wurde mir nicht erf√ºllt, sondern f√ºr sp√§ter versprochen.\\"). The Hamburgers arrived in Warsaw in February 1936. Obtaining visas and permits on the bases of passports issued by the German consulate in Shanghai three years earlier proved a major challenge. Rudolf Hamburger visited the visa office in Warsaw almost on a daily basis for several weeks, and it was necessary to obtain agreement from his friend, the Polish architect Szymon Syrkus to act as a guarantor: after several months of effort, and more than forty visits by Rudolf, the officials finally issued the Hamburgers with twelve-month visas. Ursula's daughter by Johann Patra, Janina, was born in April 1936, soon after the couple's arrival in Warsaw. Rudolf Hamburger immediately acknowledged the baby as his own. The parents of Rudolf and Ursula were not told about the child's true paternity. Sources nevertheless suggest that by the time they arrived in Warsaw the Hamburgers' marriage had been \\"shakey\\" for some time. The Polish authorities were in a state of high anxiety about the international situation, anticipating trouble from the Soviet Union to the east and from Nazi Germany to the west. Polish partitions had a long history. High levels of domestic unemployment had also given rise to legal restrictions on the employment of foreigners. In order to address these difficulties Rudolf Hamburger traveled to Paris where he signed a contract to work as a foreign correspondent for the specialist journal L'Architecture d'aujourd'hui. He also signed a similar contract with a London based specialist architecture journal. His status as a foreign correspondent may have reduced the obstructiveness the couple encountered among officialdom when applying to extend their residence permits, and enabled them to lead a relatively conventional middle-class existence. In Warsaw the Hamburgers became friendly with Szymon Syrkus (1893‚Äì1964) and his wife Helena (1900‚Äì1982) who were both involved with the International Congresses of Modern Architecture. With the help of Syrkus, Rudolf Hamburger entered into a form of architectural partnership with a Warsaw architect called Spiwall. The partnership concentrated on residential houses and villas. Hamburger's residence permit did not permit him to earn money in Poland. Some sort of financial arrangement with Spiwall was nevertheless devised, and Hamburger did most of his partnership work from home. However, a succession of \\"conspiratively arranged\\" changes of address made it increasingly hard for Hamburger to work in the city. He did draw up plans for a substantial ten dwellings unit for his partner, and also found professional work in Krakow. Towards the end of 1937 the Hamburgers moved to Zakopane, a winter resort in the mountains near the Czechoslovak border, to the south of Krakow. Rudolf traveled to Warsaw only a couple of times each month. Otherwise, he spent the winter working at home on plans that could only be implemented with the Spring thaw. In 1937 the Hamburgers received a personal visit from Ursula's handler in Moscow, who was keen to evaluate the local situation for himself. During the summer of 1937, Ursula undertook a three-month training visit to Moscow. Stalin's purges against enemies of the regime were at their height. More than a thousand German political refugees from Nazism were among the many Muscovites identified as Trotskyites and spies: in many cases, they were summarily tried and shot. Ursula Hamburger was well aware of what was going on, but she herself never fell victim to Stalin's paranoia. Rudolf Hamburger subsequently wrote that his contribution to Soviet intelligence during the time in Poland was in effect restricted to the help he was able to give his wife. He involved himself in the installation of radio antennae and getting hold of components for radio receivers/transmitters, along with general repairs and maintenance. There was code compilation, reception and transmission, stand-by duty through the night \\"and more\\". On several occasions he insisted on transmitting his own messages to Moscow, asking when he would be able to come to Moscow for intelligence training in order to be able to undertake intelligence work on his own account. Disappointingly, replies received from Moscow were invariably dismissive, deferring, as it felt to Hamburger indefinitely, any closer working relationship between Rudolf Hamburger and Soviet intelligence. In June 1938 Moscow the Hamburgers' time in Warsaw came to an end. Ursula was called to Moscow for a three-month training: a new posting for her had already been decided upon. The children were sent to stay with Ursula's parents who since 1933 had been living in London, England as refugees from Nazi Germany. Rudolf spent the summer across the Atlantic, visiting his elder brother, Viktor who had been settled as a professor of Embryology at Washington University in St. Louis since 1935.  Vaud and recruitment (Rudolf) Ursula's next posting was to Switzerland. In September 1938 Rudolf and Ursula Hamburger moved to a small house in Caux (Vaud), a three-hour walk up into the mountains above Montreux. Shortly after their arrival in Switzerland the Hamburgers' German passports lapsed. Since they were both Jewish there was little prospect of easily renewing the documents, which left them effectively stateless. In order to avoid difficulties with the Swiss authorities, they surrendered their German citizenship. Through a middle-man who had connections with the League of Nations, at the other end of the lake, in Geneva, they acquired Honduras citizenship in return for an appropriate payment. In order for them to reside legally in Switzerland it was, in addition, also necessary for Rudolf Hamburger to transfer money regularly from Shanghai, via London, to Switzerland. He also continued to contribute material to the specialist architecture journals in Paris and London. It was, however, in Switzerland that Rudolf Hamburger finally concluded that the lifestyle his wife's espionage work was imposing on them was no longer tolerable. Finally, in the first part of 1939 Moscow agreed that Rudolf might undertake intelligence work with direct links to the service. On his own initiative, he spent two months in Paris attending a course on radio technology, although French was not one of his principal languages and there are indications that language difficulties reduced the usefulness of the course to him. When he got back to Switzerland the message came through that Moscow's first assignment for him involved a posting to China. Moscow had also communicated an instruction that before he left for China he and Ursula should formally divorce, which they did. The Hamburgers' divorce opened the way for Ursula to marry Len Beurton in February 1940. Aside from any romantic considerations, this may also have been part of a longer-term Soviet plan. Len Beurton was a Soviet agent. More importantly, he was born in Essex, England, and by marrying him Ursula was able to exchange her recently purchased Honduras passport for a British passport. A further indignity came with the news from Moscow that his GRU handler for his assignment was to be Johann Patra, Ursula's former handler and the biological father of Janina, the baby who was to grow up believing that her father was the man to whom her mother had been married when she was conceived and born, Rudolf Hamburger. Having finally been added to the GRU payroll, however, Rudolf Hamburger was determined to make light of the matter.  Return to China  On 20 April 1939 at Marseilles Rudolf Hamburger boarded the ship that would take him to Asia. His earlier China trips had used the overland route, and this was the first time he had made the journey by sea. Many of his fellow passengers were German-Jewish refugees, as he reported in a letter dated 25 April 1939 to his elder brother, Viktor. They were heading for \\"one of the few places left in the world still open to them, Shanghai, where they would join some 7,000 unemployed German co-religionists already there. They spoke not one word of English and were really in a pitiful state\\" (\\"An Bord befinden sich Mengen von Glaubensgenossen, die alle nach dem f√ºr sie einzigen noch offenen Platz in der Welt fahren, Shanghai ‚Äì um zu den 7.000, die schon dort sitzen ohne Arbeit noch einige mehr hinzuzuf√ºgen. Sie sprechen kein Wort englisch und sind √ºberhaupt recht armselige Gew√§chse\\"). Viktor Hamburger had been based in Missouri since 1935 but the third brother, Otto Hamburger (1907‚Äì1997), was now living in Shanghai. After the brothers' mother had died in 1937 their father had relocated to Shanghai and joined his youngest son. This meant that although Rudolf Hamburger still had no details on the intelligence assignments that he would be given in China, he did already know that he was on his way to a family reunion. The family, at this point, knew nothing of Rudolf's divorce, though they did know that the children were staying behind with Ursula in Switzerland. This time, however, the intended ultimate destination for Rudolf Hamburger was not Shanghai, where he planned to spend at most fourteen days before moving on further to the north. A Sino-English firm of building contractors which he knew well from the old days had offered him architectural work. Details had been a little hazy, but the offer had nevertheless appeared acceptable. From his letters it turns out that he did not sail directly from Marseilles to Shanghai, but disembarked at Singapore in order to obtain a visa for \\"Siam, Indochina and Java\\". He toured around, taking in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Phnom Penh and Saigon, and then in July 1939 took a passage on a coastal boat from Saigon to Shantou (Guangdong) from where he made his way on to Shanghai. He was still in Shanghai in November 1939, having stayed there \\"longer than intended, as a result of the war\\". He was finding some architectural work, but only for very modest residential accommodation. There was no return to the grand projects. There is a certain studied vagueness in the letter he sent his brother Viktor in November 1939, and it seems reasonable to infer that Soviet intelligence still had not found him anything important to do. During this time in Shanghai, he was living not with his brother but on his own in a small house. Most of the friends and colleagues he had known when he lived in Shanghai during the early 1930s were gone: those that remained were not the ones whose company he was inclined to seek out. Under the guidance of Johann Patra he stayed in his little house and occupied himself with the operation of radio transmitters and receivers, and on a rather \\"superficial\\" (\\"oberfl√§chlich\\") level, explosives procedure. (Patra himself lived elsewhere, in relative safety, with a rich Chinese family.)  An assignment at last  It seems to have been early in 1940 that Patra and Hamburger received instructions to find comrades in Shanghai who might be persuaded to work as \\"enlighteners\\", converting local people to Communism. However, the Chinese communists had left Shanghai in 1937 when, following months of bitter fighting, the city (apart from the International Settlement and the French Concession) had been placed under Japanese military occupation. Patra and Hamburger, therefore, decided to look for candidates in other cities. Through the wide circle of friends and acquaintances he had acquired during years in Shanghai, Hamburger had contacts with a doctor in with a German wife, living in Xi'an. He set out to find the doctor so as to be able to win him for the communist cause with a face-to-face talk. There were, at least on the map, at least two ways to get from Shanghai to Xi'an. There was a more or less direct cross-country route that involved a combination of buses and trains, but both Patra and Hamburger believed that this was unacceptably dangerous because of the war. The alternative route, approximately three times as long, involved travelling by ship to Hong Kong, from where it would be possible to take a flight to Chongqing, Chiang Kai-shek's wartime capital between 1937 and 1946. Hamburger intended then to follow a land route from Chongqing Xi'an. Although he had a large amount of luggage to take, Patra still insisted that Hamburger should travel with a radio transmitter-receiver so that they might stay in touch. The device was concealed inside a commercially available portable radio. In March 1940 Rudolf Hamburger traveled with his luggage to Hong Kong. Here he had problems with the English border officials because he was travelling on a Honduras passport., but after an involuntary stay of several hours he was able to catch a flight for Chongqing where the Chinese authorities found and confiscated his radio for inspection. He was able to collect it from them two days later. It was handed over without comment, leaving Hamburger none the wiser as to whether they had failed to spot the true nature of the device hidden in the radio, or they knew very well that it was an espionage-grade receiving-transmitting device and were now alerted that his further moves would need to be closely monitored. The involuntary stay in Chongqing was not without incident. He unexpectedly came across a German acquaintance and a rich Chinese woman whom he had known in Shanghai. Bizarrely, he also came across Agnes Smedley who, it seemed, was working on a book about the war. Hamburger found time to send a letter to his father in Shanghai. He wrote, \\"The air-raids are not so harmless as you thought. They were called off in the 'misty season', but now they are again expected and feared. Thousands are being spent on constructing air-raid shelters and using explosives to create shelters under the cliffs\\" (\\"Die air raids sind doch nicht so harmlos wie du glaubst. Sie waren in der misty season unterbrochen, aber sie werden jetzt wieder erwartet und gef√ºrchtet. Tausende wurden ausgegeben, um Unterst√§nde zu bauen und in den Felsen zu sprengen\\"). Hamburger now caught a flight from Chongqing to Chengdu. The final 500 or so miles to Xi'an he covered by bus. He left the radio device and other technical equipment with his acquaintances in Chongqing. In Xi'an he met his communist friend and a group of the friend's comrades. He convinced several to go to Manchuria in support of his political mission. They were first to come to Shanghai to \\"sign up\\" and then travel on to the north. Hamburger was also intending to make his new base in Manchuria. His work in Xi'an completed, he returned to Chongqing to collect his radio receiver-transmitter. He was keen to make contact with Patra back in Shanghai in order to be able to report on what he had achieved. The radio needed repairs, but he was able to purchase the necessary parts in a specialist parts. \\"Shortly after that I was arrested\\". The \\"blue-eyed naivete\\" Rudolf Hamburger repeatedly demonstrated during his first and last serious intelligence mission provide implicit support for the assessment of his strengths and weaknesses which the Soviet intelligence directorate had presumably carried out ten years earlier.  Arrest in the Chungking Hostel  The enforced transfer of the Chinese capital from Nanjing to Chongqing after 1937 led to a major influx of foreign journalists to the new capital. These and any other foreign visitors were encouraged to make their base in the so-called Chungking Hostel. Rudolf Hamburger was one who did just that. Japanese air raids took place only between April and September: winter mist made them impossible during winter months. In the summer there were raids most nights, and hotel guests hurried to shelter in a cave in the grounds which had been adapted as an air-raid shelter. During one of those summer nights, probably in April 1940, Rudolf Hamburger and two other suspects were arrested. The American journalist Emily Hahn was one of those who witnessed the arrest. She was sufficiently impressed to recall it in an autobiography: \\"He chewed up a paper and tried to swallow it. It had a code on it, exactly like the movies\\".Emily Hahn (1975): China to me. A partial Autobiography. Da Capo Press, New York (first edition 1944) His room was immediately searched. The radio transmitter-receiver and the accompanying kit of spare parts were found and confiscated. The two individuals arrested with him were both people with whom he had been seen conversing a few times: they were soon released. In Shanghai, Otto Hamburger received a message in \\"Ganoven-jargon\\", a semi-secret dialect/language: \\"H's Bruder als Sp√§her in Kittchen. Soll weggeputzt werden\\". Otto inferred that his brother Rudolf and been arrested and was in danger of being disappeared. He communicated the news to Rudolf's \\"communist friends\\" and the information was presumably passed through to Moscow. Members of the Hamburger family later believed that by passing on the message Otto had probably secured Rudolf's eventual release. Meanwhile, Otto also used his own contacts to try and secure Rudolf's release, invoking the help of a senior nationalist Chinese government official who was in Shanghai at the time whom the Hamburger brothers both knew well. The senior official sent off a telegramme to a colleague in Chongqing, vouching for Rudolf's good character. A few days later it was the helpful official who lost his job. The case of Rudolf Hamburger was evidently one that the government took seriously.  Detention  Hamburger was held in a wooden building that was attached to a police station in Chongqing for approximately three weeks. He was interrogated about who he was, who had sent him and what he was doing. No Chinese reports of his interrogations have been accessed, but recalling these events many years later he indicated strongly that he had given nothing away. After eight days the interrogation sessions resumed, now involving serious physical torture, but still Hamburger did not betray his comrades. Early in the morning, after approximately three weeks in the \\"wooden shack\\" at the police station, Hamburger was driven away in a large limousine to a formerly private estate in the countryside outside the city. The twelve room mansion had been commandeered during the war for use as an interrogation prison and was \\"home\\" to forty or fifty detainees. Apart from Hamburger, the inmates were all Chinese. Female detainees were kept across the yard in a separate building that had previously accommodated the household servants. From the front of the house, there was a fantastic view stretching thirty or forty kilometers across valleys and rivers. He was permitted to enjoy the view for fifteen minutes each day, through the two bars that had been placed across the window of the front room on the ground floor where he was taken for his \\"daily walk\\". Hamburger later described his incarceration in this manor house as relatively benign, though he also reported that all the detainees, including him, fell ill with Malaria. At six weekly intervals he was taken before an investigating magistrate, and each time he refused to testify he was returned to custody. Hamburger's Chinese imprisonment lasted for nine months, during much of which he shared his \\"cell\\" with a Chinese student identified as \\"Wong Pin Fong\\". His cell-mate had (he said) ended up in detention as the ringleader of an illegal street protest. The pressure on Hamburger under these circumstances was to keep his thoughts to himself, and to avoid reacting to his companion's constant questions about his own situation. Wong Pin Fong communicated his own unremarkable conclusions: \\"Foreigner ... in reality you can really only be a member of the American or Soviet secret service\\" (\\"... eigentlich kannst du nur zum amerikanischen oder sowjetischen Geheimdienst geh√∂ren\\"). With no prospect of freedom in sight, and every indication that he and his fellow detainees might remain where they were for many years until malaria and the increasingly sparse diet finished them off, Hamburger became ever more depressed.  Soviet intervention  General Chuikov arrived in the Chinese provisional capital in November 1940 as the youthful new Soviet military attache. The Russian empire had suffered military humiliation at the hand of the Japanese military in 1905, and with the 1937 invasion of China by Japan the Soviet leadership were quick to strengthen political ties and physical communications links with the nationalist Chinese. The outbreak of war in Europe increased Moscow's determination to minimise the dangers of Japanese aggression against the motherland from the east. A major complication was the attitude of the Communist Party of China under the leadership of Mao Zedong. Instead of joining the government to present a common front against the Empire of Japan, the Communist fighters saw the Japanese invasion as an opportunity to pursue their own goals in opposition to the government with renewed vigour. Relations between the government and the communists became so dreadful that in January 1941 Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Chinese government, found himself forced to invite Moscow to intervene as a mediator between the government and the communists. A the end of January 1941 Hamburger was taken for another of his six weekly encounters with the investigating magistrate. This time there were no questions. Instead, his interlocutors informed him that now they knew where he came from, and that he would shortly be released and sent back. In the words of his own later report of the matter, \\"the friends had intervened\\" (\\"Es war eine Intervention seitens der Freunde.\\").  Return to Moscow  In 1939 a regular direct flight connection had been established between Chongqing and Moscow. It was now possible to fly from one capital to the other in only five days. At the start of February 1941 Rudolf Hamburger took the flight to Moscow. He was now accommodated with others in a Dacha settlement a short distance outside Moscow. There are indications that the settlement was at Kuntsevo, where it is known that there was a training centre for potential intelligence operatives. During the early summer of 1941 he received extensive training, although according to his later reports the nature of it was uneven and the organisation of it often chaotic. Sometimes lecturers \\"came out from Moscow\\" But some of the most important lessons came from discussions with fellow students who, like Hamburger, had already had the benefit of a certain amount of experience in the field. By June 1941, with the German invasion imminent from the west, he was packing his bags again.  A new assignment  His destination, this time, was Turkey, from where he was to provide intelligence reports on developments in the Middle East. In order to address the potential limitations of travelling on his Honduras passport, he intended to travel by train to Vladivostok and from there, by sea, to Shanghai. From there he would be able to travel legally through India and Iran to Turkey without having to apply for a visa. This journey did not work out quite as planned, however, since on 22 June 1941, in breach of the non-aggression deal between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, German troops stormed across the frontier. After rapidly knocking out the Soviet Union, the German plan was to continue through to Iran and capture the oil fields. The Great Patriotic War became suddenly urgent and there were no more ships sailing from Vladivostok to Shanghai. Hamburger was summoned back to Moscow. His handlers did not cancel his assignment, however. Since the original itinerary was impossible because of the absence of a sea passage from the est of the country to Shanghai, and alternative plan was devised whereby the various visa stamps would be added in his Honduras passport by Soviet intelligence, providing a forged trail indicating that he had traveled via Shanghai and India to Tehran. Then, during the Autumn of 1941, he drove across by the land route via Tbilisi in Georgia and through Armenia to Tabriz near the border in northern Iran. That meant that regardless of his passport stamps, he had to this point made the entire overland journey through territory controlled by the Soviet Union. By October 1941 he had reached Tehran. Hamburger was keen to continue to Turkey as instructed, but with international tensions rising in the area the Turkish authorities reacted negatively to his Honduras passport, and he encountered difficulty obtaining a visa. Meanwhile, the situation in Iran had changed dramatically since the early summer, and the country had gained in strategic importance with regard tho the war. In August 1941, the British and the Soviets invaded and occupied Iran by a massive air, land, and naval assault. There was a concern that the shah was insufficiently anti-German and in September 1941 he had been persuaded to abdicate in favour of his son. The German invasion of the Soviet Union three months earlier had made the United States into an unlikely backer of Stalin's Soviet Union, and the Americans now raced to create a robust transport infrastructure which by 1942 had become the route by which approximately a third of all the overseas supplies to the Soviet Union were delivered. In 1943 1.6 million tons of equipment and food were delivered to the Soviet Union through Iran. The hub of the road and rail route from the sea ports to the Soviet border was Tehran. At some stage, presumably while he was still trying to arrange a visa for Turkey, Hamburger's Moscow handlers concluded that he would be more usefully deployed sending reports from Tehran, and he received instructions to stay there.  Not Turkey but Iran  For Stalin the large US military presence that appeared in Iran towards the end of 1941 was a necessary evil, but it was not something that could be viewed with total equanimity. Monitoring of developments on the ground by means of a network of unobtrusive informants, employing agents from third countries, became an important link in the information gathering chain. The US military were naturally aware that various agencies were present on the ground, attempting to fathom their \\"true\\" motives. Rudolf Hamburger sought out contacts among the British and American officers and soon developed friendships with them, in pursuit of his information-gathering mission on behalf of his handlers. He used to pass on his findings in face-to-face GRU middlemen stationed at the Soviet embassy in Tehran. This modality was clearly not without its risks, and during 1942 Moscow provided him with a radio receiver-transmitter, instructing him to use it to create a direct reporting link. In order to provide a legal basis for his presence in the city, in January 1942 he took a job as an architect, working for the Finance Ministry in Tehran. His first project was do design and build a new building for the ministry. Draft pans had been prepared by February. His project team already included six local draftsmen. Another European was hired to supervise the project, though Hamburger himself was also closely involved in co-ordination with the various parts of the ministry, His boss was a doctor-engineer who had trained in Germany who \\"came from one of the leading families in the land\\". The language used in the office was French. There was also an Austrian architect involved with whom he was able to discuss some of the more technical challenges of the project. Meanwhile, letters to his brother and father, now both in Missouri, indicate that his health was improving. The altitude of Tehran and the dry air led to a reduction in the frequency of his malarial attacks. His family letters avoided political issues in order to avoid upsetting any censors through whose hands they might pass. (During the war it was impossible to exchange letters with his younger brother in Shanghai.) In May 1942 the ministry cut the budget for new buildings in Tehran due to the pressures of war. This held up work on the new ministry building on which Hamburger was working. Also, steel production was being diverted to war production which meant that there was not enough steel for all the reinforced concrete that the plans called for. Along with the ministry work, he also found private clients, though he became frustrated by the local builders who liked to substitute their own spontaneous ideas for the plans provided to them. There is a complaint in one of his letters that in Iran architects do not enjoy a very high status.  Trapped  Early in 1943 an Iranian friend who worked as a simultaneous translator for one of the heads of the American transport and logistics operation invited Hamburger to start working as an \\"informal collaborator\\" (informant). Money was offered. The decisive conversation took place in the friend's apartment. Around two weeks later Hamburger found himself arrested by American military police. At his first interrogation session he realised that his conversation in his friend's apartment had been recorded, and that the recording had come into the possession of his interrogators. Hamburger calculated that there was little on that tape that might have incriminated him, and his interrogators evidently agreed. In order to find some more damning evidence the Americans then broke into the little house where Hamburger was living on his own. They gave no evidence of having found whatever it was they were looking for. They did not find the heavy radio receiver-transmitter he had been given by his Soviet handlers, which was kept in an aluminium container the size of a small suitcase, and which was hung casually with a lot of knitting up a disused chimney. Around the same time Hamburger came across an English military officer in Tehran for whom he had worked in Shanghai ten years earlier. The man had then been working for the British Colonial Police in the Shanghai International Settlement and had been involved in the construction of a new jail which Hamburger had been building. It seemed reasonable to assume that the man was fully aware of the circumstances surrounding Hamburger's arrest two years before in Chongqing. From that it followed that Hamburger's unmasking in Tehran as a Soviet agent could only be a matter of time. The fact that a tape recording of an unsuccessful attempt to recruit him as an informant for another agency indicated that he must already be under observation by the Americans and their British allies. Rudolf Hamburger was now detained and taken to a small military camp just outside the city. Meanwhile his Honduras passport taken away for further scrutiny. The authorities established that stamps placed in it by passport officers in three British colonial - Bombay, Singapore and Suez - could not be matched to any corresponding records in the files of the checkpoints involved. Very quickly the authorities determined that the passport stamps could only have been entered by the Soviet Union's Main Intelligence Directorate. No further trial was considered necessary. By now it was August 1943. His British captors gave him a couple of days to leave the country and, helpfully, delivered him to the Soviet embassy.  Asylum?  Although it might be thought that his contribution to Soviet intelligence had been less than stellar since 1930, and the GRU had given little reason to believe that they valued his services very highly, Rudolf Hamburger had demonstrated a remarkable degree of persistence, commitment and loyalty over the years. Forced to leave Tehran at short notice he welcomed the opportunity to return to Moscow in order to be able to apply for political asylum. However, two days after his arrival in the Soviet capital had was accused of having worked for US intelligence against the interests of the Soviet Union and taken into investigatory detention. Over the next few weeks he faced a series of interrogation sessions, which took place at night and each lasted several hours. At dawn he would be returned to his cell. He tried to demonstrate his innocence, but the investigators came back with more accusations that he had worked for \\"other\\" intelligence services. Many years later the East German homeland security service (MfS) came to hold an information report from the Soviets which included the conclusion \\"The circumstances of Hamburger's release from detention in Iran gave rise to the suspicion that he had been recruited by a foreign intelligence service\\" (\\"Die Umst√§nde der Entlassung Hamburgers aus der Haft in Iran erwecken Verdacht seiner Anwerbung durch einen ausl√§ndischen Geheimdienst\\"). His request for a lawyer was turned down without explanation. From Hamburger's point of view there was absolutely no evidence against him and nothing to justify his detention.  Sentencing  For slightly more than nine months, between August 1943 and April/May 1944, Rudolf Hamburger was held in investigatory detention in Moscow. He lost twenty kilos (45 pounds): he was badly affected physically and mentally. \\"For 24 hours you are kept awake, through hunger and stress. To be able to think of nothing and sleep. The food is dire ... hunger is a terrible torture\\" (\\"Vor Hunger und Aufregung m√∂chte man 24 Stunden schlafen. Schlafen und an nichts denken. Das Essen ist elend. (...) Hunger ist eine furchtbare Folter\\"). There was no trial, but he was sentenced to five years in a prison camp. The conviction was based on Article 58 of the Penal Code. A fellow inmate explained that this was the paragraph for \\"political criminals\\". However, Hamburger also became aware that his conviction carried an additional three letter tag that identified his as a \\"socially dangerous element\\".  Saratov labour camp (1944‚Äì1945)  After receiving his sentence Hamburger was placed on a train and transported to Saratov, a port on the Volga River upstream of Stalingrad (as it was known between 1925 and 1961), and 850 km to the south of Moscow. The labour camp, accommodating German prisoners of war, was on the edge of town. Later he reflected that entering the camp had sealed his status as a citizen sentenced according to laws, without the investigation necessary to prove guilt or innocence, sentenced in breach of basic human rights and without the right to any legal defence. Only \\"after Stalin's death did the secret of this thousandfold injustice become known. Since the 1930s the People's Commisariat for Internal Affairs has designated special three person committees, the so-called Special boards (OSO) with special powers. These OSOs condemned politically dangerous citizens without any court verdict ... The OSOs were abolished in 1953 after Stalin's death\\" (\\"Nach Stalins Tod wurde das Geheimnis dieses tausendfach ver√ºbten Unrechts bekannt. Seit den dreissiger Jahren hat das damalige Volkskommissariat f√ºr Innere Angelegenheiten Drei-Mann-Aussch√ºsse, sogenannte OSO, mit Sondervollmachten eingesetzt. Diese OSO verurteilten politisch gef√§hrliche B√ºrger ohne Gerichtsurteil. (...) Die OSO wurden 1953 nach Stalins Tod abgeschafft\\"). Although it was his first labour camp, Hamburger had been told by prisoners with whom he had been held in Moscow what to expect. His description reflects his architect's eye. \\"Here is how the camp looks: a barren bare barrack town. Barracks in rows, rank and file, and barracks at right angles, in a vast landscape on bare ground under an open sky. And that was how life ran, in straight lines and at right angles ... Must I describe a sleeping barrack? ... where a person is reduced to an anonymous little part of a larger whole that vegetates like a cow in a stall? At right angles to the long side walls, in pairs, sets of double-deck bunk beds ... arranged in a way that takes no account of the positions of the windows, due to the shortage of space, and therefore these are partially obstructed and only let in half of the light. In the long wide space down the middle of the hut is a long table constructed of unfinished timber, with long wooden benches the same length ... The table is used by the inmates for meals ... Behind the table is a big tiled stove\\". One thing he did not know was the Brigade Leader Nikolai was a \\"Stukatsch\\", introduced to notice and report on trifling misdemeanours. In the very early spring of 1945 Hamburger was removed from the prison camp and taken to a prison where he faced his first legal hearing (\\"a farce\\"), since his sentencing and he was charged with further misconduct. He was placed in a solitary cell (\\"for hard cases\\"). The prison governor informed him that a new ordinance had been promulgated to the effect that \\"Article 58 prisoners\\" should be kept apart from other prisoners. The cell was unheated and very cold. He began to distract himself with \\"architectural fantasies.\\" \\"If I stood up, then I could use the wooden spoon they gave me to scratch the ground plans of houses in the ice crystals forming on the walls, for houses in a dreamland for lucky people with a living room, somewhere for the books, a kitchen, bathroom and garden\\". The further misdsemeanours which had triggered his transfer from the camp to the prison in the first place had placed him not merely in breach of \\"Article 58\\" of the penal code, but also in breach of \\"Patagraph 10\\" of \\"Article 58\\". His aggravating conduct had involved an Americam illustrated magazine which he had been given at the camp by the secretary of a US officer. The American military were present in one part of the Saratov labour camp supervising the assembly of a chemicals factory which had been brought in as part of a \\"wartime relief\\" programme. Fellow camp inmates were produced to back-up the evidence of the \\"Stukatsch\\" brigade leader that Hamburger had been distributing anti-Soviet propaganda. Together with the routine badmouthing of the poor treatment, terrible food and the generally bad situation in the camp, Hamburger was therefore identified as an \\"enemy of the state\\". His sentence extended to eight years. Taking account of the two years already served, that made a total of ten years.  Karaganda labour camp (1945‚Äì1949)  In May 1945 Hamburger was taken to the Karaganda region, far to the east in Kazakhstan. He gained the impression that Karaganda was the main camp at the heart of a large network of labour camps covering an area of approximately 33,800 square kilometers. Some thirty kilometers from Karaganda, within the fence surrounding the camp where he was himself held there were the remains of a village called Dolinka (–î–æ–ª–∏–Ω–∫–∞) that had originally been founded by Volga Germans. The network of camps around Karanda had been created to support the operation of approximately fifty coal mines in the area. Rudolf Hamburger lived one of the former farmhouses in the old village. \\"We stepped through the front door. Involuntarily I lowered my head. A small whitewashed entrance lobby with a flagstone floor, and behind that a large parlour of about 17 square meters, where six narrow iron bedsteads stood against the walls. In the middle a wooden table with two benches, in the corner a tiled stove ... from the entrance lobby there was also an opening to a small room with two beds in it. .... Life in the farm house is decidedly more pleasant than in the barrack accommodation of a purpose-built labour camp\\". Unlike the camp where he had been held at Saratov, this time all the prisoners were designated as \\"Article 58 (political) prisoners\\". Hamburger's transfer to this camp was not a random event. It was the result of a targeted search by the camp commander for a construction specialist. He was set to work in a design office with other prisoners. \\"The building\\" containing the design office was constructed of dried mud bricks, the floor was of cement screed. Doors and windows were of rustic construction. You had to bend to enter the room over a high step. Beyond were two similarly sized rooms, containing a team of around eight engineers, estimators and draftsmen working at drawing boards and desks. In the room to the left were the building specialists, while the estimators had their workplaces in the room to the right. The work was restricted, as usual, to relatively simple projects such as small annexes and renovation projects for police stations, washing cabins or sleeping barracks for prison camps in the area. One project that moved away from the daily pattern was for an entrance house to a semi-wild area of parkland, suggesting that someone somewhere still had ambitions beyond basic survival. Hamburger put his heart and soul into the project, ending up with a design for a gatehouse of which he was very proud. It was a kind of gatehouse to be fashioned from wood. It drew admiration from colleagues, but was too expensive to be constructed.  Return to the Volga region (1949‚Äì1950)  After four years in the Kazakh Steppes, in May 1949 Hamburger was sent back to the Volga region for a \\"review trial\\". However, when he returned to the area near his \\"first camp\\", along the Volga basin, he was informed that he had been sent back simply for the correction of a procedural error. The accusation on the basis of which he was being held was not changed. However, prisoners were never returned to camps from which they had been removed, and he was sent to a prison camp a short distance to the north of Saratov. He was now set to work as one of approximately ten inmates in a drawing office belonging to a furniture factory. He was involved in making furniture. Some of his colleagues were design experts: others were graphic artists. The programme included office furniture and, on Hamburger's table, a bed-sit combination. The work was more stimulating than his work at Karaganda had been because he was able to see the projects through to the construction phase. Most of the camp inmates - men and women - were employed in the furniture factory itself, and Hamburger was an almost daily visitor to the factory, where he was able to check on the preparation of the timber pieces and recommend changes and improvements.  Camp Kama (1950)  After a year, around May 1950 Hamburger was moved again. His destination was not initially disclosed to him. He was taken north, to the Ural foothills and placed in a lumber camp near Solikamsk and the Kama River, where he was given responsibility for buildings maintenance. \\"I was too weak for forestry work. No work brigade would take me. A kindly fellow inmate, also employed in the buildings maintenance office, allocated me the work of drawing up plans and calculations. In a tiny room of one of the barrack blocks, lit by a window the size of a show box, I sat on my own feeling imprisoned twice over\\". In the limber camp he became overcome by depression and frustration that he still had many more years of imprisonment to look forward to: \\"It all appalls me. The insignificant tasks I am set, which I have to perform, rough tables with the two scratched either side, the ceilings, the walls gawking at me in dumb stupidity, the whole as a window with its glimpse of the yard, barracks and barbed wire to prevent me from forgetting where I am, and the hunger ... the hunger and the bugs. What do I have to look forward to, if I do survive through to freedom, starved, bitten by beasts, grey-haired, a creature alienated from life and work?\\"  Kuybyshev (1950)  However, at this point, his persistent assertions that his sentence was unjust appeared to meet with a small measure of success. At some point during the middle part of 1950 he was sent to a special camp, built on the site of a vast national infrastructure construction site for power stations, dams, canals and reservoirs. Prisoners here were required to prove their value, but in return, their time at this \\"special camp\\" was said to count for twice the actual period in terms of expunging outstanding years of sentence. In Rudolf Hamburger's case, that meant that his remaining three-year sentence would apparently be reduced to one and a half years when he arrived at Kuybyshev (since 1991 again identified officially by its pre-1935 name as Samara). He was sent to a labour camp near an abandoned city. \\"No smoke came out of the chimneys, no human noise, no barking dogs. The city had been evacuated some months earlier. Soon the valley, which had nurtured a vibrant city, would be inundated in a giant flood so as to provide hydro-electric power for new industries and thousands of new homes. A bold and awesome project. So there we were, lined up like a small army of construction workers, technicians and engineers, all prisoners who if we keep up the momentum of the project, will soon be able to welcome our freedom\\". In 1950 the Soviet government decided to build what would become at the time, the largest hydro- electric plant in the world. The entire facility came on stream in 1957. It was here that Rudolf Hamburger worked on the conversion of an existing building on the edge of the city to create the offices of an important General. He prepared the plans for the furniture, the lighting and the overall interior design. However, his time at the special camp had lasted only six months when a diligent official noticed that foreigners were not permitted at this site. Nevertheless, due to the regulations governing the \\"special camp\\", by this time he had expunged twelve months of his outstanding sentence in just six months.  UsolLag (1951‚Äì1952)  There followed a \\"return to the dreaded Urals\\" as Hamburger was sent to the \\"UsoLag\\" lumber camp. Through a combination of his physical stature and the weakened condition of his body after years in the labour camp system, he was unable to cope with the physical demands of forestry work. He was transferred to the Power Plant Brigade. Here he met up with around twenty German prisoners who had all found themselves classified as \\"Article 58 prisoners\\" and sentenced to ten years in the camps. Together they were required to use handsaws to chop up the wood and fuel the wood-burning power generators. One of his fellow prisoners was the writer Heinrich Alexander Stoll who became a long-standing friend. Stoll had been sentenced (without trial) to a ten year term in Siberia in 1950 following a complicated series of events involving espionage allegations and political activism in the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic. Hamburger was able to supplement his basic labour camp wage by painting little water colour drawings as picture postcards for fellow inmates. This was a source of supplementary income that he had also, on occasion, been able to use at previous camps.  The labour camp system  Between 1929 and 1953 the Soviet labour camps consisted of 476 complexes, distributed across the entire western part of the Soviet Union. Lavrentiy Beria became responsible for the camp network in 1939. He launched a major drive to organise the camps according to a national set of precepts and structures, consciously prioritising economic aspects of the system. For Stalin the labour camps were a central pillar of the Soviet economy. When Beria took over, camp commanders received the order to \\"keep more inmates alive and exploit them more efficiently\\". Nevertheless, it is abundantly clear from Rudolf Hamburger's experiences and from other sources that there were always enormous differences from camp to camp. In the words of Tatiana Okunevskaya, a Moscow-born actress who was also a long-term camp prisoner, \\"each camp was its own world, its own city in its own territory, and each camp had its own characterTatiana Okunevskaya as quoted by Anne Applebaum in Gulag: A History (Doubleday, , 2003) page 211 as quoted by Eduard K√∂gel During his final years Stalin became ever more driven by paranoid delusions of counter-revolutionary threats, and he reacted appropriately against different ethnic groupings, rumoured rivals from within the party and \\"intellectuals\\". So it is not surprising to find the dictator stating in 1952 that \\"every Jew is a nationalist and an agent of the American security services.Josef Stalin as quoted by Anne Applebaum, in Gulag: A History (Doubleday, , 2003) page 498 as quoted by Eduard K√∂gel After Stalin died in March 1953, Beria made his own bid for national leadership. That same month he made a proposal that 90% of the more than two million labour camp inmates, who could not be convicted of any serious crime, should be set free. As a national economic resource the network of labour camps was hopelessly inefficient. In economic terms his radical proposal was set in motion, but within the party leadership Beria was seen to pose a threat. In June 1953 Nikita Khrushchev, with powerful backing from sections of the army, had Beria arrested. He was executed on 23 December 1953. The programme of labour camp releases that he had set in motion continued, however.  Signs of life from the camps  Rudolf Hamburger had been arrested less than two years before the end of the war. After war ended his brother Viktor, living in MIssouri, and his ex-wife, who till 1949 lived in an Oxfordshire village, began to receive occasional reports about him via fellow internees who had emerged from the Soviet labour camps. Rudolf Hamburger was not permitted to send or receive letters. In July 1947 Viktor received a letter from a Polish woman who reported that Rudolf was alive and \\"working as an engineer\\".Postcard dated 30 June 1947 from Maria Jablonska to Viktor Hamburger, as quoted by Eduard K√∂gel His ex-wife, Ursula, wrote to Viktor in August 1947 that she had also received a letter from Poland: \\"He is a prisoner for five years, but works in his profession. (...) I do not know when the five years will be over. She has been in the same camp with him from July 1945 to December 1946\\". At this time Hamburger himself was being held at Karaganda in Kazakhstan, and the letters from Poland evidently predated his second sentencing in May 1949. In October 1953 the US embassy in Bonn received a letter from a man called Josef Dauns who was former inmate of the Soviet labour camps. He was trying to contact Rudolf's brother, Viktor, in Missouri. He reported on his meeting with Rudolf Hamburger at Camp Kama in 1950. The letter was translated into English, presumably by embassy staff, and the translation passed to the State Department in Washington DC. In November 1953 a deputy director at the State Department wrote to Viktor Hamburger in St.Louis. The letter asked, in passing, if Rudolf Hamburger was a US citizen and if this could be evidenced. If he was and it could, the State Department would approach the Soviet government with an appeal to release Rudolf Hamburger. In February 1954 Josef Dauns sent another letter, this time directly to Viktor Hamburger, in which he spelled out in greater detail the circumstances of his meeting with Rudolf Hamburger. They had met early in 1951 at Camp Kama in the North Urals. Dauns wrote that Hamburger had been sentenced to 25 years of hard labour for espionage. It is unclear where the notion of a 25 year sentence - for which there is no other known source - came from.  Semi-freedom in Soviet internal exile (1952‚Äì1955)  It was probably towards the end of 1952 or early in 1953, after nine and a half years in Soviet custody, that Rudolf Hamburger was released. \\"Release\\" was relative, however. He was permitted to name the place, within the Soviet Union, to which he wished to be released. He had been given no advanced notice of this development and had to think very fast. Simply leaving the country was not an available option. The Soviet Union's great cities were also off limits. \\"Every other detainee knew, without a map, where he wanted to go. Home. I expressed the same wish, but it was made clear that this would involve a 'number of formalities'\\". He was stateless, he was not a prisoner of war and he was not even a former party member. Any attempt to organise permission to leave the country would take time, and in the meantime, he \\"had to live somewhere.\\" On his release Hamburger moved to a small Ukrainian city where he lodged with a farmer's wife identified as \\"Galja\\". It can be inferred that the city was Millerovo, which today is part of Russia, and an important railway junction along the route between Rostov- on-Don and Moscow, close to the frontier dividing Russia from Ukraine. He was employed there in the Buildings Department of the Ministry of Food. Later in 1953 he was moved to Kamensk, 80 km (50 miles) to the south along the main railway line towards Rostov, where he was installed as a construction site manager for the Ministry of Coal. Later, in April 1955, the ministry appointed him to a position as an architect. In 1957, by which time he had returned to the German Democratic Republic, he published a memoir of his time at Kamensk in a volume published to celebrate the \\"40th Anniversary Celebration of the Great October Revolution\\". His contribution appeared with others from East German architects who had visited the Soviet Union only as tourists. Naturally there was no question of Hamburger's piece expressly mentioning his labour camp experience, but his contribution was set apart from the others by some interesting insights and nuances. He did refer to his experiences of the vast industrial buildings erected in the Donets basin and implicitly referred back to some of the things he had seen as a prisoner. He wrote about the dreadful work conditions when ambient temperatures fell below -30 ¬∞C, and expressed fulsome respect for the women's brigades used in the earthworks.  Contacts in the German Democratic Republic  The map had changed in 1945. What had been the eastern third of the country, including Silesia where Rudolf Hamburger had grown up, had been subjected to industrial scale ethnic cleansing and then transferred to Poland, compensating for the eastern part of Poland which now became part of the Soviet Union. The middle third of Germany was administered between 1945 and 1949 as the Soviet occupation zone and then relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Dresden where he had been a student was now in East Germany and it was to East Germany that his ex-wife had hastily relocated from her Oxfordshire village home at the end of 1949 when she thought she was about to be arrested by British intelligence. Following his release from his last labour camp in 1952/53 Rudolf Hamburger tried to re-establish contact with his old friends and colleagues in what was now the German Democratic Republic. He was able to enter into a correspondence with his ex-wife, but further contact outside the Soviet Union was not so easy. Former political prisoners were not permitted to contact friends and relatives outside the Soviet Union, and his correspondence was naturally monitored. After his return to East Germany in 1955 the Ministry for State Security applied to their Soviet colleagues for a report on Hamburger in connection with his application for membership of East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED). The report came back, \\"When he was living in the Rostov area as a released prisoner, Hamburger attempted illegally to contact living relatives and acquaintances living in the USA, England and East Germany. At the same time he was in regular contact by letter with his wife, Kutschinskaja alias Berton Ursula (sic), who resides in the East German sector of Berlin\\".  Homecoming  In February 1954, still in Kamensk, Rudolf Hamburger managed to get a letter through to Richard Paulick who had returned to East Berlin from Shanghai in 1949. Eighteen months earlier, in August/September 1952, the two former Poelzig student Richard Paulick and Kurt Liebknecht had travelled as part of a delegation of East German architects undertaking a round trip of the Soviet Union. The trip had taken them to Stalingrad, Rostov and the Black Sea resort of Sochi. That meant they had been n the region where Rudolf Hamburger was living. At some stage Rudolf Hamburg picked up a copy of Pravda and read about the East German architects' visit. The article mentioned that Paulick was part of the delegation, indicating that he had now returned from China to the German Democratic Republic. This is what had prompted Hamburger's attempts, pursued with characteristic doggedness, to contact his old friend. It appears from surviving correspondence that Paulick's further letters to Hamburger while he was still in Kamensk were delivered as additions to letters from Ursula, his ex-wife, which seems to have increased the probability of delivery. There was a large amount of paper work to be organised in East Germany, which may have included restitution of his German nationality which had lapsed while he was in Switzerland in 1939. Between them Richard Paulick and Ursula Beurton (as she was, by this time, formally known) arranged Rudolf Hamburger's home-coming to the German Democratic Republic. Surviving correspondence indicates that Paulick and Hamburger both thought he would be able to return to East Germany, possibly via Moscow, in the early summer of 1954, but in the end it was only in July 1955 that he was back in East Germany. Rudolf Hamburger did not fit neatly into any of the \\"usual categories\\". The Soviets did not imprison him as a prisoner of war. He had never actually been a member of the Communist Party. He was not one of those who had emigrated as a political refugee directly from Nazi Germany to Moscow in the 1930s. The unexpected delay may very well have resulted from nothing more significant that the inability of the responsible bureaucrats to decide how to classify him.  German Democratic Republic  On his arrival in East Germany Hamburger lived, from 5 July 1955, as a tenant at the Berlin apartment of his friend Richard Paulick. He remained there only for a couple of weeks. By the middle of August he had taken a job as a Chief Architect with the Dresden city authorities. He immediately applied for membership of the ruling Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). That proved anything but easy to process, however. He needed to find two sponsors for his party membership and the Ministry for State Security needed to investigate him to make sure he did not have any guilty secrets in his history. There is no sign that Hamburger was ever anything other than firmly opposed to Nazism. However, he had lived outside Germany since 1930, and much of his more exotic international travel had been undertaken on behalf of Soviet intelligence: most of the \\"usual sources\\" on political involvement between 1930 and 1955 were not applicable or not accessible, even to East German state agencies. Initially he tried to obtain sponsorship for party membership from friends and former fellow students of architecture who had known him since they studied together in Berlin in the 1920s, but in the end it was his ex-wife (by now known most frequently as \\"Ursula Beurton\\" or by the pseudonym under which she was reinventing herself as an author, \\"Ruth Werner\\") whose information persuaded the authorities to progress his party membership application. Rudolf Hamburger received his card as a \\"candidate for party membership\\" in March 1956. In September 1956 the 135th meeting of the \\"Central Party Control Commission\\" dealt with review and verification of 19 comrades recently returned from the Soviet Union whose had been listed as candidate party members. For 18 of the 19 comrades the minutes of the session contain much detailed information on life histories, but for Rudolf Hamburger the information recorded is restricted to his address and one or two basic personal details. This may have reflected the sensitive nature of some of the relevant sources. Ministry for State Security files on Hamburger refer to information held by the Party Central Committee or \\"elsewhere\\", without spelling out more detail, beyond the high level statement that he was \\"active in the anti-fascist movement\\" and had been accepted for membership by the Party Central Committee. Rudolf Hamburger was accepted as a full party member in March 1958. Rudolf Hamburger made his home in Dresden. Important projects he directed while employed by the city authorities in Dresden included the \\"Industry Project II\\" (\\"Industrieprojektierung Dresden II\\") (1956) and the Reed Processing Collective in Romania (\\"Schilfzellstoffkombinat in Rum√§nien\\"). In 1959 he started a new job, now working as deputy to his friend Richard Paulick on the major residential developments (\\"Aufbau der 2. Sozialistischen Wohnstadt\\") at Hoyerswerda, a large new town development a short distance to the east of Dresden. He retired, formally, in 1963. After that he took several lengthy trips as a passenger on freight ships. This enabled to revisit his old haunts in Shanghai, and to meet up again with his brothers Otto and Viktor. He also undertook one or two further architecture commissions, now on a freelance basis. The most important of these was refurbishment of the interior of the East German embassy in Pyongyang.  Taboo  Discussion of Rudolf Hamburger's life story was always a political taboo in East Germany. There was no wish on the part of the authorities to discuss the lengthy detention in Soviet labour camps of a German comrade whose political credentials were beyond reproach. Because of this, there was, in addition, never any public awareness or discussion of his pioneering work as an architect in Shanghai during the 1930s. Nevertheless, after he retired Rudolf Hamburger began to compile an autobiographical volume detailing his experiences between 1930 and 1955. He was, as he himself insisted, not a natural author, but he nevertheless had a compelling series of tales to tell. The detailed nature of what he wrote has led some to suggest that he had managed to keep and then to smuggle out notes of his experiences in Shanghai, Tehran, and then in the Soviet labour camps. Whether or not he had kept contemporaneous notes, the detailed nature of what he wrote down ‚Äì not withstanding certain minor inconsistencies regarding dates ‚Äì indicates that he was blessed with a formidable memory. Although there could be no question of publishing such a volume in East Germany, he did attempt to arrange for its publication in West Germany, but by the 1970s the fashion for \\"labour camp literature\\" was already passing, and a western publisher was not found at that time. Ursula Kuczynski (Ruth Werner) had also performed her espionage activities under conditions of great secrecy till 1950, but after the trial of Klaus Fuchs it became impossible to pretend that she had not been a spy. She had, indeed, been an exceptionally effective spy. In 1977, using the pseudonym \\"Ruth Werner\\", Ursula published her autobiographical book \\"Sonjas Rapport\\" in East Germany. In most cases she avoided mention of people with whom she had worked who were still alive, and even when an \\"uncensored version\\" appeared in 2006, very many questions remained unanswered. His ex-wife's memoir nevertheless gave a remarkably candid insight into her espionage career after 1930. And in view of his close involvement, it had evidently been impossible for her to avoid including her first husband, Rudolf Hamburger, in the text.Sonjas Rapport (autobiografisch). Erste vollst√§ndige Ausgabe, Verlag Neues Leben (Eulenspiegel Verlagsgruppe) 2006 (zuerst 1977), The book was a great commercial success. Several hundred thousand copies were sold. The East German authorities invited Rudolf Hamburger to exploit his new-found fame (if only as a bit-part player in his wife's success) by producing a volume of his own, but what was envisaged was a piece of propaganda controlled by the government, and Hamburger rejected the offer with an uncharacteristic absence of courtesy. He was nevertheless furious that Ursula's book concentrated on Ursula's espionage success. He felt that it unjustifiably played down his own contribution to their espionage partnership between 1930 and 1940. It may very well be that after this he redoubled his own work on an autobiographical work of his own, although there seemed very little prospect that it could ever be published.  Death and rehabilitation  Rudolf Hamburger died at Dresden on 1 December 1980. His body was buried in a place of honour in the city's Heidefriedhof (cemetery), close to the graves of Hans and Lea Grundig. Ten years later, as the Soviet Union approached the final flight path to implosion, Hamburger was posthumously rehabilitated by Moscow in 1990. Till now there had been powerful institutional barriers preventing Rudolf Hamburger's footprint from appearing in the historical record except as a footnote in his wife's remarkable story. After 1990 many of those institutional barriers had fallen away.  A wider audience posthumously  In 2006 Eduard K√∂gel presented his doctoral dissertation on \\"Two of Poelzig's students who emigrated: Rudolf Hamburger and Richard Paulick, between Shanghai and East Berlin\\". As regards Rudolf Hamburger, the compilation drew together Hamburger's own unpublished drafts, numerous letters that he received and wrote, and various references to him in works on people with whom he had interacted between 1930 and 1955. The result was a coherent critical chronology. In 2013, more than three decades after Rudolf Hamburger's death, his own autobiographical work was finally published, with a lengthy introduction by Hamburger's son, the Shakespeare scholar Maik Hamburger, who is identified as producer of the volume.

Biography  Born in Buenos Aires, Alsina's career as a pianist, which began at the age of six, quickly led him to give numerous concerts first in Latin America, then in North America and finally in Europe, some under the direction of prestigious conductors: Gilbert Amy, Ernest Bour, Semyon Bychkov, Jascha Horenstein, Otto Klemperer, Manuel Rosenthal, Michel Tabachnik, among others. At the same time, he studied musical composition on his own, writing his first piece at the age of fourteen.Carlos Roqu√© Alsina (Anaclase) In Argentina, he actively participated as a pianist and composer in artistic programs of various musical institutions (including \\"Nueva Musica\\" in Buenos Aires from 1959 to 1964). In 1964, he was invited to Germany as part of the \\"Artists-in-Residence\\" program, which gave him the opportunity to meet Iannis Xenakis, Elliott Carter and Luciano Berio. In 1965, his composition Funktionen was premiered in Darmstadt under the direction of Bruno Maderna, of whom he became the assistant to the Deutsche Oper Berlin the following year. In 1967, a New York period began, participating in the Center of Creative and Performing Arts in New York, leading numerous master classes on contemporary piano at the University at Buffalo. He also worked at the Juilliard School in 1969 as a visiting professor. During this period, he experimented with musical theatre (see the \\"Trio\\" of 1967 for cello, trombone and percussion). In April 1969, with Jean-Pierre Drouet, Michel Portal, and Vinko Globokar, he founded the improvisation group \\"New Phonic Art\\",New Phonic Art discography (Discogs) which led him to give numerous concerts and to make multiple international tours. In 1972, he settled in France. Since 1978, in parallel to his activities as pianist and composer he has devoted himself to teaching (he has taught piano at the Conservatoire national sup√©rieur musique et danse de Lyon for nine years) and also teaches as a guest professor in several European institutions. To honour his 60th birthday (2001) and his contribution to French musical life, he received a special commission from the Minist√®re de la Culture: Phares et Rayonnements. This anniversary was also the occasion for numerous portrait concerts celebrating his multiple career. Today, Alsina continues to exercise his activities as a pianist, teacher and composer: recitals, master classes and productions of his works punctuate his last years and lead him to many trips in Europe, North America but also in China, Argentina etc.  Works  To date, he has written more than 110 works (the majority of which have been commissioned by musical institutions) - including several for large orchestra, performed at most international contemporary music festivals (Berlin, Hamburg, Donaueschingen, Darmstadt, Vienna, Tanglewood, Amsterdam, Paris, Royan, Metz, Lille, Venice, etc.).. * First Piano Study (Op.3) * Second Piano Study (Op.6) * Third Klavierst√ºck for piano (Op.8) (1963‚Äì65) * Funktionen (1965) * Concerto for piano and orchestra (1965) * Auftrag (1967) * √úberwindung (1967), commission of the S√ºdwestfunk radio premiered in Donaueschingen conducted by Ernest Bour. * Schichten for instrumental ensemble (1971) * Study for tonbak (1973) * A Letter (1976) * Cantate (1977) * La Muraille (1981) * Prima Sinfonia (1983) * Undici(1987) * Suite indirecte for chamber orchestra (1989) * Fantaisie for clarinet and orchestra (1991) * Symphonie n¬∞ 2 (1992) for large orchestra, commissioned by the Orchestre de Paris on the occasion of his 50th anniversary, premiered under the direction of Semyon Bychkov. * P√©nombres (1993) for choir, children's choir and orchestra to a text by Claire Billot * Concerto en deux mouvements (1999) for wind quintet and orchestra * Phares et Rayonnements (2001), for tape and three instrumentists * Concertino (2002) for piano and 12 instruments * Reflet (2002) for solo vibraphone * Reflets en trio (2002) for vibraphone, djemb√© and marimba * Bel Canto (2009)  Distinctions  * 1971: Guggenheim Prize for his works √úberwindung and Schichten (). * 1986: Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres * 2004: the Acad√©mie des beaux-arts awards him the Paul-Louis Weiller Composition Prize for his work as a whole.

Definition  Let (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal A, P) be a probability space and let I be an index set with a total order \\\\leq (often \\\\N , \\\\R^+ , or a subset of \\\\mathbb R^+ ). For every i \\\\in I let \\\\mathcal F_i be a Sub œÉ-algebra of \\\\mathcal A . Then : \\\\mathbb F:= (\\\\mathcal F_i)_{i \\\\in I} is called a filtration, if \\\\mathcal F_k \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal F_\\\\ell \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal A for all k \\\\leq \\\\ell . So filtrations are families of œÉ-algebras that are ordered non- decreasingly. If \\\\mathbb F is a filtration, then (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal A, \\\\mathbb F, P) is called a filtered probability space.  Example  Let (X_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\N} be a stochastic process on the probability space (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal A, P) . Then : \\\\mathcal F_n:=\\\\sigma(X_k \\\\mid k \\\\leq n) is a œÉ-algebra and \\\\mathbb F= (\\\\mathcal F_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\N} is a filtration. Here \\\\sigma(X_k \\\\mid k \\\\leq n) denotes the œÉ-algebra generated by the random variables X_1, X_2, \\\\dots, X_n . \\\\mathbb F really is a filtration, since by definition all \\\\mathcal F_n are œÉ-algebras and : \\\\sigma(X_k \\\\mid k \\\\leq n) \\\\subseteq \\\\sigma(X_k \\\\mid k \\\\leq n+1).  Types of filtrations   Right- continuous filtration  If \\\\mathbb F= (\\\\mathcal F_i)_{i \\\\in I} is a filtration, then the corresponding right-continuous filtration is defined as : \\\\mathbb F^+:= (\\\\mathcal F_i^+)_{i \\\\in I}, with : \\\\mathcal F_i^+:= \\\\bigcap_{i < z} \\\\mathcal F_z. The filtration \\\\mathbb F itself is called right- continuous if \\\\mathbb F^+ = \\\\mathbb F .  Complete filtration  Let : \\\\mathcal N_P:= \\\\\\\\{A \\\\subset \\\\Omega \\\\mid A \\\\subset B \\\\text{ for some } B \\\\text{ with } P(B)=0 \\\\\\\\} be the set of all sets that are contained within a P -null set. A filtration \\\\mathbb F= (\\\\mathcal F_i)_{i \\\\in I} is called a complete filtration, if every \\\\mathcal F_i contains \\\\mathcal N_P . This is equivalent to (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal F_i, P) being a complete measure space for every i \\\\in I.

He served overseas in the Perak War, Second Anglo-Afghan War, and Mahdist War, but was better known for his writings on military medicine and his lobbying for the creation of the Royal Army Medical Corps. Early life Evatt was born in Ireland, the oldest of seven children born to Mary Anne () and Captain George Joseph Evatt of the 70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot. His father died in 1858 while on duty in Peshawar, India. Evatt studied medicine at Trinity College Dublin and Queen's University Belfast, obtaining his Doctor of Medicine degree from the latter in 1863. He subsequently studied surgery with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. Military career Evatt enlisted in the army in 1865, with the rank of assistant-surgeon in the 25th Regiment of Foot. He saw active service for the first time in the Perak War of 1875. A few years later, he was twice mentioned in dispatches during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, serving under General Sir Charles Gough. He participated in the Battle of Ali Masjid, the Bazar Valley expedition, the relief of Sherpur, and the advance on Kabul, organising multiple field hospitals. From 1880 to 1886, Evatt was a medical officer at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. His time there was interrupted by his service in the Mahdist War, where he participated in the Battle of Tamai and the Suakin Expedition. He was awarded the Khedive's Star. Evatt was stationed in British India from 1887 to 1891, where he was the senior medical officer at Quetta. During that time he was a member of the Zhob Valley expedition of 1890. He returned to England in 1892 as the chief sanitary officer at the Royal Artillery Barracks, and in 1894 was appointed secretary to the Netley Hospital. Evatt was promoted to surgeon-colonel in 1896, and from then until 1899 served as the principal medical officer at Hong Kong. He was promoted to surgeon-general in November 1899, and until his retirement in 1903 ‚Äì on his 60th birthday ‚Äì was the principal medical officer for the Western District, based at Salisbury. Evatt's obituary in the British Medical Journal observed that he would be \\"chiefly remembered for his persistent advocacy of the formation of the medical officers of the army into a Corps\\". His efforts in that regard began at least as early as 1884, when he read a paper to the Royal United Services Institute calling for a series of reforms. The Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) was eventually established in 1898. When the Royal Army Medical College opened in 1907, Evatt was one of four officers whose names were placed on a memorial dedicated to those who had been instrumental in the creation of the RAMC. Other interests Evatt was a member of the Liberal Party and stood unsuccessfully on three occasions for the House of Commons. He first ran for parliament in Woolwich at the 1886 election, where he lost to the Conservative candidate Edwin Hughes by a significant margin. This was despite his candidacy being endorsed by Florence Nightingale, with whom he had corresponded on a number of occasions. In 1917, after her death, he wrote a reminiscence of her for The Journal of the Royal Artillery. After retiring from the military, Evatt ran in Fareham at the 1906 election and in Brighton at the January 1910 election; he did not come close to being elected on either occasion. Evatt was a prolific writer. He contributed numerous articles to the British Medical Journal, and served on the council of the British Medical Association for a period; in 1896 he was the president of the organisation's Hong Kong branch. He also served on the committee of the International Health Exhibition of 1884. Personal life In 1887, Evatt married Sophie Marie Frances Kerr ‚Äì a niece of Field Marshal William Maynard Gomm, a granddaughter of Major-General Lord Robert Kerr, and a great-granddaughter of William Kerr, 5th Marquess of Lothian. The couple had two children together: Sophie Estelle Kerr Evatt (b. 1878; known as Ettie), who was born in Faizabad, India, and George Raleigh Kerr Evatt (b. 1883; known as Raleigh), who was born in Woolwich. His son followed him into the army, but was killed in action near Armenti√®res, France, in November 1914. Evatt's nephews via his brother John included the Australian politicians H. V. Evatt and Clive Evatt. He entertained two more of John's sons, Frank and Ray, while they were on leave in London during World War I; both were subsequently killed in action.

Granite sculpture was made in 1913 by sculptor S. D. Merkurov. At the present place has been since 1972.  History  In November 1910 the sculptor S. D. Merkurov removed the death mask from the face of Leo Nikolayevich Tolstoy. After that, he began to create a monument to the writer, who ordered from him a Moscow patron N. A. Shakhov. In 1913, a sculpture carved from Finnish granite was ready. According to the original idea, the monument was to be erected on the Miusskaya square opposite the private university building of A. L. Shanyavsky. However, the Black Hundred organization \\"Union of the Russian People\\" threatened to blow up the monument to the writer who was excommunicated from the church, so far as he was supposed to stand in front of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral that was being built. As a result, the Moscow City Duma did not give permission for the installation of the monument, and the sculpture remained in the studio of Merkurov. The sculpture was recalled during the years of Soviet power, and in 1928 the monument was erected in the square of the Maiden Field in the framework of the Leninist plan for monumental propaganda. In 1972, it was replaced by a more monumental monument of the sculptor A. M. Portyanko, and the sculpture of S. D. Merkurov was moved to the present place ‚Äî to the museum of Leo Tolstoy. In addition to these two, in Moscow there is a third monument to L. N. Tolstoy ‚Äî before the so-called \\"House of Rostov\\" on Povarskaya.  Description  The monument is quite generalized in its forms, which is typical of the pre-revolutionary works of Merkurov. The figure of the writer seems to grow out of a piece of red coarse granite. His head is slightly tilted. The writer is dressed in a wide blouse, his hands are plugged in the waistband.

Austrian Party The Austrian Catholic People's Party () was formed in 1895, following a split in the Conservative Hohenwart-Klub . Its leaders were Alfred Ebenhoch and Josef von Dipauli. Membership in the party, representing Ultramontane and Conservative positions, was not limited to one nationality. The Catholic People's Party brought together Germans, Poles and Czechs, united by their Catholic faith and the political conclusions drawn from it, in the Elections of 1897. In the Reichsrat elections of 1901 it lost 4 out of 27 seats. It joined the Christian Social Party in 1907. Hungarian Party The Hungarian Catholic People's Party (Katolikus N√©pp√°rt) was at the initiative of Ottok√°r Proh√°szka, Count N√°ndor Zichy and Count Mikl√≥s M√≥ric Esterh√°zy on November 14, 1894 (according to another source, on January 28, 1895). The impetus for its creation was given by the legal reforms of the 1890s aimed at a Separation of Church and State, most notably the introduction of Civil Marriage - to which the party's founders were strongly opposed. During its existence, the party ran in five elections (1896, 1901, 1905, 1906, and 1910). It joined the Opposition Bloc which achieved a historic victory in the 1905 elections, unseating the Liberal Party which had been in power since the Compromise of 1867 and triggering a severe domestic political crisis. As a member of the Coalition, which was confirmed in power in the 1906 elections, the People's Party was represented in the Second Wekerle Cabinet by Alad√°r Zichy. By 1910, the Coalition had disintegrated and the independent Catholic People's Party had once again been pushed into opposition. Due to the outbreak of World War I in 1914, no new elections were held until 1920. The Catholic People's Party, led by Alad√°r Zichy (who had been its president since 1903), merged with the National Christian Socialist Party on February 3, 1918, with the strong support of the National Christian Socialist Association, to form the Christian Social People's Party. The latter was dissolved and banned during the time of the Soviet Republic of Hungary. It was re-established in 1920, under the name of the Christian National Association Party. Several newspapers were at different times affiliated with or operated by The Catholic People's Party: The Hungarian State (1868-1908), the Constitution (1895-1919), the People's Party (1899-1909) and the People's Newspaper (1910-44). During its existence, the party had three presidents; the founder was N√°ndor Zichy (1894-?), J√°nos Zichy (? -1903) and finally Alad√°r Zichy (1903-1918). Among the prominent members of the People's Party, J√≥zsef Farkas from Zala County, who not only worked diligently with Count N√°ndor Zichy, but also was elected to parliament four times, representing the party. Other prominent members and supporters of the party included Fl√≥ri√°n Strausz de Strauszenbergh, Papal Prelate and Bishop of Als√≥lendva; Istv√°n Rakovszky de Nagyr√°k√≥ and Nagyselmec; √ñd√∂n Beniczky of Benice and Micsinye; Mikl√≥s Zboray de Zbor√≥; and Gy√∂rgy Szmrecs√°nyi de Szmrecs√°ny. An enthusiastic and militant member of the People's Party was Dr. Ferenc Major, chief medical officer of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, who represented the party alongside K√°roly K√°lm√°n, parish priest of S√≥sk√∫t. Ferenc Dar√°nyi, a lawyer and politician, first stood in 1896 as a candidate with a People's Party program in the Szentl≈ërinc district, but failed to get elected. In 1901 and later, he was elected at the Zalabaksa district of Zala County. Zala County was one of the strongholds of the Catholic People's Party, where the party often held rallies there: on May 31, 1896, the People's Party held a major rally in the fairgrounds in Zalaegerszeg. Count Alad√°r Zichy was elected representative in Nagykanizsa in 1896, and from there he represented the district with the program of the People's Party, of which he was elected president in 1903, after the resignation of Count J√°nos Zichy.

According to the information of 1826, the house belonged to merchant Nakhodkina. In 1849-1918, the merchants of Verevkina owned the mansion. In the middle of the 19th century, from the side of the courtyard to the house a two-storeyed gallery with a rounded corner was attached. After the reconstruction in 1914, the facade was decorated with decorative elements in the Neoclassicism style. At the end of the 19th to the beginning of the 20th century, the editorial office of the newspaper Nedelya was located on the first floor. After the October Revolution, the building was nationalized and there were communal apartments, and later - various institutions. In the 1970s, reconstruction was carried out, during which interiors were changed into the walls, and a metal frame was built into the walls. By the beginning of the 21st century the house is in a long lease from the firm \\"Eladi\\" and was in emergency condition. In 2002‚Äî2003, it was rebuilt according to the method of \\"preservation of the front wall\\": the ceilings and the rear wall were demolished, the attic floor was added.  Architecture  The two-story mansion refers to the Empire style, but it has several heavy proportions. In its design decorative elements are used, typical for post-fire buildings: wreaths, cartouches, lion masks, relief panels. The central part of the facade is marked with pilasters of the Doric order with a pediment.

History  In the late 1780s, the retired Lieutenant General F. M. Shestakov acquired a plot of several possessions in Kozitsky lane. He ordered the architect M. F. Kazakov to build a stone mansion. Initially, only the right part of the current building and the wing on the left side were built. After the death of F. M. Shestakov, the house was inherited by his relative V. D. Lobkov. After the death of Lobkov in 1795, his widow Anna Ivanovna Lobkova completed the manor house, and it has acquired a modern look. Her son, S. A.

In 1860, the owner of the mansion was the architect M. O. Lopyrevsky. Under him, the apartments were still rented. Apartments in this building at different times shot the singer E. P.

The facade is decorated with stucco. Above the Windows of the second floor there are symmetrical ornamental compositions, and above the Windows of the portico there are heads in diamonds. The main entrance to the building was originally in its central part, and after the reconstruction it is located in the archway and leads to the lobby with a staircase.

Early life  Borel studied at the University of Antwerp and the ETH Zurich, where he received his doctorate in immunological genetics in 1964. Afterwards he was at the Swiss Research Institute of Medicine. From 1970 he was in the research laboratories of Sandoz in Basel.  Discovery of cyclosporin  In 1972, Borel was involved in the discovery of the immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporin (Sandoz called Sandimmun), which was isolated by Sandoz in 1971 from a fungus that a Sandoz employee brought back from vacation in Norway. The screening program at Sandoz was previously developed by K. Saameli (and St√§helin) and the immunological testing procedures of S. Lazary. Initially, use as an antibiotic was considered. When it was realized that the substance had only T-cells and therefore had potential in transplantation medicine, Borel aroused much attention in 1976 at a congress in London. In the practice of organ transplantation, the new drug was tested in 1977 by the British surgeon Roy Yorke Calne. In 1983, Borel became vice president of the pharmaceutical division of Sandoz (later Novartis). Since 1981 he was Professor of Immunopharmacology at the University of Bern. Also involved in the discovery and development was Hartmann St√§helin, head of the Pharmacology Department at Sandoz, which included the Immunology Department, and later there was a dispute over their respective shares in the discovery.

It also saw use as a Coastal-defense gun during World War II.  Design  The 28 cm MRK L/35 gun was a built-up gun made from three layers of reinforcing hoops. It used a cylindro-prismatic horizontal sliding breech, but unlike later Krupp guns it didn't use a metallic cartridge case. Instead, it used separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The four ships of the Brandenburg- class had a slightly unusual arrangement for their primary armament. Although the primary armament consisted of six 28 cm guns in three twin gun turrets that all fired the same ammunition, the fore and aft turrets had 28 cm MRK L/40 guns, while the amidships turret had 28 cm MRK L/35 guns due to space constraints. The ships did not have centralized fire control and each gun type had different ballistics. The L/35 guns had a muzzle velocity of and a maximum range of vs and a maximum range of for the L/40 guns.  Coastal defense  In addition to its role as a naval gun, the 28 cm MRK L/35 also saw use as a coastal defense gun. In 1893 Norway bought three guns on shielded coastal mounts to equip the Oscarsborg Fortress, which guards the Oslofjord that leads to the Norwegian capital of Oslo. When Norway was invaded on 9 April 1940 the three guns of the Oscarsborg Fortress together with shore mounted torpedo launchers sank the German Heavy Cruiser Bl√ºcher during the Battle of Dr√∏bak Sound. This foiled a German naval landing which was attempting to capture Oslo and allowed the Norwegian royal family to escape. In 1910 two ships of the Brandenburg-class were sold to the Ottoman Empire and two ships remained in the High Seas Fleet until they were deactivated during World War I and scrapped after the war. When the two ships in German service were deactivated during World War I there were plans to convert the four guns to coastal mounts and deploy them to protect the Dardanelles. However, the fortifications they were planned to arm were never finished and the guns remained unused.  Ammunition  Before and during World War I, the gun used about of RP C/12 (Rohr-Pulver ‚Äì tube powder) propellant that was a mix of nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin and small amounts of other additives with a calorific value of 950 and an uncooled explosion temperature of 2,975 kelvins. {  style=\\"margin-right: 0;\\" - !

Matter containing these nuclides is termed up-down quark matter (udQM). The continent of stability is named in analogy with the island of stability. However, if it exists, the range of charge and mass will be much greater than in the island. Quark matter composed of up quarks and down quarks is predicted to be a lower energy state than that which contains strange quarks (strange quark matter), and also lower than the combination of quarks in the form of hadrons found in normal atomic nuclei if there are over 300 protons and neutrons. The lower limit of 300 was calculated based on a surface tension model, where the surface has a higher energy than the interior of the piece of quark matter. In order to be the absolutely more stable form, the energy must be lower than that of the most stable normal matter, that is 930 MeV per baryon. If these quark matter nuclides exist, they would be stable against fission, as fission would increase the surface. The quark matter nuclide could absorb neutrons resulting in an increase in its mass. The electric charge of up-down quark matter: full result (blue dots) and the bulk approximation (blue line). The shaded region is the continent of stability. The boundary to the continent of stability is determined by the situations where the Coulomb energy due to electric charge overcomes the binding energy, or where decay into atomic nuclei results in lower energy. The lowest energy mass number is proportional to the cube of the charge (atomic number). However, a range of charges is stable for each mass, and the range increases as the mass increases. This can result in very heavy nuclides with atomic numbers the same as existing known elements, and even zero charge pieces of quark matter. A proposed alternative form of quark matter known as strangelets contains strange quarks in addition to the up and down quarks. This would be neutral in charge, and thus not form atoms. udQM is probably lower energy than strangelets (uds-matter). At the Large Hadron Collider, the ATLAS Collaboration is attempting to observe this kind of matter. Other Properties Electron-positron pairs will form in the high charge field via the Schwinger mechanism when the electric charge of udQM is larger than 163, at which the baryon number is 609. The smallest stable udQM against neutron emission would be at baryon number 39. Formation in nature udQM could be possibly formed during a supernova core collapse from conversion of superheavy nuclei. In this environment there is a high density of electrons and electron neutrinos present. The udQM would then end up in neutron stars. udQM nuclides may be detectable in cosmic rays. A star containing a large proportion of udQM is called a ud quark star (or udQS). Heavy neutron stars may contain this matter type. Whether they do can be verified by detecting binary neutron star collisions.

In the 2000s, it was restored. Now the building is occupied by the research Institute of emergency children's surgery and traumatology. Chetverikov house has the status of cultural heritage of Federal significance.–£—Å–∞–¥—å–±–∞, 1-—è –ø–æ–ª. XIX –≤. ‚Äî –ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π –¥–æ–º  History  The first known image of the building on Malaya Yakimanka was found on the plan of ownership of the merchant wife Tatyana Evdokimova and is dated 1772. Then it was a square in terms of one- storey stone house, covered with a closed arch. The walls of this house, built in a modern building, have been preserved, and it can be assumed that it was built in the middle of the 18th century. In the 1800s, the owner of the mansion was a merchant Ivan Vasilyevich Chetverikov. Under him the building was rebuilt: the first floor was significantly expanded and there was a second. In 1845, a wooden mezzanine appeared near the mansion. In 1863, a two- storey building was added to the Eastern facade. At the end of the 19th century, the owner of the estate was a merchant Nikolai Osipovich Sushkin, in which new decorative elements appeared on the facades and interiors of the house. Under the Soviet regime, the mansion became one of the buildings of the children's trauma clinic ‚Ññ 20 Timiryazeva. By the end of the 20th century the mansion was dilapidated, and in 1987 the project of its scientific restoration was developed, which provided for the reconstruction of the appearance of the building for 1860-1870-ies. However, this project has not been realized for a long time. The mansion was empty, homeless people settled in it, and then there was a fire. In 2003, on the basis of children's city clinical hospital ‚Ññ 20 named after K. A. Timiryazev, The research Institute of emergency children's surgery and traumatology was established, and construction of a new building began near the Chetverikov house. There were plans to demolish the Chetverikov house, construction on its place of a two-level underground Parking and the subsequent \\"reconstruction\\" of the mansion. The public actively opposed it, and as a result it was decided to carry out restoration of a mansion. Howling recreated numerous decorative elements: plaster column capitals, window frames, base, pilasters, and stucco facade brackets, pediments and corbels. The brickwork was restored. Unpreserved wooden mezzanine was rebuilt of brick. The interiors of the building were recreated from natural fragments and measurements of the 1980s. In one of the rooms on the second floor is the office of the Director of the hospital Leonid Roshal.

In the period of mongol conquest and assimilation with enslaved by Turkic tribes played its role in the ethnogenesis of modern Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Karakalpaks, Uzbeks, Buryats, Uygur and others. Origins Mongol tribe Katagan (Hatagins) takes its origin from Buha-Hatagi - the eldest son of Mongol‚Äôs mother Alan- goa. Katagan tribe came to Transoxania together with the son of Genghis Khan Chagatay and played a big role in the political history and ethnogenesis of many modern Turkic people. Evidence about Katagans are seen in the works of Rashid ad Din, namely in his historical ethnographic work Jami' al-tawarikh written in the early 14th century. According to The Secret History of the Mongols the origin of Katagans is the following: *Borte-Chino born by the order of the Higher Heaver. His wide was Gia-Maral and they descent being Bata-Chigan. *The son of Bata-Chigan - Timacha *The son of Timacha - Horichar- Mergan *The son of Horichar-Mergan - Auchjam-Boroul *The son Auchjam-Boroula - Sali-Hachau *The son of Sali -Hachau - Eke-Nidun *The son of Eke-Nidun - Sim- Sochi *The son of Sim-Sochi - Harchu *The son of Harchu - Bordjigadai-Mergan was married to Mongolchin-goa *The son of Mongolchin-goa - Torolchin-Bayan was married to Borohchin-goa *The son of Torolchin: Duva-Sohor and Dobun-Mergan *Dobun-Mergan married Alan-goa, the son Hori-Tumat Horilartay-Mergan, born in Arih-usune. They had two sons: Bugunotai and Belguntonai *After the death of Dobun-Mergana, widowed Alan-goa bore three sons from Maalih Bayaudaisa: Bugu- Hadagi, Buhatu-Salchi and Bodonchar-Prostak. *Belguntai became the forefather of Belgunot tribe *Bugunotai became the forefather of Bugunot tribe *Bugu- Hatagi became the forefather of Hatagi *Buhutu-Salchi became the forefather of Salchuyit tribe *Bodonchar became the forefather of Borchigin generation - the origin of Chingiz khan Katagans as part of Uzbeks In the sources there are evidences that speak of Katagans being as part of known of Uzbek tribes in the mid XVI. Katagans are mentioned in the lists of 92 uzbek tribes. Famous descendant of Uzbek Katagan tribe was a historian of XVI century - Muhammad Yar Arab Katagan, who is the author of Musahhir al-bilad (The conquest of lands) in Persian language. It speaks of the history of Shaybanids. Uzbek Katagans used to live on the territories of Horzem, Tashkent, Surhandaryinsk, Kashkadayins regions and in the Fergana of Uzbekistan. Katagans used to live on the territories of Tajikistan and Afghanistan as well. According to population census of Tajikistan in 2010 the number of Katagans was 7601 people. According to historical data, in the 40s XVII century Katagans were one of the strong tribes living in Balha and partly in Kunduz. In times of Ashtarhanids the Balha region was given to Katagans as a nomad camp. At the same time Katagans were forming a strong political alliance. In the beginning of XVII during the reign of Muhmudbyi, Balh and Badahshan became known as land of Katagans. In XIX numerous Uzbek-Katagans lived in Kunduz, Afghanistan. Katagans of Kunduz and Tash-kurgan were considered to be descendants of 16 sons, each of whom was a descent of a separate kin. 5 sons were from one mother - the besh bola group. Other 11 sons were from a different mother - the group of Chegun. Besh bola divided into next kins: kesamir, djung, katagan, luhan, tas, munas. Munas divided to: chuchugar, chechka, yugul, sirug, temuz, burka, berdja. Chegun consisted from: murad, basuz, ssiri katagan, churag, djuduba, katagan kurasi, murad shaih, adjigun, kin, kudagun, semiz. Uzbek- katagans of southern Uzbekistan speak kipchak and karluk-chigil dialects of uzbek language, which is evidenced by ethno linguistic research. Tohchi- katagans that used to live in Surhan-Sherabad oasis speak on the dialect of karluk-chigil with ‚Äúyi‚Äù later, such as turks and karluks. Katagans as part of Kazakhs According to Tynyshpayev - katagans made the major power of kazakh khan, the ruler of Tashkent, Tursun khan, who was defeated in a war of 1628 by another kazakh khan Esim. afterwards, numerous and powerful katagan tribe split into several: one part which remained with the title shanshykyly became part of the kazakhs Elder Zhuz, other parts of katagan became part of uzbeks, karakalpaks and kyrgyzs. Accordingly to Abu-k-Gazi-bahadur-khan in ‚ÄúShadjara-yi va mogul‚Äù kazakh-katagans were destroyed in 1628 together with the assassination of Tursun-Muhammed khan. Such an easy of destruction is explained by the fact that most part of this tribe left to Kashgariya at the end of 16th century, in time of ruling in Yarkend Abd ak-Karim khan. As the result of aforementioned it became few in number and very vulnerable. Katagans that migrated to Kashgariya were headed by Sultan Gazi-sultan, he was given by the khan of Yardkend a land Kargarlyk. His descendants were on state positions later on, and katagans assimilated among local uygurs. From the work of Muhammedjan Tynyshpayev ‚ÄúKyrgyz-kazakhs of XVII and XVIII centuries‚Äù (addition to materials about the history kyrgyz-kazakh people): In the year of 1627 the historian Abulgazy Bogadurkhan fled Khiva from his brother Asfendiar and was received by Yesim, who lived in the mountains of Turkestan. Three months later, another Kazakh khan Tursun, who owned Tashkent, arrived there. An honorary refugee Yesum handed over to Tursun, with whom Abulgazy moved to Tashkent. Further, Abulgazy reports that two years later Yesim attacked Tursun, \\"killed him and killed the Katagans\\" Traditions that have survived among the clan of the Chanshchk of the Tashkent district, say that once their khan was Tursun, who was killed by Yesim. After that, most of the katagans fled to Bukhara, and the remaining ones began to be named after the branch of the \\"Chanshkly\\" katagans. Chokan Valikhanov, speaking about the Elder Zhuz of Kazakhs, notes: Katagans are the most ancient people living in the south of Central Asia and Kazakhstan. At the beginning of the XVII century. they formed the main support force of the ruler of Tashkent - Tursun-khan, and in the middle of the 17th century, part of them became part of the Uzbek people, and the other part was part of the Kazakh Chaniishki tribe.

In Turnback Canyon, after a chunk of ice in a large hydraulic damaged his kayak and he had barely reached the shore, he wrote in his diary: > \\"One huge horrendous mile of hair, 30 feet wide, 50,000 cubic feet per > second and a twenty degree downgrade going like hell. Incredible! I did not > flip in that mile or I would not be writing ... I'll never go back, not for > $ 50,000, not for all tea in China. Heed my words well and do not be a ass! > It's unpaddleable!\\"Walt Blackadar: Caught Up in a Hell of Whitewater. Sports > Illustrated, August 14, 1972 Sports Illustrated compared his success at Turnback Canyon with the first ascent of Mount Everest. Canada named a mountain in the Alsek Range in his honor; Turnback Canyon is located on the west flank of Mount Blackadar. In 1972, with Roger Hazelwood and Kay Swanson, Blackadar attempted the first descent of Devil‚Äôs Canyon of the Susitna River in Alaska. While they completed the descent alive, there were several swims and two lost boats. He ran Devil‚Äôs Canyon again in 1976 and 1977, the former filmed for the TV show American Sportsman; he was not able to complete the run without swimming. Blackadar appeared in many other episodes of American Sportsman, running the Grand Canyon and other western ‚Äúbig water‚Äù rivers. He also appeared in a full-length feature documentary, The Edge (1976), running the Grand Canyon. Blackadar's paddling career suffered a tragedy in 1974, when young Julie Wilson lost her life while running the West Fork of the Bruneau with him in Idaho. The rapid was later named Julie Wilson Falls in her honor. Blackadar was greatly saddened by the loss, and it affected his aggressive, devil-may-care approach to the sport.Greg M. Peters, Adventure Journal, The Hard-Partying, Big Water- Running Walt Blackadar, May 24, 2018. Retrieved July 10, 2018. In 1974, Blackadar learned of Evel Knievel's plan to jump the Snake River Canyon on a rocket-powered motorcycle, and he resolved to be there to witness the event. Sneaking onto the river with four kayakers, he positioned himself in the rapids below the jump. When Knievel's parachute opened prematurely and his cycle floated down toward the river, crashing on the banks, Blackadar got to him. He checked Knievel out and accompanied the daredevil to the helicopter for evacuation.Walt Blackadar, Sports Illustrated, September 23, 1974. Retrieved July 10, 2018.

Riley was born on July 6, 1912, in Harrisonburg, Virginia, as the son of Thomas A. Riley and attended the high school there in summer of 1931. He was then admitted to the Virginia Military Institute at Lexington and graduated in June 1935 with Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering. While in college, Riley was a member of ROTC unit and held reserve commission since July 1931. He was also active in football, baseball and boxing teams and served as president of the Shenandoah Club in his senior year. Following his graduation from VMI, he resigned his Army Reserve commission and accepted appointment as second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on July 10, 1935. He was subsequently ordered to the Basic School at Philadelphia Navy Yard for further officer training and completed the school in March 1936. With 124 students, it was the largest Basic School class to that date. This class provided two future Marine Corps Commandants (Leonard F. Chapman Jr. and Robert E. Cushman Jr.), five lieutenant generals (Lewis J. Fields, Frederick E. Leek, Herman Nickerson Jr., William J. Van Ryzin, Richard G. Weede), five major generals (William R. Collins, William T.

Riley was promoted to the rank of captain in May 1941 and appointed commanding officer of the Marine detachment aboard the battleship USS \\"New York. While aboard that ship, he took part in the escorting of cargo and troop ships to Iceland and Scotland. World War II When the Japanese attacked the Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Riley was still aboard the USS New York in the Atlantic Ocean on convoy duty. He was detached from New York following his promotion to the rank of major in May 1942 and ordered to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Riley was subsequently tasked with the formation of 1st Aviation Engineer Battalion, Fleet Marine Force. This unit was designated as a separate engineer battalion intended to be airlifted onto islands to repair captured airfields. He sailed with that unit to the Pacific area in August 1942 and took part in the construction of a landing field on New Caledonia. Riley and his engineers were ordered to Guadalcanal in November of that year and took part in the rehabilitation of Henderson Field after heavy fighting. He was later responsible for the construction of Sailer Field there and departed Guadalcanal in February 1943. For his service during the construction of the airfields there, he was decorated with the Bronze Star with Combat \\"V\\". Riley was then stationed again at Noumea, New Caledonia and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in August 1943. He was transferred to the staff of III Marine Amphibious Corps in October of that year and served as assistant engineer and executive officer of the Engineer Section during the campaigns at Bougainville, Emirau, Saipan and Guam.

He was subsequently decorated with the Legion of Merit with Combat \\"V\\" for his service on Guam. He was ordered back to the United States in September 1944 and assigned to the Headquarters Marine Corps. He served as the officer in charge of Engineer Supply Division, Quartermaster General's Department under Brigadier General William P. T. Hill and received the Navy Commendation Medal for service in this capacity. Postwar service Josiah Bunting, Virginia Military Institute, 1963. Riley toured all Marine bases around the world during his tenure as Inspector General. Here shown during the promotion of Brigadier General John P. Condon on August 7, 1961, at Iwakuni, Japan. Condon's deputy, Brigadier General Roy L. Kline is on the right. He remained in Washington until October 1946, when he was transferred to Baltimore, Maryland and appointed Inspector-Instructor of 11th Engineer Battalion, Marine Corps Reserve. Riley sailed again to the Pacific area in July 1948 and assumed duty as executive officer of 5th Service Depot at Guam. His depot consisted of engineer company, signal company, military police company, ordnance company, supply company, transport company and several Marine ammunition companies and served as support depot for units in that area. In July 1949, Riley assumed command of the depot and remained in charge until February 1950, when the depot was ordered back to the United States and attached to the Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow, California. Riley was sent to the Armed Forces Staff College at Norfolk, Virginia, in August of that year, and, upon graduation in January 1951, he was promoted to the rank of colonel. He was then attached to the Headquarters of Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic at Norfolk and served consecutively as assistant engineer officer, and engineer officer, under Lieutenant General Graves B. Erskine. He was ordered to Washington, D.C., in June 1952 and attached to the Headquarters Marine Corps as head of planning branch, G-4 Division (logistics) again under his World War II superior, Major General William P. T. Hill. Riley was ordered to Quantico in June 1954 and attached to the Advanced Research Group. This group was tasked with the development of the recommendations on how the MAGTF should evolve structurally to meet the challenges of atomic warfare and new technologies such as helicopters and jet aircraft. Riley departed Quantico in July 1955 and joined 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. He served consecutively as Divisional Chief of staff under Major Generals Lewis B. Puller, Edward W. Snedeker and Reginald H. Ridgely. When Ridgely was appointed commander of Camp Pendleton, California, in June 1957, he requested Riley as his chief of staff. Riley was then co-responsible for the training of new recruits until January 1959, when he was nominated for the promotion to the rank of brigadier general. He joined 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton as assistant division commander under Major General Edward W. Snedeker. When Snedeker was appointed commandant of the Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, at the beginning of October 1959, Riley assumed temporary duty as commander of the 1st Marine Division and served in this capacity for one month until the arrival of Major General Henry R. Paige. He then resumed his duties as assistant division commander and remained at Camp Pendleton until July 1960. Riley assumed duty of assistant division commander, 3rd Marine Division on Okinawa, Japan and served under Major General Donald M. Weller until June 1961. Because of the ongoing Laotian Civil War and worsening situation in Vietnam, he was tasked with the training and combat preparation of the division for Counter-guerrilla operations. Upon his return to the United States and a brief period of leave at home, Riley assumed duty as Inspector General of the Marine Corps on July 1, 1961. In this capacity, he was responsible for the conducting investigations and inspections of Marine units within the limits of the United States and also on the bases in Pacific theater. Riley served in this capacity until July 1, 1964, when he retired after almost 30 years of active service. Civil career Riley settled in Orange County, California, and worked in the aerospace industry until September 1974, when he was appointed by then-Governor of California, Ronald Reagan, to the capacity of Supervisor of Orange County's Fifth District. He replaced Ronald Caspers, who had died in office when his ship disappeared in June of that year just nine days after being reelected. During his 20 years as Supervisor, nearly 1 million people moved to Orange County, more than 300,000 homes were built and five new cities sprang up, three of them in Riley's district. He was also responsible for the expansion of John Wayne Airport, where the terminal built in September 1990 was named after him. The Thomas F. Riley Wilderness Park near Rancho Santa Margarita, California was also named after him. However the end of his tenure in 1995 was marred as his retirement coincided with Orange County's financial fall. Riley and two fellow board members, Gaddi H. Vasquez and Harriett M. Wieder, were able to escape misconduct charges by leaving office. While others sought to shift blame for the bankruptcy, Riley was one of the few to take responsibility. Grave at Arlington National Cemetery During the press conference about announcement of his resignation, Riley commented: Riley's health began failing, his left foot was amputated in 1997, because of a severe infection worsened by diabetes.

Prior to the board's formation, figures were conducted by different means such as the BBC financing its own audience research, while the ITV companies sub-contracted theirs. Most watched special events The majority of special events attracting large audiences are often carried on more than one channel. The most watched programme of all time on a single channel is the 1973 wedding ceremony of The Princess Anne, shown only on BBC1. * Post-1981 figures verified by the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB) * Pre-1981 figures supplied by the British Film Institute (BFI) { class=\\"sortable \\" - !Rank !Event !Viewers (millions) !Date !Network - ! 1  1966 FIFA World Cup Final: England v West Germany  32.30  BBC One/ITV - ! 2  Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales  32.10   BBC One/ITV - ! 3  Royal Family (documentary)  30.69  and  BBC One/ITV - ! 4  Apollo 13 Splashdown  28.60   BBC One/ITV - ! 5  1970 FA Cup Final replay  28.49   BBC One/ITV - ! 6  Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer  28.40   BBC One/ITV - ! 7  Wedding of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips  27.60   BBC One - ! 8  2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony  24.46   BBC One - ! 9  2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony  24.24   BBC One - ! 10  Torvill and Dean ‚Äì Olympic Ice Dance Championship  23.95   BBC One } Notes: *At least two Muhammad Ali boxing matches were reported to have been watched by at least 26million viewers in the United Kingdom: the Fight of the Century (Ali vs. Frazier) was reported to have been watched by 27.5million British viewers in 1971, and The Rumble in the Jungle (Ali vs. Foreman) was reported to have been watched by 26million viewers on BBC One in 1974. *The Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton (29 April 2011) received a total audience peak of 26 million viewers, but this is a combined figure aggregated from the ten different channels that broadcast the ceremony.

Plot Giovanni Passamonte, a writer, is awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. He is about to embark on a one-week road trip to Stockholm to receive the prize when his personal assistant, Rinaldo, injures his back and can no longer drive him there. His son Oreste, a personal trainer who had arrived that morning to crash at his father's place after an argument with his wife Barbara, is recruited to replace Rinaldo. Lucrezia, Giovanni's daughter by another woman, invites herself to the trip to document it as part of her online blog. The trip becomes a turning point for the four characters: Giovanni is nostalgic and lamenting a lack of inspiration. He is secretly planning a big surprise at the award ceremony (but ultimately changes his mind) and decides to interfere and improve the lives of his three companions. His eccentricity is the cause of the trip and often results in comedic moments throughout the movie. He is afraid of flying (hence the road trip), doesn't like using credit card (Rinaldo carries more than 50,000 EUR in cash for any emergency), has had many love stories, some of which have produced children (at least 6). Oreste is a former Olympic athlete turned personal trainer and owner of an ailing gym, too proud to ask his father for financial help, but willing to drive for him in exchange for a 15,000 EUR loan. Lucrezia is a neurotic blogger with the passion for art and literature. Rinaldo is a loyal assistant who has sacrificed much for Giovanni, including his only love interest. The trip offers Giovanni occasions to shake things up in the life of their companions and make them reflect on their story and identity. The movie ends with Giovanni's acceptance speech where he declares the insignificance of prizes in general and the importance of the people \\"off-stage\\", who lead regular lives.

The oldest igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rock is part of the Grenville Province, a small continent that collided with the early North American continent. The beginning of the Paleozoic is poorly attested and the oldest rocks in Kentucky, outcropping at the surface, are from the Ordovician. Throughout the Paleozoic, shallow seas covered the area, depositing marine sedimentary rocks such as limestone, dolomite and shale, as well as large numbers of fossils. By the Mississippian and the Pennsylvanian, massive coal swamps formed and generated the two large coal fields and the oil and gas which have played an important role in the state's economy. With interludes of terrestrial conditions, shallow marine conditions persisted throughout the Mesozoic and well into the Cenozoic. Unlike neighboring states, Kentucky was not significantly impacted by the Pleistocene glaciations. The state has extensive natural resources, including coal, oil and gas, sand, clay, fluorspar, limestone, dolomite and gravel. Kentucky is unique as the first state to be fully geologically mapped. Stratigraphy, Tectonics & Geologic History The oldest Precambrian igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement in Kentucky is only known from gravitational studies and boreholes and does not outcrop at the surface. The earliest rocks formed in the Proterozoic, east of the Grenville Front, as part of the continental crust of the Grenville Province, which collided with Proto- North America, kicking of the Grenville orogeny. In northern Kentucky mafic, felsic and metasedimentary rocks have similar abundances. A study in 1985 of 42 boreholes, spanning into central Ohio found 14 percent gabbro, eight percent metagabbro, 12 percent amphibolite, 12 percent hornblende gneiss and schist and two percent quartz diorite. Additionally, there is 33 percent granite, two percent granodiorite gneiss, seven percent metasedimentary rocks and 10 percent granite gneiss. Metamorphism reached amphibolite-grade in the sequence of metamorphic facies. The northeast has slightly higher concentrations of granite as well as anorthosite. Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago) Throughout the Ordovician, Kentucky was covered in shallow tropical seas, depositing limestone, dolomite and shale. The region was the flooded continental shelf of Laurentia, situated in the Southern Hemisphere as part of the Iapetus Ocean, based on reconstructed paleogeography. The Camp Nelson Limestone along the Kentucky River gorge between Frankfort and Boonesboro dates to the Middle Ordovician and is the oldest rock exposed at the surface in the state. Additional mudstone and shale formation from the Late Ordovician indicates a shift to a shallower sea, which supported extensive marine life. Brachiopod, bryozoan, coral, sponge, crinoid, trilobite, conodont, ostracode and nautiloid fossils are very common in stream beds and road cuts in the Bluegrass Region. Silurian rocks are not exposed in the Bluegrass Region, but is common in the surrounding Knobs Region. High sediment loads prevailed in the shallow tropical sea at first, forming additional shale. Silt and clay which formed the shale appears to have originated from the east, forming alternating units between carbonate layers. Shelly invertebrates and corals form the bulk of limestone and dolomite from the period. The Cincinnati Arch formed during the Silurian due to gentle folding and upwarped parts of the region above the water level, separating Kentucky into two geologic basins. The upwarping of the arch continued into the Devonian, which is supported by the lack of Early Devonian rocks in central Kentucky where the arch formed. Devonian rocks are only exposed at the surface in the Knobs Region and are not present in the Bluegrass Region, although they are known from the sub-surface throughout the rest of the state. For the most part, shallow sea conditions prevailed with areas experiencing dry land conditions. By the late Devonian sea levels increased, resulting in poorly oxygenated deep water. Organic-rich black shales formed, ultimately producing oil and gas which is now extracted. Black shales hold broadly similar fossil assemblages to Silurian and Ordovician deposits, but have particularly well preserved calcareous stromatoporoid sponge fossils, which are found at the Falls of the Ohio close to Louisville. By the Mississippian, Kentucky remained largely submerged and still south of the equator, but related to the merged continental mass of Euramerica. The closing of the Iapetus Ocean created the narrower Rheic Ocean, as the supercontinent Gondwana moved toward Euramerica. The Pennyroyal Region has exposed Mississippian rocks. Black shale deposition continued through the Early Mississippian, but rivers and streams shifted the sediment load to terrestrial material from the Appalachian uplands further east, delivering sand, mud and silt. When sea levels dropped in the Middle Devonian, massive limestone formations took shape which now form much of the state's karst landscape and host the world's largest cave, Mammoth Cave. Coastal plains and tidal deltas periodically displaced the sea. By the Devonian, proliferation of fishes and land life increased the variety of fossils. Fish teeth became common alongside invertebrates and scale ferns, tree ferns, calamite trees and large amphibians lived on the land in estuaries and ox-bow lakes. In 1995, a single five foot long embolomere amphibian fossil was found in sandstone, near the margin of the Western Kentucky Coal Field. In the Pennsylvanian, shallow seas existed periodically, but the landscape was mostly swampy land. As the supercontinent Pangaea took shape, Kentucky was situated on the equator. Grasses and cordaite trees joined the fossil record and dead vegetation was encapsulated in silts and sands, capped by delta clays, preventing oxidation. This material formed Kentucky's two main coal fields. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) The Late Permian, the Triassic and the early part of the Cretaceous‚Äîa span of 200 million years‚Äîis missing from the stratigraphic record. The rifting apart of Pangaea formed the Atlantic Ocean as North America shifted into the Northern Hemisphere. Small outcrops from the Cretaceous at the end of the Mesozoic are found in southwest Kentucky, near the state line with Tennessee, in the Jackson Purchase Region and parts of Mississippian Plateau. These sands, clays and gravels deposited at the flooded eastern edge of the Western Interior Seaway and never consolidated into rock. Cenozoic (66 million years ago- present) In the Paleogene and Neogene, in the Cenozoic brackish, freshwater and marine sediments deposited in the Jackson Purchase Region, the northern limit of the Mississippi Embayment. Thin beds of lignite and carbonaceous clays are common in the eight counties of the region. Unlike neighboring states, with landscapes heavily changed by glaciations during the Pleistocene, ice sheets only reached Covington, Kentucky. Glaciation changed the course of the Ohio River, in the vicinity of Louisville and Cincinnati where glacial melt waters filled the valley with sand and gravel. Lake bottom sediments deposited locally where the Kentucky, Green, Licking and Salt rivers were temporarily impounded by glacial debris. Natural resource geology Kentucky has extensive natural resources. Coal mining in Kentucky targets bituminous coal, which has played an important role in the state's economy for decades. In addition to coal and hydrocarbons, sand, gravel, dolomite and limestone are important resources. Unlike many areas, much of the sand production was from floating dredgers on the Ohio River, rather than exclusively dry-land quarries. In 1982, Kentucky ranked fourth among US states in clay production. Prior to 1979, three-quarters of the fluorspar produced in the US is sourced from the Illinois-Kentucky fluorspar district. The state legislature formed the Department for Natural Resources and the Environment in 1972. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Kentucky led the US in coal production. A well drilled in 1819 in salt water, in the South Fork of the Cumberland River revealed the first indications of petroleum in Kentucky. A rush to produce paraffin from oil in the 1850s prompted discoveries in Clinton, Cumberland, Allen, Barren, Meade, Wayne and Russell counties. A total of 4,755 barrels were produced in 1883. Major discoveries came after 1900, including the Big Sandy gas field, in Floyd County, Warfield Fork gas pool, Big Sinking pool, Campton pool, Sunnybrook pool and Ragland pool. Henderson County grew as a source, leading state production by the 1930s and World War II. The Greensburg pool in Green County was a major source found in the late 1950s, helping to drive total production to 27.27 million barrels by 1959. The state legislature passed a drilling regulation in 1960 requiring permits for wells and creating the Water Pollution Control Commission. Due to poor record keeping, the exact number of wells is not known. However, the Kentucky Geological Survey estimated a cumulative total of 200,000 wells in 1992, with 23,000 oil wells and 11,000 gas wells producing in 1989. The Eastern Coal Field and Western Coal Field have been the mine sites of production, with little exploration in the Jackson Purchase and Bluegrass regions.

The incident sparked significant media coverage and a surge in business for the bakery. The baker was invited to introduce Republican Vice Presidential nominee Paul Ryan at a political rally the following week. The incident Just after 10:00am on Wednesday, August 15, 2012, an advance team from Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign entered the three- month old \\"mom-and-pop\\" Crumb and Get It bakery, asking owner Chris McMurray if he would host an unscheduled media event, but McMurray politely declined, citing political differences. McMurray said that the exchange was very kind‚Äînot heated, hoarse, or ill-mannered‚Äîa matter of political difference (\\"convictions about my faith\\" and then-President Obama's attitude toward business), with no offense to Biden. McMurray later explained that he \\"would not like to be used as a photo op for (Obama/Biden's) campaign\\". Biden's event was held at the nearby River Street Grill instead. Aftermath A television reporter for WDBJ, Roanoke, Virginia, received a tip about the occurrence, a resultant story being picked up by the Drudge Report and various conservative blogs. The coverage led to an outpouring of support and a surge in business the next day that caused it to close down at 1:15pm because it ran out of food. McMurray opened shops in Fredericksburg and Lakeland before later shutting its doors. McMurray's disagreement stemmed in part from his reaction to Obama's \\"You didn't build that\\" remark the previous month in Roanoke. Republican Vice Presidential nominee Paul Ryan requested that McMurray introduce him at a rally in Roanoke the following week, when McMurray told the crowds \\"We (small business owners) did build it\\". Three non-partisan fact- checkers subsequently found Obama's remark to refer to public infrastructure and not to the small businesses themselves. Reports that Secret Service agents subsequently entered and thanked McMurray \\"for standing up and saying no\\" and \\"bought a whole bunch of cookies and cupcakes\\" were later contradicted by the a Secret Service spokesman who said the agents were there to thank the shop owners for their trouble and apologize for any inconvenience the advance team may have caused. The Crumb and Get It incident \\"re-entered the national conversation\\" after the 2018 Red Hen restaurant controversy. At that time, the owner of an unrelated Pennsylvania bakery of the same name reported being \\"slammed with messages\\" concerning the incident in Virginia six years earlier. Similar incidents The Crumb and Get It incident was among similar incidents that \\"re-entered the national conversation\\" in the wake of the 2018 Red Hen restaurant controversy. In the 2012 Masterpiece Cakeshop incident, a Colorado baker refused to make a customized wedding cake for a gay couple due to the owner's religious opposition to their marriage. In 2015, a county clerk in Kentucky, Kim Davis, refused on personal religious grounds to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In the June 2018 Red Hen restaurant controversy, a restaurant co-owner in Lexington, Virginia who disapproved of President Trump's administration's policies asked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to leave the restaurant. Contrasting with the generally positive reaction received by McMurray, after Sanders tweeted about the incident, the restaurant quickly became the object of an online troll campaign, extreme Yelp reviews, and a negative tweet from President Trump himself.

The cadres camp was located on the Mushenshi River in Zambia. Background At this point in the war Rhodesia's political and military position appeared to be a strong one. Nationalist guerrillas had been unable to make serious military inroads against Rhodesia. In the early 1970s the two main nationalist groups faced serious internal divisions, aid from the Organisation of African Unity was temporarily suspended in 1971 and 129 nationalists were expelled from Zambia after they were alleged to have plotted against President Kenneth Kaunda. Furthermore Britain's efforts to isolate Rhodesia economically had not forced major compromises from the Smith Government. In 1971, Rhodesia joined Alcora Exercise, a secret defensive alliance for Southern Africa, formalised in 1970 by Portugal and South Africa. Alcora formalised and deepened the political and military co-operation between the three countries in the fight against the revolutionary insurgency in the territories of Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique and South West Africa and in the prevention of possible external aggression to those territories from the hostile neighbouring countries. The Raid On 17 April 1971 a ten-strong force from the Rhodesian SAS, supported by the Rhodesian Air Force (RhAF) attacked the ZIPRA camp. During the raid one cadre was killed and another was wounded. Once the SAS team had secured the camp the troopers discovered enemy intelligence whilst recovering the enemy‚Äôs equipment. All of this was then brought back to Rhodesia when the SAS team was picked up by air force helicopters.

Sanford was born in 1818, the son of Edward Ayshford Sanford, a Member of Parliament for Somerset, by his first wife Henrietta Langham, daughter of Sir William Langham, 8th Baronet. The family had owned Nynehead Court in Somerset since 1599, and William Ayshford Sanford succeeded to the estate on the death of his father in 1871. He served as Colonial Secretary from 1852 to 1855, and in this position Sanford asked the assistant Surveyor of the state, Robert Austin, to make observations and collections of birds while exploring inland regions. In the report of the Austin Expedition of 1854 is a note on a \\"Ground Parrot\\", following Sanford's labelling of what is assumed to be the type specimen of Pezoporus occidentalis, the cryptic \\"night parrot\\". After returning to England, Sanford is noted for his interest in natural history, especially the paleontology of the Somerset area. As a large landowner, he was a prominent public man in Somerset, was chairman of the Wellington bench of magistrates, and a Deputy lieutenant of the county. He had been a strong supporter of the Liberals, but in his late years became a Liberal Unionist. Sanford died at his residence Nynehead Court, Somerset, on 28 October 1902. He was twice married, first in 1857 to Sarah Ellen Seymour (d.1867), daughter of Henry Seymour, of Knoyle House, Wiltshire, a male-line descendant of the Seymour baronets; and secondly in 1874 to Sarah Elizabeth Harriet Hervey (d.1877), daughter of Lord Arthur Hervey, Bishop of Bath and Wells, by his wife Patience Singleton. By his first wife, he left children: * Colonel Edward Charles Ayshford Sanford (1859‚Äì1923) * Mary Ethel Ayshford Sanford (1861‚Äì1941), who married her cousin Field Marshal Paul Methuen, 3rd Baron Methuen (1845‚Äì1932), and left children * Henry Seymour John Ayshford Sanford (1863‚Äì1934) * Ellen Henrietta Ayshford Sanford (d.1932), who married Charles Edward Pole-Carew (1853‚Äì1938), and left children * Blanche Clotilde Ayshford Sanford (d.1936) * Rosalind Ayshford Sanford (d. 1935), who married Sir Sidney Godolphin Alexander Shippard (1837‚Äì1902)  References  Category:1818 births Category:1902 deaths Category:English palaeontologists Category:Zoological collectors Category:Colonial Secretaries of Western Australia ","title":"William Ayshford Sanford"},{"id":"57856337","text":"http://xgames.espn.com/xgames/athletes/3012829/kevin-robinson Kevin Robinson (December 19, 1971 ‚Äì December 9, 2017) nicknamed K-Rob was a professional freestyle BMX rider.

The balloon depicts Trump as an angry orange baby holding a smartphone. The balloon was flown over Parliament Square, London, on 13 July 2018, where the police estimate that over 100,000 protestors were in attendance, and 50,000 more in the Meadows, Edinburgh, the following day, where protests were also held. Although Trump was not visiting Edinburgh, he was spending the weekend at his Turnberry golf course, but permission to fly the balloon there was refused by Police Scotland. The balloon has also been flown in France, Argentina, Ireland, and Denmark. With permission, activists made a copy of the balloon and it has been flown in numerous locations in the U.S. Concept Schematic depiction of the balloon One of the organisers, Max Wakefield, described the balloon protest as being in response to \\"the rise of far-right politics that dehumanises people in order to get into power\\", and saw it as an attempt to introduce some \\"good British humour\\" into the political discourse surrounding Trump's visit. Wakefield cited the Trump administration's family separation policy and Trump's withdrawal of the United States from the Paris climate agreement as examples of the kind of policies which the protest was targeting. Leo Murray, who led the campaign, wrote in its crowdfunding statement: The tall, helium-filled plastic inflatable, also referred to as a \\"balloon\\" or \\"blimp\\", was designed by Matt Bonner and constructed by Imagine Inflatables of Leicester. It was made after a crowdfunding campaign on crowdfunder.co.uk raised the GB¬£16,000 cost of its creation and deployment. It depicts Trump as \\"an angry orange baby\\" with a snarling mouth, tiny hands, wearing a nappy, and holding a smartphone. Wakefield said \\"The only way that you can make any impact with Donald Trump is to mock him, because you can't engage him in any kind of argument ‚Äî it never gets anywhere.\\"  History  Permission from the Greater London Authority (GLA), Metropolitan Police and National Air Traffic Service (NATS) was required for the balloon to be flown over Parliament Square, the space above which is considered restricted airspace. Permission was granted, allowing it to be flown, while tethered, up to high, for up to two hours. Both the GLA's 'City Operations' team and NATS stressed that the nature of the protest did not play a part on their decisions. After learning of the balloon, Trump remarked, \\"I guess when they put out blimps to make me feel unwelcome, no reason for me to go to London.\\" After its appearance in London, the balloon was taken to Edinburgh, where it was flown over the Meadows, a public park near to the city centre, as part of the protests against Trump's two-day-visit to Scotland, permission to fly the balloon near Turnberry golf course having been refused. On 17 July 2018, the balloon was tethered outside the O2 Arena in London during a performance by the American rock band Pearl Jam, with their blessing. Protesters planned on flying the Trump baby balloon in Ireland in November during Trump's visit to the country, however his trip was cancelled. Museums including the British Museum and the Museum of London expressed interest in acquiring or displaying the original balloon. 2019 London appearance Ahead of Trump's state visit to the UK in June 2019, Sky News ran a commercial featuring the balloon. The blimp was likely to be flown again during this visit, subject to permission from the Metropolitan Police. A crowdfunding initiative arranged for the blimp to fly if ¬£30,000 were raised before Trump's arrival on 3 June 2019; this funding goal was achieved. The Museum of London again said that it would like to exhibit the balloon. The blimp flew at 9.00 am 4 June 2019 in Parliament Square, ahead of the main protest that congregated at 11.00 am in Trafalgar Square. A smaller balloon was prepared to be carried in the march. The smaller balloon was \\"stabbed with a sharp object\\" by Amy Dalla Mura, a pro-Trump supporter later that day; the woman was arrested and charged. Appearances outside the UK United States A group of activists in New Jersey raised nearly US$24,000 in a GoFundMe campaign to purchase Baby Trump balloons that they planned to fly over Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Initially, they sought US$4,500 to purchase one balloon. Their fund raising was so successful that they were able to purchase six balloons in all. The balloons are available for \\"adoption\\" by groups for events in other states. Copies of the \\"Baby Trump\\", sometimes referred to as the \\"baby blimp\\", balloon have appeared across the U.S. in Florida, Michigan, California, Chicago, New York and Washington, among other places. On 22 September 2018, a balloon was seen flying near Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in West Palm Beach at a rally to mark the anniversary of Hurricane Maria striking Puerto Rico. On 2 October, the balloon appeared at a Spokane, Washington protest when Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Washington to support the reelection of Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers. Baby Trump made an appearance at a 13 October 2018, Woman's March rally in Chicago, Illinois.

The balloon made its California debut at the Los Angeles Convention Center on 19 October 2018 during the Politicon. On 27 October 2018, the Trump balloon was flown in West Hollywood, California and Grand Rapids, Michigan. The Grand Rapids co-organizer stated, \\"It's meant to be fun, but we're also making the point that this guy is dangerous and he's a little unhinged. We want to make the point that this administration is taking us down what we think is the wrong path and is threatening to democracy, to our moral standing in the world.\\" On 28 October 2018, the Baby Trump balloon made an appearance in New York City at an \\"Impeachment parade.\\" The blimp appeared on 19 January 2019 at Los Angeles Women's March, and at a protest rally outside Trump's re-election campaign launch in Orlando on 18 June 2019. The balloon made an appearance during 4 July 2019 Independence Day festivities at the Salute to America event on the National Mall. The National Park Service granted a permit for its use. The balloon was seen at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con on 20 July. It flew again on 21 September in Ventura, California. The balloon appeared in Lexington KY, outside of the city's courthouse on 4 November 2019 in protest of Trump's visit to the city. The balloon appeared in Tuscaloosa, Alabama for the NCAA College Football game between the #2 LSU Tigers and the #3 Alabama Crimson Tide on 9 November 2019 at Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium. President Trump attended the game while protesters flew the balloon at Tuscaloosa's Monnish Park. At that appearance the balloon was slashed by Hoyt Hutchinson. Hutchinson was taken into police custody. The balloon appeared in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 20, 2020 to protest his rally there. It is the first time President Trump has hosted a rally since the COVID-19 pandemic began to spread in the United States. https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the- know/in-the-know/503737-baby-trump-balloon-appears-in-tulsa-ahead-of-rally- raises-more France The balloon appeared in Paris on 11 November 2018, at a march protesting about Trump's visit to attend the ceremonies of the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. Speaking to a CNN journalist, one protester said, \\"I think Paris should be protesting not only Trump's presence here, but also should be trying to send a message to President Macron for having invited him here, especially on the anniversary of the signing of the armistice.\\" Argentina G20 Buenos Aires summit. Video from Todo Noticias. On 29 November 2018, the Trump Baby was flown in Argentina in protest during the G20 Buenos Aires summit. Ireland From London the blimp moved to Ireland, and appeared at 6.00 pm, on 6 June 2019, at the \\"Stop Trump Ireland\\" protest at the Garden of Remembrance, in Dublin. Permission was granted by Irish Aviation Authority. Denmark In preparation for Donald Trump's planned visit to Denmark in September 2019, a Danish campaign was launched to have the blimp transported to Denmark and flown during Trump's visit. Despite the visit being cancelled, the blimp still flew over Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen on 2 September 2019. Copycat balloons   Sadiq Khan  On 30 August 2018, pictures of a balloon similar to that of Donald Trump's were circulated, this time depicting London's Mayor Sadiq Khan wearing a bright yellow bikini. The balloon, like the Donald Trump baby balloon, was crowdfunded after ¬£58,000 was raised to create the blimp. Organizers, identified as Yanny Bruere, a 28-year-old sales manager from Northampton, known for anti-semitic tweets, said \\"a certain amount of respect should be afforded to the leader of the free world and the greatest ally the UK has,\\" and that the balloon was made \\"in retaliation\\" to the Trump balloon. It featured Khan wearing a yellow bikini in response to the banning of a series of Protein World advertisements on London's public transport networks, which had shown a woman in a yellow bikini with the slogan \\"are you beach body ready?\\". The adverts were criticized for allegedly objectifying women and promoting unrealistic female body images. The adverts were eventually banned, with Sadiq Khan supporting their removal. Khan commented, \\"If people want to spend their Saturday looking at me in a yellow bikini they're welcome to do so, I don't really think yellow's my colour though.\\" A small crowd gathered to watch as the blimp flew over London's Parliament Square on 1 September 2018. It has made no further appearances. The Sadiq Khan bikini-clad balloon was sold on eBay on 28 August 2019, for ¬£16,000.  Boris Johnson  During Anti-Brexit protests in London on 20 July 2019, a giant balloon depicting the former mayor of London Boris Johnson was flown over Parliament Square. The balloon depicted Johnson with a pink-face and blonde spiky hair whilst wearing a white T-shirt with a red bus across the front with the words '¬£350m', in reference to the bus he used during the Brexit referendum campaign. He was also depicted wearing blue shorts with love hearts printed on them with the world 'Nigel' also printed across the front, resembling the Pro-Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage. The No to Boris, Yes to Europe\\" protest was against Johnson's view on Brexit and also against him becoming the next prime minister of the United Kingdom.

He was suffect consul in an undetermined nundinium between AD 130 and 138. He is known entirely from a dedication on a statue base from Auximum (near Ancona), erected to honor him as the city's patron. Although the inscription provides a straightforward cursus honorum, the career of Oppius Sabinus remains enigmatic. He was adlected into the Senate by the emperor Hadrian inter tribunicos, or as having held the magistracy of plebeian tribune, which was followed by his tenure as peregrine praetor, elected as the candidate of the same emperor; these two offices, demonstrating the favor of that emperor, obviously are dated before Hadrian's death in the year 138. After completing his term as praetor, Oppius Sabinus was selected as the legatus or assistant to the governor of Hispania Baetica, a post commonly held for one year. He returned to Rome, where he was appointed curator of a number of roads: the viae Clodia, Annia, Cassia, Cimina, tria Trajanarum, and Amerina. These comprised the network covering Italy, and his supervision of them occupied his time for two years. Then he accepted a commission as legatus or commander of the Legio XI Claudia, then stationed at Durostorum (Silistra) on the Danube, which kept him from Rome for three years. Oppius Sabinus received another appointment, this time as governor of the imperial province of Lusitania, which was commonly held also for three years. His last praetorian office was from the sortition, which awarded him the governorship of the public province of Hispania Baetica. It is thought his consulate followed immediately after this last governorship.Paul M.M. Leunissen, \\"Direct Promotions from Proconsul to Consul under the Principate\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 89 (1991), p. 227  Discussion  A number of details in his cursus honorum merit discussion. First, his origins. It is tempting to identify this Oppius Sabinus as the son of the consul of the year 84, Gaius Oppius Sabinus, who was killed by the Dacians the following year. The filiation of the younger Oppius Sabinus, \\"C.f.\\" or \\"Gaius filius\\", supports this surmise. The name elements \\"Julius Nepos\\" could refer to his maternal grandfather. And the last four elements of his name, \\"Manius Vibius Sollemnis Severus\\" could come from the man who adopted Oppius Sabinus after his father's death and raised him. However, the primary objection to this surmise is that were the younger Oppius Sabinus the son of the consul of 84, he would have been considered a nobiles, or member of the Senatorial class, and not in need of being adlected into the Senate. Further, there is no record of either a Julius Nepos or Manius Vibius Sollemnis Severus living at the appropriate time. One could argue further that both men were of the equestrian class, which would explain their obscurity, but this verges on special pleading. The only safe inference from his name is that the young Oppius Sabinus was a native of the countryside near Rome, as were many of the Oppii Sabini. As for the dates of his career, little improvement can be made on the conclusion originally offered by Attilio Degrassi and since accepted by G√©za Alf√∂ldy that Oppius Sabinus acceded to the consulate between the years 130 and 138.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter der Antoninen (Bonn: Rudolf Habelt Verlag, 1977), p. 203 The time required to pass through all of the offices and appointments following his praetorship would take at a minimum 10 years: assuming Hadrian promoted him to the Senate immediately after his own elevation to emperor in 118, and add a year for his praetorship, Oppius Sabinus would have been legatus to the governor of Baetica in 120/121 (whose identity we do not know), and consul no earlier than the year 130. The terminus ante quem of 138 is the year Hadrian died, for in the inscription he is referred to in a manner to suggest this emperor was still alive. None of the men who are known to have governed Lusitania and Baetica between the years 125 and 138 have been precisely dated, so this information does not help us narrow the dates of his career. That all of the consuls for the years 133, 134 and 135 are known does offer some help, for clearly Oppius Sabinus could not have been consul in those years. Beyond this we cannot go. Needless to say, his life is a blank after his consulship.

Basel were runners-up in the previous season. The season started on the weekend of 21‚Äì22 July 2018 and will end on Saturday 25 May 2019. The first round of the Swiss Cup was played on the week-end 29, 30 June and 1 July. Basel played the first round on Friday 29 June against lower classed FC Montlingen and they were victorious. Therefore Basel continued in the competition in the second round against FC Echallens. Basel were also qualified for qualifying phase and play- offs (League Path). The draw for the second qualifying round was held on 19 June 2018 (after the completion of the first qualifying round draw). The first leg was played on 24 July and the second leg played on 1 August 2018. But Basel were eliminated by PAOK and they therefore continued in the Play-off round of the Europa League against Vitesse Arnhem.  Club   Management  Rapha√´l Wicky was the first team manager at the start of the season. His assistant was Massimo Lombardo and a further member of the training staff was Werner Leuthard. Due to the very poor start into the season Wicky was sacked on 26 July, after the Champions League qualifying defeat against PAOK. Alexander Frei then took over as interim coach until a new manager was named. On 2 August Basel announced that Marcel Koller had signed as new manager. He appointed Thomas Janeschitz and Carlos Bernegger as his assistants. Massimo Colomba stayed as the Goalkeeper coach. Massimo Ceccaroni is head of the FCB Youth System.

During the winter break, on 4 February 2019, the club announced that Edon Zhegrova had been signed in on loan for 18 months from Genk. The Campaign Domestic League The season started on the weekend of 21‚Äì22 July 2018. Basel's priority aim for the new season was to win the league championship. Domestic Cup Basel's clear aim for the cup this season was to win the title. The first round was played on the week-end 29, 30 June and 1 July. Basel played their first-round game on Friday 29 June away from home against lower classed FC Montlingen. In the first round Basel beat Montlingen 3‚Äì0, in the second round Echallens R√©gion 7‚Äì2 and in the round of 16 Winterthur 1‚Äì0. In the quarter finals Sion were defeated 4‚Äì2 after extra time and in the semi finals Z√ºrich 3‚Äì1. All these games were played away from home.

Albian Ajeti scored the first goal, Fabian Frei the second for Basel, then Dejan Sorgiƒá netted a goal for Thun, but the end result was 2‚Äì1 for Basel.

Due to lingering injuries, she moved her retirement date up to the World Championships in February. In December, Mikaela Shiffrin became the eighth athlete (four men, four women) to win at least 50 World Cup races across all disciplines, as well as the youngest (at age 23) to do so. Shiffrin ended the season with 17 race victories (3 Super Gs, 4 giant slaloms, 8 slaloms, and 2 parallel slaloms/city events), shattering Vreni Schneider's 30-year-old record of 14 wins in a season, which was set in the 1988-89 season. Shiffrin also won four crystal globes for the season, tying the women's record held by Vonn and Tina Maze. On 6 March 2019, former slalom season champion (and Olympic gold medalist) Frida Hansdotter announced her retirement from alpine skiing following the 2018‚Äì2019 season.

It is located at a distance of circa 90 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 3923 is about 155,000 light years across. NGC 3923 is an example of a shell galaxy where the stars in its halo are arranged in layers. It has more than twenty shells. It was discovered by William Herschel on March 7, 1791.  Characteristics  NGC 3923 is an example of a shell galaxy where the stars in its halo are arranged in layers. NGC 3923 has up to 42 shells, the highest number among all shell galaxies, and its shells are much more subtle than those of other shell galaxies. The shells of this galaxy are also symmetrical, while other shell galaxies are more skewed. Concentric shells of stars enclosing a galaxy are quite common and are observed in many elliptical galaxies. In fact, every tenth elliptical galaxy exhibits this onion-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop as a consequence of galactic cannibalism, when a larger galaxy ingests a smaller companion. As the two centers approach, they initially oscillate about a common center, and this oscillation ripples outwards forming the shells of stars just as ripples on a pond spread when the surface is disturbed. With deep imaging were also detected a stream extending from the core of NGC 3923 and a small elliptical galaxy on its axis, which is a probable progenitor of some the shells. Another stream lies south of the core of NGC 3923, and a hook like structure lies at the northwest. Based on the velocity dispersion of the globular clusters of NGC 3923 the mass of the supermassive black hole of the galaxy was estimated to be .  Supernovae  One supernova has been detected in NGC 3923, SN 2018aoz, a type Ia supernova with peak magnitude 12.7. It was discovered on April 2, 2018.  Nearby galaxies  NGC 3923 is the brightest galaxy in a galaxy group known as the NGC 3923 galaxy group. Within 25 arcminutes from NGC 3923 have been detected seven dwarf elliptical galaxies. NGC 3904 is located 37 arcminutes away. Other galaxies in the group include NGC 3885, ESO 440-27, and ESO440-011. Other nearby galaxies include NGC 3617, NGC 3673, NGC 3717, NGC 3936, and NGC 4105.

The Union of Communist Groups was founded in the spring of 1920 as followers of Neumann moved away from the Federation of Czech Anarcho-Communists. Neumann's publication ƒåerven had carried pro-communist articles since 1919. Neumann and other anarchists around ƒåerven had tried to work within the Czechoslovak Socialist Party, but felt disillusioned with the party after the 1920 Czechoslovak parliamentary election. With the founding of the Union of Communist Groups ƒåerven issued a declaration denouncing any collaboration with the Czechoslovak Socialist Party. A workers conference was organized in Lom May 23‚Äì24, 1920 at which Neumann declared the objective of the new organization to be in line with the Communist International (Comintern), and called for the formation of workers, peasants and soldiers' soviets. Nevertheless, in practice the group retained many anarchist political traits it spite of its support to the Comintern. The Union of Communist Groups sent a delegation to the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern; consisting of Ivan Olbracht, Emanuel Vajtauer, Hugo Sonnenschein and Helena Mal√≠≈ôov√°. Following the congress, the Union of Communist Groups unsuccessfully sought recognition as the Czechoslovak section of the International.

The drama stars Sami Khan, Sarah Khan and Aleezay Rasool in lead roles, and premiered on 18 December 2014 on Geo Entertainment, where it aired on Thursday nights at 8:00 PST. It was the second appearance of Sami Khan and Aleezay Rasool after Bikhra Mera Naseeb.  Synopsis  The story revolves around Wajdan (Sami Khan) and Anushay (Sarah Khan) who are in love with each other and plans to marry. Wajdan belongs to an upper class family and lives with his mother Mehtab Bano (Asma Abbas). Being the sole owner and in position of power, Mehtab Bano expects everyone to obey her rules and regulations. Wajdan loves his mother a lot and respects her every decision. Differences between them arise when Wajdan expresses his wish to marry Anushay. Mehtab Bano refuses as Anushay belongs to a middle class family. In her point of view, differences between class and status leads to poor relationships. On the other hand, Wajdan is adamant on marrying Anushay while Mehtab Bano begins to despise Anushay and goes on to plan her murder. As Anushay struggles between life and death, Mehtab Bano forces Wajdan to marry a girl of her own choice, Rania (Alizey Rasool). Wajdan is unable to accept Rania as his wife and tells her that he still loves Anushay. Saltanat-e-Dil is a compelling story of three individuals as they are manipulated by Mehtab Bano's tricks.  Cast and Characters  Sami Khan as Wajdaan Sarah Khan as Alizey Alizey Rasool as Rania Asma Abbas as Mehtab Bano Anwer Iqbal Mazhar Ali Seemi Pasha Fazila Qazi Reception Although the drama serial had a cast of Asma Abbas, Fazila Qazi, Sami Khan, and Sarah Khan it was disliked by some viewers due to the ascendency of Hindi serials, and that it was based on the familiar theme of one man with two wives. Syed Ali Raza Usama's direction was appreciated but despite its high budget it had poor ratings.

This is the director's second film after his notable debut with the cult hit Hrid Majharey. It has been produced by Rupa Datta of Camellia Productions Pvt. Ltd. The film immediately garnered a lot of interest nationally on its announcement owing to the Demonetisation carried out by the Government of India in November 2016. The act was taking its toll on the country. It is probably the first film in Bengali where money almost became a separate character. Ghosh's mentor, acclaimed writer-director- actor Aparna Sen has been the Creative Consultant of the film. She had come on board since she reportedly liked the concept of the different colours of money and after going through the screenplay that she was really impressed with. Rongberonger Korhi is an anthology of four short stories and features National Award winning star-actor Rituparna Sengupta, veteran cine star Chiranjeet Chakraborty, critically acclaimed actors Ritwick Chakraborty, Soham Chakraborty, Kharaj Mukherjee, Arunima Ghosh, Arjun Chakrabarty and others.  Plot  An anthology of four shorts - a different colour of money emerging from each story. The following synopsis is resourced from the Habitat Film Festival site. First story (Red - Love) - A poor fighting tribal couple seeks divorce from a local judge who charges a big sum of money. After getting the decree, they realize that they are still in love. They need to remarry but there‚Äôs no money left. But they don‚Äôt give up! Second story (Blue - Separation) ‚Äì A young wife comes to know of her aged husband's accidental death from her lover. The husband has left her a fortune. His death sets her free to reunite with her lover. The two plan their future but a big surprise awaits them. Third story (Glittery - Profit) ‚Äì A middle-class man, sacked from his job and ditched by his girlfriend, sits alone in a park. A pimp approaches him and brings him to a prostitute. New to this world, he prefers to chat. What he learns from her shocks him! Fourth story (White - Loss) ‚Äì A village boy, a 'Dhaaki' (drummer), leaves his ailing mother and travels to the city to earn money to buy medicines for her. He does get a good amount of what he wants, but loses his mother by the time he returns.  Cast  All the four stories have three principal characters. ; First story * Arunima Ghosh as Sitarani Murmu, tribal woman * Soham Chakraborty as Ramchandra Murmu, tribal man * Kharaj Mukherjee as Khagen Chandra Banerjee, Government Clerk ; Second story * Arunima Ghosh as Manda, the young wife * Chiranjeet Chakraborty as Bijoy, the aged husband * Arjun Chakrabarty as Mithun, the young lover ; Third story * Rituparna Sengupta as the unnamed prostitute * Ritwick Chakraborty as the unnamed client * Dhee Majumder as the unnamed pimp ; Fourth story * Rituparna Sengupta as the mother * Rwitobroto Mukherjee as son Joga * Durga idol  Production   Scripting and pre-production  The first draft of the screenplay was written in 2015 and underwent rewrites till it went into production in September 2016. Initially, these were written as short film projects for the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI). Pre- production spanned over three months from September 2016 till November 2016. Recce was carried out extensively in Kolkata and the suburbs and in the Burdwan and Birbhum districts for budget-friendly locations.  Principal photography and post-production  The film was shot on the ARRI ALEXA MINI Camera by ace cinematographer Sirsha Ray. The first day of the shoot was on 10 December 2016. The film was shot over a period of 10 days. This aspect of a ten-day shoot seemed to be a regret harboured by the director. In two exclusive interviews to The Statesman newspaper and to a web portal TheMoviean.com, he conceded that he would have preferred a two-week shoot instead. The film was edited by veteran editor Rabiranjan Maitra, which took three months to be locked. The music production was done by Debojyoti Mishra.  Controversy   Clash with Hindu Right Wing Group  In December 2017, a little known Hindu Right Wing Fringe Outfit rose in protest against the film and called for its ban. The film reportedly drew the ire of the Hindu outfit as two of its characters were named after deities Ram and Sita. The activists of the fringe group, Hindu Jagran Manch, held demonstrations outside the local office of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) on Friday and submitted a deputation seeking changes in the names of the characters. Director Ranjan Ghosh, however, refused to make any changes, calling the protests an attempt to curb his creative freedom. Ghosh said the film had four separate stories about relationships and there was no mythological connection. In one of the four stories, two characters were named Ram and Sita. The spokesperson for the West Bengal unit of Hindu Jagran Manch, Vivek Singh, had written a letter to the Union Information and Broadcasting minister, Smriti Irani, stating that naming the film‚Äôs characters after Ram and Sita would hurt the sentiments of Hindus. Singh told reporters on Thursday that he would not give up the fight and may even explore legal options if the Censor Board clears the film without considering the group‚Äôs demand. The BJP‚Äôs West Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh said the trend of naming film characters after Hindu Gods or revered mythological characters might harm the sentiments of people of the community.  Support from the national and regional media  In the clash with the Hindu Right Wing Group, the entire national and regional media rallied around the film in support of the freedom of expression. The Citizen felt \\"Did not Ram ask Sita to prove her chastity by passing through the fire? Did not Sita find absolution in finding her way back to the earth she sprung from? So, what is wrong if a film names its characters after mythological names? Don‚Äôt we name our own children after the names of mythological characters in the epics and after Gods and Goddesses of the Hindu pantheon like Ganesha, Sita, Radha, Krishna and the like? The first axe to fall would then be Mehboob‚Äôs classic Mother India where the ‚Äúmother‚Äù in the title was named Radha. Ramesh Sippy‚Äôs bumper hit Seeta Aur Geeta should be recalled and renamed according to the wishes of this Right Wing group who have suddenly decided to become ‚Äúcensors beyond the censors.‚Äù Should we then, in retrospect, ask for a change in the names of all films where the characters are named after Gods and Goddesses of the Hindu pantheon and of Indian epics?\\" Firstpost wrote \\"In our country, of course, religion is a low hanging fruit for all kinds of radicalism, and in the absence of any debate, dialogue or civil discussion whatsoever, the names of the film‚Äôs characters are being targeted. It is said that there are as many as thirty-three crore gods and goddesses in the Hindu religion. If one were to stop using their names in the arts and literature for fear of retaliation from such self-appointed sentinels of the religion, then there will be no artistic expression left in the country, and our great nation, which was once known all across the globe as an upholder of uninhibited creative freedom, will soon turn into a barren and dark desert of fear and subjugation.\\" Outlook (magazine) slammed the Right Wing Group stating \\"Bengali film \\"Rong Beronger Kori\\" has drawn the ire of a Hindu outfit as two of its characters are named after deities Ram and Sita. Director Ranjan Ghosh, however, has refused to make any changes, calling the protests an attempt to curb his creative freedom. The activists of the fringe group, Hindu Jagran Manch, held demonstrations outside the local office of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) today and submitted a deputation seeking changes in the names of the characters. Ghosh said the film has four separate stories about relationships and there is no mythological connection. In one of the four stories, two characters have been named Ram and Sita.\\" The Hindu lent its support reporting \\"Mr. Ghosh said the film has four separate stories about relationships and there is no mythological connection. In one of the four stories, two characters have been named Ram and Sita. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt we see people having names like Ram, Lakshman, Sita, Kartik, Saraswati in our everyday life? Do they now want to change those names as well!‚Äù he wondered. ‚ÄúIt is a question of artistic freedom, a director‚Äôs prerogative of creating a work of art. We will protest and object to any bid to curb our freedom,‚Äù he asserted.\\" The Indian Express reported the director's point of view that \\"‚ÄúThis entire thing is a cheap publicity gimmick by this fringe organisation, which wants to hog the limelight. It is piggybacking the film for publicity. It is an attempt to curb the creative freedom of artists,‚Äù he added. Rongberonger Korhi is his second feature film. ‚ÄúIt is a love story and there is an element of separation in the film. I will not change the name of my characters and there is a noble thought behind naming the characters. People will come to know about it after watching the film. It has not been done to hurt the sentiment of anyone. On the other hand, no one can dictate what people will be wearing and what they will eat. I will ask the CBFC not to pay heed to the demands of this organisation,‚Äù Ghosh said.\\" The Times of India wrote \\"When Ritwik Ghatak directed ‚ÄòSubarnarekha‚Äô, he cast Madhabi Mukherjee in the role of a girl called Sita. Born an orphan, Sita is brought up by her elder brother Ishwar. As the story unfolds, Sita is forced to take up prostitution. By a strange twist of fate, she is one day confronted by the reality of her drunk brother turning up at her brothel as her client. Before the release of this film in 1965, no one said that Ghatak was insulting Hindu sentiments. But 52 years later, the use of Sita‚Äôs name for a character played by Arunima Ghosh in Ranjan Ghosh‚Äôs ‚ÄòRongberonger Korhi‚Äô has angered the members of the Hindu Jagaran Manch. After verbal and email protests, members of this outfit are giving a deputation to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC).  CBFC Certification  On January 12, 2018, the Central Board of Film Certification, Kolkata, passed the film without any cuts or modifications, thereby overturning the demands of ban by the fringe outfit Hindu Jagaran Manch. The director lauded the CBFC for taking an objective view of the film without any bias and for not succumbing to any pressure. Film scholars also viewed this development as a very positive sign on the behalf of the CBFC.  Release   Festival participation  Rongberonger Korhi was selected as a Market Recommended Film at the Dubai Film Market of the 14th edition of the Dubai International Film Festival, that being the only Bengali Film of 2017 to make the cut. The festival was held from December 6‚Äì13, 2017, at Dubai, UAE. The film was further screened on May 26, 2018, at the 13th edition of the prestigious Habitat Film Festival organized by the India Habitat Centre held from May 19‚Äì27, 2018, in New Delhi, India. It was reportedly screened before a full house and was greeted with a standing ovation. Rongberonger Korhi was screened at the Telangana International Bengali Film Festival in Hyderabad held between 7‚Äì9 December 2018. It won the Best Film (Critics), Best Director (Critics), Best Actor Female (Critics), Best Supporting Actor Male (Popular) and Jury Special Mention for Kharaj Mukherjee. The film was selected in the Indian Vista section of the 17th Third Eye Asian Film Festival, Mumbai, 2018, between 14‚Äì20 December. It got an overwhelming response from a full house and a 3* critics' rating. Next, the film was screened at the 9th Asian Film Festival, Pune, held at the National Film Archive of India there from 24‚Äì30 December 2018. It was selected in the Indian Vista section. Rongberonger Korhi was screened in the Cinema of the World section of the 17th Dhaka International Film Festival held between 10‚Äì18 January 2019, in Dhaka. The screenings were at the National Library of Bangladesh auditorium and at the Shilpakala Academy of Bangladesh. The film was selected in the 'Chitrabharati (Indian Cinema) Competition' section of the 11th Bengaluru International Film Festival, 2019, organized by the Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy and supported by the Government of Karnataka. It was held between 21‚Äì28 February.  National Film Awards  The Times of India reported on January 1, 2018, that Rongberonger Korhi could not be sent for the National Film Awards for the year 2017 owing to the pending CBFC Certification, following the row created by the demonstrations and protests by the Hindu fringe group. While rueing this lost opportunity, the director had reportedly mentioned that the issue at stake was more important than any awards.  Theatrical release  The film eventually released on March 23 to wide positive press and a very positive word-of-mouth publicity but a low key pre-release publicity campaign resulted in a feeble audience response in the opening weekend. It completed a total three-week run in the city theatres and another two-week run in the suburbs, thus totaling a five-week run overall.

The August 2017 induction ceremony was ProRodeo's 38th annual event, and marked the first time in the event's history that the class of inductees included barrel racers from the Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA). Bush competed in the Girl's Rodeo Association (GRA), now known as the Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA) and won two World Barrel Racing Championships, in 1952 and 1953.  Early life  Bush was born Wanda Harper in Mason, Texas, on October 6, 1931, to Alvin and Gussie Harper. She first helped her father with goat tying on their ranch but soon graduated to roping calves. She became as proficient as men and, with her horse, Eagle, won a roping contest against a man. The story never circulated far since Bush quietly defeated her opponent and moved on. Bush assisted her father with the ranch duties in many capacities, from ranch chores to punching cows and sheep. She also developed a strong foundation in horsemanship throughout her childhood, riding horses at the ranch. When Bush attended school, she wore her pants under her dress so she could ride her horse the 3 miles it took to catch the school bus at the end of their road. At school she would remove her pants for the day and then put them back on to go home.  Career   Competition  When Bush started competing professionally, the sanctioning organization for women's rodeo was the Girl's Rodeo Association (GRA). Bush became one of the first cowgirls to join the GRA, so her card number was 14. Bush was 21 when she won her first National Barrel Racing Championship in 1952. She won again in 1953. She ultimately won 32 world championship titles, in several different rodeo events, including flag racing, calf roping, and ribbon roping. Bush also participated and won in a non-rodeo event, a western event known as cutting. Bush attributed much of her success to her father's horsemanship and his horses. Especially important to her was her horse, Dee Gee, on whom she won her two national barrel racing championships. When asked about her championships while riding Dee Gee, Bush said \\"I just did what I did, and I discovered I could ride as good as anyone else could.\\" Bush competed locally and nationally, including match races and stock shows, including the notable Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo and winning often against both genders. The GRA became the Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA) in 1981. Bush's two barrel racing championships are presently recognized by the WPRA and the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) as World Barrel Racing Championships.2017 Barrel Racing Records, World Records & Season Stats ‚Äì World Champion Barrel Racers, p. 6.  Finals events  Barrel racing is still sanctioned by the WPRA but is now part of PRCA rodeos and its finals take place alongside men's events such as bull riding and tie-down roping at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR), which is held every December at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. However, the National Finals Steer Roping event is held separately, in Mulvane, Kansas. Bush qualified for the NFR seven times in her rodeo career. When Bush competed in the NFR, it was held in several different locations.  Horses  In Bush's GRA competition period, her horse Dee Gee was \\"pivotal\\" to her success in barrel racing. Bush retired Dee Gee in 1955 and made her a broodmare in 1958. Dee Gee bore seven colts, with descendants still competing today. Bush also rode the horse Flying Eagle successfully in a number of events. Wanda and her husband, Stanley, both competed in cutting, and both were very successful. Stanley said that their horse Royal Chess was the best cutting horse he ever rode. Royal Chess was out of Phoebe Chess by Royal King. The National Cutting Horse Association (NCHA) Hall of Fame inducted Royal Chess in 1970 when he was owned by Clyde Bauer. Dee Gee and Phoebe Chess provided foundation stock at the Bush's ranch.  Career summary  Bush was semi-retired by her mid- sixties. During her career, Bush won 32 world titles: 9 all-around (1952, 1957, 1958, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1968, 1969), 2 barrel racing titles (1952, 1953), two cutting world titles (1966, 1969), 1 flag racing world title (1969), 11 calf roping titles (1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1960, 1962, 1964, 1966, 1967) and seven ribbon roping titles (1951, 1953, 1954, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959). She became reserve world champion in barrel racing 3 times. Even though Bush won her two barrel racing titles prior to when the NFR began, she qualified 7 times (1959, 1960, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, and 1974) for the NFR during her career. Bush has won more awards than any other cowgirl in the WPRA. In 1968, Bush opened her first clinic in Austin, Texas, to teach barrel racing and horsemanship. As her competition days waned, she opened more clinics. Bush had many successful students. After her death in 2015, the response from her former students was huge and included many top cowgirls. As of 2018, Bush still has won more championships and awards than any other rodeo woman.  Retirement  Bush continued her involvement in rodeo after her retirement. In 1992, at age 62, she competed in the Old Fort Days Futurity. She rode her daughter's mount Flaming Patrick, winning a cash prize and reserve title after not having competed in years. She also served on the GRA Board of Directors in several different positions. In 1969, she had won the aforementioned Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. Later she secured a GRA- sanctioned barrel race for said show and rodeo. In the 1980s, GRA President Jimmie Munroe asked her to act as the Texas Circuit Director of the RAM National Circuit Finals Rodeo (RNCFR) to resolve an issue concerning equal purse money for women in the PRCA. Bush leveraged her rodeo contacts with all of the Texas rodeo committees to persuade them not to leave the WPRA over the issue. Bush is credited with convincing every rodeo in Texas to pay in so the event could remain. \\"She was very proud when they got equal money; it was something she always wanted,\\" noted Shanna.  Personal life  Bush preferred a reserved lifestyle, but the fans loved her, so she occasionally attended events to please them. Bush appeared in Rolling Stone magazine in the same issue as rock star Bruce Springsteen and also appeared in the television game show To Tell the Truth. In 1957, Wanda married Stanley Bush. In 1959, they had one daughter, Shanna, who qualified for the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) in barrel racing in 1984. Bush suffered a heart attack on December 27, 2015, while at home in Mason, Texas. She was admitted to the hospital in Brady, Texas, and died two days later, on December 29. After her death, Jimmie Munroe, past WPRA President, described her as \\"the greatest horsewoman of all time\\".

It is a mostly terrestrial unit deposited during a marine regression close to the shoreline. The dinosaur Dahalokely has been discovered in the formation.  Description  The section containing the Dahalokely site is informally termed the \\"Ambolafotsy Formation\\" and is divided into lower, middle (containing the type locality), and upper units. The lower unit has produced several biostratigraphically informative foraminifera, including Whiteinella aprica, W. baltica, Helvetoglobotruncana praehelvetica, and H. helvetica, and the nannofossil Quadrum gartneri, placing the sample within the Q. gartneri and H. helvetica zones. The upper unit contains the ammonite Subprionocyclus neptuni. The sediments of most of the middle unit of the Ambolafotsy Formation are interpreted as terrestrial, deposited during a marine regression. Carbonized plant fragments are quite common in the middle unit, along with claystones, shales, and cross-bedded sandstones. Marine microfossils and macrofossils are generally absent, although a deposit of ostreids several meters above the type locality for Dahalokely suggests that the area was deposited close to the shoreline.Near Ampandriambengy, around the area of Antsiranana at Fossilworks.org  See also  * List of fossiliferous stratigraphic units in Madagascar * Geology of Madagascar  References  Category:Geologic formations of Madagascar Category:Cretaceous Madagascar Category:Paleontology in Madagascar Category:Upper Cretaceous Series of Africa Category:Turonian Stage Category:Shale formations Category:Sandstone formations Formations ","title":"Ambolafotsy Formation"},{"id":"57857157","text":"Claude Sadio (born 29 October 1943) is a Senegalese basketball player.

He served as the County Governor of Finnmark county from 1922 until 1928 and then he was the County Governor of Vest-Agder county from 1928 until 1948. Personal life Hagbarth Lund was born on 5 March 1877 in Kristiania, Norway. His father, Eilert Christian Lund, was a ship's captain. His mother was Mary Falch. Hagbarth Lund married Dagny B√∏ckmann in 1915. He died on 23 July 1963. Education and career Lund graduated from the Kristiania Cathedral School in 1897. He then received his cand.jur. degree in 1903. He practiced as a prosecutor in Tana Municipality from 1907 to 1922. During that time he also served several other roles. He was the mayor of Tana Municipality from 1908 to 1916, having run for the Liberal Party. From 1910 to 1914 he was a member of Finnmark County Committee. In 1913, he was elected to the Storting (Norwegian Parliament), representing Finnmark county, a seat he held until 1924. In 1922, he was appointed to be the County Governor of Finnmark county, so he left parliament and a deputy filled in for the rest of his term which ended in 1924. From 1925 to 1930 he was elected as a deputy representative to Parliament representing the Market towns of Nordland, Troms and Finnmark, meaning he only served in Parliament if the representative was unable. This was the case from 1928 to 1930, where he served almost the whole period. In 1928, he was appointed to be the County Governor in Vest-Agder county. He continued in that role until the German occupation of Norway. He resigned in 1941 rather than support the Nasjonal Samling government, but after the liberation of Norway, he resumed his job until his retirement in 1948. From 1942 to 1945 while Lund was not governor, Iver Leuch Elieson was the German-occupation government's governor of Vest-Agder.

The terrain is typical for eastern Denmark and yet challenging due to its complex varieties of vegetation ‚Äì from thick spruce forest to hilly, yet fast old beech forest areas. Despite the fact that wood cutting has been extensive over the previous years, large areas of old spruce still provides for fast running. 24 champions were celebrated the third final day 13 July 2018.

Hirota collaborated on the original game with Masaharu Iwata, Yasunori Mitsuda and Ryo Fukuda. For its sequel Shadow Hearts: Covenant, Mitsuda returned and was joined by Kenji Ito and Tomoko Kobayashi. The final game From the New World saw Fukuda return with newcomers Tomoko Imoto and Hirotomi Imoto. The Shadow Hearts series originated in the 1999 role-playing game Koudelka, the music of which was composed by company founder Hiroki Kikuta. Each game has received a soundtrack album, with Hirota also producing an arrange album of Shadow Hearts music. Hirota's work on the Shadow Hearts series was directly influenced by his work as a sound designer. The first game's music encompassed a wide range of music genres, with Hirota not wanting it to sound like something from a movie. He also sought to emulate his Gothic-style sound design of Koudelka. The score for Covenant increased the dynamic and emotional elements while retaining the original game's musical style. For From the New World, the team incorporated ethnic elements to represent its setting in the Americas. The recurring theme \\"Icaro\\" was initially designed to represent the lead characters of Shadow Hearts, and went on to recur in arranged forms in its two sequels. Reception of the music has generally been positive. Series overview Shadow Hearts is a series of role-playing video games for the PlayStation 2 (PS2) produced by Japanese studio Sacnoth, which was later rebranded as Nautilus. The Shadow Hearts series originated as a continuation of Koudelka, an RPG for the original PlayStation conceived by former Square staff member Hiroki Kikuta, who founded Sacnoth to develop the game. The tone of Koudelka inspired that game's art director Matsuzo Machida (originally credited as Matsuzo Itakura) to create the titular first game, which was set in the same universe as Koudelka. Machida took on the role of director. Shadow Hearts was followed by two sequels‚ÄîShadow Hearts: Covenant and the spin-off title Shadow Hearts: From the New World‚Äîbefore Nautilus was absorbed into Aruze in 2007 and ended video game production, ultimately ceasing to exist during corporate restructuring in 2009. Shadow Hearts Shadow Hearts Original Soundtrack Plus1 The music for the original Shadow Hearts was composed by Yoshitaka Hirota. Hirota worked on the game's music alongside Masaharu Iwata, Yasunori Mitsuda and Ryo Fukuda. Hirota had originally worked as a sound designer on Koudelka. Mitsuda was both an old friend and a frequent collaborator with Hirota on their earlier projects for Square, contributing around ten songs to the soundtrack. Iwata had previously worked on the score of Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, while Fukuda was brought in by Hirota based on their past experience working on the score for Sonic Shuffle. While creating the soundtrack, Hirota wanted to use his background in sound design to make a successor to the \\"Gothic\\" style he created for Koudelkas sound effects. Itakura gave Hirota's team a basic outline of the game's setting and premise. Hirota's intent was to make the soundtrack \\"beautiful yet destructive\\", not wanting players to think it was like a movie score. The soundtrack included over fifty songs, which was a large project for Hirota at this time. He included elements of punk, new wave industrial rock, techno, electronic rock and orchestra. His aim was to create \\"personal, future ethnic music\\". Upon first hearing the result, producer Jun Mihara was shocked, as to him the music sounded like a random jumble of genres somehow being fitted together. Despite the shock, he was impressed with the young team's efforts, which motivated him to make the game itself match these images. The game's vocal elements had multiple contributors; the main theme \\"Icaro\\" and several additional vocals were provided by Kyoko Kishikawa, while the ending theme \\"Shadow Hearts\\" was sung by Hiroko Kasahara. \\"Icaro\\" was put together quickly for an internal demo. Hirota wanted the theme to be \\"short yet striking\\". Its use in the game's opening sequence where the main protagonist saves the main heroine was intended to show the game's focus on these two characters. Later versions of \\"Icaro\\" were used to connect back to that scene and its meaning. The lyrics of \\"Shadow Hearts\\" were written by James H. Woan, with lyrics in both Japanese and English. Track titles were also created by Woan. A 2CD soundtrack album for the game, Shadow Hearts Original Soundtrack Plus1, was published by music label Scitron on June 18, 2001. A reprint of the album was released on January 19, 2005. RPGFan called the music \\"a score of a beauty and quality rarely seen in an OST, that easily stands among the best in recent memory\\", praising its ambience and unconventional orchestration, although they found some tracks overly dark. The reviewer ended by lauding Hirota's work on the album. Video Game Music Online gave the album a score of 4.5 stars out of 5. The reviewer, while calling the album in general \\"a mixed bag\\", praised the emotion and thematic variety displayed by the music. Particular praise went to the battle theme \\"Near Death Experience\\", main theme \\"Icaro\\", and the vocal theme \\"Shadow Hearts\\". His main criticism was towards tracks such as \\"But-Dad-Dead-Bed\\" and \\"Sweet Pillows\\", which were cited as either uninspired or poorly constructed. He finished by saying \\"anyone with a taste for adventure and creativity will enjoy this soundtrack significantly\\". Reviewers of the game also praised the music. Gerald Villoria, writing for GameSpot, praised the soundtrack the audio's strongest point despite some repetition. David Smith of IGN praised the variety and quality of the soundtrack, though he felt Mitsuda's tracks were weaker than his other works. Patrick Gann of RPGFan described the soundtrack as \\"nothing short of brilliant\\", describing it as potentially the best RPG soundtrack of 2001. Shadow Hearts II Original Soundtrack Composition for Shadow Hearts: Covenant, known in Japan as Shadow Hearts II, was led by Hirota. Mitsuda returned from the original Shadow Hearts, along with series newcomers Kenji Ito and Tomoko Kobayashi; Kobayashi, a staff member at Sacnoth, was responsible for writing some short story-related pieces. The soundtrack includes over sixty songs. Mitsuda contributed between five and six solo pieces, along with working on a few collaborative tracks. The music for the game, as included on the soundtrack album, was composed between June 2002 and the end of 2003. According to sound director Hirotomi Imoto, he asked the composers to take the original sound for Shadow Hearts, deconstruct it and rebuild it. The composers used different tones for their tracks; Hirota created \\"dark\\" tracks, Mitsuda focused on melodies with a \\"beautiful face\\", and Ito's themes were \\"mental\\". Due to the game's shift in tone compared to the original, Hirota wanted a soundtrack that was more dynamic and emotional without surrendering the signature Shadow Hearts sound. Mitsuda had difficulty during early production as he wanted to adapt his music to better fit the Shadow Hearts universe, but at Hirota's insistence he maintained his own style which was fitted into the game's overall score. Covenant was Ito's very first project for the PS2, his first time working with Hirota and Mitsuda, and the first time he ever collaborated on a major track, this being the final boss theme \\"The 3 Karma\\". \\"The 3 Karma\\" was co-composed by Hirota, Mitsuda and Ito. The piece came together after the three composers had a private meeting, and after the speed and tempo were set each was allowed to go in their own direction. Because of the battle's style, a limited number of instruments were used for the theme. During the recording process, there was a combination of scripted music and improvisations from the performers. The previous game's main theme \\"Icaro\\" was included as a part of the soundtrack, with Hirota rearranging it while preserving its core musical notes. The ending theme \\"Getsurenka\\" was written by Hirota, with lyrics by Kumiko Hasegawa, and performed by Mio Isayama. \\"Getsurenka\\" was described by Machida as the \\"true feelings\\" of main heroine Karin. Its tone, according to the producer Asako Oikawa, was decided upon once he and Machida had finalized the game's ending. The lyrics were intended to be the words heroine Karin Koenig wanted to say to Yuri but was unable to before that point. Upon receiving the request, Hasegawa was inspired by their combined effect with a near-full moon outside her home to turn off all the lights and write the lyrics by moonlight; the song was written as a love poem. Isayama was so impressed by the emotion within the lyrics that she \\"sang from [her] heart\\". A 2CD soundtrack album, Shadow Hearts II Original Soundtrack, was published by Team Entertainment on March 24, 2004. Video Game Music Online was very positive, citing the battle themes as one of the album's strengths and giving praise to the environmental and dungeon themes. He enjoyed Mitsuda's contributions despite their low number, but felt Ito's use of electronica made his tracks contrast against the rest of the album. Jesse Jones of RPGFan was generally positive, with tracks such as \\"Astaroth\\" and the ending theme receiving particular praise, but he felt that several tracks felt lacking compared to the first game. Some tracks including \\"Town of Twilight\\" suffered in Jones's eyes due to their overuse in Covenant. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com praised the soundtrack, positively mentioning Mitsuda's contributions. GamePro positively noted that the music \\"gets dramatic during every battle\\", and Bethany Massimilla of GameSpot found it enjoyable and praised the battle and main themes. IGNs Jeremy Dunham felt that the soundtrack was not as good as the first game, but still called it a strength of the game. Mark Marrow of PALGN said the score \\"does a nice job of fitting in with the context of each area\\", and RPGFans Mike Bracken echoed Dunham's opinion on the score's weakness compared to Shadow Hearts despite saying that anyone interested in game music should get the soundtrack album. Shadow Hearts: From the New World Original Soundtrack Composition for From the New World was once more led by Hirota, who was joined by Fukuda and newcomers Tomoko Imoto and Hirotomi Imoto, the latter also acting as sound director. Due to the game's setting of the Americas, the soundtrack made heavy use of ethnic instruments and vocals, with the overall theme being \\"thirst\\"; this was meant to evoke both the desert environment and people's thirst for connections. For the lyrics, the team used both Latin and Italian. The production of the soundtrack, as with the rest of the game, was on a tight schedule and caused trouble for some members. Before starting on the score, Hirota researched the cultures of Native American tribes, seeing a shared belief in coexistence with the world that informed his concept for the game's music. After his research, he came up with the concept of ancient instruments fusing with modern electronic elements, which would become the main theme of the score. Hirota handled the majority of the tracks, with his first completed piece being the theme \\"Dream Catcher\\", which played during a key story sequence. Fukada, who previously played a minor role for the last two Shadow Hearts titles, was invited by Hirota to contribute solo tracks to the score. Fukada acted as both composer and arranger for the game. Tomoko Imoto was a Sacnoth employee whom Hirota had met when they were part of the band for a live concert. A number of ethnic instruments were used throughout the score, including a didgeridoo and a caj√≥n. Their use tied into the game's setting of the \\"new world\\". As with Covenant, the series' main theme \\"Icaro\\" was used in an arranged form; this time it appeared in the opening theme \\"Great Ghost Dance\\". The choral work for the game was led by Akiko Shikata. During her work on the chorus segments, including the spirit sequences, she had to redo several of her tracks so they would come off as primal, with one piece needing to be redone when Imoto rung her up and complained that it sounded like a \\"men's festival\\"; she adjusted it so it sounded more ceremonial. For one early segment set inside a theater, Shikata used the aria \\"D'Oreste, d'Ajace\\" from the opera Idomeneo by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. She picked the area due to its dark tone, consequently working it into the environment. The chorus work included the use of Tuvan throat singing for some tracks including \\"Dream Catcher\\" and \\"Great Ghost Dance\\". The game's ending theme \\"Spread My Wings\\" was composed by Hirota, and written and sung by Takehara Tomoaki of the indie funk band Taste of Chocolate. A 2CD soundtrack album, Shadow Hearts: From the New World Original Soundtrack, was released by Team Entertainment on August 24, 2005. Video Game Music Online was generally positive about the album, enjoying several tracks including the \\"Fusion\\" themes of heroine Shania and different environment themes due to fitting their locations fairly well. The ending theme \\"Spread My Wings\\" was criticised as inferior to the previous theme songs. Summarising the album, the reviewer said: \\"Overall, it's a good album. Not great, since many of the themes have the potential to become very repetitive after repeated listenings.\\" Wilson felt that the soundtrack was much stronger than that of Covenant though still inferior to the first game, and despite an uneven start the album was generally strong. Massimilla said that the score \\"remains oddly compelling in the Shadow Hearts style\\". Dunham was highly positive about the game's soundtrack, giving it high praise in contrast to his opinions on the voice acting. Tristan Kalogeropoulos of PALGN praised the music, saying it matched the game's tone and tied the action together. Gann said that, despite some \\"redundant\\" town themes, the soundtrack was one of the game's strongest elements despite disliking \\"Spread My Wings\\". Other albums Koudelka Original Soundtrack The music for Koudelka was composed by Kikuta, who had previously composed the scores of Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 3 and Soukaigi for Square; he wrote the music alongside his roles as the game's director, producer and writer. Kikuta found composing the score the easiest part of development due to mainly working on his own. His concept for the musical elements of Koudelka were created alongside the setting and narrative. The score was arranged by Kikuta and Nick Ingman. To compose the most of the game's tracks, Kikuta used Atari Notator sound software. While he found the lack of compression an issue, the better sequencing compared to the software he used for earlier games was very useful when creating the score for the CGI cutscenes. Due to there being a smaller amount of music than the average RPG, the score was completed within six months. Rather than having looping tracks like his earlier work with Square, the soundtrack of Koudelka used ambient sounds and short tracks related to cutscenes outside of battle themes. The game featured influences from church music. The opening vocal theme \\"Requiem\\" was performed by Catherine Bott, while the ending theme \\"Ubi Caritas et amor\\"‚Äîtaken from a larger composition by Maurice Durufl√©‚Äîwas performed by the London Oratory School. Excerpts from the score were used in a CD drama adaptation of the game released in November 1999 by Scitron Digital Contents. The soundtrack album for the game, Koudelka Original Soundtrack, was published on December 1, 1999 by Pony Canyon and Scitron Digital Contents, featuring over an hour of music across 34 tracks. The album included all tracks from the game, and live versions of three of the battle themes arranged by Naoya Akimoto. Harry Simons of Video Game Music Online gave a mixed opinion of the album, praising several tracks but finding the rest either lacking or poorly written. RPGFans Patrick Gann was highly positive about the game's music aside from the live tracks, which he referred to as \\"a bomb\\". Reviewers of the games were divided about the soundtrack. GameSpots Ike Sato called the soundtrack \\"simply amazing\\", and Jake Alley of RPGamer enjoyed most aspects of the music while finding the battle themes clashed with the game's tone. David Zdyrko of IGN was unimpressed by the environmental music and called the battle themes \\"very worst... [that have] ever been used in a console role-playing game.\\" Ken Chu, writing for RPGFan, found the soundtrack disappointing compared to Kikuta's previous work. Dutch magazine Power Unlimited was particularly scathing, calling the music \\"a disaster\\". Near Death Experience: Shadow Hearts Arrange Tracks Planning for the arrange album Near Death Experience began as Hirota was producing the soundtrack of From the New World. The album's title derived from his opinion that senses were interconnected. The main wish of Hirota was to rid himself of the practical side of music development, which had previously restrained his creative abilities for the Shadow Hearts series and involved working with multiple composers who stuck to their own styles due to time constraints. For the remixes, Hirota decided to experiment with his own style while retaining the core of each track. The album featured tracks from all three Shadow Hearts games, covering compositions by Hirota, Mitsuda, Ito and Imoto. Each also provided arrangements; Hirota handled five out of the eleven tracks, while the others worked on two each. The album was published by Team Entertainment on August 24, 2005. These four also arranged the tracks. The two music critics who reviewed the title had split opinions on the album despite generally liking the tracks included. Video Game Music Onlines Eduardo Friedman called the album \\"fantastic\\", particularly noting arrangmeents for the titular battle theme from the first game and Hirota's arrangmenet of \\"The 3 Karma\\". Mike Wilson of RPGFan ranked the album as a 6.5 out of 10. While he enjoyed some arrangements, he felt there was a general lack of effort put into the arrangements. A track criticised by both was Mitsuda's arrangement of Covenant boss theme \\"Astaroth\\", which they felt was inferior to the original.

She studied at the Women‚Äôs Department of King‚Äôs College with John Byam Shaw, and at Westminster Technical Institute with Walter Sickert and Harold Gilman. She was influenced by the Camden Town Group, and joined its successor, The London Group (LG) in 1914. Her early works were considered radical, challenging the traditionalism of the Royal Academy of Arts. In spite of severe criticism, she persisted in establishing herself as a modernist artist. By the 1920s and 1930s she was widely recognized for the quality of her work. She showed her works consistently from 1914 to 1960, a sustained career of almost half a century. She is recognized as an important contributor to the London Group. Life Emily Mary Godwin was born at Stoke Bishop, a suburb of Bristol, in 1887. From 1908 to 1910 Mary Godwin studied in London with John Byam Shaw, who taught at The Women‚Äôs Department of King‚Äôs College. From 1911 to 1914 Godwin studied at the Westminster School of Art under Walter Sickert. In 1915 she studied with Harold Gilman, who influenced her use of colour. Known initially as Miss E. M. Godwin, Mary Godwin soon dropped her first name, perhaps because another Chelsea artist was already exhibiting as E. Godwin. Miss L. C. Godwin, possibly a sister of Mary Godwin, was also an artist and lived at Stoke Bishop, Bristol before moving to Cornwall in the 1920s. Mary Godwin lived most of her life in London, at addresses including 225, 253, and 68 Hampstead Road. She also painted in the West Country, France and Madeira, Portugal. Career Mary Godwin is first listed as exhibiting at the New English Art Club (NEAC) and the London Salon of the Allied Artists Association (AAA) in 1913. She showed her works consistently in The London Group's exhibitions from 1914 to 1960. In addition to the LG, NEAC and AAA, her works appeared at the Bloomsbury Gallery, the Chenil Gallery, the Goupil Gallery, the Manchester City Art Gallery, the National Portrait Society, and even the Royal Academy. Harold Gilman died in 1919, after only a short time at the Westminster School of Art, but by then he had inspired a loyal group of followers, including Mary Godwin, Ruth Doggett, and Marjorie Sherlock, who carried on with his approach into the 1920s and 1930s.\\"Pupils and followers\\" in The Camden Town Group, p. 68, at thefineartsociety.com Thirty-three of Godwin's paintings were displayed in a solo show at the Leger Galleries in London as of January 1936, including The Bay, The Villa, and English Bay, Vancouver. An illustration of The Bay was included in the January 1st issue of Apollo. Godwin's painting A Back-Room in Somerstown is featured on the back cover of Jane Johnson's Works exhibited at the Royal Society of British Artists, 1824-1893 and the New English Art Club, 1888-1917 : an Antique Collectors' Club research project (c1975). Critical reception Sketch of \\"Ethel\\" by Mary Godwin, 1914 Many of Mary Godwin's early works were regarded as radical. With others of The London Group, she was seen as challenging the Royal Academy of Arts which was viewed as traditionalist. In 1914, Walter Sickert presented M. Godwin's sketch \\"Ethel: A Modern Drawing\\" as an exemplar in his series of \\"Modern drawings\\" in the magazine The New Age. Godwin's painting A Back-Room in Somerstown was published in The Sunday Times in 1914. The Queen magazine complimented her \\"subtleties of light and colour\\" in 1915. Others were considerably less complimentary to the modernism of The London Group. The Connoisseur reviewed the third exhibition of the London Group in 1916 and concluded that it contained \\"several paintings and drawings which came within the category of art, and many others which could only be regarded as pieces of foolishness.\\" Mary Godwin was one of four artists individually mentioned, as was Sylvia Gosse. By 1936, the radicalism of Mary Godwin's work was no longer being emphasized and the quality of her work was more recognized. The Times described the paintings in her solo show at the Leger Galleries as \\"so sedate in feeling and so completely realised in execution\\". A reviewer in February's Apollo noted her \\"undoubted capacity\\". The Times reviewer noted the influences of Walter Sickert and Charles Ginner, but credited Godwin with \\"her own taste in colour\\". The Apollo reviewer also compared her work approvingly to that of Charles Ginner, noting an \\"unconscious affinity\\" in their use of colour and choice of subject. As of 1940, Godwin's work was shown at the Royal Academy. Her Flower-women of Madeira was number 386 in the 1940 catalogue. Godwin continued to paint and to exhibit until her death in 1960, throughout a career that produced almost half a century of sustained work. Her achievements are in strong contrast to the social expectations of her youth. In 1913, many of Sickert‚Äôs pupils were women, but however talented they might be, they were rarely taken seriously as artists. They were expected to marry rather than have lasting careers, and their works were less likely to be featured in solo exhibitions or acquired by public galleries. A century later, critics are reassessing Godwin's work and that of other British women artists, recognizing the importance of such women‚Äôs artistic achievements and the transformation in gender roles that occurred during her lifetime. Cultural references Godwin's painting A Back Room in Somers Town provides the title for a mystery by John Malcolm. Paintings by Mary Godwin and Walter Sickert are important to the plot of the book.

The suite has several integrated instruments: Raman spectroscopy, time- resolved fluorescence (TRF) spectroscopy, and Visible and InfraRed (VISIR) reflectance spectroscopy to provide preliminary information about the mineralogy and molecular structure of samples under consideration, as well as being able to directly measure organic compounds.NASA's Mars 2020 Rover Update: SuperCam Will Detect Organic Materials. Himanshu Goenka, International Business Times. 26 September 2017. The total is four complementary spectrometers, making the suite sensitive enough to measure trace amounts of chemicals. In April 2018, SuperCam entered the final stages of assembly and testing. LIBS Its remote laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) emits a 1064-nm red laser beam to investigate targets as small as a grain of rice from a distance of more than 7 meters, allowing the rover to study targets beyond the reach of its arm. The beam vaporizes a tiny amount of rock, creating a hot plasma. SuperCam then measures the colors of light in the plasma, which provide clues to the target's elemental composition. Its laser is also capable of remotely clearing away surface dust, giving all of its instruments a clear view of the targets. LIBS unit contains three spectrometers. Two of these handle the visible and violet portion of the VISIR spectra, while the IR portion is recorded in the mast.The SuperCam Remote Sensing Instrument Suite for the Mars 2020 Rover: A Preview. Roger C. Wiens, Sylvestre Maurice, Fernando Rull Perez. Spectroscopy. Volume 32, Issue 5, pg 54. 1 May 2017. Raman spectroscopy SuperCam's Raman spectrometer (at 532 nm) investigates targets up to 12 m from the rover. In the Raman spectroscopy technique, most of the green laser light reflects back at the same wavelength that was sent, but a small fraction of the light interacts with the target molecules, changing the wavelength in proportion to the vibrational energy of the molecular bonds. By spectrally observing the returned Raman light, the identity of the minerals can be determined. IR spectrometer The infrared spectrometer, provided by France, operates in the near-infrared (1.3 to 2.6 micrometers) wavelengths and its photodiodes, or detectors, are cooled by small thermoelectric coolers to ensure that they operate between ‚àí100 ¬∞C and ‚àí50 ¬∞C at all times. This instrument will analyze many of the clay minerals and help unravel the history of liquid water on Mars. The types of clay minerals and their abundances give clues about the nature of the water that was present, whether fresh or salty, acidic or neutral pH, whether it might have been icy or warm, and whether the water was present for a long period of time. These are key questions to understand how habitable the surface environment was in the distant past. Camera/telescope SuperCam's optical camera acquires high-resolution color images of samples under study, which also help determine the surface geology. This camera can also study how atmospheric water and dust absorb or reflect solar radiation, which may help to develop weather forecasts. SuperCam is also equipped with a microphone to capture the first audio recordings from the surface of Mars. The microphone is the same model (Knowles Electret) as the ones that flew to Mars on the 1998 Mars Polar Lander and the 2007 Phoenix lander. However, neither mission was able to record sounds. Spectrometers ‚Äì Table  The detectors of all four spectrometers are cooled to just below 0 ¬∞C by thermoelectric coolers.

With a construction history dating at least as far back as 1725, it is one of the city's oldest surviving buildings, with a long history of association with early settlers of the area. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description and history The Buckingham House is located in what is now a residential area north of downtown Milford, on the east side of North Street at its junction with Maple Street. It is a 2-1/2 story timber framed structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The siding on the front of the house is wide sawn boards with beading, and is believed to be old if not original to the house's construction. The front facade has an unusual configuration, with five bays on the first floor and three on the second, all in a symmetrical arrangement. The entrance is in the center bay, framed by moulding and topped by a projecting cornice. The interior has a number of original or older finishes, and architectural evidence of the First Period methods used to frame the structure. With The land on which the house stands was allocated to Thomas Buckingham during the first period of colonial settlement, in 1639. Although it is possible that portions of the house structure (including its frame and chimney stack) date to the 17th century, a significant number of its features are characteristic of late First Period construction, suggesting a construction date around 1725. The house underwent a number of alterations in the 18th century, especially after 1753, when Jehiel Bryan, a carpenter, married into the Buckingham family. Most of its significant architectural features date to the 18th or early 19th century.

Between 1978 and 1985, it was the only mortgage institution in Nigeria. According to the constitution of Nigeria, the Federal Mortgage Bank was established to meet the housing needs of all citizens of the country. It is regarded as the apex mortgage finance institution in the country and regulates the activities of primary mortgage loan originators. History A direct government intervention to expand the mortgage industry in Nigeria, the bank was established by the military government of Olusegun Obasanjo to be a wholesale and retail credit institution that would provide long term financing to home buyers, building material firms and mortgage financial institutions. The initial plan was to make the company pool long term deposits from government sources, mortgage companies, pension and trust funds and private individuals to fund its credit activities at competitive interest rates. The law founding the bank came in effect in January 1977 and also gave the bank the ability to guarantee construction loans financed from private investments. The bank inherited the assets of a previous Nigerian building society following the dissolution of the latter. However, the objectives of the federal government's housing policy was slow to become a realization, in 1989 the administration of Ibrahim Babangida liberalized the housing finance sector and opened up opportunities for retail oriented primary mortgage institutions. FMBN was propositioned to become a regulator of the primary mortgage originators as the apex mortgage lending institution in the country and its primary mortgage lending activities was taken over by the Federal Mortgage Finance Company of Nigeria. In furtherance of expanding mortgage financing to more Nigerians, the government established the National Housing Fund that included a mandatory contribution scheme to mobilize funds to develop the mortgage sector. The activities of the bank has been geared towards the development and regulation of primary mortgage originators and managing the National Housing Fund.

It is the 31st overall episode of the series and is written by Amanda Segel and directed by Helen Shaver. It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on November 29, 2012. Plot Flashback In 2006, after going on a date with Grace (Carrie Preston), Finch (Michael Emerson) organizes a gift for her birthday. On her birthday, Grace gets instructions for a scavenger hunt that Finch has made. After following the steps, she arrives at a gallery where Finch has personally brought the painting she admired on Venice. They then share a kiss. Present day The Machine gives the numbers of a couple: Daniel (Mark Pellegrino) and Sabrina Drake (Francie Swift), both CFOs of an editorial. They suspect a Maryland militia leader may be the one targeting them as they recently published an indictment. Reese (Jim Caviezel) follows Sabrina and Daniel, finding that Daniel has let a board member decide the fate of their company as their income has declined, angering Sabrina. Later, Reese notices a man planting a bomb on Sabrina's car, which he quickly disarms and throws away. Finch intercepts a call between Daniel and the man, discovering that Daniel ordered the hit on Sabrina. Reese then has Carter (Taraji P. Henson) investigate the hitman, and she partners with narcotics detective, Cal Beecher (Sterling K. Brown) to get information about the man. Reese then attends a book signing where the Drakes meet and a protest ensues outside. He spots a sniper in a building targeting Daniel and he saves him but the sniper flees. Finch then finds that Sabrina contacted the sniper, and both realize that the Drakes ordered a hit on each other. Finch then calls Fusco (Kevin Chapman), who decided to ignore his calls to meet a woman on a date, for help. He reluctantly agrees to go but to his surprise, her date, Rhonda (Tricia Paoluccio), wants to go with him, which he accepts. After avoiding the hitmen, Reese and Finch kidnap the Drakes and tie them in a house. Not getting information about the hitmen they hired, Finch acts as a marriage counselor in order to solve their issues. Reese frees them and go to their house, where they wait for the hitmen to come but he locks the Drakes on their pantry. The hitmen arrive and shoot Fusco, but he survives using a bulletproof vest. After defeating the hitmen, the Drakes are arrested. However, due to their expensive lawyers, Finch does not expect both to get long sentences. Beecher meets with Carter, who thanks him for his help, and both agree to go to dinner. Reception Viewers In its original American broadcast, \\"'Til Death\\" was seen by an estimated 14.43 million household viewers and gained a 2.9/7 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a slight decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 14.57 million viewers with a 3.1/8 in the 18-49 demographics.

Phil Dyess-Nugent of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"A-\\" grade and wrote, \\"Speaking of reasons to love this episode, did I mention that Mark Pellegrino gets punched in the face? Pellegrino plays a man who's partnered with his wife in running a small publishing house, and in one of the most remarkable stretches for an actor since Marlon Brando signed on for Guys And Dolls, he doesn't have supernatural powers and isn't running a small publishing house against the backdrop of a savage, post-apocalyptic landscape.\\" Tim Surette of TV.com wrote \\"Though 'Til Death' was overly schmaltzy almost to a fault, it weirdly fit into spectrum of what we expect from this show that continues to defy the trappings of other CBS procedurals. Maybe I'm a softy at heart, but among all the darkness of Person of Interest, 'Til Death' was a welcome ray of sunshine.\\" Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.4 star rating out of 5 and wrote \\"This was an enjoyable episode that managed to delve a bit deeper into the characters at the same time it perfectly coincided with the topic for the case of the week. And it's with those strengths, along with the stellar acting, that really does make Person of Interest continue to be a stand out show.\\"  References  External links * \\"'Til Death\\" at CBS * * \\"'Til Death\\" at TV Guide * Category:Person of Interest (TV series) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"'Til Death (Person of Interest)"},{"id":"57857965","text":"Rron Statovci (born 18 January 1997) is a Kosovo Albanian professional footballer who plays as a defender for Albanian club Partizani Tirana.

Kleinicke was named Righteous Among the Nations in 2018; he, along with Oskar Schindler, Karl Plagge and Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz, is one of the few Nazi Party members to be given this award.  Early life  Helmut Kleinicke was born on 19 November 1907 in Wildemann, in Lower Saxony, to a family of foresters. In his youth he studied civil engineering. He joined the Nazi Party in 1933. Although some survivors claimed that he had been an SS officer with the rank of Obersturmbannf√ºhrer, there is no documentary evidence that Kleinicke served in the SS, and his niece denied it. In 1941, Kleinicke was recruited into the team who started the planning and construction of Auschwitz concentration camp. Having just married a woman named Cilly, eleven years his junior, he moved to Chrzan√≥w, close to the camp.  Rescue activities  In Chrzan√≥w, Kleinicke had to pick the Jewish inhabitants who were young and able-bodied to work in the camp. Kleinicke treated his workers relatively well and made efforts to prevent transports to the death camps in the later years of the war. He did not allow SS members to harm his employees. On some occasions, he warned Jews about upcoming roundups, rescued them from being deported, hid them in his attic and his shed, or helped them flee across the border. In late 1943, his supervisors suspected that he was helping Jews escape after noticing a trend of Jews in his care disappearing, and he was removed from his position and drafted into a Wehrmacht artillery unit to fight on the northern front. Many of his former employees who stayed after his departure survived the Holocaust and provided evidence for his deeds.  Postwar  After the capitulation of Germany, Kleinicke was imprisoned by the British, and released in July 1945. In an affidavit from July 1948, Holocaust survivor Siegmund Engl√§nder wrote that Kleinicke had saved Jews \\"without regard to his person\\", and that many of the survivors from Chrzan√≥w owed their lives to his efforts. This and two similar letters convinced Kleinicke's denazification panel that he had not been a \\"convinced National Socialist\\". Kleinicke was exonerated in March 1949. He lived with his wife and only daughter (who was born after the war) in Clausthal-Zellerfeld. According to his daughter, he felt guilty that he had not saved more lives; he did not answer letters from the Jews that he had rescued. In January 1979, the American miniseries Holocaust was broadcast in Germany. Kleinicke watched it and was deeply affected. Three days later, he suffered a stroke, and died a few months afterwards. At Beth Lohamei Haguetatot, Jews from Chrzan√≥w meet annually for a reunion. Several of them survived the Holocaust because of Kleinicke's efforts. In a September 2015 documentary, Holocaust survivor Josef K√∂nigsberg testified that Kleinicke saved his life by removing him from a queue of men who were going to be deported. Spiegel Online then searched through Deutsche Dienststelle archives to corroborate the story. Yad Vashem recognized Kleinicke as Righteous Among the Nations in May 2018. The ceremony was held on 14 January 2020 at Yad Vashem, making Kleinicke the 628th German to be honoured by the organisation.

Accident  A regional train same as the derailed one. At 17:15 Turkish time on July 8, 2018, five bogies of the six-car train of Uzunk√∂pr√º-Halkalƒ± Regional operating with train number 12703 on the Istanbul-Pythio railway en route to Halkalƒ± Terminal in Istanbul derailed at near Sarƒ±lar village of √áorlu, Tekirdaƒü. Of the 362 passengers and six crew on board, 24 were killed and 318 injured. 276 lightly injured passengers were discharged from the hospitals after receiving treatment, while medical care for the 42 severely injured victims continues in hospitals in Tekirdaƒü, √áorlu and Istanbul. The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications announced in a statement right after the accident, that the derailment occurred after the railway track slipped down from its original position due to torrential rains. It was reported that the track was intact when a scheduled train passed through that location at about 10:40 local time the same day. Heavy rainfall at a rate of per hour occurred between 14:20 and 15:10 in the region. Investigations revealed that a culvert under the railway had collapsed as flood water sapped it by washing away the soil underneath its foundation, and as a result the track ballast under the tracks lost its support. However, the sleepers at that spot appeared to be in good order to the railroad engineer of the train, which was running at a speed of . The locomotive ran through without incident, then the first car derailed, although it remained upright. The following five cars, however, fully derailed and overturned, destroying of tracks. Numerous Russian news sources reported that Russian tourists were among the injured. The Radio and Television Supreme Council imposed a temporary ban on broadcasting the accident. Aftermath Halkalƒ±, Istanbul- Pehlivank√∂y, Kƒ±rklareli. Several emergency services, including AFAD, UMKE, Health Ministry emergency 112 and Gendarmerie, arrived at the scene for rescue operations. The closest distance of the highway to the accident site was approximately . Due to the muddy terrain which was a result of the sudden heavy rainfall, access by road vehicles was impossible. The victims were transported to the ambulances waiting on the highway using tractors' chaser bins provided by the villagers. Tracked vehicles had to be sent to the accident site. The injured passengers were transported to nearby hospitals by ambulances and helicopters. Rescue operations continued all night, and were completed at 6:00 hours the next day. Repair of the railroad began on 9 July. First, the ballast, sleepers, and damaged tracks were renewed from both sides. Following the restoration of the track, the overturned and damaged cars were removed on July 14 by a work force of 30 with the help of a railroad crane. The cars were transported firstly to √áorlu railway station on a freight train and from there to the Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation (MKE) in ƒ∞zmit by trucks.

He was born in New York to Rhonda and Paul Cantor, who managed acts such as B. J. Thomas and Dionne Warwick. In the early 1970s, he and his family moved to the Los Angeles area. In the early 1990s, he served as an A&R; executive for the Chrysalis Music Group. After signing Rage Against the Machine, Cantor left Chrysalis to work briefly as an agent and then a promoter, putting together some of the largest concert and dance events in the city at that time. He also entered the nightclub business, taking a 10 percent stake in Dragonfly, a club known at the time for its 1970s and hip hop theme nights. At that time he was involved romantically with actress Rose McGowan. Cantor was found dead in his Hollywood home on July 30, 1993; he had been stabbed repeatedly in the upper body. No suspect has ever been identified and the investigation remains open. His death was the subject of renewed interest a year later, when, during preliminary motions in the trial of O. J. Simpson for the killings of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman, Judge Lance Ito ruled that defense lawyers could have access to the investigatory file in the Cantor case. The defense had argued that the similarity of the three killings suggested the same person or persons had committed them. It has also been argued in books on the case that Cantor knew both Goldman and Nicole, and thus they may have been killed over mutual involvement in possibly illegal business activities. Life Cantor was born in New York in 1967. His father Paul, a former William Morris agent who had moved into managing musicians like Dionne Warwick and B. J. Thomas, moved the family to Los Angeles four years later. In his young adulthood, Brett followed his father and older brothers Cliff and Marc into the music industry. At Chrysalis Music Group, Cantor worked as an A&R; executive, looking for artists to sign and develop. In that capacity he signed Jane's Addiction and helped get Rage Against the Machine its first record contract. Both bands became stars of the early 1990s alternative rock scene. Cantor left Chrysalis to work, briefly, at the Agency for the Performing Arts. He then formed his own company called Underground Entertainment, which promoted raves. Events Underground organized at nightclubs, like Petting Zoo, Sanitarium, After Hours and L.A. Palooza were among the largest concert/dance parties in Los Angeles during that time. When nightclub owner Steve Edelson converted one of his Frolic Rooms, on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, into a different club called Dragonfly, Cantor came in as his partner, holding a 10% share in the business. Dragonfly soon became known among the city's clubgoers for its theme nights. Wednesday nights were part of a series called Superfly, focusing on 1970s music, particularly disco, while Friday night's Riot featured hip hop. The club was profitable for its owners. One spring 1993 night at Dragonfly Cantor met a young actress named Rose McGowan. The two soon became romantically involved; in her 2018 autobiography Brave, McGowan credits him with helping her escape an abusive relationship that had led her to develop an eating disorder. She considered him her soul mate. Death Early on the morning of July 30, 1993, Cantor left another nightclub, Club 434. He is not known to have been seen alive after that. Later that day, his body was found at his Hollywood home a short distance from Dragonfly. Cantor had been stabbed 23 times around the head and arms. His throat had been cut almost to the point of decapitation. Some accounts also report that he was given a Colombian necktie, his tongue pulled out through an incision in his lower jaw, as well. The body was found near Cantor's opened front door. The investigation was moved from the local precinct to the downtown headquarters of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), where it continues. No suspect has ever been identified. Aftermath Edelson could not bring himself to enter Dragonfly after Cantor's death, and sold his interest shortly afterwards. \\"Being there felt wrong, and it still does today\\" he told Los Angeles magazine in 2012. Cliff Cantor took over his brother's share and ran the club afterwards. Possible connection to O. J. Simpson murder case Almost a year later, the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson, former wife of American football player and actor O. J. Simpson, and Ronald Goldman, a waiter, were found dead with similar injuries at Brown's home in Brentwood. O.J. Simpson was arrested and charged with two counts of murder but later acquitted at trial. In September 1994, Simpson's lawyers moved to have Judge Lance Ito allow them to review the LAPD's file on the Cantor homicide. Like Cantor, Nicole and Goldman had been stabbed predominantly in the upper body, their throats severely cut. Goldman's throat, in particular, had been cut by someone reaching from behind him, starting on the left side and moving upward to the right across the neck, similar to the wound on Cantor. According to the coroner, the killer of Nicole and Goldman had also used a long thin blade, much like the one that had been used on Cantor. Ito granted the motion three weeks later, ruling that the material was \\"discoverable under Brady\\", referring to the 1963 U.S. Supreme Court decision that requires prosecutors to turn over any potentially exculpatory evidence their investigations uncover to the defense. The Simpson defense team also noted that the similarity of the killings themselves was not the only connection between the three murders. Goldman had once worked at Dragonfly as a waiter, where he was seen together with Cantor by other employees, and Nicole had often gone there with her friends to dance, raising the possibility that either or both were acquainted with Cantor. After the Simpson-Goldman murders, detectives questioned Steve Edelson about possible connections. Later, a tabloid ran a story suggesting that Edelson was behind all three slayings. He denied the claims, saying \\"the whole thing was ridiculous ... At the time there were some bad feelings in Hollywood about me.\\" Simpson's defense, which admitted at the time it requested the files that they weren't sure there was a connection, never brought the Cantor killing into evidence. Simpson was subsequently acquitted in October 1995. After the trial, author Joseph Bosco followed up on the Cantor homicide in his book A Problem of Evidence. He reported that the Cantor family had set up a tip hotline for information about Brett's death, but had it directed to them rather than the LAPD, and only shared one tip they received, which did not produce any useful leads. Cantor's family has publicly dismissed any connection between Cantor's death and the Simpson case; privately, Bosco wrote, the wife of Brett‚Äôs other brother Matt, told him she believed there was a connection between the cases. The LAPD detectives assigned to the Cantor case at the time Bosco inquired about it also denied any connection. Dallas- based author and private investigator William Dear likewise asserted in his 2014 book O.J. Simpson Is Innocent And I Can Prove It that Cantor was a diversion by the Simpson defense to protect Simpson's son Jason. Bosco stated that Cantor was under investigation by the FBI for possible involvement in the drug trade at the time of his death, and one of Jason's former girlfriends told Bosco that investigators found $130,000 in cash in a safe in Cantor's office after he was killed.

In 1984, he succeeded Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town and was appointed president of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) from 1988 to 1990. He returned to Munich in 1990 as director of the Cardiac Surgery Clinic at the Klinikum Gro√ühadern of the University of Munich (LMU). He has also been active in experimental research in xenotransplantation and from 2011 became a spokesman for funded research into the transplantation of pig tissue and organs into primates, with a team involving veterinarians, virologists, clinicians, lawyers and ethicists. Early life and education Bruno Reichart was born in Vienna in 1943 and grew up in Ingolstadt. He studied medicine at the University of Erlangen‚ÄìNuremberg and Munich University, now called Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU) and received his MD in 1968, after which he became a medical assistant at the First Gynecological Clinic of the University of Munich, the Surgical Department of the Municipal Hospital Munich-Harlaching and at the Medical Clinic of the University of Munich. Early surgical career From 1971 to 1973, Reichart worked as a surgical assistant under surgeon Rudolf Zenker and within a year was appointed visiting cardiac physician in Memphis, Tennessee, where he focused on heart, lung, and vascular surgery. Upon his return to Munich in 1974, Reichart commenced surgery at the Cardiac Surgery Clinic at the LMU. In 1977 he became its senior physician and a year later he passed his habilitation with the topic \\"The mechanical support of acute right heart failure\\", and become a cardiothoracic surgeon in 1978. Heart transplant 1981 On 19 August 1981, Reichart performed Germany's first successful heart transplant at the LMU. The procedure was previously performed more than 10 years earlier in 1969, when two heart transplants took place in the Cardiac Surgery Clinic at the LMU, but they were both unsuccessful, with one dying within two days of surgery, from a coronary thrombosis. Reichart's attempt in 1981 involved a 32-year old recipient who had experienced a heart attack a year earlier and was left with severely impaired left ventricular function. During the year until heart transplant, the recipient also experienced a large blood clot in the lung, acute heart failure and a stomach ulcer. The 23 year old donor had been killed in a road traffic accident ten days prior to transplant. Azathioprine, cortisone and Anti-thymocyte globulin were the immunosuppressants used until two rejection episodes resulted in changing therapy to cyclosporine A three weeks after surgery and they were discharged from hospital at Christmas 1981. Between 1978 and 1982, he held various professorships including the Universities of Boston, Birmingham, Milwaukee, Paris and Stanford. More than twenty heart transplant procedures followed over the next three years. Under his leadership, intermittently spanning over 40 years at LMU, more than 1,000 heart transplants were performed. Combined heart-lung transplant 1983 On 13 February 1983, Reichart was the first in Germany to perform a combined heart‚Äìlung transplant. The recipient was 27 years old and bed-bound with severe pulmonary hypertension and diseased liver and kidneys. The donor, three years younger, had died the previous day from a clot in the brain. Following the combined heart‚Äìlung transplant, the recipient died after ten days. Reichart was appointed professor at the LMU in the same year. Later surgical career Groote Schuur Hospital In 1984 he became a cardiac surgeon at the South African Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, succeeding Christiaan Barnard. Here, his research on baboons and green monkeys had been discontinued due to problems with its acceptance from society and the universities. In 1990, he returned to Munich and was appointed director of the Cardiac Surgery Clinic at the Klinikum Gro√ühadern of the LMU. Xenotransplantation In 2011, he became a spokesman for funded research into the transplantation of pig tissue and organs into primates (xenotransplantation,) leading a group that develops transgenic pigs. To prevent hyperacute rejection and coagulation disorders, harmful pig genes are replaced with certain human genes. This German Research Foundation (DFG) funded research, the ‚ÄúBiology of xenogeneic cell, tissue, and organ transplantation ‚Äì from basic research to clinical application‚Äù has involved collaborating with veterinarians, virologists, clinicians, lawyers and ethicists. At his 75th birthday celebrations in 2018, he anticipated that it would take at least three years before the first human would be implanted with a pig‚Äôs heart. His aspiration is to see that \\"the transplanted tissues and organs will in the future be genetically programmed to also carry an immunosuppressive molecule on all their cells, so that even fewer corresponding drugs are needed - or perhaps none at all\\".

Built between 2014 and 2015, it was the first church to open in downtown Raleigh since 1958. Holy Trinity is a member of the Anglican Church in North America and is under the governance of the Diocese of the Carolinas.  History  Holy Trinity Anglican Church started in 2003 by a group of Episcopalians from Raleigh who met weekly to pray for renewal in the Episcopal Church of the United States. The group, which had organized themselves as All Saints Fellowship, grew to two hundred members and began a twelve-week Sunday evening preaching series featuring Anglican preachers from across the United States. Trinity School for Ministry, an Evangelical Anglican seminary, provided support for the preaching series. In 2004 they began holding worship services in the chapel at St. David's School, an Episcopal private school in Raleigh. On September 12, 2004 the congregation officially launched Holy Trinity Anglican Church, joining the Anglican Communion Network, a theologically conservative network of Episcopal and independent Anglican churches in the United States working toward Anglican realignment. The congregation eventually broke ties with the Episcopal Church and joined the Anglican Church in North America, becoming part of the Diocese of the Carolinas. Garland S. Tucker, former C.E.O of Triangle Capital, was the founding Senior Warden of the church. In 2010 the church purchased a plot of land across the street from William Peace University, to construct a new church building, and the Jordan House, a Queen Anne Victorian mansion on North Blount Street built in 1898 for Dr. Thomas M. Jordan, to be used as the church offices Construction began on a new church building in June 2014. The new church cost around $7.5 million to build. The church is built in the colonial style. It is over 25,000 square feet and has a 130-foot tall steeple. When the new building for Holy Trinity opened in September 2015, it was the first church opening to take place in downtown Raleigh since 1958, when Edenton Street United Methodist Church was rebuilt following a fire in 1956. Over five hundred people attended the first service held at the new church building. The church was dedicated by Bishop Steve Wood on November 8, 2015. Entrance Holy Trinity was a winner of the 2016 Downtown Raleigh Alliance Imprint Award. In September 2017, the clerical leaders of Holy Trinity supported and signed the Reforming Catholic Confession. The church was represented by John Yates at the 2017 Anglican Connection Conference.

Developed from the concept of food deserts various methods have been proposed to measure transit deserts. Transit deserts are generally characterized by poor public transportation options and possibly poor bike, sidewalk, or road infrastructure. The lack of transportation options present in transit deserts may have negative effects of people‚Äôs health, job prospects, and economic mobility. History The term ‚Äòdesert‚Äô has been variously applied to areas that lack key services like banks, food access, or even books. The idea of transit deserts was coined by Dr. Junfeng Jiao and Maxwell Dillivan, first appearing in print in 2013. Since that time the concept of transit deserts has been expanded upon and competing definitions and measurement techniques have emerged. Definitions Gap Based Measurements Gap based measurement techniques are the most prominent and well-defined definition of transit deserts. Such methods typically use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based methods to measure the gap between transportation supply and demand. These methods quantify demand and supply and then subtract demand from supply in order to find the ‚Äúgap‚Äù in transit service. Areas that fall below a certain threshold are termed \\"transit deserts\\". Using this method studies have found that nearly all cities in the United States have transit deserts. Studies have also consistently shown that central business districts are almost never transit deserts, but the locations of transit desert areas varies considerably in different cities. No Transit Definition A more informal definition of transit deserts has also emerged in which areas that lack some type of transportation, most often public transportation like buses and subway stops, are termed transit deserts.. Sometimes this definition has been expanded or slightly redefined to refer areas that lack a certain type of transportation such as \\"subway deserts\\". Implications The causes of transit deserts are much debated. Some have cited suburban sprawl and deliberately segregationist policies as some of the leading causes of transit deserts.. Still others contend that transit deserts are often the result of poor planning practices and that better transit planning can help alleviate them.

History Both founding members of the Southeastern Conference, Auburn and Ole Miss first met on October 20, 1928 in Birmingham, Alabama with Ole Miss winning the game by a score of 19‚Äì0. After a 14‚Äì7 Auburn victory in 1932, the teams didn't meet again until 1949, when the Rebels defeated the Tigers by a score of 40‚Äì7. They have met in two bowl games, with Ole Miss winning the 1965 Liberty Bowl by a margin of 13‚Äì7 and Auburn winning the 1971 Gator Bowl by a score of 35‚Äì28. The Gator victory marked the beginning of the longest winning streak in the series, with Auburn winning nine straight between 1971 and 1991. Auburn and Ole Miss have met every year since 1990 and, with the SEC placing both Auburn and Ole Miss in the West division in 1992, the teams will continue to meet annually. The rivalry took a heated turn in 1999 when then-Ole Miss head coach Tommy Tuberville, after stating days prior that he would only leave Ole Miss \\"in a pine box\\", accepted the head coaching position at Auburn. Shortly thereafter, some began to refer to the annual Auburn‚ÄìOle Miss football matchup as the Pine Box Bowl. In the first matchup between the squads after Tuberville's departure for Auburn, the Rebels defeated Auburn by a score of 24‚Äì17 in overtime. Since the 1999 contest, Ole Miss has defeated Auburn only four times, the most recent of which came in the form of a 27‚Äì19 win in 2015.

It is currently owned by Tallapoosa Publishers Inc.  History  The Tallassee Tribune was founded in 1919 by N.R. Thompson as an independent paper. Thompson had started his journalism career at the Franklin County Times, and worked at the Birmingham Ledger, and Birmingham Age-Herald. After he collapsed from a heart attack in 1931, the ownership of the paper passed to his two sons, with his son Dick Thompson assuming editorship. Early in Dick Thompson's tenure, the paper was thrown into the national spotlight when federal commissioner Eugene Dunnegan was sent by the Roosevelt administration to Tallassee as a labor dispute mediator. Citing broad powers under the National Industrial Recovery Act, Dunnegan reportedly told Thompson that editorials Thompson had written against organized labor violated Section 7 of Title I of that act, and, according to Thompson's account, Thompson was told to \\"desist\\". Thompson responded with a front-page editorial defending the rights of the press. Though accounts differ on the specifics of the meeting, the national firestorm that followed resulted in Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins issuing a clarifying edict that Department of Labor conciliators should not interfere with the press. \\"Please keep in mind always in your work of adjusting industrial disputes,\\" read the edict, \\"that you have no right to tell any editor what he may or may not print in his news or editorial column. There is nothing in the NRA or any other federal statute which gives you such a right.\\" The entirety of Title I of the act was later ruled unconstitutional. The Tribune changed hands a number of times after the Thompson family sold it. Hunter Golson, son of H.H. Golson, the legendary editor of the Wetumpka Herald, published the newspaper for a time, before moving on. He sold the paper to Ben Green in 1943. Green ran the paper to wide acclaim for a few years, but retired due to ill health, selling the paper former editor of the Farm Bureau News and returning WWII veteran Herve Charest in June 1946.

History In 1215, King John granted the custody of the counties of Waterford and Desmond (most of Cork and Kerry) to Thomas fitz Anthony. This was a reward for fitz Anthony‚Äôs support for the king in fighting rebel barons in England at the time. Thomas fitz Anthony seems to have founded the medieval town of Stradbally, which was situated at the centre of his lordship (he also founded Thomastown in Co. Kilkenny). Thomas fitz Anthony died in 1226 or 1227 and the lordship subsequently passed to one of his sons-in-law, Thomas de Dene. When Thomas de Dene's son Reginald died in 1302, he held a quarter of the town of Stradbally from the king. Stradbally subsequently passed to a branch of the FitzGeralds, Earls of Desmond, who held it until the early 18th century. In 1300, when King Edward I levied his Irish domains to finance his war against Scotland, Stradbally was one of five towns in the county to be assessed for special payments. We also know that Stradbally had a mill ‚Äì there are references to it in 1298 and 1336 ‚Äì but we do not know its location. All this suggests that Stradbally was an important medieval town. All that remains of medieval Stradbally, however, is its church; it is not known what became of the rest of the town. In 1654 the Civil Survey described Stradbally as ‚Äòa County Towne with a greate many howses‚Äô, which suggests that the medieval settlement had survived in some form up until then. Cian Flaherty, 'Stradbally: a picturesque 18th-century village with medieval roots' in Willie Whelan et al, The towns and villages of the Waterford Greenway (Waterford County Museum, 2018). The present village of Stradbally dates from around the end of the 18th century, and was built by the Uniacke family of Woodhouse, who owned the village and most of the surrounding district. At the centre of the village is a market square surrounded by terraces of two-storey houses and businesses. The three-storey building which dominates the east side of the square is a former police barracks, and is probably slightly older than the buildings around it. Stradbally has two churches. St James‚Äô Church of Ireland church is located at the top of Church Lane, just behind the ruined medieval church. Work on this church began with the appointment of John Devereux as Vicar of Stradbally in 1798. The main body of the church was completed in 1802, with the addition of a tower four years later. The tower was originally topped with a spire, but this was removed in 1876 when the chancel was added. The church also had a gallery, accessed from the first floor of the belfry, but this is also long since gone. The church was dedicated to St James in 1970. It is typical of the numerous Church of Ireland churches built by the Board of First Fruits in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The Board was an institution of the Church of Ireland that was established in 1711 by Queen Anne to build and improve churches in Ireland. Holy Cross Catholic church is located a short distance outside the village. A map from 1819 shows a church just south of where the present church now stands. The present church, a large, single-cell, barn-type structure, was built in 1834. Stained glass windows were added in 1868, followed by an imposing tower in 1870 and an apse in 1873. These additions were largely funded by the Barron family.Tom Hickey, John Keane and Brian Corry, Stradbally na D√©ise II (Stradbally Tourism and Enterprise Group, 2013). The Sisters of Mercy came to Stradbally in 1875 at the invitation of the parish priest, Fr Thomas Casey. Initially they lived in Myrtle Lodge (adjacent to the Old Rectory, and which itself had served as a rectory earlier in the century), then in 1883 they moved into what had been Hannigan‚Äôs Hotel in the square (now Whelan‚Äôs pub). When Fr Casey died in 1885, the sisters moved into the former parochial house behind Holy Cross Church, renaming it Mount St Joseph‚Äôs. They also built a school in the grounds, which opened in 1890. In addition to this the sisters established a small linen industry to give employment to local girls. The industry was successful and lasted for over thirty years, but mass production and cheap imports led to its closure in 1925. Dwindling vocations led to the convent‚Äôs closure in 1988.Hickey et al, Stradbally na D√©ise II. The school established by the sisters was not the only one in the village. A Church of Ireland primary school was built by the Uniacke family of Woodhouse around the beginning of the 19th century, opposite the Church of Ireland church. In 1819, the school was kept by the curate, who taught ‚ÄòEnglish, Greek and Latin, at ¬£30 per annum for boarders, and four guineas for day boys‚Äô.William Shaw Mason, A statistical account or parochial survey of Ireland, vol. 3 (Dublin, 1819), p. 383. The school has opened and shut several times, depending on numbers, but it continues in use to this day as St James‚Äô National School. In 1806, local Catholic landowner Pierce Barron opened a school ‚Äòfor the gratuitous education of the poor of the parish‚Äô.Stone plaque on wall of Barron Hall. The building was divided in two ‚Äì boys were taught at one end and girls at the other. The building functioned as a boys‚Äô school until 1966 when the new boys‚Äô school opened nearby. The Barron School was repurposed as a community hall, and has been extensively restored in recent years. Stradbally GAA Club was founded in 1886. Gaelic football has always been the dominant sport in the parish, with the Stradbally team winning five-in-a-row senior county football titles from 1940 to 1944 and again from 2001 to 2005. Gaelic games were played in a variety of locations in the district, before the club acquired a permanent pitch in the early 1970s. A clubhouse was built in 1979. The GAA ground is named after local priest Fr Pat Cummins, who trained the Stradbally team in the early 1940s. The important role of Gaelic games in the parish is also evidenced by the handball alley on the Chapel Road, built in 1934. On Christmas Day 1929, local postman Larry Griffin disappeared from the village. Several residents were arrested and charged but the case fell apart and all were acquitted. Medieval church Stradbally‚Äôs ruined medieval church is situated beside the present Church of Ireland church. A large building, it comprises three sections ‚Äì the nave, the chancel and the tower. The oldest (c.1215) and largest part of the church is the nave, rectangular in shape and over 17 metres long. It consists of two doorways, one each in the north and south walls. Either side of the north doorway are draw-bar sockets, for securing the door on the inside; in times of danger, the bar was drawn across and reinforced the door. Just inside the south doorway is a stoup or font for holy water, carved out of a single block of sandstone. The west gable was once surmounted by a bell-cot (a small shelter for the church bell), which was still there when John O‚ÄôDonovan from the Ordnance Survey visited in 1841. This has now gone, but the remains of a small window can still be seen. Originally there would have been an arch connecting the nave with the chancel, but this is also now gone. The present chancel is a post-medieval rebuild. In the sanctuary, against the east gable, is the burial place of the Powers of Ballyvoile ‚Äì the inscription on the gravestone outlines their genealogy in detail, although doubt has been cast on elements of it. The tower probably dates from the 13th or 14th century, and consisted of three storeys. What now remains of the tower is the north half; the south half may have collapsed into the original chancel, necessitating the reconstruction of same. It is not quite clear how one actually entered the tower, but possibly there was a doorway in the north wall of the chancel. In the surviving north portion of the tower are the remains of a spiral staircase and a garderobe or toilet. The tower probably served as a residence for the priest. Perhaps due to its spacious interior, the church has often been mistaken for an Augustinian abbey. This belief probably stems from the fact that for over 300 years, the church was in the possession of the Augustinian Priory of Inistioge which, like Stradbally, was founded by Thomas fitz Anthony. In 1540, at the height of the Reformation, the church and rectory of Stradbally were taken over by the Crown, and came under the control of the Bishop of Lismore. We do not know precisely how long the church remained open after this. In 1615 it was described as being in a dilapidated state. The oldest dated gravestone is that of Michael Martin who died in 1717, which suggests that the church was almost certainly in ruins by that time. The gravestone is adorned with a skull and crossbones, a common symbol of mortality at the time. The most unusual feature of the ruined church is not the church itself but an inscribed gravestone which lies prone in the corner of the nave. Around the edge of the stone is an inscription, the surviving portion of which reads: ‚ÄòYSABELLA GAL‚Ä¶ JACET PLNI‚Äô. The top of the stone is covered in a variety of symbols, most of which seem to have some Christian significance, including the lily (symbolising the Resurrection) and the all-seeing eye, though this is a matter of interpretation. The stone is a mystery. We do not know how it ended up in the church ‚Äì it probably dates from around 1600, when the church was quite possibly still in use. We do not know who Ysabella was either. It has been speculated that she was a Galvin or Galwey, both of which are local names. Indeed, one 19th-century scholar thought that the stone had nothing to do with anyone named Ysabella, and suggested ‚Äì improbably ‚Äì that if the inscription was complete, it would read: ‚ÄòBeneath this altar lie the remains of Blessed Paulinus‚Äô.Flaherty, 'Stradbally' in The towns and villages of the Waterford Greenway.

Bitopic proteins (also known as single-pass or single-spanning proteins) are transmembrane proteins that span the lipid bilayer only one time.Membrane Structural Biology: With Biochemical and Biophysical Foundations, by Mary Luckey, 2014, Cambridge University Press, page 91. These proteins may constitute up to 50% of all transmembrane proteins, depending on the organism, and contribute significantly to the network of interactions between different proteins in cells, including interactions via transmembrane helices. They usually include one or several water-soluble domains situated at the different sides of biological membranes, for example in single-pass transmembrane receptors. Some of them are small and serve as regulatory or structure-stabilizing subunits in large multi-protein transmembrane complexes, such as photosystems or the respiratory chain. Topology-based classification Bitopic proteins are classified into 4 types, depending on their transmembrane topology and location of the transmembrane helix in the amino acid sequence of the protein. According to Uniprot:Topology definitions in Uniprot, see , *Type I is bitopic protein with its N-terminus on the extracellular side of the membrane and removed signal peptide; *Type II is bitopic protein with its N-terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and the transmembrane helix located close to the N-terminus, where it works as an anchor; *Type III is bitopic protein with its N-terminus on the extracellular side of the membrane and no signal peptide; *Type IV is bitopic protein with its N-terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, and the transmembrane helix located close to the C-terminus, where it works as an anchor. Hence type I proteins are anchored to the lipid membrane with a stop-transfer anchor sequence and have their N-terminal domains targeted to the ER lumen during synthesis (and the extracellular space, if mature forms are located on plasmalemma). Type II and III are anchored with a signal-anchor sequence, with type II being targeted to the ER lumen with its C-terminal domain, while type III have their N-terminal domains targeted to the ER lumen. Type IV is subdivided into IV-A, with their N-terminal domains targeted to the cytosol and IV-B, with an N-terminal domain targeted to the lumen.Harvey Lodish etc.; Molecular Cell Biology, Sixth edition, p.546 The implications for the division in the four types are especially manifest at the time of translocation and ER-bound translation, when the protein has to be passed through the ER membrane in a direction dependent on the type.

When finished it will be used by the Heathen organization √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞ for religious ceremonies, concerts and exhibitions. It is Iceland's first major hof to the Norse gods since the Viking Age. It is located on the southern slope of the hill √ñskjuhl√≠√∞, close to Reykjav√≠k University. The project has been under development since 2005, but has been delayed several times because of the 2008‚Äì2011 Icelandic financial crisis and problems with the design. It has been under construction since 2015. History Development In 2005, √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞ decided to sell its house in Reykjav√≠k which it had acquired in 1998. The real-estate value had at this point increased so much that the organization's long-time goal of building a hof in Reykjav√≠k for its activities had become a realistic project. √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞ originally applied for a plot of land for a religious building in Elli√∞a√°rdalur. Reykjav√≠k's mayor Ingibj√∂rg S√≥lr√∫n G√≠slad√≥ttir instead suggested a location on the hill √ñskjuhl√≠√∞, which √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞ accepted in 2006. However, this plot turned out to be within the safety zone of the Reykjav√≠k Airport, so a new location nearby, on the southern slope of the same hill, was assigned in 2008. √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞ and its allsherjargo√∞i Hilmar √ñrn Hilmarsson were especially pleased by the proximity between this location and the Reykjav√≠k University. The land was donated by the city and the construction funds were provided by √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞. On 1 September 2008, five architectural firms submitted their respective proposals for the building's design to √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞'s building committee. When the building still was on a planning stage, the 2008 Icelandic banking collapse took place, which resulted in substantial financial losses for √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞, and the hof project was delayed by several years. In January 2015, Magn√∫s Jensson's design was revealed. It was reported that construction was soon to begin. The building was reported to have a construction cost of 130 million Icelandic kr√≥nas. Construction Construction officially broke ground at the solar eclipse of 20 March 2015. The building was then projected to be finished in the late summer of 2016. However, the complicated design has caused technical problems and further delays. Immediately there were problems with the preparation of the site, which had the effect that actual construction did not begin until 2017. In December 2017 it was expected to be finished by the end of 2018. In February 2019, Hilmar √ñrn said that the most optimistic expectation was for the building to be finished in December 2019, although he hoped that parts would be ready for active use already in the autumn that year. He explained that it was the dome that caused problems and that the project had gone severely over its original budget, with the costs now estimated at around 270 million kr√≥nas. He also revealed that √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞ had looked at different models for potentially crowdfunding parts of the costs, although stressed that the funders in that case must receive something in return for their money. He explained that it was crucial for the organization's dignity to not take any bank loan. In June 2019, Hilmar √ñrn said that the building would be constructed in stages. He hoped that the office part would be ready in the winter, but that even if the crowdfunding campaign was a success, the whole project could take up to two years to finish. In February 2020, Hilmar √ñrn expected the office part to be ready in 2020, and the dome to be finished in 2022. The projected cost was now 300 million kr√≥nas. Architecture and design A memorial for Sveinbj√∂rn Beinteinsson stands next to the building site since 2010. Hof √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagsins was designed by the Icelandic architect and √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞ member Magn√∫s Jensson. Jensson wanted the building to look timeless and neither be a Viking Age pastiche nor specifically modern. The aim was to represent a close relationship to earth, sky and sun. The design incorporates numbers and geometry considered sacred by √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞, such as the numbers nine, 432,000 and the golden ratio. The building is made of concrete and local wood. The main part will have an area of and hold a maximum of 250 people. It has an oval shape and an inverted dome on top; the intention is to let in sunlight which changes on a daily and seasonal basis. It is built into the side of the hill and uses natural rock as one of its walls, allowing water to flow down the stone wall and be collected in pools. Next to the building is a memorial stone for Sveinbj√∂rn Beinteinsson, √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞'s first allsherjargo√∞i. The monument was dedicated on 22 April 2010 with a ceremony that paid tribute to the local landv√¶ttir and several gods. The design allows the building to be expanded in the future. According to Hilmar √ñrn, there are preliminary plans for an expansion that would provide a facility for international research on subjects related to mythology. Name The name used in the media and promotional material, \\"hof √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagsins\\", is descriptive and means \\"The hall of the ≈çs faith association\\" or \\"The temple of the ≈çs faith association\\". The association has asked the public for proposals for the building's official name, but the final decision will be taken shortly before the consecration.

He was the inventor of the Kibble balance, an improved version of the current balance, developed for the realisation of the S.I. unit of mass, the kilogramme. Early years and family Kibble was born in Letcombe Regis (formerly in Berkshire, now part of Oxfordshire) to Ellen and Herbert Kibble. His father was a police sergeant. He was the youngest of four children. From an early age he enjoyed repairing electrical and mechanical devices. He attended Abingdon School from 1950-1957, where he was a house prefect and gained significant academic success. He won numerous prizes for physics, mathematics and science and was awarded a Bennett Scholarship. He was a member of the Debating and Roysse Society in addition to playing for the hockey and rugby teams. He was awarded an open scholarship to study Natural Science at Jesus College, Oxford. He met his future wife, Anne Greenfield, there and they married in 1964, the same year that he was awarded his DPhil on the subject of atomic spectroscopy. They had two children, Nicola and Stephen. Career Kibble moved to Canada after completing his DPhil as a post- doctoral fellow at the University of Windsor, Ontario. Two years later, he returned to England and spent the following thirty years at the National Physical Laboratory (N.P.L.) in Teddington as a senior research fellow. In 1970, with G. J. Hunt, he measured the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton, which highlighted previous errors and greatly improved work on the S.I. definition of the amp√®re. The realisation of the amp√®re had been made with a current balance, a device that is difficult to use and contains inherent problems, including that the dimensions of the coils therein need to be measured accurately. The Kibble balance Kibble worked with Greville Rayner on coaxial a.c. bridges and the calculable capacitor from which the ohm could be realised, publishing in 1984. Prior to this, however, he had been exercised by the problems with the current balance and had ideas for its improvement. Supported in his thinking during a visit by Robert D. Cutkosky of the National Institute of Standards and Technology of the US, Kibble went on to invent the moving-coil watt balance in 1975. In 1978 the Mark I watt balance was built at the N.P.L. with Ian Robinson and Ray Smith. A more accurate realisation of the amp√®re was made, therefore the current balance had been superseded. This development led to the internationally accepted setting of the conventional Josephson and von Klitzing constants in 1990, obviating any further justification for national representations of these values which had previously inhibited trade. International teams developed their own versions of the balance. In 1990, the Mark II watt balance was built, with a view to measuring the Planck constant accurately enough to redefine the S.I. unit of the kilogramme from fundamental constants. Such an instrument equalises one force with another, specifically the weight of a [one-kilogramme, typically] test mass and the force produced by an electric current in a moving coil in a magnetic field. The magnitude of the upward force on the coil is controlled by changes to the current. The power of the moving mass is equal to the product of the current and potential difference measured in the coil, hence the term 'watt' balance (as the S.I. unit of power is the watt (W)). To remove the inaccuracies due to measurements of the coil and the magnet, a second step involves moving the coil at a particular velocity through the magnetic field ‚Äì without the test mass present or an applied current ‚Äì and measuring the induced potential difference. The current is measured with a resistor, using the von Klitzing constant through the quantum Hall effect, and the potential difference is measured using the Josephson effect. Electrical power can be measured using the Planck constant and time, meaning that the S.I. units of length and time can be related to the mass along with the Planck constant, finally eliminating the need for usage of the platinum-iridium cylinder held at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (B.I.P.M.) in Paris for the realisation of the S.I. unit of the kilogramme. On 16 November 2018, at a meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures in Versailles, France, 60 countries' representatives voted to reform S.I. units permanently. The kilogramme will forthwith be defined using the Planck constant. NIST-4 Kibble balance Later years Kibble retired from the N.P.L. in 1998, but continued to work in the field at the N.P.L., the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Braunschweig, the B.I.P.M., and he also visited many other metrological institutions worldwide with his wife, Anne. From 2009, he wrote for the IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Magazine. In 2010, he published Coaxial Electrical Circuits for Interference-Free Measurements with Jurgen Schurr and Shakil Awan.

Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after the Eritrean War of Independence, after which relations have been cordial. Since independence Eritrea's relationship with Ethiopia was entirely political, especially in the resuscitation and expansion of IGAD's scope. Since 1998 and the Eritrean‚ÄìEthiopian War, the relationship became increasingly hostile. Ties were reestablished on 9 July 2018 in the aftermath of a peace agreement. Diplomatic-Political Relations   History  While Ethiopia remained independent during the colonial conquests of Africa, Italy created a colony called Eritrea around Asmara in the 19th Century. After World War II and Italy's defeat, Britain occupied Eritrea. Eritrea was then federated with Ethiopia in 1952 by the ratification of UN General Assembly Resolution 390, which ignored the independence desires of the Eritrean people. In the late 1950s, Eritreans began organising an armed rebellion from their base in Cairo. In 1962, Ethiopia's emperor Haile Selassie unilaterally dissolved the federation and annexed Eritrea, triggering a war that would last three decades. Eritrea seceded from Ethiopia through their war of independence (1961-1991). Eritrea's independence was formally recognised when it was admitted into the UN after a referendum in 1993. In December 2000, Eritrea and Ethiopia signed a peace treaty ending their war and created a pair of binding judicial commissions, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Border Commission and the Eritrean- Ethiopian Claims Commission, to rule on their disputed border and related claims. In April 2002 The Commission released its decision (with a clarification in 2003). Disagreements following the war have resulted in stalemate punctuated by periods of elevated tension and renewed threats of war. Since these decisions Ethiopia has refused to permit the physical demarcation of the border while Eritrea insists the border must be demarcated as defined by the Commission. Consequently, the Boundary Commission ruled boundary as virtually demarcated and effective. Eritrea maintains a military force on its border with Ethiopia roughly equal in size to Ethiopia's force, which has required a general mobilization of a significant portion of the population. Eritrea has viewed this border dispute as an existential threat to itself in particular and the African Union in general, because it deals with the supremacy of colonial boundaries in Africa. Since the border conflict Ethiopia no longer uses Eritrean ports for its trade. During the border conflict and since, Ethiopia has fostered militants against Eritrea (including ethnic separatists and religiously based organizations). Eritrea has retaliated by hosting militant groups against Ethiopia as well. The United Nations Security Council argues that Eritrea and Ethiopia have expanded their dispute to a second theater, Somalia. In March 2012, Ethiopia attacked Eritrean army outposts along the border. Addis Ababa said the assault was in retaliation for the training and support given by Asmara to subversives while Eritrea said the U.S knew of the attacks, an accusation denied by US officials.  Recent Developments  At a summit on July 8, 2018 in Asmara, Eritrea's President Isaias Afewerki and Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed pledged to restore diplomatic relations and open their borders to each other. The next day, they signed a joint declaration formally ending the Eritrean‚ÄìEthiopian border conflict. Another peace agreement was signed in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on 16 September later that year.

Societal & Cultural Relations   Ethiopian-Eritreans Community Organizations and the Habesha Community Throughout the Ethiopian- Eritrean Diaspora, there have been many multi-ethnic and bi-national origin community organizations founded by and for Eritreans and Ethiopians to foster good relationships, promote and express cultural commonalities well before diplomatic ties between the two countries's governments were ever restored.

The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on gothic overtones, as well as elements from other genres such as alternative rock and psychedelic rock. Currently in a state of hiatus, the band saw extraordinary popularity in the Philadelphia and New York City underground music scenes in the late 1980s and early 1990s before going through numerous tumultuous lineup changes following the departure of founding member Lee Daniels and the death of lead singer Brett Turner. The band was originally founded by high school mates Jeffrey D. Erb and Lee Daniels who began writing songs in the basement of Erb's father's house. After working with several people to begin to find their sound, the band settled on a lineup that consisted of Erb on bass guitar, Daniels on rhythm guitar and keyboards, Brett Turner as lead vocalist, Michael Chairs on drums and Eric Stein on lead guitar. The band recorded two EPs including \\"Flowers in the Cathedral\\" and \\"Beyond the Mist\\" in Philadelphia area recording studios and performed countless live shows between Washington DC, Philadelphia and New York, including the infamous CBGB nightclub, before internal conflict between Chairs and Daniels caused Daniels to leave the band. Rob Studt took up Daniels' place on keyboards following his departure. Suffering from depression, lead singer Brett Turner took his own life in 1989 at the age of 20, causing the band to try out several lead singers before landing on Jose Maldonado. The band went on to record the EP \\"Shadow and Ivy\\" in 1992 followed by the full length album \\"Here\\" in 1993. Friction between Erb and Maldonado started early on however and ultimately led to the band splitting down the middle not long after their full length release, with Erb and Chairs going in one direction, Maldonado and Stein going in another and Rob Studt retiring from music altogether. Erb went on to rejoin his original founding partner Lee Daniels and formed the band [needle] in 1995.  History   Formation and early years (1986‚Äì1987)  Jeffrey Erb and Lee Daniels, the founding members of Sri Lanka, were school friends at Reading Senior High School in Reading, Pennsylvania. The two frequently attended local all-ages concerts around the Philadelphia area and knew that they wanted to focus exclusively on all-original music. After posting inquiries in local music stores and papers, Erb and Daniels recruited John Pacific to play guitar and Jason Wierzbicki to play drums, while Erb focused on bass guitar and Daniels on keyboards. The foursome began writing original music in Erb's father's basement. The group then recruited Pete Radice as the lead singer. Lack of commitment to rehearsals, however, led Erb and Daniels to seek out other band members and the only song that survived the initial lineup was called \\"The Haunting\\". In 1987 Erb and Daniels performed a complete overhaul on the lineup and recruited Brett Turner as a lead singer and Eric Stein as lead guitar player. Turner and Stein were longtime high school friends from Methacton High School in Eagleville, Pennsylvania. The lineup was completed when Michael Chairs, a friend of some of Erb's friends joined the band as drummer, and Daniels picked up rhythm guitar in addition to keyboards.  Late '80s (1987‚Äì1990)  The new lineup immediately gelled and the band began writing originals that developed what ultimately became known as the band's sound, with a writing style that blended musical influences of The Sisters of Mercy, The Mission UK, The Cure and The Cult. In 1907 they released their first EP, \\"Flowers in the Cathedral\\" which contained the songs \\"Flowers in the Cathedral\\", \\"All the Same Again\\", \\"Spinning Around\\" and \\"Heaven's Grace\\". Sri Lanka performed its first live show in 1987 at Revival, a nightclub in Philadelphia and quickly gained a following within the indie music scene in the Philadelphia region. In 1988, the band recorded their second EP, \\"Beyond the Mist\\" which contained four tracks, including \\"Darken Wood\\", \\"Untitled\\", \\"Torch Song\\", and a re-recorded version of \\"Flowers in the Cathedral\\". The song \\"Darken Wood\\" began to gain significant notoriety and was selected to be included on a compilation release called \\"A Taste of Philadelphia\\". The band was beginning to see a growth in popularity and increase their exposure through performances at the CMJ Music Marathon, clubs in Washington DC and at New York's CBGB. Internally, however, the band was suffering from squabbles and in-fighting. The disagreements ultimately led to the expulsion of Lee Daniels from the band, which was a challenging decision for Erb. The band recorded a video for \\"Darken Wood\\" and brought on Rob Studt, a mutual friend of the other members of the band, to play keyboards. They also began opening for international acts such as New Model Army. Tensions within the band increased however, when Brett Turner began dating Erb's younger sister, creating a significant wedge between the two. On December 2, 1990, suffering from increasing depression, Brett Turner took his own life, shocking and devastating the other members of the band. Following Turner's death, the band struggled with deciding what path to take and tried out mutual friend, Robert Kraft as a singer for the band. Kraft's membership in the band was short-lived however and the group continued to seek a singer that they felt would capture the sound of Sri Lanka.  The '90s (1991‚Äì1994)  After asking him to audition numerous times, the band finally settled on Jose Maldonado to lead the musical sound of Sri Lanka into the 1990s. Michael Chairs had met him while attending a show of the band that Maldonado was currently heading up called Thee Misfit Toys. Maldonado's vocals, reminiscent of Eddie Veder brought a different sound to the band. In 1992, the band released the EP \\"Shadow and Ivy\\" consisting of songs that the band had been writing prior to Maldonado's entrance, with lyrics written by Erb. \\"Shadow and Ivy\\" consisted of three songs, including \\"Fields of Everafter\\", \\"Requiem\\", and \\"Ties that Bind.\\" The band had a resurgence in popularity following the EP's release and live performances that expanded throughout New York and Philadelphia. In 1993, the band released its first full-length studio album entitled \\"Here\\". The release contained eight songs, including \\"Mantra\\", \\"Beyond the Pain\\", \\"Fountains of Mirage\\", \\"Here\\", \\"X\\", \\"Lucinda\\", \\"Reaching\\" and a remixed version of 1992's \\"Fields of Everafter\\". The album received highly positive reviews and was a strong evolution to the sound of Sri Lanka, and founding member Lee Daniels returned to partner with the band in directing and producing a video for \\"Fields of Everafter\\". The artistic direction of Sri Lanka was at a significant crossroads however as Maldonado began to exert significant control on the band's sound. Tensions mounted once again within the band and this time Eric Stein sided with newcomer Maldonado. The differences ultimately led to an unpleasant breakup within the band in 1994, with Stein and Maldonado going off to pursue other projects together, and Chairs and Erb opting to go a different direction.

It was first discovered in Honduras in 1977 in the regions of Olancho, Lempira and Copan. Its common name is Kamm's tillandsia.  Description  Tillandsia kammii is a xerophytic epiphyte. It is one of only four species of Tillandsia that is protected by the CITES Appendix II. T. kammii has densely arranged leaves and often grows between five and ten centimeters tall. It has thin wiry roots and has been known to grow both as a single plant and in clusters. This plant has a short, bright red inflorescence, surrounded by violet petals, that rarely lasts more than a day after blooming. Unsurprisingly, this plant has a rough texture and appearance which is due to coarse trichomes covering its leaves. Tillandsia kammii closely resembles both T. velutina and T. plagiotropica. It is differentiated from the former by its larger, denser trichomes, and from the latter by its narrower, longer, and more flexible leaves.  Habitat  Tillandsia kammii inhabits the tropical savanna climate in Honduras and El Salvador at elevations of 500 to 1200 m. Average temperatures in its habitat range from 14 ¬∞C ‚Äì 35 ¬∞C, with an average total annual precipitation of roughly 1400 mm.\\"Catacamas Climate Norrmals 1961 ‚Äì 1990\\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Here the Great Plains, southern Rocky Mountains, Colorado Plateau, and Basin and Range Provinces meet, giving the state great geologically diversity. The geologic history of the state began with its assembly during the Yavapai and Mazatzal orogenies 1750 to 1650 million years ago (Mya). This was followed by 200 million years of tectonic quiescence that ended in the Picuris orogeny. This event transformed the New Mexico crust into mature continental crust. Over a thousand million years of tectonic quiescence followed, ending with the rise of the Ancestral Rocky Mountains in Pennsylvanian time, 300 Mya. The Permian and most of the Mesozoic were another interval of relative tectonic quiescence, where gradual subsidence deposited formations that preserve an impressive stratigraphic record across the state. This ended with the Laramide orogeny, beginning around 70 Mya, which elevated most of the mountain ranges of modern New Mexico and was accompanied by violent volcanic activity. The opening of the Rio Grande rift commenced around 30 Mya,, and was followed by late Cenozoic volcanism along the Jemez Lineament, particularly in the Jemez volcanic field. Most of New Mexico has a semiarid to arid climate, and ground water in aquifers is an important geologic resource for farmers and municipal areas. Oil and gas production in the state totalled 1,820,963,878 MCF of natural gas and 331,460,749 barrels of oil in 2019, yielding $3.1 billion in oil and gas taxes and revenues for the state. Mining has historically been important, but accounted for just 3,763 jobs by 2018. Geologic hazards are infrequent in New Mexico, but potential dangers include erosion or flash flooding in arroyos; arsenic or other contamination of ground water or soil; sinkholes or other subsidence; earthquakes; mass wasting (such as landslides); mine hazards; oil field hazards; radon accumulation in homes; or volcanic eruptions. Stratigraphy, tectonics, and geologic history Proterozoic Map of Precambrian bedrock exposures in New Mexico Sandia Crest, an uplifted Mesoproterozoic batholic The crust underlying the state formed between 1.7 and 1.8 billion years ago as island arcs. This is recorded in the rocks of the Moppin Complex, the Gold Hill complex, and the Pecos greenstone belt in northern New Mexico. These are described as juvenile crust, because their Nd model ages are close to the crystallization ages determined from U-Pb dating. This indicates that the material making up the island arcs was extracted from the Earth's mantle only shortly before the island arcs formed. These rocks are mostly amphibolites thought to be formed by metamorphosis of tholeiitic basalt. The island arcs were carried into a subduction zone along the margin of Laurentia, the ancient core of North America, around 1700 million years ago, an event called the Yavapai orogeny. The arcs accreted to the continental margin, forming a band of new continental crust stretching from Arizona to Newfoundland and from the Wyoming-Colorado border to central New Mexico.. These events are recorded in the rocks of the Vadito Group and Hondo Group. A second set of slightly younger island arcs accreted to the continented shortly after, around 1650 to 1600 Mya, during the Mazatzal orogeny. The Mazatzal beds now underlie most of southern New Mexico and the Mazatzal orogeny is recorded in the Manzano Group of the Manzano and Los Pinos mountains. Precambrian rocks crop out across approximately five percent of New Mexico and underlie the entire state. The rocks now exposed at the surface were uplifted during the Paleozoic, the early Cenozoic Laramide orogeny as well as block faulting and tilting in the more recent geologic past. For the most part, these rocks are exposed along the Rio Grande rift in the center of New Mexico, except in the Zuni Mountains and Burro Mountains. The total relief of Precambrian rocks is 11 kilometers. The rocks are 70 percent plutons and 30 percent supracrustal formed between 1.765 and 1.4 billion years ago in the Proterozoic, based on uranium-lead dating. All of the rocks more than 1.65 billion years old show evidence of metamorphism ranging between greenschist and amphibolite grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies. An area in the Cimarron Mountains in the vicinity of Taos reached granulite facies. Geologists debate the extent of different terranes‚Äîsections of continental crust‚Äîthat joined together. Metavolcanic rocks in the Tusas Mountains may be among the oldest, which are intruded by 1.65 billion year old trondhjemite, but display more than one metamorphic fabric. Precambrian rocks formed volcanogenic polymettalic sulfides, rich in gold, silver and tungsten, kyanite, copper veins and pegmatite with beryllium, lithium, niobium, tantalum and mica. The region was tectonically quiescent until around 1400 Mya, when the poorly understood Picuris orogeny deformed and metamorphosed much of the crust of New Mexico. This event is recorded in the rock of the Trampas Group and in extensive batholiths intruded into the crust throughout the western United States, such as the Sandia Crest batholith. Following the Picuris orogeny, northern New Mexico was again tectonically quiet, while southern New Mexico experience some deformation associated with the Grenville orogeny. This is recorded in the Allamore and Tumbledown Formations (about 1250 Mya) and the De Baca Group and Animas Formation (about 1200 Mya). Thereafter the region experienced steady erosion, which in some cases brought rock near the surface that had been buried as deep as . Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago) Map of Paleozoic exposures in New Mexico Pennsylvanian limestone of the La Pasada Formation in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains New Mexico at the start of the Paleozoic was dominated by the Transcontinental Arch, an elevated region from Minnesota to northern New Mexico. Small quantities of alkaline magma were intruded in the early Cambrian along north-south faults, which may indicate incipient rifting of the New Mexico aulacogen. Later in the Cambrian, the sea began to advance northeast across New Mexico, beginning in the boot heel of the state (Sauk sequence) and sedimentary beds were deposited during the Cambrian through Devonian, beginning with the Cambrian Bliss Formation. The sea did not submerge the Transcontinental Arch until Mississippian time. By the late Paleozoic, in the Pennsylvanian and Permian, the rise of the Ancestral Rocky Mountains broke the ancient peneplain into basins separated by uplifts. Fossiliferous marine limestone such as the Madera Group was deposited in the basin shelves, while areas receiving debris eroded off the highlands formed clastic sedimentary formations such as Flechado Formation or Sangre de Cristo Formation. Towards the end of the Pennsylvanian, fluctuations in sea level caused by global glaciation produced cyclic formations like the Bursum Formation, marking the transition from marine to continental sedimentation. The latter is recorded by red bed formations such as the Abo Formation or the Cutler Group. The Cutler Group contain important fossil quarries that shed light on the early evolution of tetrapods. Continental sedimentation began in the north and prograded to the south. At the same time, a deep basin, the Delaware Basin, formed in southeastern New Mexico and Texas, surrounded by the massive Capitan barrier reef. A brief rise in sea level deposited the limestone of the San Andres Formation across much of New Mexico, making this the most extensive Paleozoic formation exposed in the state. The subsequent retreat of the sea resulted in deposition of large deposits of gypsum, potash and salt of the Castile and Salado Formations in the Delaware Basin. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) Map of Mesozoic exposures in New Mexico, USA The Mesozoic began with the Permian-Triassic extinction event. The Sevier and Nevadan orogenies pushed up mountains to the west of New Mexico that produced a rain shadow, giving New Mexico an exquisitely hot and dry climate through much of the early Mesozoic. The lower Triassic is recorded nowhere in the rock beds of New Mexico, but the middle Triassic is recorded in beds of the Moenkopi and Anton Chico Formations.Lucas 2004, p.137 The Moenkopi represents deposition in a coastal plain by rivers running to the west.Fillmore 2010, pp.142-158 This pattern continued into the late Triassic, when the climate become somewhat cooler and wetter, and a substantial river system developed through New Mexico that deposited the Chinle Group.Lucas 2004, pp.138-142Fillmore 2010, pp. 160-176 The Rock Point Formation of the Chinle Group preserved large numbers of fossils of Coelophysis, one of the earliest known genera of dinosaurs. The Jurassic was again a time of arid climate. A great dune sea, or erg, spread across northern New Mexico and deposited the sandstone of the Entrada Formation.Fillmore 2010, pp.201-203 This was followed by flooding of northern New Mexico by an arm of the Sundance Sea, leading to deposition of the limestone and gypsum beds of the Todilto Formation. The Jurassic ended with the deposition of the Summerville and Morrison Formations, the latter deposited in a vast foreland basin east of the coastal mountains thrown up by the Sevier orogeny.Fillmore 2010, pp. 203-218Lucas 2004, pp. 143-147 The increasing weight of the Sonoma mountains to the west drove subsidence of its foreland basin, which included most of New Mexico. During the Cretaceous, the region was submerged by the Western Interior Seaway, which deposited shore formations such as the Dakota Formation and marine formations such as the Mancos Formation. Advances and retreats of the coastline are recorded in formations such as the Mesaverde Group. Towards the end of the Cretaceous, shallow subduction of the Farallon plate drove the Laramide orogeny, which uplifted the Rocky Mountains and lasted into the Cenozoic. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) Bandelier Tuff in San Diego Canyon As the Farallon plate disintegrated and sank into the mantle, hot asthenosphere rock rising to take its place. This helped trigger the Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up, which deposited significant ash falls across much of New Mexico. The vast Mogollon-Datil volcanic field was active during this time, as were the smaller Latir volcanic field and the Ortiz porphyry belt The rise of hot asthenosphere below New Mexico reversed the compression of the crust and put it into tension, resulting in the opening of the Rio Grande rift and the development of Basin and Range geology across the southern part of the state. The development of the Rio Grande rift is recorded in the rocks of the Santa Fe Group. The Jemez volcanic field began to develop around 15 Mya, and the Valles Caldera (or Jemez Caldera) formed 1.25 Mya ago in the Pleistocene, exploding and the collapsing into its magma chamber and emplacing the Bandelier Tuff. Small mountain glaciers formed in the Brazos and Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Natural resource geology Under Spanish rule turquoise and lead were mined near Cerillos and copper was found at Santa Rita in the southwest in 1798. Artisanal mining for placer gold took place after an 1821 discovery in the Ortiz Mountains south of Santa Fe. New deposits, along with the reopened Spanish mine in Silver City prompted a boom in copper mining in the late 19th century. Placer gold mining expanded into the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and along the Rio Grande, while lead mining got underway in Las Cruces. Coal was discovered near gold and copper mines and potentially recoverable gold deposits grew more numerous as prospectors traced placer gold back to the veins where it originated. In 1863, silver was found in Magdalean, west of Socorro, followed by a large find in Grant County. Silver City, White Oaks, Ute Creek, Cerrillos, Elizabethtown, Twining, Chloride, Hondo Canyon, Red River Canyon and Socorro were soon discovered to also have silver. Rising costs and depleted ore bodies have led to widespread abandonment and ghost towns throughout the state, which remain comparatively well-preserved in the dry climate. Mining is still a cornerstone of the New Mexico economy, although it has largely shifted to open-pit extraction. Coal is mined in the northwest and copper, silver, gold, manganese, zinc and lead are extracted near Silver City. Molybdenum is an important resource in the Sangre de Cristo mountains, including the Questa Mine. Uranium is still mined close to Grants, although production has dropped after high point between the 1950s and the 1970s. Gypsum, limestone, potash and salt are mined out of Pennsylvanian and Permian rocks in the east. The San Juan Basin in the northwest has active oil and gas production, along with the small extent of the Permian Basin in the southeast.

Roskell was born on 2 July 1913 in Norden, near Rochdale. He won a scholarship to Rochdale Municipal Secondary School before attending Accrington Grammar School. In 1930 he won a history scholarship for Manchester University. Here he was influenced by William Abel Pantin and E. F. Jacob, who helped Roskell gravitate towards medieval history. Roskell was taught a neo-Stubbsian method that sought to use administrative and biographical research in studying constitutional history. He gained a first in 1933 and was awarded an MA a year later. His masters thesis was published by the Chetham Society in 1937 as The Knights of the Shire for the County Palatine of Lancaster, 1377‚Äì1460. After being awarded a Langton Fellowship in 1935, Roskell studied the Parliament of 1422 at Balliol College, Oxford, for his doctoral thesis. Under the supervision of V. H. Galbraith, he completed this in 1940 (The Commons in the Parliament of 1422) but his studies were interrupted by the Second World War. Roskell served in the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic. Roskell returned to Manchester in 1945 and his thesis was eventually published in 1954. For ten years after 1952 he was Professor of Medieval History at the University of Nottingham before returning to the University of Manchester to take the chair of medieval history. He retired in 1978. In 1968 he was awarded a Fellowship of the British Academy. Against the views of Albert Pollard and J. E. Neale, Roskell argued in 1964 that it was in the seventeenth century that Parliament became indispensable to the Crown, not the during the sixteenth. With Linda Clark and Carole Rawcliffe, he edited The History of Parliament that covered the House of Commons from 1386 to 1421. These were published in four volumes in 1992. He married Evelyn Liddle in 1942, with whom he had two children. He died on 1 May 1998.

It opened on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre on December 13, 2018. The play is set to transfer to London's West End at the Gielgud Theatre in 2020. The show follows the story of Atticus Finch, a lawyer in 1930‚Äôs Alabama, as he defends Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of rape. Varying from the book, the play has Atticus as the protagonist, not his daughter Scout, allowing his character to change throughout the show. During development the show was involved in two legal disputes, the first with the Lee estate over the faithfulness of the play to the original book, and the second was due to exclusivity to the rights with productions using the script by Christopher Sergel. During opening week, the production garnered more than $1.5 million in box office sales and reviews by publications such as the New York Times, LA Times and AMNY were positive but not without criticism.

The book had previously been adapted for the stage but Rudin specified that this production would be completely unrelated to the prior pieces. On February 15, 2018, it was announced that Jeff Daniels would star in the production as Atticus Finch. Celia Keenan-Bolger and Will Pullen were also announced to play Scout and Jem Finch, respectively. The production began previews at the Shubert Theatre on November 1, 2018, prior to an official opening on December 13, 2018. During production the show was involved in two legal disputes, one with the Harper Lee estate, and the other against licensed productions of the Christopher Sergel adaptation. As of March 12, 2020, the play suspended production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Performances will be suspended until January 3, 2021 at the earliest.  Legal disputes during production   The legal dispute between Sorkin and the Harper Lee estate  During development of the play, the Lee estate believed that the proposed script varied too much from the book, and a complaint was filed in an Alabama federal court in March of 2018. In discussion with Sorkin about the terms of use for the rights to produce a play, it was specified by the estate that the character of Atticus should not deviate from the original character created by Harper Lee. The Lee estate alleged that Sorkin had made too many changes to the original story by framing Atticus as the main character instead of Scout. Sorkin describes how the evolution of Atticus was viewed by the Lee estate as being \\"far less dignified\\" than the original character but the show's lawyers disputed this point stating his character \\"does not derogate or depart from the spirit of the novel.\\" Because the Lee estate lawsuit was jeopardizing the release of the show, a countersuit of $10 million was filed by Sorkin's lawyers in April 2018. On the tenth of May 2018, the premiere of the show was confirmed after an agreement was reached between the two parties, and both lawsuits were settled. Legal threats by Rudin against licensed productions of the Sergel adaptation Before Aaron Sorkin adapted To Kill a Mockingbird for the theatre, a different adaptation of the novel by playwright Christopher Sergel had been available for license for over 50 years. Claiming worldwide exclusivity for the professional stage rights to any adaptation of Lee's novel, lawyers acting for the company Scott Rudin formed to produce Sorkin's adaptation, Atticus Limited Liability Company (ALLC), moved to shut down productions of the Sergel adaption staged within 25 miles of any city that ALLC determined to be a major metropolitan center that might eventually host a production of Sorkin's adaptation, even if that company had already paid the rights holders.Evans, Greg. \\" 'To Kill a Mockingbird' UK Tour Cancelled\\" deadline, January 22, 2019Means, Sean.\\"The Grand cancels its production of ‚ÄòTo Kill a Mockingbird‚Äô at Salt Lake Community College over a legal battle with a Broadway mogul\\" Salt Lake Tribune, February 20, 2019Peterson, Chris. \\"Issue Over Two Different Mockingbird Scripts\\" onstageblog, February 25, 2019Leighton, Paul. \\"'Mockingbird' killed in Marblehead\\" Salem News, February 25, 2019 Dozens of community and non-profit theaters across the US cancelled productions of Sergel's adaptation, as well as a professional tour planned in the UK.

Reception   Critical reception  The play was met with some criticism over the liberties taken by Sorkin, but Los Angeles Times theater critic Charles McNulty writes Sorkin's adaptation \\"moves as confidently as it speaks even if it doesn't completely add up dramatically.\\" McNulty disputes those who take issue with the changes Sorkin made to the story by stating that Sorkin \\"created something impeccably fresh.\\" Jesse Green, a theater critic from the New York Times articulated that Sorkin's choice to start with the trial and provide backstory through scenes going back in time was \\"very effective\\" for telling the story on stage. Matt Windman argues that \\"some of Sorkin's choices are questionable\\" and that the set design was \\"too distracting to be effective.\\" Windman also articulates that the show \\"proves to be an engrossing, provocative, and uniformly well-acted adaptation.\\"  Box office  The show opened on December 13, 2018, during the week ending on December 23, the production grossed over $1.5 million, breaking the record for box office grosses for a non-musical play in a theater owned by The Shubert Organization.

Plot Reese (Jim Caviezel) works to save the life of a local taxi driver (Michael Irby) who is put in danger when a passenger leaves behind a laptop that is wanted by the Estonian mafia. Reese and Finch (Michael Emerson) eventually realize the laptop contains valuable information that could enable terrorists to enter the county undetected. As a result, the Estonian mafia is killing anyone who has even seen the laptop. Finch is able to locate the laptop and the Estonians are defeated by Reese. Finch and Reese then have the cab driver use the laptop to negotiate a deal with the Secret Service to bring his family over from Cuba in exchange for the laptop. At the same time, HR decides to reestablish ties with Elias and blackmail Fusco (Kevin Chapman) into helping. After walking into an ambush, Fusco tells HR member Simmons (Robert John Burke) that Elias has cut all ties and Fusco is as well. In response, Simmons leaves Carter (Taraji P.

Taxonomy This species was formerly considered to be the same species as Cetoscarus bicolor, which is otherwise restricted to the Red Sea; however, there are major morphological and molecular differences between the two species, so the IUCN Red List has recognized them as separate species since 2010. This species is sometimes known as the bicolour parrotfish, but this name also is applied to C. bicolor. C. ocellatus currently encompasses the Pacific and Indian Ocean populations and these are presently considered to be conspecific. However, molecular studies indicate that the Indian Ocean population is probably specifically distinct from the Pacific population, if this is the case then the Indian Ocean species would be Cetoscarus nigropinnis. Etymology The species name ocellatus refers to the dark ocellus on the dorsal fin of juveniles.Fishes of Australia  Distribution  Cetoscarus ocellatus is widespread in the coastal waters of Indian and Pacific Oceans. These fishes are found along the southern east coast of Africa, from Somalia to South Africa, in Australia and in Southeast Asia (The Coral Triangle region) and north to southern Japan.  Habitat  These fishes ares associated with coral reefs, and can be found at depths between . They vary in habitat. Some prefer coral reefs, while some prefer seagrass beds, algal beds, mangroves and rocky reefs.  Description  Cetoscarus ocellatus can reach at maturity a body length of about . This species has a long snout and shows 14-15 pectoral rays;, 5-7 median predorsal scales and 3 rows of scales on cheek. The color of the Cetoscarus ocellatus varies between genders as well as between adults and juveniles. Juveniles are usually white with a thick orange band that surrounds the head, except snout and chin. They have a black circular spot on their dorsal fin and a thick orange band on their rounded tail. Females of the initial phase have a dark purple to reddish brown head, finely spotted with black ventrally. Body shows dorsally a broad, pale yellowish zonewhile below it is bluish gray. Scales are rimmed and spotted with black. Median fins are brownish red and caudal with a whitish crescent posteriorly. The brightly-coloured terminal males are green, scales are rimmed with pink, head and anterior body show numerous small pink spots. An orange line is running from mouth to anal fin. File: Dragonet and young Parrotfish.jpgJuvenile from Sulawesi, Indonesia File: Scaridae - Cetoscarus ocellatus (Initial phase).JPGFemale from French Polynesia- Initial phase File: Bicolor parrotfish.JPGMale from Australia ‚Äì Terminal phase Biology Cetoscarus ocellatus is a hermaphroditic member of the Parrotfish family. It is found largely within the Coral Triangle region, although it has been found to inhabit sea grass and algal beds as well as mangroves. As these Parrot Fishes are hermaphrodites, they start out as females (the 'initial phase') and eventually can become males. They travel in large schools that are led by one dominant male followed by females. If for some reason this male were to leave or get separated, one of the dominant females of the group will take charge and change its gender and color. Parrotfish are important to the dynamic of coral reefs and are being threatened by overfishing, and destruction of habitat due to climate change.  Threats  In the Coral Triangle Region fish are being threatened by overfishing, destruction of habitat and destructive fishing practices. Due to climate change, their habitats are being destroyed. This is detrimental due to the fact that parrot fish are important to the dynamic of coral reefs. The family of parrot fishes is extremely big with about 80 different species. Due to the impact that humans are having on their habitat a study was conducted on genetic diversity to see which type of parrot fish had the highest genetic diversity (the one with the highest genetic variation is the one that will most likely survive drastic changes in the environment). In this article we were able to find out that Cetoscarus ocellatus had one of the lowest values of genetic diversity. This means that with climate change happening and the destruction of their habitat the bicolour parrotfish is less likely to adapt and more likely to die. As this fishes are kept in aquariums, they are also more likely to get infected with parasites due to the water in the tanks. A study conducted in Vietnam to test certain fish for the parasite Cryptocaryon irritans. They tested 14 fish and 8 caught the parasite, meaning 57.14% of them are likely to catch this parasite. They were able to see that spring had the highest prevalence followed by winter and the summer (with only 20%). This information is important for aquariums to keep in mind, so they are able to treat their waters a certain manner before the parasite can get to the fish.  Corallivory  Corallivory refers to animals that eat coral polyps. All parrot fishes feed on coral, but the corallivory within the parrot fishes may depend on the local environment and the species of coral present. An experiment by Bellwood and Choat in 1990 showed that Cetoscarus ocellatus take 10% fewer bites of live coral in the Great Barrier reef compared to other parrot fishes.

In this census, she is listed as \\"Blanche O. Dreyfuss.\\" *According to the Social Security Death Index, she was born July 22, 1883. Evidence leans toward 1883 as the correct year of her birth, particularly in light of her educational pursuits. Her siblings were Nellie (born approximately 1879), Theresa (sometimes called Tessie, born approximately 1890), Clara (sometimes spelled Claire, born February 15, 1881\\"Claire Kissane,\\" Social Security Death Index available on Ancestry.com (available through subscription), accessed July 11, 2018.), and W.

By 1900, a year after Sigmund's death, the family was living with the family of Elizabeth's sister at 147 5th Street in College Point, Queens.1900 census. The details of her education are also problematic. In the 1917 interview, Merrill claimed to have received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia University, after which she took a city examination and received her license to teach \\"five years\\" prior to the interview. However, in another profile published later that year, the unnamed author describes Merrill as having attended Barnard College.Since Wikipedia is based on tertiary sources, this article cannot include an editor's May 2018 inquiry to the Registrar of Barnard College which revealed that Merrill was not a student at Barnard and took teacher training courses at Columbia. However, Merrill does not appear in any class lists of the many yearbooks Columbia has posted on its website. If she was born in 1895, it is improbable that she would have graduated from college and achieved teacher training by 1912 when she would have been 17. Although her college education remains mysterious, in 1906 she apparently passed her teacher training and was assigned to teach at Public School 84 in Queens.School 18, no. 3 (September 20, 1906), p. 69.The City Record vol. 34 (November 2, 1906), p. 10674. Apparently, she maintained this job until 1915 when she requested a sabbatical and apparently did not return.Minutes of the Board of Superintendents (New York: Board of Education, 1915), p. 252, 716. Career Although Merrill claimed to have begun her theatrical career by sending an unsolicited song to Eva Tanguay, her interest in theater seems to have predated that event. In a 1917 interview, Merrill described attending theater with her mother while in high school: \\"I never missed a Saturday matinee\\".Mary B. Mullett, \\"Still in Her Twenties She Has Won Fame and Fortune as Songwriter\\" The Sun (February 11, 1917), p. 7. A 1906 review of a production of The Jolly Bachelors put on by St. Mary's Catholic Club in Brooklyn is probably one of the earliest mentions of Merrill (still under her birth surname) in print. A reviewer for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported: \\"There were many musical numbers. Charles Bill, William Morrison and Blanche V. Dreyfoos managed to take one step higher in the art with which they have been so generously endowed.\\" (Blanche's sister Clara Dreyfoos played the small role of Constance.) \\"'Jolly Bachelors' Were Entertainers,\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle (no date, probably February 1, 1906), no page number indicated.

She was so taken with the performance that she wrote her first song, \\"Give an Imitation of Me,\\" and then filed it away. A friend convinced her to send it to Tanguay for her consideration. Tanguay liked it accepted it, leading Merrill to write an additional four songs for Tanguay. Although she didn't accept remuneration for her first effort, that changed when songwriter and music publisher Charles K. Harris signed Merrill to a contract and published her songs.\\"Harris Signs Newcomer,\\" Variety (July 16, 1910), p. 5.

By 1915 Merrill had established a strong reputation as a songwriter who catered to the individual characteristics of specific performers, women in particular. In July 1915 Brice began to work with Merrill, in what Grossman calls the \\"turning point in [Brice's] career and the beginning of a productive professional relationship. During their association, Merrill created some of Brice's most distinctive material and freed her from the problem that had always plagued her: finding songs that really suited her.\\" The first results of their collaboration resulted in Brice's act opening on September 6, 1915 at The Palace.Barbara Wallace Grossman, Funny Woman: The Life and Times of Fanny Brice (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1991), p. 85. After touring with and refining the material, Brice returned to The Palace in February 1916. The act had four songs, the latter three of which had lyrics by Merrill: \\"If We Could Only Take Their Word,\\" \\"The Yiddish Bride\\" (which critic and Variety founder Sime Silverman called \\"a gem\\"), and \\"Becky Is Back in the Ballet.\\" The performance was favorably reviewed.Sime, \\"Fannie Brice,\\" Variety (February 11, 1916), p. 18.

Why Worry? was a play with music and was Brice's only attempt to play a serious role on Broadway. During its tour prior to opening on Broadway, the play closed temporarily due to an illness of one of the performers. Initial reports was that the play lacked class. When it re-opened in Atlantic City, New Jersey for the continuation of its pre-Broadway run, it included two songs written by Merrill, one called \\"The Yiddish Indian.\\"\\"Why Worry Reopening,\\" Variety (August 16, 1918), p. 13.

She recorded it in 1921,\\"Victor matrix B-25769. I'm an Indian / Fanny Brice,\\" Discography of American Historical Recordings accessed July 3, 2018. and the music was published in 1922. Brice performed it in her 1928 film My Man\\"Fannie Brice Features a Mills Song Number,\\" Billboard (January 26, 1929), 26. and Brice's performance of the song was briefly portrayed by cartoon character Betty Boop in the 1932 animated short Stopping the Show (the sequence was also used in the 1934 short Betty Boop's Rise to Fame). Finally, \\"I'm an Indian\\" is briefly viewed in a puppet rendition (by Lou Bunin) for Brice's final film appearance in the 1945 film Ziegfeld Follies. The following year Brice had an all-Merrill program\\"Merrill-Brice Songs,\\" Variety (May 12, 1922), p. 4. before working up an act called Around the World.Sime, \\"New Acts This Week: Fanny Brice,\\" Variety (June 16, 1922), p. 18. The idea behind the act was that Brice would portray people from different cultures. Variety reviewer Sime described the opening number as consisting of three different styles of lyrics, and unusually, the lyrics had Brice refer to Merrill. This is the song \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\". Longer than a typical song, it has Brice portraying herself travelling around New York City, going to the Belasco Theatre to the Music Box Theatre in search of the right kind of material to perform. For her 1923 vaudeville act, Brice sang at least four songs, all with lyrics by Blanche Merrill: \\"Hocus Pocus,\\" \\"My Bill,\\" a ballad called \\"Breaking Home Ties\\" and a \\"new Spanish comedy song.\\"Con., \\"New Shows This Week: Palace,\\" Variety (January 12, 1923), p. 19. Near the end of his career, songwriter Jack Yellen recalled Tin Pan Alley and that writers of special material sometimes got the better end of a deal. He mentioned Merrill, whom he called \\"an expert\\" who could command thousands of dollars for material, with Fanny Brice being one of her steady and smart customers. Apparently there was a break in the relationship between Brice and Merrill in 1924. Merrill published a poem in Variety in 1924 that Brice was now a \\"Belasco star\\" and that Merrill was her \\"use-to-be writer.\\" Grossman hypothesized that Brice felt Merrill couldn't do anything more for her career. After her marriage to Billy Rose, a songwriter, it's possible that he disallowed collaboration between Brice and Merrill because of professional jealousy.Barbara Wallace Grossman, Funny Woman: The Life and Times of Fanny Brice (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1991), p. 194. Although they were no longer working together, in an extensive November 1925 interview with Brice, she had warm words for Merrill.Fanny Brice, \\"The Feel of the Audience,\\" Saturday Evening Post (November 21, 1925), p. 10ff.  1916-1925  Caricature of Blanche Merrill and her various clients in 1916Other Merrill clients and works from 1916 included Willie Weston in The Hunter,\\"Vaudeville: New Acts,\\" Variety (September 1, 1916), p. 6.

Merrill's talents had become so well known by the end of 1916 that Variety published a full-page caricature of Merrill writing for numerous vaudeville players who were clients: Fannie Brice, Maurice Burkhart, Clara Morton, Lillian Shaw, Dorothy Meuther, Gertrude Barnes, Eva Tanguay, Belle Baker, J.D.

Blanche Merrill was announced as the Cocoanut Grove's official songwriter.

The article continues however by talking of Merrill's desire for tighter control over her work. With the aid of her lawyer, Merrill was able to get a clause written into her contracts that restricted performance of her songs to the field to which they were conceived, whether vaudeville or musical comedy. Merrill was also able to obtain a restriction on performing rights, stipulating that a performer could not transfer performing rights to another performer. This restrictive clause was occasioned by an incident with Fanny Brice who paid Merrill $1,000 for two songs, but then gave the song \\"I Don't Know Whether To Do It or Not\\" to Lillian Shaw. Merrill was contemplating action against Brice, but either withdrew or the action was settled.\\"Scene Around a Song,\\" Variety (February 8, 1918), p. 5.untitled list of brief notices, Variety (March 8, 1918), p. 11.

The onset of World War I led Merrill to write two works whose temperament were very different from each other. One was a popular song, \\"Boots, Boots, Boots.\\" Written as a parody of Rudyard Kipling's poem Boots, it was first performed by the Howard Brothers at the Winter Garden Theatre in The Passing Show of 1918.Sime, \\"Show Reviews: Winter Garden,\\" Variety (September 6, 1918), p. 17.

The first major controversy of Blanche Merrill's career occurred in 1919. As originally announced, Merrill was to write and compose all the musical numbers for the Ziegfeld Follies of 1919.\\"Merrill's 'Follies' Songs,\\" Variety (February 21, 1919), p. 5. Subsequent notices indicated a division of responsibility. Merrill would write the first act,\\"Writers of 'Follies',\\" Variety (March 7, 1919), p. 12. Irving Berlin would write the second act,\\"Berlin in on 'Follies',\\" Variety (March 14, 1919), p. 1. and Gene Buck would write the third act.\\"3 Acts for 'Follies',\\" Variety (March 21, 1919), p. 13. The situation changed when Ziegfeld asked Merrill to allow composer Dave Stamper to rewrite the music for three of her songs. According to Variety, Merrill refused and withdrew from the project entirely, signing on with the Shubert Brothers to work on their upcoming show, Biff Boom Bang.\\"Miss Merrill With Shuberts,\\" Variety (June 13, 1919), p. 13. But according to Barbara Wallace Grossman, Merrill was fired.Barbara Wallace Grossman, Funny Woman: The Life and Times of Fanny Brice (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1992), p. 193. Though Biff Boom Bang did not materialize, Merrill, along with lyricist M.K. Jerome, contributed lyrics to three songs to the revue Shubert Gaities of 1919. (The songs were \\"Coat O' Mine,\\" \\"Crazy Quilt,\\" and \\"This is the Day.\\"\\"Shubert Gaities of 1919,\\" Internet Broadway Database accessed June 28, 2018. A notice in a July 1919 issue of Variety stated that Merrill had signed a contract with Lee Shubert to produce a musical version of Clyde Fitch's play Girls. Although this was intended to be a vehicle for Nan Halperin, the notice warned that Halperin was known only from vaudeville and lacked theatrical experience.\\"Nan Helperin in 'Girls',\\" Variety (July 18, 1919), p. 12. When the musical opened on November 3, 1919 it was called The Little Blue Devil and neither Halperin nor Merrill were associated with it.\\"The Little Blue Devil,\\" Internet Broadway Database accessed June 27, 2018. Merrill did write an act for Halperin which opened in the summer of 1920.\\"Nan Halperin's Selection,\\" Variety (August 13, 1920), p. 13. The lack of writing the musical version of Girls might have been the cause of the dispute between Merrill and the Shubert Brothers. Apparently that did not reduce Merrill's value. Variety reported that \\"Blanche Merrill Inc.\\" increased its capital from $1,000 to $10,000.\\"Incorporations,\\" Variety (June 20, 1919), p. 51. The fall of 1920 saw the continuation of the professional relationship between Merrill and Lillian Shaw when the latter appeared at the Palace in song scenes by Merrill. A reviewer wrote \\"Miss Shaw was literally a howling success as far as the audience was concerned. Her second number was slightly blue in spots, but when those particular spots arrived the Palace crowd shrieked their delight. There are some spots where the talk is a little broad, so broad it may be a question how they will take it away from Broadway, but Miss Shaw is sufficient [a] showwoman to know where and where not to use it.\\"Fred., \\"New Acts This Week: Palace,\\" Variety (November 12, 1920), p. 17. In a dispatch dated April 7, Variety noted that Merrill was in Chicago for a week concerning \\"Shubert affairs.\\" While there she spent time at the Woods and Garrick theatres which were home to Monte Cristo Jr. and the touring production of the Shubert Gaities of 1919.\\"Blanche Merrill Pussyfooting,\\" Variety (April 9, 1920), p. 31. Theatrical producer Harry Frazee commissioned Merrill to produce musical versions of two of his plays, My Lady Friends and A Pair of Queens.\\"Musical 'Lady Friends',\\" Variety (October 29, 1920), p. 13. Neither of these commissioned appeared to have seen fruition. (My Lady Friends was eventually turned into the musical No, No, Nanette.) The lack of Merrill's activity from the end of 1920 last through the middle of 1921 was due to the illness and death of her mother, Elizabeth Dreyfoos, on January 18, 1921. A notice in Billboard said that Merrill collaborated with John Murray Anderson on the Greenwich Village Follies of 1921, the third production in that series of revues.\\"Musical Comedy Notes,\\" Billboard (August 20, 1921), p. 30. But when the show opened on August 31, 1921, the only credit to Merrill was a single song, \\"Pavlowa.\\"\\"Greenwich Village Follies of 1921,\\" Internet Broadway Database\\" accessed June 28, 1921. By this time Merrill was earnestly trying to expand her writing skills for a musical. To producer William Harris Jr. she presented an idea for a dramatic musical revue. Harris prematurely suggested staging the work by November 1922.\\"Dramatic Musical Revue,\\" Variety (September 1, 1922), p. 1. Subsequent notices indicated the play was intended for Fay Bainter, and that Merrill had gone to the country to concentrate on writing.\\"Inside Stuff On Legit,\\" Variety (October 13, 1922), p. 12. By December 25, 1922, Fay Bainter opened in the play The Lady Christilinda which was produced by Harris. Merrill was not involved.\\"The Lady Christilinda,\\" Internet Broadway Database accessed June 28, 2018. Belle Baker's appearances in the 1922‚Äì23 season prompted some attention. In October 1922 she was performing at the Palace. Her act included some songs by Merrill, including \\"The Bootlegger's Slumber\\" which one critic called \\"a Wop number.\\" The song was received with enthusiasm.\\"New Shows This Week: Palace,\\" Variety (October 20, 1922), p. 19. But with Prohibition recently put in place, the Palace's house manager warned Baker not to repeat the song. She disregarded his warnings, apparently with the approval of the audience. The conflict made the headline on page one of Variety.\\"Frankly Prohibition Song Sung at Keith's Palace,\\" Variety (October 20, 1922), p. 1, 4. Merrill also wrote an act for Lillian Lorraine.\\"$2,500 On Roof for Lillian Lorraine,\\" Variety (August 11, 1922), p. 13.  Mollie Fuller  Merrill became involved with Mollie Fuller in 1922. Fuller had been a vaudevillian with her husband, Frederick Hallen. After Hallen's death in 1920, Fuller became blind after an unexplained ailment. In 1922, her predicament was uncovered and reported on by Variety columnist Nellie Revell who had learned of Fuller's situation after being briefly hospitalized at St. Vincent's Hospital (where Fuller had been hospitalized). It was through Revell's column that Blanche Merrill befriended Fuller. Her performances were arranged by the B. F. Keith Circuit. Both Merrill and Keith contributed their services to the act without remuneration,\\"Mollie Fuller Back To Stage New Act,\\" Variety (July 28, 1922), p. 1. and Merrill had paid production costs.\\"15 Years Ago,\\" Variety (January 5, 1938), p. 176. By the time the Fuller's act was first presented in Paterson, New Jersey, it was called Twilight and was judged a success.\\"Mollie Fuller's Act Opens,\\" Variety (December 22, 1922), p. 4. In January 1925 Variety indicated that Merrill was writing new material for Fuller.\\"Inside Stuff on Vaudeville,\\" Variety (January 7, 1925), p. 9. The new skit was called An Even Break and was also designed to disguise Fuller's blindness, a disability of which the audience was totally aware.\\"Vaudeville Notes,\\" Billboard (November 14, 1925), p. 18.R.C. \\"Moller Fuller and Company in 'An Even Break'\\", Billboard (December 5, 1925), p. 20. In it, Fuller played a scrubwoman in a fancy dress shop. Various customers come and go, regarding the scrubwoman with condescension. When one customer wants to model a new dress, she insists the scrubwoman try it on first. As the scrubwoman is trying on the dress, she reminisces about her past days when she was an actress in the theater. The moral of the story was \\"All we get out of life is an even break.\\"Abel., \\"New Acts This Week: Molie Fuller and Co.,\\" Variety (November 25, 1925), p. 14. Opening at the 81st Street Theatre, the act did not receive the same rapturous approval as did Twilight although reviews were generally positive. One later review indicates that the act's moral was turned into a song, \\"The Best That You Get When You Get It is Only an Even Break.\\" Fuller appeared to have finally retired from the stage after An Even Break. After several near-death scares (with Revell anxiously reporting on Merrill's devotion to Fuller),such as: Nellie Revell, \\"Right Off the Desk,\\" Variety (July 7, 1926), p. 32.\\"Mollie Fuller and N.V.A.,\\" Variety (July 7, 1926), p. 27. Fuller moved to California and was supported by the National Vaudeville Association until her death in 1933. Activities for Merrill in 1923: *Under the direction of Edwin August (engaged by Marcus Loew), the Delancey Street theater proposed using amateurs from the audience to participate with professionals in creating films which will be shown the following week. The skit is called \\"The Great Love\\" and authored by Blanche Merrill.\\"Amateurs in Films,\\" Variety (February 8, 1923), p. 4. Each film will run approximately 2,500 feet.

See: \\"Letters,\\" Variety (January 7, 1925), p. 6. *The music publisher Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. sued lyricist and publicist C.F.

We Have No Bananas.\\" The scenario of the proposed film was to have been written by Blanche Merrill.\\"'Bananas' Film Title Use Unauthorized,\\" Variety (August 23, 1923), p. 17. As a result of the thought of Henry Ford running for political office, Variety published Merrill's satirical lyrics to a song called \\"It's All a High Hat.\\" (There is no other evidence of this song beyond these published lyrics.) Evidence of Merrill's concern over unauthorized use of her material was probably relieved in part by her new contracts she put in place at the outset of the 1924‚Äì25 season. The new contracts stipulated that her material remains her property, when either performers leave a show or when the show closes. The article noted that this had become the typical procedure for most vaudevillians.\\"Inside Stuff on Vaudeville,\\" Variety (September 24, 1924), p. 11.

Called \\"Weeping Singles,\\" the column attracted attention, including some who accused Merrill of being portrayed by her.\\"Inside Stuff on Vaudeville,\\" Variety (June 10, 1925), p. 9. Before Merrill's departure for Hollywood, the last new skit that appeared was written for Pauline Saxon and Ralph Coleman. An article from November 11, 1925 indicated that Merrill attended numerous parties intended to wish her well on her Hollywood journey.\\"Blanche Merrill's Gay Round of Lunches, Parties,\\" Variety (November 11, 1925), p. 12. 1925-1927: Hollywood Initial news of Blanche Merrill being involved with the film industry appeared in July 1925. A report indicated that she had tried out as a scenario writer \\"with much success\\" and had written a story called \\"The Seven Wives of Bluebeard.\\"\\"Inside Stuff On Vaudeville,\\" Variety (July 29, 1925), p. 48. This initial report\\"Blanche Merrill Engaged for Films,\\" Variety (October 21, 1925), p. 3. was confirmed when Merrill signed a contract with Joseph M. Schenck. This contract gave her a weekly salary of $750, and would provide an additional $5,000 for each scenario or adaptation that she provided. Merrill departed for Hollywood in November 1925 for \\"a six month experimental visit.\\" An exclusive contract, it would prevent her from doing vaudeville work during her time in Hollywood. Filmed at the Cosmopolitan Studios and produced by First National,\\"Kane's 'Seven Wives',\\" Variety (October 7, 1925), p. 46. the Merrill's initial story was eventually released on January 13, 1926 as Bluebeard's Seven Wives.Bluebeard's Seven Wives (1925).

But Schenck decided not to have Talmadge or Meighan and instead use featured players instead of stars.\\"Inside Stuff on Pictures,\\" Variety (February 17, 1926), p. 20.

However, Merrill's contract with Schenck precluded her from writing for external clients.\\"Fannie Brice's Return,\\" Variety (March 24, 1926), p. 4. The series of unrealized projects ended when Merrill became involved with the Duncan Sisters and their ill-fated film Topsy and Eva. Thinking it good material for a film, First National Pictures purchased the story and began to fashion a screen treatment. The Duncan Sisters, however, were dissatisfied with First National's proposed treatment and wouldn't sign with them.\\"'Topsy and Eva' for U.A.; B. Merrill's Scenario,\\" Variety (November 3, 1926), p. 9. Instead, the sisters signed a contract with Joseph M. Schenck who would make the film for United Artists.

Griffith who shot the final scenes.\\"Topsy and Eva,\\" Variety (June 22, 1927), p. 30. Variety blamed the picture's poor quality on its troublesome production, but tried to be charitable: \\"The picture is not going to draw heavy grosses and it is not going to please all around...It will do, however, and nicely for the kiddie matinee.\\" The film of Topsy and Eva represented the conclusion of Blanche Merrill's involvement with the movie industry.Barbara Wallace Grossman, Funny Woman: the Life and Times of Fanny Brice (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press), p. 263, note 104. 1926-1930: West Coast vaudeville Mary Kornman and Mickey Daniels, both recently retired from Hal Roach's Our Gang film series, began appearing in vaudeville in 1926.

In 1938, Merrill opened offices in conjunction with music publisher Irving Mills whose company was Mills Music.\\"Air Briefs: New York,\\" Billboard (April 2, 1938), p. 11. The association with Mills undoubtedly led to the publication in 1939 of \\"Fanny Brice's Comedy Songs,\\" a compilation of songs all with lyrics by Blanche Merrill, most with music by Leo Edwards. With the exception of \\"I'm an Indian,\\" none of the songs had been previously published, although nearly all of them had been written in the early 1920s.Blanche Merrill, Leo Edwards, Edwin Weber, Fanny Brice's Comedy Songs, New York: Mills Music, 1939.\\"Publish Lyrics,\\" Variety (September 13, 1939), p. 35. Ultimately she was not successful in steady work in radio and essentially retired. 1940‚Äî1948 In 1940, Merrill was engaged as one of the writers to supply material for a revue. It was to be produced by Leonard Sillman and, like others in his series of revues, provisionally titled New Faces. The revue would have brought back movie actors Joe Cook and Patsy Kelly to Broadway. Others names floated as possible cast members were Pert Kelton and Rags Ragland.\\"'New Faces' May Be Given More Adult Title,\\" Variety (April 17, 1940), p. 51.

The show ran for three performances before closing.[ http://www.ibdb.com/broadway- production/all-in-fun-1049 \\"All in Fun\\" at IBDB.com.] One of the people in the cast was Imogene Coca whose apparent connection to Merrill would be useful ten years later. In 1942 Variety indicated a plan for Horn & Hardart to have a radio show aimed at children, different from their long-running The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour. It was to be called Automatically Yours (a pun since Horn & Hardart had a chain of automats) and would have included songs by Blanche Merrill and Leo Edwards (the notice does not indicate whether these were new songs or revivals of materials the pair had written in the 1920s).\\"Automat's Radio Show Into Legit Musical,' Variety (December 16, 1942), p. 42. Blanche Merrill's connection to the Duncan Sisters did not end in 1932. When she opened her office in 1938, one of her first tasks was to write material for Rosetta Duncan. A 1946 advertisement for the Duncan Sisters appearing at Joaquin Garay's Copacabana in San Francisco stated that their act included \\"special material by Blanche Merrill.\\"Advertisement, Variety (November 13, 1946), p. 45. A year later, a notice in Variety indicated that the Duncan Sisters were planning to start their own record company. To be known as \\"Duncan Disc Co.\\" they planned to have Merrill as their partner in the venture.\\"Duncan Sisters Run Own Platter Outfit,\\" Variety (December 31, 1947), p. 1. Apparently, these plans never came to fruition. Although unpublished, the Duncan Sisters and Merrill co-authored at least four songs in 1947.Library of Congress, Copyright Office, \\"Catalog of Copyright Entries: Third Series, Renewals\\" (Washington D.C.: Library of Congress, 1976), pp. 4793, 4844. A 1946 notice in Variety stated that Merrill was writing a semi- autobiographical novel entitled \\"I Wrote a Song\\" for Random House.\\"Literati: Chatter,\\" Variety (May 1, 1946), p. 28. By 1949, she had completed the novel \\"written wholly in rhyme\\" which was scheduled for publication either in fall 1949 or spring 1950.\\"Chatter: Broadway,\\" Variety (May 18, 1949), p. 54. The publication never occurred. 1949-1952: Television The earliest indication of Blanche Merrill's interest in television was a verse published in Variety at the beginning of 1949.Blanche Merrill, \\"Television,\\" Variety (January 5, 1949), p. 102. Over the course of 89 rhyming lines, she portrays television as a new invention that sparks curiosity, and then a frantic rush to capitalize on it, resuscitating vaudeville careers while threatening the movie industry. The reference to resusciating vaudeville careers was either anticipatory or based on first-hand knowledge, for later that year a brief notice in Variety indicated that Merrill was getting back into vaudeville because it provided television content. Merrill was vacationing in Atlantic City during August 1949 while working on ideas for radio and television, including \\"a show for Sid Caesar.\\"\\"Chatter: Broadway,\\" Variety (August 24, 1949), p. 62. That turned out to be Your Show of Shows. Apparently having worked together on the flop All in Fun, Merrill had already been working with Imogene Coca (having written ten songs for her) when, in April 1951, producer Max Liebman signed Merrill to work exclusively for Coca on Your Show of Shows.\\"Blanche Merrill's TV Deal,\\" Variety (May 2, 1951), p. 34. Merrill's final words on the subject of television appear to be another verse entitled \\"Dear Mr. Sponsor\\" and published in Variety at the start of 1952.Blanche Merrill, \\"Dear Mr. Sponsor,\\" Variety (January 2, 1952), p. 114 Her verse was written from the point of view of a housewife addressing a sponsor.

Technique Merrill knew her special skill resided in creating character songs. A 1915 advertisement for Lillian Shaw states: \\"Everybody knows that Lillian Shaw is the original character singer of character songs / songs written by Blanche Merrill (a real writer of character songs).\\"Advertisement in Variety (March 26, 1915), p. 36. As part of an article interviewing women songwriters, an anonymous author writing for The New York Sun was one of the few who raised the topic of the dearth of women in a field dominated by men.\\"What Makes a Song Hit Analyzed by Successful Ballad Writers,\\" The Sun (September 9, 1917), page 8. Comparing the composition of songs to sports, the author said that songwriting would be among the most difficult of tasks because women must have specialized knowledge to be able to write songs and be successful in the field. In response to what is the key to making songs work, Merrill replied \\"Give them Broadway in their songs.\\" one Broadway manager said to her: \\"Blanche, always put just a little touch of the risque in your songs,\\" an idea to which Merrill agreed. She said \\"I like to put human interest into a song. I try to make every line count, instead of depending on a couple of punch lines to get it across.\\" Part of Merrill's technique was meeting with a client (a performer), assessing their skills, noting their singing range an ability and seeing them on stage. In an interview Brice stated that she had the ideas for the songs, and Merrill wrote them out. The unidentified author of Variety article stated that that assertion contradicted what is known about Merrill's writing style. \\"It is a known fact\\" that Merrill used a separate contract for Brice in the Ziegfeld Follies that prohibited Brice or Ziegfeld to use the songs for anyone else without permission. Unlikely that Brice would have signed such a contract if she had been the originator of the songs.\\"Inside Stuff on Vaudeville,\\" Variety (November 25, 1925), p. 8. One profile described her as an \\"efficiency expert in songwriting.\\" She did not wait for inspiration. Rather, she knew she had a job and sat down to do it. She felt she produced her best work when under pressure. She appeared and worked in a businesslike manner. Analyzing the 1925 interview with Brice from the Post, Barbara Wallace Grossman recounts that the germ of an idea started with Brice, at seeing incongruity and ridiculousness in ballet dancers, chasing nobody. Meanwhile, sentence fragments also occurred to Brice: \\"Oh, would I were a bird! I would fly in the spring!\\" After thinking over the idea for a night, she would take the idea to Blanche Merrill and the two would work on it, Brice describing the setting and costumes, improvising and Merrill writing down ideas. Quoting Brice: \\"I giving my conception of the character and [Merrill] making a suggestion now and then and writing a line that might go with some movement of the ballet.\\"Barbara Wallace Grossman, \\"Funny Woman: The life and Times of Fanny Brice\\" (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1991), p. 100. Merrill's technique in creating a song or act was to visualize the characters as real people. For the interviewer Mary Mullett, Merrill described creation of the song \\"Becky is Back in the Ballet.\\" The title implies that Becky was away some place‚ÄîWhere? Why? What was the situation? Based on those questions, Merrill constructed an entire scenario which became the basis for the song's lyrics. \\"I can see Becky as plainly as I can see you. I know her and her big brother and her father and mother and all the rest of them. You see when I write a song it is almost like putting a whole story or a whole play into just a few verses.\\" The unique quality of Merrill's rhymes at the service of creating Becky's world can be seen in her lyrics for \\"Becky is Back in the Ballet.\\" VERSE Becky was a dancer Look how she danced Nighttime and day she triptoed away She got a job in the ballet But one night her foot made a slip She fell on her back with oi! such a crack She almost located her hip They thought she was dead from the bump on her head She should be in bed but instead: CHORUS Becky is back in the ballet Kicking her feet to the sky Becky is back in the ballet Doing a sweet butterfly Look how she goes Upon her toes She can pose on her toes on her big brother's nose She flies, she can flitter Hither and thither her feet they go with her She holds up the foot while she smiles with the face She tripples and skipples all over the place She shakes with a shiver and quives with a quiver Her father and mother will never forgive her Since Becky is back in the ballet. CHORUS 2 Becky is back in the ballet Dancing away with her feet Becky is back in the ballet Look she can ne'er do a spleet She kicks to the front The back and the side Some day she will kick and commit suicide She kneels, it's a twister From kneeling so much on her knee is a blister She goes all around she goes all 'round the place Someday she'll get dizzy and fall on her face No one can endure her they'll kill her or cure her Her father and mother are goin' to insure her Since Becky is back in the ballet. Merrill recounted how she created the song \\"I Look Like the Last Rose of Summer\\" for Lillian Shaw: > \\"...I had to write a song for her and it was to be a German number: that is > in German dialect. I hadn't any idea when I sat down to write it what it was > going to be about: but I like objects, so I asked myself what object I could > make use of in the song. And the first thing that came into my mind‚Äîheaven > knows why!‚Äîwas a baby carriage. Well, naturally, a baby carriage suggested a > married woman. And there I was! The whole picture of the tired, forlorn, > disillusioned, little immigrant mother and her views on matrimony came > before my mind.\\" When I'm writing a song I do the words and melody together, > as I go along. Perhaps that isn't the way other song writers do, but it > happens to be my way. First I write a couple of lines of the words and then > I get up and‚Äîyou know‚Äî...\\" she shows the interviewers how she tried to fit > the lines with rhythm and accent and motion. Then I write a few more lines > and get those so they will sing. Sing‚Äîand act! For these aren't drawing room > songs, or concert songs. They are comedy songs. And that means they've got > to be actable as well as singable. They don't read well because they are not > in any regular meter.\\" There never was any vers libre in the world half so > free as the verse for these comedy songs. The rhythm is all given by the > music. And that changes oftener than weather in April. One of the ways of > giving punch, for instance, is to give one or two words as much length, > musically, as perhaps the next dozen words get. These tricks, if you want to > call them that, make the song very effective; but when the lines are read > they seem absolutely impossible.\\" All this is particularly true of songs > like the one I was just speaking of, the one about the young German mother. > When Lillian Shaw sang it she came on the stage pushing an old baby carriage > with a fake baby in it. She wore an old brown dress and a shabby old hat and > she just looked tired, tired, tired. I LOOK LIKE THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER Verse: Henry Blaum vas introduced to me Ven I joost came here from Germany. He vas fat an' foolish in der looks. But he made love like dem fellows in der books. Vee got married and I tell you what! In my heart I vish dot vee vas not! Love! Dot's nice! But take it right from me, Marriage ain't vot it's crackled up to be! Chorus: From six in the morning till the sun goes down I push and push this t'ing around'. Oh dat's lovely I don't tink! Look! Like de vater! Always crying for a drink! If I were single once again, I'd keep avay from der marriage mit der men. Oh, vat a life you lead ven you're a vife!

Minnen och anteckningar / 3 (1897-1905) Life Louise von Fersen was the daughter of Fabian von Fersen (1762‚Äì1818) and Louise Piper and thus niece of Axel von Fersen the Younger. She was the sister of Axel von Fersen (1798‚Äì1839), Fabian von Fersen (born and died in 1800) and Gustaf Hans von Fersen (1802‚Äì1839). She married the courtier count Carl Gustaf Gyldenstolpe (1800‚Äì1872) in 1835 and became the mother of six children, among them foreign minister August Louis Fersen Gyldenstolpe and Ida Gyldenstolpe, who married Audley Charles Gosling. While Louise von Fersen had three older brothers, all died officially childless. When her youngest brother Gustaf Hans von Fersen, a known rake, died \\"totally d√©cr√©pit\\" in 1839, he had three daughters with the ballerina Carolina Brunstr√∂m, but no children in his three year old marriage with countess Sofie Bonde, and the entire von Fersen fortune and all of the estates within it was thereby inherited by Louise von Fersen. Among her inheritance was included the estates M√§ls√•ker House, Ljung Castle, Steninge Palace, Fersen Palace and Finn√•ker. Louise von Fersen and her husband were known for their luxurious and expensive lifestyle. They were particularly known for their gambling trips to the casinos of Bad Homburg, Wiesbaden and Baden-Baden. Their lifestyle gradually resulted in them having to sell of estate after estate to cover their debts. In 1853, the gambled away M√§ls√•ker to Fredrik √Ökerman on the steamer Gauthiod between Stockholm and L√ºbeck, in 1855 they were forced to sell Finn√•ker, and in 1865 the Fersen Palace in Stockholm. In 1867, they were finally declared bankrupt and their property, including Ljung and Steninge, was sold at public auction, which was a major scandal in contemporary Sweden. Louise von Fersen reportedly smashed a set of Manufacture nationale de S√®vres given to her uncle Axel von Fersen the Younger by Louis XVI of France to prevent it from being auctioned, and was threatened with imprisonment.

History  At the end of the 17th century the site was in the possession of the boyar Peter Lopukhin, the uncle of Queen Eudoxia Lopukhina. During the fire of 1812, the Lopukhins' estate was seriously damaged and five years later it was sold. Part of the possessions was acquired by the Lutheran community, and in 1818-1819 the church of St. Peter and Paul was built there. The other half of the plot was purchased by merchant E. F. Kippen and in 1817-1819 he built a manor house with a classical portico there. A fragment of the wall of the old Lopukhins' manor with a clypeus was found on the right side of the main house during the restoration works. In 1844 the St. Petersburg crook K. Kh. Toll rebuilt the right wing of the manor, building the second floor. In 1857, the collegiate recorder A. I. Chernov built a left wing. At that time, behind the main house of the estate was a large garden (now there is a fire department number 47). At the end of the 19th century the estate was bought by the merchant F. N. Konkin.  Architecture  The complex of the Kippen manor includes several buildings (Starosadskiy lane, house 5/8, building 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The main house is in the backyard. On the central axis are the front gate. The central part of the facade of the manor house is marked with a large portico of six Doric half-columns, which unite two floors. The portico is completed by an almost smooth entablature and a large pediment. On the sides of the portico are two entrances, covered with wide forged umbrellas.

One of thousands of Indigenous children removed from their families by the Canadian government during the Sixties Scoop, she was taken from her mother at 8 weeks of age and adopted by a non- Indigenous family. Her adoptive family encouraged an exploration of her Indigneous roots and she began beading at the age of 7. Smith reconnected with her birth mother, who was also an artist, as an adult and discovered that they shared a passion for beadwork. Beadwork Smith was first drawn to beadwork as a child and is a predominantly self-taught artist. Her own work is rooted in traditional practice and incorporates natural materials including sweet grass, birch bark and porcupine quill. She was featured as a First Nations artist at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. A custodian of traditional beadwork, Smith has collected and exhibited pieces at various museums as a way of educating people about the practice. Smith curated her first show, Spirit Seeds: A Celebration of First Nations Beadwork, at the Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives in 2014. It featured beadwork from her personal collection of artifacts, including beaded bags and Iroquois smoking caps dating to as early as the mid-1800s, along with contemporary pieces by Smith and fellow Indigenous artists. In addition to her beadwork and exhibition work, Smith offers educational workshops focused on traditional Woodlands culture.

Highland Ave and College St. in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The spring was originally built in 1896 in the Romanesque architectural style, and was later renovated in 1912 in the neoclassical style.  History  The exact origin of the tapping of the natural spring which was later Howe Springs remains unknown. The first report on the history of the site came during its construction in 1896, and it claims that the location of where the spring was constructed was originally home to a Native American settlement.‚ÄúGen. Howe Fountain.‚Äù Pittsburgh Press, October 18, 1896. The origin of Howe Springs began when Thomas Marshall Howe and his family moved from Ohio to Pennsylvania and bought the location, which he named the Greystone Estate. Thomas Howe was one of Pittsburgh's most prominent citizens, involving himself in the financial and political sectors, as well as contributing to a significant amount of philanthropic work. Howe served two terms in the U.S House of Representatives representing Pittsburgh as a Whig. He later would become one of the founding members of the Republican Party in 1858. During the Civil War he served as Assistant Adjunct General for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Howe also turned down President Grant‚Äôs nomination for Secretary of the Treasury and President Hayes‚Äô nomination for Secretary of War. Howe also held a number of financial positions as the head of various companies during his career. The Howe family was first inspired to create Howe Springs following the devastating Johnstown Flood of 1889, with the idea of making water accessible and free to the public.‚ÄúGeorge Wilkins Guthrie and Florence J. Howe‚Ä¶‚Äù The Pittsburgh Press, April 7, 1938. The first structure that was built around the spring was built by the architectural firm Alden & Harlow and was constructed by John Shreiner in 1896. This structure was erected as a posthumous memorial to Thomas Howe by his wife, Mary A. Howe.‚ÄúAmateur Sports.‚Äù The Pittsburgh Press, September 28, 1896. Following Mary Howe's death, the Howe heirs sold the Greystone Estate, which included the spring, to Michael Benedum in 1910, and included a broad clause to ensure that the spring would remain free and open to the public.Deed of Sale from George W. Guthrie et al to Sarah Nancy Benedum, 27 December 1910, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, Deed Book vol. 1695, pp. 127-130. County Recorder's Office, Pittsburgh, Pa. Michael Benedum was a wealthy businessman in Pittsburgh, making his fortune in the oil and natural gas industries. He was also an important philanthropist in Pittsburgh, and a significant historical figure. The new ownership immediately encountered problems with the spring. In April 1911 it was reported that the water in Howe Springs was found to be impure by the City Water Bureau, and city workers destroyed the structure that had fed the spring.‚ÄúWar on Over Howe Spring.‚Äù Pittsburgh Daily Post, April 5, 1911. Howe's descendants, who wanted to make sure that the spring continued to be free and open to the public, took legal action against the city and the new owners. In order to end the drama around the spring, a plan for a new structure was done by architect W.H. Van Tine.‚ÄúPlan to Improve the Howe Spring.‚Äù Pittsburgh Daily Post, April 6, 1911. In addition to a new structure around the spring, a new spring was also designed to be built which would improve water quality.‚ÄúTo Protect Howe Spring.‚Äù Pittsburgh Daily Post, April 7, 1911. The new structure and spring were completed in 1912, and once again Howe Springs was opened to the public in its new neoclassical design.‚ÄúHowe Spring in Grecian Shelter.‚Äù The Pittsburgh Daily Post, January 2, 1912.‚ÄúHowe Spring again Open to the Public.‚Äù The Pittsburgh Press, June 15, 1912. Howe Springs was nominated in January 2016 to become a City Historic Landmark by Preservation Pittsburgh.  Architecture  The original structure around how springs was done by architecture firm Alden & Harlow, who were active mainly in Boston and Pittsburgh. Their structure was designed in the Romanesque Revival style, and lasted from 1896-1910.Floyd, Margaret.

Van Tine's structure was designed in the neoclassical style, and construction finished in 1912.

Currently located at Canadian Forces Base Winnipeg, the RCAF Band provides musical accompaniment for ceremonies of the RCAF in Canada. The band is presently under the command of Captain Matthew Clark. History In 1946, Carl Friberg, a wartime bandmaster working as a public relations representative in Vancouver, was invited to form a professional band for the RCAF No.2 Training Command in Winnipeg. It became operational the next year and was transferred to Edmonton as the North West Air Command Band. The band's first high-profile performance was during the Earl Alexander of Tunis's (Governor General of Canada from 1946 ‚Äì1952) tour of western Canada in 1948. In 1955, the band became the Tactical Air Command Band which coincided with an increase in musicians, going from 35 to 55. The band was transferred back to Winnipeg in 1964 and was combined with the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery Band in 1968 to become the National Band of the Canadian Armed Forces which was made up of 90 members at the time. The other members of the band became part of the newly formed Canadian Forces Air Transport Command Band and was transferred to the Canadian Forces Air Command in 1975, with its headquarters in Winnipeg and was renamed the Air Command Band. During the reformation of the Music Branch in 1994, the band was expanded from 35 to 45 members. The band changed its name again in 1997 to the Band of 1 Canadian Air Division when that particular unit was formed. Unlike its predecessors, this was a downgrade as decreased in the number of musicians. Another name change came in 2000 when it was changed back to \\"Air Command Band\\". In 2009, a major reorganisation of the band occurred. An increase of demand prompted its leadership to create new subdivisions such as the Command Brass and an eight member pipes and drums (not to be confused with the RCAF Pipes and Drums).https://www.pressreader.com/canada/moose-jaw-express- com/20111208/281891590103160 As of 2020, both of those ensembles have been dissolved. In 2011, with the restoration of royal military prefixes, the band was renamed the Royal Canadian Air Force Band. In July 2018, the band took part in the changing of the Queen's Guard at Buckingham Palace in London for the first time.

It is the site of the original Marulan township prior to the moving of the village in the 1860s in the wake of the Main Southern railway bypassing the original town. It is also known as Mooroowoolen. It was built from 1835 to 1867. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The establishment of towns outside of the County of Cumberland did not gain momentum until the 1830s. This decade became an intensive period of town founding in New South Wales. The thirteen year boom receded in 1842 when economic depression temporarily halted expansion. During this period however 53 new towns and villages were planned by the colonial administration. Many Australian towns originated because of the need for provision of services. Typically, an inn would be established on a colonial road and then other service establishments would be attracted to the location, such as a general store, blacksmith, wheelwright etc. The colonial roads contained many such hamlets providing for travellers needs. The essential qualities of a service town are that it serves a population outside its own boundaries and produces services for sale rather than goods. Marulan began as one such service town in the early days of the boom period of the 1830s. The colonial administration was responsible for the setting aside of land for villages and town reserves and subsequently for design and layout of these centres. The decision as to their location was based upon constraints relating to the nature of the settlement. Thus the site for a service town would be determined largely by transport routes. Since river and road transport antedated selection of town sites in most cases, they exerted a controlling influence on site location. A town of the 1830s was often no more than a small cluster of buildings and this remained the situation even during the land boom of the 1830s. Apart from the wayside public house, the smallest settlements were hamlets, recognised by the possession of a general store and a blacksmith or shoemaker. In the south, Gunning, Bungendore and Marulan, which depended on road traffic represented this type of town. The town plans drawn up by the Surveyor General's office reflected the size and type of the individual town. In contrast to the major regional centres, ordinary towns and villages were not given detailed layout plans and the smaller villages such as Marulan, designed to provide services to travellers, were characterised by linear plans following a largely single street pattern. By reserving an area for a village prior to the growth of that district a certain primacy was afforded to that location. Any businessmen who considered locating outside the government reserve would have faced considerable disadvantages. The advantages of the village sites were that within the reserved area: # It was possible to purchase a small parcel of land; # post offices and government buildings were available; # mailcoaches stopped; # The government was required to provide services and improved conditions. The disadvantages of other locations stifled development away from the reserve. Within the Marulan district only one location possessed the features to satisfy the requirement of a village reserve and that was where the village began.  Site selection  The Great South Road, south of the Cumberland Plain, was first marked out by Surveyor-General Mitchell in 1829-30. It ran parallel to the coast and passed through the village of Bungonia. A branch road was also marked out to leave the main line at the beginning of the Marulan Range. This road was to lead to the Goulburn Plains and township. Mitchell then returned to select suitable sites for the founding of towns and villages. At the junction of the roads from Bungonia and Goulburn he selected a place to serve the travellers on these new roads. The name given to the site was Marulan. He saw the function of the village as that of a wayside settlement and so chose the site where traffic would be greatest. He also noted the importance of a supply of fresh water and as Barber's Creek was nearby this constraint could be satisfied. Mitchell instructed a surveyor to lay out some allotments to allow occupation in 1834, although the design of the complete village had not yet been approved. Apparently requests had been made for the early subdivision of sites.  The development of the village  Marulan was given a simple design with no side streets and with all allotments having frontages to the major roads. The design is unusual in that it does not conform to the 1829 Government regulations for the laying out of towns and villages, presumably because there was no intention for Marulan to become a town. Due to the road junctions, reservations were provided on three corners of the intersection, with the largest reservation on the high side of the junction being the Church reserve, maintaining the tradition of allocating the most prominent position in a settlement to the church. All other allotments were equally placed around the road junction. Approval of the design was notified in March 1835 One of the first buildings in the village area was the Woolpack Inn, built by Joseph Peters in 1835. Confusion and concern about the future of the village plan in 1835 had prompted Peters to write to the Surveyor General referring to the fact that he had \\"nearly\\" completed a large brick house and stable for the accommodation of the public, and would be unjustly injured if the road was realigned further. Fortunately for Peters the line of the road was not altered. Subsequently, Peters applied to be the Marulan postmaster and was appointed so in 1836. Also at this time a blacksmiths shop was established, and together with the inn and post office, supplied the basic needs of the travellers. In 1841 the Church Reserve was surveyed with three allotments being created for a church, a dwelling and a school. On a visit in 1847 Bishop William Broughton inspected the \\"commodious chapel in which the divine service is periodically performed\\". During the late 1830s and 1840s the sale of land at Marulan continued and the original design of the village was extended. The first additional allotments merely extended the village linearly along the Great South Road, but later depth was added to the village. As the need arose for house sites, side streets were included and allotments were surveyed with frontage to these minor streets. There were however probably not as many residents as appears from the number of lots in the village as often one person owned several lots and other areas were held by absentee landholders. A decade after the founding of the settlement it was described as \\"a small cluster of houses with two inns, a post office and three or four stores procuring custom.\\"(Sydney Morning Herald, 11 January 1847) A notice of sale appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of 18 February 1850 relating to four allotments in the centre of the village and described as the land at the corner of Barbour Street and opposite the Woolpack Inn. The notice refers to the following improvements: # The Australian Store, with attached four bedroom dwelling of brick construction on stone footings; # A schoolhouse of timber slabs; # A stable for five horses with loft; and # A court house of brick on stone foundation, lately out of use, the Court having been discontinued since 1 January 1850. All the buildings offered for sale were described as being large and of sound construction.  The railway  During the 1840s there was much discussion of the possibility of a southern railway either along the line of the Great South Road or through Goulburn. The decision was finally made in favour of Goulburn. Nevertheless, for the route of the railway Marulan was an important point for it stood on the ridge which separated the valleys of the Shoalhaven River and the Wollondilly River. This was the narrowest piece of land between the two rivers so that whatever route was chosen it had to pass in the vicinity of the village. Pressure was applied on the government by many local landowners wishing to profit from the proximity of the railway to their land. It would seem that some at least had more influence than the Marulan residents for when finally drawn up in 1857 and confirmed by legislation in 1862 the line passed to the north of the village and not sufficiently near to it to ensure the village's future. The political decision to so locate the railway completely changed the patterns and means of transport in that district. For Marulan specifically it meant that the village no longer had access to through traffic and had to move to the point where the two transport corridors crossed. If the village had refused to move it is most probable that a completely new settlement would have been founded near the railway.  The new town site  At the time of construction of the railway, the population in the neighbourhood of Marulan increased, however at the end of 1867, as work on the viaduct across Barber's Creek neared completion, many of the railway workers moved to the next section of the line. John Morrice, the owner of the property \\"Glenrock\\", took advantage of the railways construction by subdividing the land fronting the main road in the vicinity of the railway. He named this town Mooroowoolen, and an advertisement for the sale of lots appeared in 1867. It was about 2 miles from Marulan. Unfortunately for Morrice the railway station was not opened until August, 1868, and the demand for his sites was poor. The only real interest was shown by those who operated businesses at Marulan. The Marulan Postmaster and storekeeper, John O'Neill erected new premises at Mooroowoolen and the Mooroowoolen post office operated after February 1868. The inns at the old town were closed, also relocating near the railway. An article in the \\"Sydney Morning Herald\\" of 12 May 1868, described the impact of the railway: > \\"The railway crosses the main road at right angles to the little township of > Mooroowoolen. Marulan is a curiosity in townships. At one time it was a > thriving and busy place, but now the buildings are going to decay, and there > seems little prospect of improvement.\\" Since most of the children attending the Marulan Public School had moved to Mooroowoolen it was decided to also move the school. Temporary premises were rented from June 1870 and occupation of a new school on a site donated by John Morrice commenced in December, 1871. A new stone church was opened at Mooroowoolen on 1 October 1878 replacing the chapel at the old town site. The moving of the church represented the final stage of the relocation of Marulan. Gradually Mooroowoolen became known as Marulan. The old township was in a state of ruin and the new town contained all the relevant services to cater for the needs of travellers. The function of the settlement had not changed and the layout of the new township was similar to that of the original village; its form remained basically linear still focussing on the main road.  Description  A village plan still exists. The Hume Highway (formerly the Great South Road), Bungonia Street and Barber Street remain in present use, and a number of other streets are still identifiable. Barber Street currently provides access to trucks carrying material from mines in Bungonia Gorge although the road alignment has been altered at the intersection of the highway. This plan is the final plan of the village layout dated and a series of earlier plans of the growing town have been located dated 1835, 1839, 1841. A detailed description of archaeological features and relics is located in the field survey.  (i) Eastern Section  Remains of the town buildings and associated structures are concentrated on the eastern side of the highway. The approximate position of the N/S property boundaries along the highway is indicated by a fence line with heavy vertical timber posts. Field survey has identified the position of a substantial number of surface features in these areas associated with the original township. These include: :(a) foundations of a line of stone, brick and slab buildings which once stood along the highway :(b) evidence of domestic planting :(c) remains of fences, walls and hedges along property boundaries :(d) depressions representing the alignment of streets :(e) refuse piles containing domestic debris :(f) one substantial (possible) communal well :(g) evidence of a blacksmith's forge :(h) an industrial area containing evidence of brick and lime manufacture for the production of building materials :(i) concentrations of brick, worked stone and artefact scatters indicating previous human occupation of the land :(j) various other features such as rectangular depressions and large bramble brushes which are characteristic of disturbed land resulting from human occupation :(k) two cemeteries containing burials from the period of settlement to the present time  (ii) Western Section  While the greatest number of sites have been identified on the eastern side of the highway, evidence of the previous occupation is apparent on the western side of the highway. Sites include: :(i) a concentration of ceramic and glass fragments and a small number of broken bricks was found on the grass verge on the DMR reserve; though disturbed, it would appear that the material relates to the site of the Woolpack Inn known to have stood on this land. :(ii) mature introduced vegetation in Section 7, indicative of early garden planting :(iii) a large bramble bush (section 5) possibly represents an early building site Field survey did not locate relics in Section 5 or \\"Appendix B\\".  Archaeological evidence  The concentration of surface finds in some areas indicates the location of subsurface, stratified archaeological deposits; however, no systematic archaeological excavation has been undertaken within the curtilage. The deposits of archaeological significance indicating the nature of occupation and settlement of Old Marulan Town are distributed throughout the site. Surface evidence predominates in some sections of the site and it can be predicted that the whole site contains covered relics which are not visible without excavation.  Heritage listing  The site of Old Marulan Town is considered to be an outstanding archaeological resource which is able to vividly illustrate unrecorded details of Australian history relating to the form and functions of an early colonial service town, and the way of life of its inhabitants. Examination of the ground surface indicates that the total area of the site contains relics relating to the early occupation of the town. Future archaeological research of the site should result in a wealth of information which is only suggested from surface findings. The significance of the relics and deposits within the land is heightened by the limited period of the town's existence and the subsequent lack of further development of the land. The site therefore is a rare \\"time capsule\\" relating to colonial town life from 1835-67 which has suffered minimal contamination from later phases of use. Exploitation of the site in order to gather historic information would necessitate the preparation of a full research study prior to archaeological excavation of any part of the site in order that all possible avenues of research be considered. Old Marulan Town was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The town site is a valuable historical and archaeological site rich in information relative to the formand function of an early colonial country town and the way of life of its inhabitants. It was established in the earliest expansions of town and village settlement beyond the Cumberland Plain. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Old Marulan's significance is two-fold. First, the number of towns dating from this early period which were not developed after the 1860s is very small. Those known to exist include Carrington, Boydtown and towns associated with mining activities. Second, although roughly of the same period, Old Marulan is unlike these other town sites. The mining \\"towns\\" were mainly canvas settlements built for a transient and itinerant population and generally contained few buildings of even a semipermanent nature. Examples of this type of township include Hill End, Byng and Silvertown from the 1850s and 60's and Newnes and Glen Davis and Joadja from the turn of the century.

History The 2nd Destroyer Flotilla originated in early 1907 as a part of a Home Fleet Flotilla within the Home Fleet. In February 1909, that Home Fleet Flotilla was split into the 2nd and 4th Destroyer Flotillas. The new flotilla was then assigned to the 2nd Division of the Home Fleet from February 1909 to May 1912. From May 1912 to July 1914 the flotilla was part of the Home Fleet's First Fleet. It was then transferred to the Grand Fleet from August 1914 to April 1916. After its stay with the Grand Fleet the flotilla was assigned to the Plymouth Command from April 1916 to November 1917 and was stationed at Devonport. It was next assigned to the Coast of Ireland Station from November 1917 to November 1918 based at Derry. After World War One the flotilla was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet from December 1918 to November 1924. In December 1924 it was sent to join the Mediterranean Fleet where it stayed until June 1932. It was recalled back to home waters as part of the Home Fleet between from June 1932 to August 1936. It was sent back to join the Mediterranean Fleet from August 1936 until September 1939. The flotilla was gradually dispersed to the South Atlantic and West Indies, and in January 1940 it was reformed once more as part of the Home Fleet until May 1940. On 1 June 1940 it was sent to join the Mediterranean Fleet until 1 August 1942. It was next transferred to the Eastern Fleet where it remained until June 1943 when it was disbanded.

Background and education She was born in Kabarole District on 12 May 1976. She attended Ugandan schools until she graduated Senior 4 in 1994. She went on to obtain a certificate in Project Planning and Management from Makerere University, in 1998. She followed that with a certificate in computer science, obtained in 2000, also from Makerere University. In 2002, she graduated with a Diploma in Journalism and Media Management, from the Uganda Management Institute, in Kampala, the capital and largest city in Uganda. She also has a Bachelor of Arts degree, awarded by the Mountains of the Moon University, in Fort Portal, in the Western Region of Uganda. Career before politics Rwabogo started her career in 1997, working as a community programme officer for women and child development. She then worked as a community trainer for a non-profit organisation called Africa Media Alliance, serving in that capacity until 2000. For one year, she worked as an intern news-reporter for the New Vision newspaper. For the next thirteen years, until 2015, she worked in various capacities with several radio stations, including (a) Voice of Toro (b) Better FM and (c) Hits FM.

In 2016, she won the Kabarole Women Representative constituency on the National Resistance Movement political party ticket. During the 2017 parliamentary debate about removing the age-limit restrictions from the Ugandan Constitution, Rwabogo was a vocal opponent of the age amendment. Controversy Beginning in November 2017, Sylvia Rwabogo began receiving unsolicited telephone calls and SMS messages from someone, whom the MP first mistook for a constituent. Later, the phone calls became romantic, and when she blocked her tormentor's phone number, her tormentor turned to text messages. When the unwanted messages persisted, Ms. Rwabogo, who is single, reported the matter to the police, who laid a trap for the arrest of the harasser. The culprit turned out to be a 25-year-old male college student, who admitted to sending the offensive communication. He was promptly found guilty, and sentenced to two years behind bars. Other responsibilities Sylvia Rwabogo is a member of the parliamentary committee on HIV/AIDS and related diseases. She also concurrently serves on the parliamentary committee on agriculture.

Thanathorn believes the construction of this dam exemplified government's lack of accountability and crony-capitalism that peaked with the 1997 economic crisis.  Business career  After completing his studies, Thanathorn set out to pursue a career with the United Nations, and was offered a position as a development worker for the UN in Algeria. Thanathorn was forced to abandon his plans when his father, Pattana Juangroongruangkit, was diagnosed with cancer. Following his father's death in 2002, Thanathorn returned to Thailand and assumed leadership of the Thai Summit Group at the age of 23. Under Thanathorn‚Äôs leadership, the company's revenues grew from 16 billion baht in 2001 to 80 billion baht in 2017. Thanathorn oversaw the transformation of the company into a global conglomerate with manufacturing facilities in seven countries and more than 16,000 employees worldwide. In 2005, Thanathorn struck a deal with the US auto-maker, Tesla to supply 500,000 cars per year. The deal was noted as a \\"new record\\" for Thai Summit Group with total sales of 7.9 billion baht and a profit of 5.98 billion baht. Thanks to the deal, the Thai Summit Group set up factories in the United States. In 2009, Thanathorn led the company to acquire the world's largest mould maker, the Japanese company Ogihara. Thanathorn served as the President of the Federation of Thai Industry's Nakhon Nayok Chapter for two consecutive terms, between 2008 and 2012. He was also the youngest elected Secretary-General of the Thai Auto Parts Manufacturers Association, serving between 2007 and 2010. Thanathorn was also a member of the Industrial Cluster Development Board of Thailand's National Science and Technology Development Agency. In May 2018, after 17 years as Executive Vice-President of the Thai Summit Group, Thanathorn resigned from this position after being elected leader of the Future Forward Party.  Political career  Thanathorn in party meeting in 2019 On 15 March 2018, Thanatorn and Piyabutr Saengkanokkul, a former constitutional law professor at Thammasat University, along with a group of like-minded individuals, filed for the creation of a new political party, Future Forward (Thai: ‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡∏ï‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà), with the Election Commission of Thailand. Thanathorn was unanimously elected as the party's leader at the party's first public meeting in May 2018. Since founding the party, Thanathorn has advocated his vision for the party: the return of civilian government and demilitarization of Thai politics, greater political accountability, a fairer distribution of wealth, a social welfare system that promotes human dignity and greater decentralisation of power. In order to guarantee Future Forward's independence and transparency, the party has developed a funding structure which relies entirely on donations from party members and supporters. The Future Forward Party goal is to raise 350 million baht from party members and the public to pursue its campaign in the 2019 general election. Due to his business experience, relative youth, and political views, international media have drawn comparisons between Thanathorn and French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Thanathorn is occasionally referred by Thai media as the \\"billionaire commoner\\", representing the struggle to amend the social class system in Thailand. He is also jokingly referred to as \\"Daddy\\" by his young female supporters. Thanathorn and two other senior party members, Jaruwan Sarankate and Klaikong Vaidhyakarn, were charged by police with the Computer Crime Act after an NCPO member filed an allegation against them for transmitting false information or information that damages the country's stability in relation with the Facebook Live Broadcast on 29 June 2018. The three politicians were ordered to meet investigators at the Technology Crime Suppression Division (TCSD) on Friday, 24 August 2018 to hear charges against them. Through their lawyer, they asked to postpone the date to 17 September 2018, saying the order had come at a short notice and they were already tied up with their planned schedule. Thanathorn previously appeared on 31 July 2018 as a witness, but refrain from giving a statement on the allegations to officials.. Thanathorn was among the MPs elected in the 2019 vote. One month later, the Election Commission accused him of holding shares in a media company, V-Luck Media, when he registered as an MP candidate, which would violate election laws and disqualify him as an MP. Thanathorn has denied these charges, stating that all his shares had been transferred a month prior to his registration. On 23 May 2019, one day before the opening of the new parliament, the Constitutional Court voted unanimously to accept the case submitted by the Election Commission against Thanathorn, and voted 8-1 to suspend Thanathorn's MP status until a ruling is reached. He was permitted to attend the opening ceremony to take his oath before being ordered to leave. Thanathorn was nominated for prime minister by a coalition of anti-junta parties, but lost to incumbent prime minister and coup leader Prayut Chan-o- cha. On 20 November, the Constitutional Court convicted Thanathorn, disqualifying his MP status. In his mandatory disclosure of assets to the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC), Thanathorn reported assets of 5.6 billion baht, making him the wealthiest member of the Thai parliament.  Personal life  Thanathorn is married to Rawiphan Juangroongruangkit. They have four children together. Angered by the 2006 coup, Thanathorn gave his son the nickname, Demo (Thai: ‡πÄ‡∏î‡πÇ‡∏°‡πà), from the Greek root demos ('democracy'). In his free time, Thanathorn enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking, trekking, climbing, marathons, kayaking, cycling, diving and mountaineering. He has participated in various extreme sports competitions, including the Tor Des G√©ants and the Sahara Marathon. Thanathorn was the first Asian to complete the 560 km self-supported foot race above the Arctic Circle. In an interview about his style and grooming, Thanathorn revealed that he doesn't use any facial or hair products and doesn't use soap or shampoo while showering. He also revealed that he wears generic white shirts and pleated khakis as a daily uniform. The only investment he makes into his wardrobe is for his climbing and running clothing for his outdoor hobbies. Asked about his media diet, Thanathorn says he reads foreign newspapers like The New York Times, The Economist, Financial Times, and Thai newspapers like Matichon and Krungthep Turakij (Bangkok Business). He is a big fan of esports and games such as Minecraft and Arena of Valor, which he cites as one of the tools he uses to connect with his children.

Data plans are offered by internet service providers. These include mobile data plans, offered on cellular networks, from cellular telephony companies, and those from conventional fixed land line links, amongst other forms of offered data communications. Network data hosting servers also offer plans based on data served, such as for websites.  Reasons for data caps/plans  Data plans are primarily designed by network carriers to limit the maximum amount of bandwidth offered for either cellular or cable services. This allows the network to facilitate more customers at a time while having less overall stress on its network. Cellular and satellite networks especially require these systems due to the high upfront costs of towers or satellite transmitters, costing up to three-hundred-fifty thousand dollars for one tower.  Cellular/satellite data plan formatting  Data plans, sometimes also referred to as data caps, are usually created by a binding contract between the telecommunications carrier and the user of their service. This contract outlines a maximum amount of usable data, usually highlighted in either megabytes or gigabytes, allotted per month for the user. In most cases companies will allow a user to surpass the amount of data allowed in the contract, however, will have to pay a per-gigabyte fee, ranging anywhere from five to fifteen U.S. dollars.  Popularization of unlimited plans  Unlimited data plans have seen a large increase in usage by consumers since their initial introduction by U.S. network T-Mobile. These plans, instead of setting an overall maximum for the user, have an amount set-up that, when surpassed, will slow the speed of the network for that user. Unlimited plans typically cost significantly more than the traditional shared data plans, which is a major reason that carriers have set large boundaries and fees. The limits imposed on unlimited plans are designed to fight against attempts to misuse the network, such as a DDoS attack, but are more commonly reasoned as a method to increase the number of people that can use one tower simultaneously.  Data speed changes  When a network is near reaching peak capacity data speeds may be slowed down by carriers as part of most major telecomm contracts. This, as stated previously, allows for more people to be utilizing one tower, reducing needed capital for the company. Since speed changes are allowed at the company's will, the user has no official guarantee of speed on most major networks.  Costs brought upon by additional data  In many cases both the user and carrier have to incur additional costs when a user utilizes more of a given data package, which has helped in the proliferation of data caps and other forms of shared data plans. Most of the charges that the carrier has to incur for additional data usage is partially or fully given to the user of the network. = Users = Users are required to pay flat- rate additional fees that occur when they go above the amount of data given to them in their contract, utility, or prepaid plan. The cost per gigabyte of this fee is usually higher than what the contract itself offers, which discourages users from over-utilizing data and incurring a charge for the carrier. Certain contracts, which do not offer paying additional fees for an increase in data, may result in a shutdown of service, or in extremely rare cases, termination of the service as a whole. = Carriers = Carriers incur costs for additional data usage, as it limits the number of customers, and associated contracts, that they can handle on one network. Creating more cell phone towers in a given area would be costly, and largely useless until particular spikes in traffic. When the peak usable amount of one tower is reached, it may cause negative public relations towards the reliability of the corporation as a whole.  Cable data plan formatting  Traditional cable and fiber providers do not need to worry to the same degree about tower maintenance, as most of the costs of having additional bandwidth have been covered for years to come. Companies like Xfinity and AT&T; regularly boast data caps in excess of one terabyte, which a majority of users will never use in the given period of a month. This opens a question about why the data cap exists in the first place, and it is usually found to be a method to deter large-scale denial-of-service attacks on their networks, and suppress business customers from utilizing personal internet connections.  Bundling  Data caps are often associated with the allowed speeds of the network offered, as an attempt to associate two data restrictions together, which helps them to target market sectors easily. People who do not require fast data speeds usually do not need large data caps, and vice versa. This also creates the ability for corporations to up-sell customers on higher priced packages, similar to the operating methods of some cellular providers.

Background  A UFC Featherweight Championship bout between Max Holloway and Brian Ortega served as the event headliner. The fight was originally scheduled to take place at UFC 226, but Holloway pulled out due to \\"concussion like symptoms\\". In the co-headlining slot, a bout for the vacant UFC Women's Flyweight Championship between former UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship challenger Valentina Shevchenko and former UFC Women's Strawweight Champion Joanna Jƒôdrzejczyk took place. If victorious, Jƒôdrzejczyk would become the first woman to win titles in different divisions. They met previously in amateur muay thai and kickboxing, with Shevchenko winning all three encounters. On October 2, the UFC announced that Shevchenko would face Sijara Eubanks at UFC 230 instead, as that event was in need of a headliner. The fight between Shevchenko and Jƒôdrzejczyk was put back together a week later though, as a fight between then UFC Heavyweight and Light Heavyweight Champion Daniel Cormier and Derrick Lewis wound up filling the headlining slot at UFC 230. A lightweight bout between Gilbert Burns and Olivier Aubin-Mercier was previously scheduled to take place in February 2018 at UFC on Fox: Emmett vs. Stephens. However, Burns was pulled from the pairing during the week leading up to the event after medical officials deemed that it was unsafe for Burns to cut the necessary weight for the 156-pound limit. The fight has been rescheduled for this event. A middleweight bout between The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil 3 heavyweight winner Ant√¥nio Carlos J√∫nior and The Ultimate Fighter: Nations middleweight winner Elias Theodorou was initially scheduled to take place at UFC Fight Night: Santos vs. Anders. However, J√∫nior pulled out on August 28 due to injury. The pairing was then rescheduled for this event. In turn, on September 13, it was reported that J√∫nior was forced to withdraw as a surgery is required to treat the injury that caused the first cancellation of this bout. On October 1, it was reported that Eryk Anders would replace him. A light heavyweight bout between Jimi Manuwa and Thiago Santos was expected to headline UFC Fight Night: Santos vs. Anders, but the bout was scrapped due to an injury suffered by Manuwa. The pairing took place at this event. A featherweight bout between Renato Moicano and Mirsad Bektiƒá was expected to take place at the event. However, Bektic was forced out of the bout due to an undisclosed injury on November 15. In turn, Moicano is not expected to compete and instead will serve as a \\"replacement\\" option in the event that one of the headlining participants is unable to fight at the event. John Makdessi was expected to face Carlos Diego Ferreira at the event. However, Makdessi pulled out of the fight on November 28 and was replaced by returning veteran Jesse Ronson. However, on December 4, it was announced that Ronson was pulled from the bout after Ontario Athletics Commission officials deemed that he was too heavy to safely make the lightweight 156-pound limit. He was replaced by newcomer Kyle Nelson.

From 1738, the chambers belonged to Prince Konstantin Stepanovich Kantakuzen. Around the 1730s-1740s the chambers were reconstructed, having received a decor in the Annensk style. In 1744, Kantakuzen was purchased by Prince Alexander Alekseevich Dolgorukov. Later, Dolgorukov acquired two adjacent sites, and then began restructuring the chambers with a significant increase in their volume. The author of the project of reorganization is the architect Vasily Yakovlevich Yakovlev, as evidenced by the surviving drawings. The restructuring of the Chambers ended in 1764. Now the main facade was oriented towards the Church of the Assumption on Pokrovka, towards which there was a grand entrance driveway. Along Pokrovka there was also a parade fence with lions holding chains in their mouths. After perestroika, a coach carriage was made in the center of the mansion, separating the old part of the building from the new one. Guests could enter the building on carriages, and from the middle of the passage the side staircases led to the grand entrance hall with columns and sculptures. The mansion was not damaged during the fire of 1812, and Napoleon placed in it the central office of the French police. In September 1812, a trial took place over the Russian arsonists in Moscow. In the early 1930s a multi-storey residential building was built nearby, because of the angle of the oldest part of the mansion was dismantled. In 1997, the restoration of Dolgorukov's house was carried out, however, the elevator shaft of the residential building did not allow to completely restore the corner of the mansion. Restorers have restored the former main fa√ßade of the 17th century chambers, highlighting it in white. On the southern facade a pale yellow color shows the restructuring of 1730s and 1740s.

The middle part of the mansion is marked with a risalite with a Tuscan portico on the second floor, consisting of four pot-bellied half-columns. Thick rims on the half-columns are shifted downward from the canon's place (next to the echinus). Originally the courtyard facade was decorated with lateral rezalitas. In 1832, a two- storey extension was made to one of them.

It was added to the State and the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Samuel Hall was born in Derbyshire, England in 1818. After farming there, he emigrated to America, and by 1844 he and his brother George were in Milwaukee. There they joined a party of English immigrants, also from Derbyshire, and they all came out to Albion Prairie, where the first whites had settled only three years before. These English arrivals mostly settled in a group. Some were skilled in masonry and in 1847 they built a brick church for their Primitive Methodist congregation. Samuel Hall was a member and helped with the project. With Early on, Samuel, his wife Sara, and his brother George lived with Isaac Bunting on the farm. In 1854 they bought the farm from Isaac: 233 acres. George and Samuel then split the farm, with Samuel getting 100 acres. By 1856 Samuel was well-off enough to build a substantial house. The main block of the current house is the original house - a simple rectangle, two stories tall, with walls of coursed limestone. The style is Greek Revival, with the characteristic low-pitched roof, the cornice returns, and the symmetric placement of windows and door. Inside is a central staircase, typical for Greek Revival. A parlor on the first floor has elaborate baseboards and window trim. The rest of the house is trimmed more simply. The house originally had a summer kitchen as an ell where the stone wing is now - one story, built of wood. Samuel's wife Sarah died in 1865. When she died, Samuel hired Ann Wright as a helper. They married the following year, and eventually had three children. In 1867 Hall tore down the original summer kitchen and replaced it with a two-story ell with limestone walls like the original block, but simpler styling. An open porch runs along the side of the added wing. A one-story wing holding the kitchen was added at the same time. The Primitive Methodist Church held its Sunday School Anniversary and Picnic on July 4 in Samuel's grove of trees. The Edgerton Independent announced the picnic in 1877: > Singing and speaking will commence at 9:30 a.m. after which there will be a > table picnic provided by the ladies on the prairie, assisted by all who may > come with their pies and cakes to make it a grand social gathering. After > dinner, plays and sports of different kinds will commence, such as foot, > wheel-barrow and sack racing, playing ball, dropping the handkerchief, old > Miller, duck under the water kit, and many other plays that we are unable to > think of, but be assured that the people of Albion Prairie know how to have > a good time, and are bound to have it if the weather permits. The farm includes some agricultural buildings. A 30-foot pig barn was built of limestone at the same time as the house and still stands. There is also a 90-foot wooden dairy barn and concrete silo built before the 1930s. Northeast of the barn is an 80-foot tobacco shed. There is also a poultry barn and various sheds. Samuel died of pneumonia in 1888. His son George, 18 years old, quit school to take over the farm. He inherited both his father's and uncle's farms, and grew tobacco, grain, and hay, and raised pure-bred short-horned cattle and Polish China hogs. Descendants of Sam Hall farmed until 1951 - then rented out the farm.

Butterfly collecting  Pachliopta mariae marie) from Shannon's collection Mynes woodfordi shannoni in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London As a young man, Shannon was an avid butterfly collector, and before his posting in the Solomon Islands in World War II he consulted with entomologists at the Plant Diseases Division of the DSIR, who supplied him with cyanide for killing insects. He converted large biscuit tins for butterfly storage by installing racks of card on which to pin his collections. On one occasion he observed a male birdwing butterfly from a sandbagged radar station 15 feet above ground. Shannon jumped off the embankment, net in hand, and caught the butterfly before hitting the ground. \\"The bruises were worth it,\\" he later said. On the island of Malaita he observed one species, Mynes woodfordi, that congregated only in the tops of papaya trees, and constructed a special net with several bamboo pole extensions to capture one; the specimen many years later became the holotype of a new subspecies, which was named Mynes woodfordi shannoni in his honour. The butterflies Shannon collected were preserved in his storage tins, which were carried on boats and though surf from island to island throughout his military service. Ray Shannon in his Birkdale flat in October 1996, showing part of his butterfly collection to Rosemary Gilbert, entomology technician at Auckland Museum. After the war, he continued collecting well into his 80s, making expeditions to many tropical countries including Peru, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Guinea, Japan, and Costa Rica. He eventually amassed 400 drawers of butterflies, approximately 13,000 specimens: possibly the largest private butterfly collection in New Zealand. Shannon was also an assiduous collector of reference books about Lepidoptera, and continued to purchase butterfly specimens from dealers after his declining health prevented further expeditions. On his death, his papers and butterfly collection were donated to Auckland Museum, and became the centerpiece for the 2018 exhibition The Secret World of Butterflies.

Arriving in Wisconsin, he initially went to Muskego where other immigrants from Tinn had settled, but he felt that the land was too poor and marshy, so he moved on to the Koshkonong area. In August, near where his loft house stands today, he found three other immigrants from Tinn who had recently settled. He joined them, buying 160 acres for $200. Around 1844 he built his loft house. It is one story with an attic, with walls of horizontal rough-hewn red oak timbers, with the corners joined by dovetails and the gaps between logs filled with chinking strips and mortar. On the east end the second story overhangs five and a half feet beyond the first story, supported by posts. The building follows a traditional Norwegian folk form that probably dates from the late 1500s. The only other similar loft structure in the state is the Lisbakken Stabbar at Old World Wisconsin.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 and on the State Register of Historic Places the following year. Dr. Michael Iverson was born near Bergen, Norway in 1861. He studied medicine in Norway and Germany, then immigrated to America in 1891. In 1894 he established a practice in the heavily Norwegian-American community of Stoughton. By 1898 he was successful enough to build a large, stylish new home at 327 E. Washington. With The house was built by A.E. Ovran, two stories tall, built of wood with a hip roof and four gables. Jutting up from each gable peak is a narrow carved dragon head, said to be considered good luck by Norwegians at that time. Beneath the dragon heads, the gable ends are decorated with bargeboards and carved crosspieces. One window on the house is different - supposedly from the first church to use glass windows in Norway - inscribed \\"1700.\\" At one corner of the building is a round greenhouse. At the side entrance is a speaking tube through which patients could talk with Dr. Iverson in his bedroom at night, before the arrival of the telephone. Inside, the rooms originally included a parlor, music room, the doctor's office, and a maid's room. Iverson and his family lived in the house for seven years. In 1904 he established the Scandinavian-American Hospital in Stoughton, which eventually became Stoughton Community Hospital. It wasn't financially successful at first and he moved his family to the hospital in 1905, both to save money and for convenience. Peter Norman Johnson bought the house from Iverson in 1905. Johnson was another Norwegian, who arrived in 1849 and prospered at farming. He retired to the Iverson-Johnson house, and his daughter was still living there in 1988 when it was added to the NRHP.
