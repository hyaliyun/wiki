This behavior enables faster travel while reducing path lengths to cover more ground when travelling, searching for food and avoiding predators. Different types of suspensory behaviour include brachiation, climbing, and bridging. These mechanisms allow larger species to distribute their weight among smaller branches rather than balancing above these weak supports. Primates and sloths are most commonly seen using these behaviours, however, other animals such as bats may be seen hanging below surfaces to obtain food or when resting. == Biomechanics == Suspensory behavior seen in Ruffed Lemur (Varecia variegata) === In primates and sloths === Roosting behaviour in flying foxes (Pteropus conspicillatus) Animals who exhibit suspensory behaviour have similar mechanisms to perform this action and often involve many different parts of their body like the trunk, shoulders and many other features of their upper body. Typically, these animals have an overall dorso-ventral flattening, a shortened lumbar region and a mediolateral expansion of the rib cage causing the scapula to be repositioned dorsally and humeral articulation to be oriented more cranially than the usual lateral placement shown in quadrupedal animals. The scapula is also longer, giving these animals a particular arm and shoulder shape. Combined, these morphologies allow for the infraspinatus muscle to be repositioned creating more resistance to trans articular tensile stress for suspending below a branch. These animals also have longer clavicles, creating a bigger projection of the shoulder which increases the ability to move when the forearm is raised above the head. To help with supporting their weight, the forelimbs are elongated. The humerus is longer as well and this helps with the movement of the deltoid muscles in the shoulder joint when the arm is moving away from the body. The triceps branchii is small and there is a shorter distance to the elbow joint and a shorter olecranon process which allows for a greater elbow extension. There are many different ways animals, especially primates, position themselves during suspensory behaviour and these positions require different bones and muscles. Below is a list of different positions and their mechanisms. * Sit/forelimb-suspend: Most of the weight of the body is put on the ischium, however the abducted forelimbs grab a hold of a branch overhead and allow for the body to be stabilized and supports some of this weight that is being put on the ischia. * Cling/forelimb-suspend: One of the forelimbs is hanging causing more than half the weight to be put the hindlimbs and the clinging forelimb. * Forelimb- suspend: One or both arms is holding all the weight of the animal as it hangs from a branch. ** Unimanual forelimb-suspend: Suspension using one hand with lack of support from the rest of the body. The humerus is abducted and the elbow is usually extended completely. ** Bimanual forelimb-suspend: suspensions using both hands. ** Forelimb-suspend/sit: This is similar to sit/forelimb-suspend except more than half the weight is held by the forelimbs and not the ishchia. The arms of the animal are extended and the remainder of the weight is supported by the ishchia and/or feet. In this position one arm can hang, creating most of the weight to be held by the single forelimb. ** Forelimb-suspend/squat: suspension from above but the lower body is in a squat position. ** Forelimb-suspension/stand: Half of the weight is supported by the two forelimbs that are extended, the other half is supported from standing. ** Forelimb-suspend/cling: Hind limbs are flexed and grasping a support while one or both of the forelimbs are grasping the support as well, distributing the weight evenly. ** Forelimb-suspend/lie: suspension of the forelimbs with the back in a horizontal position, as if they were lying on their back. ** Trunk- vertical-suspend: One or both forelimbs and one or both hind limbs carry the weight. The foot/feet are above the level of the hip. This differs from other forms as all four limbs have tension. ** Unimanual flexed-elbow-suspend: Suspension with the humerus adducted and the elbow not extended. These parts of the body hold the animals entire weight. ** Bimanual flexed-elbow-suspend: similar to unimanual flexed-elbow-suspension, expect both hands are involved, not just one. * Forelimb-hindlimb-suspend: hanging from the arm and foot. ** Ipsilateral forelimb-hind-limb-suspend: suspension with a forelimb and hind limb on the same side of the body. ** Contralateral forelimb-hind-limb- suspend: suspension with a forelimb and a hind limb on the opposite sides of the body. * Tail-suspend: suspension from the tail, with no support from the rest of the body. ** Tail/forelimb-suspend: Half of the weight is on the tail and the other half on the forelimb(s). ** Tail/hind limb-suspend: Half of the weight is on the tail and the other half on the hind limb(s). ** Pronograde tail/quadrumanous-suspend: All five limbs help support the body while the back is horizontal. ** Orthograde tail/quadrumanous-suspend: All five limbs help support the body while the back is vertical. * Hind limb-suspend: Suspension from the foot/feet, no support from any other body parts. * Flexed-hind limb- suspend: Knee and the hip are flexed during suspension. * Extended-hind limb- suspend: Knee and hip are extended during suspension. === In bats === Roosting is a vertical upside down behaviour seen in bats which involves the use of the feet to grasp a surface. The hind limbs are very important as they provide most of the strength to support the bat. The forelimbs can be used as well, having all four limbs supporting the animal. The head and neck are usually kept at a 90o or 180o angle. == Locomotion == Suspensory locomotion aids with reducing path lengths and covering longer distances by moving faster through branches and trees above. The movements of involved in suspensory behavior can be described as being seen most often among monkeys. The swinging motion of grabbing branch after branch with alternating hands or launching the body from one support to another losing contact with the support is very common and the most popular form of locomotion among suspensory animals. Some animals such as the platyrrhines, use their tails for traveling and usually never use their forelimbs for transportation, while some species use both their tails and forelimbs. Suspensory behavior is advantageous for avoiding predators. The quick motions and ability to escape high above the ground enables an avoidance strategy, maintaining survival. While this type of locomotion can be beneficial there can be some consequences when dealing with extreme heights as vigorously moving through the trees allows for more opportunity for injury. The easiest way for animals to avoid this consequence is using their abilities to focus on uninterrupted travel, accuracy and avoiding alternative routes. === Types of locomotion === Pygmy marmoset (Cebuella pygmaea) climbing tree  Brachiation  Brachiation involves the animal swinging from branch to branch in a sequence motion above the ground in a canopy of trees. Typically these movements involve both arms without the aid of the legs or tail. Tail and hind limb suspension can be used in different situations like feeding or escaping predators during drastic situations, however the use of the arms is preferred for this type of movement. Composite image of a juvenile proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus) learning to leap from one tree to another  Climbing  Climbing consists of moving up or down a vertical surface using all four arms and legs to help move the body upward or downward. There are many different ways in which in animal can climb such as using alternating arms and legs, climbing sideways, fire-pole slides and head or bottom first decline. Vertical climbing is the most costly form of locomotion as the animal must defy gravity and move up the tree. This is particularly harder for animals with a larger body mass, as carrying their entire weight becomes more difficult with size. Also involved with climbing is a \\"pulling up\\" motion in which the animal will pull itself above a branch using both of its arms and the hind limbs launch over the branch using a swinging motion.  Bridging  Animals use this type of behavior when crossing between trees and other surfaces. This movement requires the use of the hind limbs to leap across extended areas. Small animals have an easier time leaping between gaps, while larger animals are more cautious due to their weight and typically swing from branch to branch instead. Feeding while suspended from a rope == Feeding == Suspensory behaviour is very important for animals in regards to feeding. It has been reported that suspensory movements make up approximately 25% of all feeding strategies shown in primates. Suspension helps them reach fruits and other vegetation that might be difficult to obtain on foot, while allowing them to cover a large distance at a greater speed. Often in arboreal regions, flowers, fruits and other plants are located on small terminal branches and suspension enables animals to access this food while saving time and energy. By suspending below the branch they avoid a greater chance at the branch breaking and are able to keep a steady balance. Hanging by the tail is very common when foraging which permits the use of the hands and arms to not only grab food but to catch themselves if they were to slip or fall. Suspension allows for fast travel, which is helpful when collecting food as well. Speed allows animals to minimize competition while avoiding predators to ensure they grab as much food as they can in a short period of time. If an animal is in a high tree, they often eat their food then and there to avoid injury and predators. Quadrupedalism and bipedalism combined with suspensory mechanisms are crucial for providing support during feeding so the animal does not fall and risk losing the food, or risking its life. == Examples == Ateles_paniscus.jpg  Spider Monkey (Ateles paniscus) Varecia_variegata_full_body_curled_up.jpg  Ruffed Lemur (Varecia variegata) Bornean_Orangutan_mother_and_baby,_Seneca_Park_Zoo.JPG  Bornean Orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) 9092_-_Milano_-_Museo_storia_naturale_-_Diorama_- _Bradypus_trydactilus_-_Foto_Giovanni_Dall'Orto_22-Apr-2007.jpg  Pale Throated Sloth (Bradypus tridactylus) == See also == * Arboreal locomotion * Brachiation * Climbing == References == Category:Arboreal locomotion Category:Eating behaviors ","title":"Suspensory behavior"},{"id":"19263213","text":"Victor Amadeus of Anhalt-Bernburg (6 October 1634 in Harzgerode – 14 February 1718 in Bernburg), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Bernburg.

He is from Allegheny County and represented the 28th legislative district since 2001. His district included the municipalities of Pine Township, Marshall Township, Bradford Woods, Franklin Park, and McCandless. Turzai served as the House Majority Leader from 2011 until 2014, and was elected Speaker in January 2015. He was a candidate for Governor of Pennsylvania in 2018 until he suspended his campaign in February 2018. == Education and personal life == Turzai was born in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. He grew up in Moon Township and attended Our Lady of the Sacred Heart High School in Coraopolis. He earned a B.A. in English from the University of Notre Dame in 1981 and his J.D. degree from Duke University School of Law in 1987. Turzai is married to Lidia Turzai, a pediatrician. They have three children and live in Marshall Township in Allegheny County. ==Early career== Turzai was an assistant district attorney for Allegheny County from 1988 to 1992, when he joined Houston Harbaugh, a law firm in Pittsburgh. He practiced law with Houston Harbaugh through 2004, and remains Of counsel with them. Prior to serving in the legislature, Turzai served as the vice president of the Bradford Woods Borough Council. He was also a former representative to the Republican State Committee in 2000. He is also a former member of the Pine- Marshall-Bradford Woods Police Board. ==Political career1998 U.S. House of Representatives election=== In 1998 Turzai ran to represent the 4th District in the U.S. House against Democratic incumbent Ron Klink. He won the Republican primary by a large margin, with 54.25% of the vote to David F. Miller's 24.45% and Paul Adametz's 21.26%, but was defeated by Klink in the general election, 64-36%. ===2001 special election=== In 2001 he was elected to the Pennsylvania House, winning every precinct in the 28th district against attorney Thomas Dancison in a special election to fill the seat of Jane Orie, who had replaced Melissa Hart in the state Senate in 2000. In November 2010 Turzai was elected majority leader after the elections which gave the House a 21-seat majority by Republicans. He had also previously served as minority whip. He was majority leader from 2011 to 2014. Turzai was House Majority Leader in June 2011 when it passed the amended \\"Fair Share Act\\", a tort reform bill that largely repealed Pennsylvania's common law doctrine of joint and several liability. On November 15, 2016, Turzai was chosen by House Republicans to be speaker-designee of the House of Representatives. On January 6, 2017, he was unanimously elected as Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for a second term. ===Committees=== Because of his role as Speaker, Turzai sits on all committees in an ex-officio capacity. He actively serves on the Committee on Committees and the Committee on Rules. === Legislative ratings and endorsements === In 2017 Turzai was given a 91% rating by the National Federation of Independent Business (which endorsed him in October 2016) and an 80% rating by the American Conservative Union. In 2016 he was given a 0% rating by the Sierra Club but a 25% rating by the Sierra Club PA. That same year he received a 92% rating by the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry. The National Rifle Association endorsed Turzai for re- election in 2016. As of 2017 he holds a 93% NRA rating. ===Gubernatorial run, 2018=== Mike Turzai at a campaign rally On November 14, 2017 Turzai officially announced he would run for governor in 2018, challenging Democratic incumbent Tom Wolf. Others in the Republican primary field are Scott Wagner, R-York; Paul Mango, a former health care director with McKinsey & Company; and Jones Day attorney Laura Ellsworth. During the primary race Turzai also ran to retain his 28th District House seat, defending against Democrat Emily Skopov; had he won the primary, Turzai would have been required to vacate his legislative seat. He remained speaker throughout the election season. During a campaign stop in December 2017, Turzai said as governor he would prioritize \\"Fiscal responsibility, a balanced budget, school accountability and increased investments in career and technical education.\\" He said that if he was unable to bring about those changes during a first term, he would not seek a second term. State representative Kathy Rapp and state Senator Scott Hutchinson endorsed his candidacy with supporting remarks. As of February 2018, Turzai had $1.2 million in his campaign account. On February 10, 2018, Turzai announced to the state Republican Party Committee that he would no longer be running for governor, following the endorsement of Scott Wagner. ===Retirement=== On January 23, 2020, Turzai announced from his district office that he would be retiring from office at the end of his current term, to seek opportunities in the private sector. Turzai later announced that he would retire on June 15, 2020, prior to the end of his term. One day after leaving office, Turzai was named general counsel for Peoples Natural Gas. ==Issues Abortion === In February 2018, Turzai and State Representative Judy Ward, a nurse, introduced a bill banning the abortion of fetuses who have been diagnosed with Down syndrome in the womb. Currently, fetuses can be aborted up to 24 weeks gestation in Pennsylvania, except in cases of sex selection abortion, which are banned. Turzai cited the country of Iceland in remarks about the bill, saying that Iceland has an almost zero rate of babies born with Down syndrome because almost all are aborted. ===Cannabis=== Turzai is vehemently against the legalization of medical cannabis in Pennsylvania. He was reported to break down in tears when discussing the subject in a meeting with the GOP caucus. Turzai is also fiercely opposed to legalizing adult-use cannabis in the state. ===Education=== In 2010, one of Turzai's top campaign contributors was the Pennsylvania State Education Association, which represents more than 187,000 Pennsylvania teachers and educators. The association gave him $22,500. In September 2016 Turzai advocated increasing tax credits to Pennsylvania businesses that contributed to scholarship funds that help low income people send their children to private schools. On October 26, 2017, Turzai publicly asked several public universities within Pennsylvania to freeze tuition for the 2018-2019 school year for in-state residents. The universities that he asked were the University of Pittsburgh, Penn State University, Temple University, and Lincoln University. After a state budget was passed at the end of October, those schools along with the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine stood to receive more than $600 million for the 2017-2018 fiscal year. Also in October 2017, Turzai voted yes on HB 178 to amend the Pennsylvania Public School Code in various ways. Through his yes vote on the bill, Turzai supported: allowing school boards to suspend teachers for various reasons, including economic reasons, and that suspensions must be based on performance ratings; making schools practice armed intruder or terrorism drills; delaying the use of the Keystone Exams as a graduation requirement until the 2019-2020 school year; and requiring schools to provide a school meal to any student who asks for one, regardless of ability to pay. The bill also requires instruction on opioid abuse to students in grades 6-12. In December 2016, Turzai announced that he would author a bill to increase tax credits for education. Specifically, his bill would \\"increase the amount of tax credits available under the Educational Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) program by $50 million (to $175 million) and the amount of tax credits available under the Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit (OSTC) program by $25 million (to $75 million).\\" He said his purpose in introducing the legislation was to increase school choice and \\"help more students escape from failing schools.\\" Turzai introduced three education- related bills during the 2017 session: * HB 202: Creates certain exemptions from the Keystone high school graduation exam for career and technical education (CTE) students. Passed the legislature and was signed into law on June 21, 2017, becoming Act No. 6.http://www.legis.state.pa.us//cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=H&SPick;=20170&cosponId;=21377http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/bill_history.cfm?syear=2017&sind;=0&body;=H&type;=B&bn;=202http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?sYear=2017&sInd;=0&body;=H&type;=B&bn;=0202 * HB 250: Increases tax credits for certain state educational tax credit programs.

The bill didn't pass either legislative chamber.http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2017&sind;=0&body;=H&type;=B&bn;=0700http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/bill_history.cfm?syear=2017&sind;=0&body;=H&type;=B&bn;=700http://www.legis.state.pa.us//cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=H&SPick;=20170&cosponId;=22562 === Guns === On April 1, 2008, Turzai voted against an amendment to HB 1845 (Reporting Missing Firearms). The amendment would have made it a summary offense, first degree misdemeanor, and then a third-degree felony (for each subsequent violation) for a person to fail to report a lost or stolen firearm to law enforcement within three days of discovering it missing. On October 5, 2010, he voted in favor of HB 40 (Self Defense Law Amendments), which passed the House by a vote of 159-38. The bill would have expanded the sets of circumstances in which a person would be allowed to use force for self- defense. In October 2014, Turzai voted in favor of HB 1243 (Authorizes Civil Action against Local Firearm Laws). The bill would have authorized \\"any 'individual adversely affected' by any firearm law enacted by a county, municipality, or township to seek declaratory or injunctive relief and actual damages in an appropriate court,\\" according to Project Vote Smart. === Hate crimes === In 2017, Turzai cosponsored HR 161, \\"A Resolution condemning acts of hate and vandalism against the Jewish community.\\" === Health care === During a campaign stop in 2017, Turzai said that growing jobs in the private sector is the key to providing people with good health insurance. \\"The private sector providing family sustaining jobs is the key to making sure our folks have good health benefits,\\" he said. === Keystone Energy Enhancement Act === On December 20, 2016, Turzai introduced the Keystone Energy Enhancement Act, which he had sponsored in previous legislative sessions. The bill would set up 20 \\"Keystone Energy Enhancement Zones\\" across the state. Within these zones, natural gas, manufacturing, and petrochemical companies which operate within the zones would receive numerous tax deductions, exemptions, and credits for 10 years, as well as a $1,250 tax credit for each full-time job created within a zone. ===Natural gas severance tax=== Turzai has been opposed to a severance tax and impact fee on natural gas. During his campaign for governor, Tom Wolf pledged to tax Marcellus Shale. Turzai opposed Wolf's plan. In July 2017, the Pennsylvania State Senate leadership proposed a tax that would vary based on market prices. In September 2017, a Pennsylvania House committee voted 15-11 along party lines to amend a bill to \\"rechristen\\" the impact fee that has been assessed on shale gas wells since 2012 as a severance tax. Turzai spoke at a news conference sponsored by opponents of the shale tax. He said that he is \\"steadfastly opposed\\" to the push for a vote on the bill as well as a vote on the severance tax itself. At the end of October 2017, the state legislature passed a budget and sent it to Governor Wolf for his signature. The revenue bills as part of the budget did not contain a new tax on natural gas drilling companies, which the governor had wanted but Turzai opposed. However, after receiving the budget from the legislature, the governor continued to push for a natural gas severance tax. Earlier in 2017, the governor had proposed a 6.5% severance tax on natural gas production. ===Privatization of liquor stores=== In Pennsylvania alcohol is sold through a state-run chain of stores called Fine Wine & Good Spirits. The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board owns and operates 600 of these stores throughout the state. After being elected governor in 2010, Tom Corbett expressed his support of privatizing Pennsylvania's 621 state liquor stores and in January 2013 announced his proposal for privatization. In March 2013, Turzai introduced the legislation for Corbett's plan, HB 790, which would privatize the state-owned liquor stores with the state using the revenues for education. On February 14, 2017, Turzai likened the enactment of state liquor reforms with taking Pennsylvania \\"into the 21st century and out of the era of Prohibition,\\" referring to Act 39 which allowed for privatization of wine in private retail licenses, among other provisions. He announced that he would introduce legislation that would divest the state's wholesale system for both wine and liquor. Turzai supports eliminating the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board's role in acting as the middle-man in wine and spirit distribution. He supports divesting state- controlled wholesale system of wine. He said, \\"Divestiture will \\"free the wine\\" by allowing retailers to negotiate pricing on products and by allowing them to have those products delivered directly to retail markets.\\" Later he introduced HB 1075, which was passed in the House by a vote of 105-84 and was referred to the Senate Law and Justice Committee. In April 2017, the Pennsylvania state House passed several bills, sponsored by Turzai, to privatize wholesale wine and spirits sales and expand alcohol retail outlets in Pennsylvania. The Patriot-News called Turzai \\"the leading voice for privatization in the Legislature.\\" Turzai introduced HB 975 which would divest the wholesale wine business from the Commonwealth and expand wine retail licenses. He also introduced HB 1075 which would divest the wine and spirits business from the Commonwealth. Both bills passed the state House on April 25, 2017.http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2017&sind;=0&body;=H&type;=B&bn;=0975http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/bill_history.cfm?syear=2017&sind;=0&body;=H&type;=B&bn;=975http://www.legis.state.pa.us//cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=H&SPick;=20170&cosponId;=23200http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2017&sind;=0&body;=H&type;=B&bn;=1075http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/bill_history.cfm?syear=2017&sind;=0&body;=H&type;=B&bn;=1075http://www.legis.state.pa.us//cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=H&SPick;=20170&cosponId;=22912 ===State budget and taxes=== As of October 2017, Pennsylvania has been in a \\"budget stalemate\\" since June between Pennsylvania state Senate and House Republicans and Democrats and Governor Tom Wolf. As of the end of September 2017, legislators and Governor Wolf were putting together a new proposal to solve the budget stalemate. House Republicans, led by Turzai, wanted to avoid raising taxes and instead expand legal gambling and use a one-time transfer of $630 million that would come from surpluses and special state accounts. As of October 1, 2017, legislators came to a tentative deal that would pass a revenue package (that would include a small expansion of gambling) that does not increase taxes. On June 30, 2017, the state House overwhelmingly passed House Bill 218, a bipartisan budget agreement, which, according to Turzai, \\"answers the challenge to deal with a potential $3 billion shortfall and begins the process of reinventing Pennsylvania government.\\" After the bill passed, Turzai said, \\". . . this budget does not rely on onerous job-crushing tax hikes originally proposed by the governor. This bipartisan, no income or sales tax increase budget places priorities on core government functions . . .\\" Since 2001, Pennsylvania's general fund budget has grown from $20 billion per year to $31.5 billion. In an op-ed that Turzai published in Penn Live, he questioned, \\"Has government has become 50 percent more efficient? Have we increased our services by half? Certainly, family incomes haven't risen at that rate. Census calculations show median family income in our state rising by a mere 13.5 percent over the same time period.\\" Turzai supports zero-based budgeting. The way he describes it is \\"a system in which we start from zero and build a budget according to what Pennsylvania - and its taxpayers - can afford.\\" === State gambling === Turzai supported a 2013 bill, passed in the House, that would have approved an expansion of gambling in the state. According to Turzai, the fact that the bill would add money to the state budget was one of his reasons for supporting the issue. The budget passed by the legislature at the end of October 2017 included a major expansion of legalized gambling, which Turzai supported and would bring in $200 million for the current fiscal year. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, \\"Gambling expansion had been a sticking point as legislators struggled to close the deficit that was more than $2 billion.\\" The gambling bill allows the state to license 10 casinos that could have between 300 and 750 slot machines and 30 table games. It also allows some truck stops to have up to five video gaming terminals. Turzai led the negotiations for the budget, which passed the House by a vote of 109-72, sending it to the governor. === Transportation === Turzai supports investing taxpayer dollars into upgrading the state's infrastructure. In 2013, he introduced a bill that would have spent $900 million for \\"deteriorating highways, mass transit systems, and bridges,\\" according to Ballotpedia. === Voter ID law comment and controversy === Speaking to the Republican State Committee on June 23, 2012, Turzai stated that Pennsylvania's new voter ID law would \\"allow Governor [Mitt] Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania\\" in the November 2012 U.S. Presidential election. He listed the goals that the majority-Republican legislature had achieved toward that end: \\"Pro-Second Amendment? The Castle Doctrine, it's done. First pro-life legislation—abortion facility regulations—in 22 years, done. Voter ID, which is going to allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania, done.\\" According to CBS Philadelphia, \\"Turzai's spokesman defends his boss's comment, saying Turzai meant that assuring voter integrity will make for a fairer election.\\" Turzai's comment heightened national debate and concern over whether the goal of the voter ID laws then being passed in Republican- controlled states was actually to check voter fraud or to set obstacles against \\"elderly, disabled, low-income people and the homeless, plus married women who have changed their names, transgender individuals, and students who have photo IDs that don't list an expiration date\\", in Pennsylvania an estimated 750,000 of whom were already registered voters, as acknowledged by the state. A lawsuit had been filed in April challenging \\"Act 18,\\" the new law, signed in March, which amended the Election Code's definition of \\"proof of identification\\" to include only certain forms of ID as acceptable.The bill was sponsored by Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, R-Cranberry, who in the spring of 2008 had sponsored a predecessor bill with the same name, the Pennsylvania Voter Identification Protection Act (House Bill 2519). The 2012 bill that passed, H. B. 934, was known as Act 18. Before the suit went to court in July, the state \\"signed a stipulation agreement with lawyers for the plaintiffs which acknowledges there 'have been no investigations or prosecutions of in-person voter fraud in Pennsylvania; and the parties do not have direct personal knowledge of any such investigations or prosecutions in other states.'\\" In August, in a statement praising the Commonwealth court for upholding Act 18, Turzai said, \\"It is unfortunate, but there has been a history of voter fraud in Pennsylvania. The elections in the Commonwealth will be on a more level playing field thanks to voter ID and other recent election reforms.\\" The plaintiffs appealed to the state supreme court, which vacated the lower court's decision and sent it back. Justice McCaffrey wrote, \\"While I have no argument with the requirement that all Pennsylvania voters, at some reasonable point in the future, will have to present photo identification before they may cast their ballots, it is clear to me that the reason for the urgency of implementing Act 18 prior to the November 2012 election is purely political. That has been made abundantly clear by the House Majority Leader.\\". That month during a Fox News debate with state senator Daylin Leach, Turzai claimed that the legislation, for which no Democratic representative had voted, had bipartisan support, and argued that it \\"is really just about presenting voter identification, which you do when you're buying Sudafed at a drugstore, or going to a place to buy beer, or to a gym, or going to an airport.\\" === Voting === On September 26, 2017, Turzai voted in favor of HB 171, legislation that would allow any registered voter to be appointed a poll watcher in any district in the state. The legislation also requires that poll watchers must be registered electors and residents of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. === Water === In May 2017, Turzai announced he would introduce a bill to place the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) under the oversight of the state's Public Utility Commission (PUC). He said that over the last year, the media had recounted several issues facing the residents of Pittsburgh with regards to the PWSA and water including incorrect billing, system leaks, and what he described as \\"non-compliance with federal water quality mandates.\\" He later introduced his bill, HB 1490, on June 2 with state Rep. Harry Readshaw. The state House passed the bill by a vote of 195-0. ===Wikipedia editing=== Between 2013 and 2017 an editor or editors traced to the Pennsylvania House Republican caucus in Harrisburg repeatedly edited Wikipedia articles on Turzai and other Pennsylvania Republicans. ==Electoral history== Mike Turzai delivering a speech === U.S. Congress === In 2012, Turzai was expected to announce a run for the U.S. Congress in Pennsylvania's then-new 12th congressional district. On January 25, however, he announced he had decided against running. ===Pennsylvania House of Representatives=Campaign finance=== Based on campaign finance records, Turzai has raised a total of $7,440,095 for his elections. * 2016: $2,599,751 * 2014: $727,061 * 2012: $1,240,179 * 2010: $1,119,234 * 2008: $897,998 * 2006: $369,196 * 2004: $238,078 * 2002: $248,598 ==References * 28th House District map * * State Representative Mike Turzai official caucus website * Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:People from Sewickley, Pennsylvania Category:American people of Hungarian descent Category:Pennsylvania Republicans Category:Speakers of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Category:21st-century American politicians Category:University of Notre Dame alumni Category:Duke University School of Law alumni ","title":"Mike Turzai"},{"id":"19263270","text":"Sandusky County Regional Airport is a county-owned public-use airport located five nautical miles (9 km) southeast of the central business district of Fremont, a city in Sandusky County, Ohio, United States. == Facilities and aircraft == Sandusky County Regional Airport has one runway designated 6/24 with a 5,500 by 100 ft (1,676 x 30 m) asphalt pavement.

He was killed in action at the Battle of Antietam while commanding the famed \\"Stonewall Division,\\" a unit first made famous under Stonewall Jackson. ==Early life and career== Starke was born in Brunswick County, Virginia. His younger brother Peter Burwell Starke also became a general in the Confederate army, as well as a Mississippi politician. Prior to the Civil War, the brothers worked in the family's stagecoach business that operated between Lawrenceville and Petersburg, Virginia. In 1840, William Starke moved to the South, becoming a successful cotton broker in Mobile, Alabama, and New Orleans, Louisiana.Warner, p. 289. In 1858, he purchased the SS Texas Ranger, a former supply ship, from the Federal government and used it to haul cotton to his customers.Steamship Texas Ranger history Retrieved 2008-09-10 Starke was married to Louisa Grey Hicks, the daughter of a prominent Brunswick County businessman. Their daughter Sallie was born in Melrose, Alabama.Dolliver, pp. 349-50. ==Civil War== At the outbreak of the Civil War early in 1861, despite his lack of formal military education, Starke was named as the lieutenant colonel of the 53rd Virginia Infantry until June. He subsequently was an aide-de-camp to Gen. Robert S. Garnett in western Virginia, but was without a position following Garnett's death in the Battle of Corrick's Ford. His coolness and judgment in the midst of the confusion that followed the death of General Garnett were highly commended by Colonel William B. Taliaferro, who succeeded to command. He temporarily served on the staff of Robert E. Lee in August 1861.Eicher, p. 506.Evans, p. 663. Later in the year, he received a commission as the colonel of the 60th Virginia Infantry. He led the regiment during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign. He was wounded in the hand during the Seven Days Battles on June 26, 1862, but resumed his duties after a three-day recovery period before finally relinquishing command after the battle.Welsh, p. 204. For his gallant efforts during the fighting, he was commended twice and then promoted to brigadier general on August 6, 1862. He was assigned command of the Second Louisiana Brigade. He led the Stonewall Division during the Second Battle of Manassas following the wounding of General Taliaferro. For unknown reasons, Jackson decided not to leave him in permanent command, appointing a staff officer (John R. Jones) instead. In mid-September, Starke's Brigade was part of the force under Stonewall Jackson that captured the large Union garrison at Harpers Ferry, after which they marched into Sharpsburg, Maryland, on September 16. A strong Union attack on the morning of September 17 drove back the Confederate lines. Starke was shot three times and died within an hour. He was one of six generals killed or mortally wounded at Antietam.Memorial marker for W. E. Starke at the Antietam Battlefield Retrieved 2008-09-10 His body was buried in the Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia, next to his son who had been killed three and a half months earlier at the Battle of Seven Pines.Hollywood Cemetery ==Memorialization== Col. Bradley T. Johnson, in his official report on Second Manassas, wrote concerning the death of Starke: > I cannot forbear doing but scant justice to a gallant soldier now no more. > It was my fortune during the two days of battle, during which he commanded > the division, to be thrown constantly in contact with Brigadier-General > Starke.

Fellow Confederate officer Clement A. Evans later wrote, \\"His name deserves lasting remembrance in association with the Stonewall division.\\" A mortuary cannon on the Antietam Battlefield marks the approximate place where Starke was shot the third time, west of the Hagerstown Turnpike in the West Woods area.

Gourdou-Leseurre put forward the GL-50 as a submission for the CAP2 category (despite the fact that this categorisation system was removed in 1920). Its 300 hp Hispano-Suiza engine was intended to be fitted with a supercharger, however this was not fitted, despite the fact it would have increased its performance drastically. It was of wooden construction, with a long-span untapered wing, considered unusual at the time, that feature being more in line with single-seat aircraft design, as were the wing bracing struts. ==Operational history== The date is not recorded of the first flight of the GL-50, however it is known that it occurred in 1922.

Nasse-setä was the host of a children's television show, who hated children, and was nearly always drunk. His distinguishing features included a garishly-coloured jacket, a clown's nose made of a table tennis ball, and a yellowed Finnish matriculation cap. His catch phrase was Nasse-setä on hyvin hyvin vihainen (\\"Uncle Nasse is very very angry\\"), which became popular throughout Finland. When hosting his children's hour, Nasse- setä tried to, often through gritted teeth, present an image of a child-loving jovial uncle, but often failed to conceal the disgust he felt towards children and sometimes even flat-out verbally insulted his young audience. He often appeared to use intoxicants, often behind the scenes but sometimes also in plain view: In one sketch, he crouched behind his desk to smoke a cigarette during the show, in another—while trying to do magic tricks—he claimed his alcoholic beverage to be a \\"magic drink\\" helping him to perform the tricks, and in one sketch he had created a chime instrument out of half-empty liquor bottles and had to repeatedly \\"tune\\" his instruments by sipping from the bottles. He was also known to ask children to send him ten-markka bills or photographs of their mothers. At one time, Nasse-setä explained how he had ended up as host of a children's show: on the day when he was at a career fitting test, the meters were out of order. According to unofficial word of mouth, the inspiration for Nasse-setä was the Hollywood worker, and Finnish legend Markus-setä (Markus Rautio), who hosted the Markus-sedän lastentunti (\\"Children's hour with Uncle Markus\\") on Yleisradio from 1926 to 1956. According to word of mouth, he hated children in real life, but in the radio shows he hosted it was, of course, never revealed. The outward appearance of Nasse-setä is a parody of the Sirkus Papukaija character Faqir Kronblom. In the 1990s, a children's song collection LP record called Nasse-sedän lastentunti (Children's hour with Uncle Nasse) was published. The record did not contain songs performed by Nasse-setä, only a few speaking parts between the songs. Nasse-setä also appears in the Uuno Turhapuro films Uuno Epsanjassa (1985) and Uuno Turhapuro - This Is My Life (2004). For the 2004 Turhapuro film, Vesa-Matti Loiri put on Nasse-setä make-up for the first time in years. Nasse-setä sketches can be found on the Spede Show DVD publications: Spede- Show - Kliffaa hei 1984-1985, Spede Show - Ihan huvin vuoksi 1985-1986 and Spede Show - Kyllä kansa tietää 1986-1987 as well as the Vesku Show DVD publications Vesku Show - Kuselan paluu and Vesku Show - Vili, Vili, Vili.... ==External links== * Nasse-setä in Youtube Category:Television in Finland Category:Spede Pasanen Category:Fictional Finnish people ","title":"Nasse-setä"},{"id":"19263392","text":"An attributive verb is a verb that modifies (expresses an attribute of) a noun in the manner of an attributive adjective, rather than express an independent idea as a predicate. In English (and in most European languages), verb forms that can be used attributively are typically non-finite forms — participles and infinitives — as well as certain verb-derived words that function as ordinary adjectives. All words of these types may be called verbal adjectives, although those of the latter type (those that behave grammatically like ordinary adjectives, with no verb-like features) may be distinguished as deverbal adjectives.Rodney Huddleston, Introduction to the Grammar of English, CUP, 1984, p. 100. An example of a verbal adjective with verb-like features is the word wearing in the sentence The man wearing a hat is my father (it behaves as a verb in taking an object, a hat, although the resulting phrase wearing a hat functions like an attributive adjective in modifying man). An example of a deverbal adjective is the word interesting in That was a very interesting speech; although it is derived from the verb to interest, it behaves here entirely like an ordinary adjective such as nice or long. However, some languages, such as Japanese and Chinese, can use finite verbs attributively. In such a language, the man wearing a hat might translate, word-for-word, into the wears a hat man. Here, the function of an attributive adjective is played by the phrase wears a hat, which is headed by the finite verb wears. This is a kind of relative clause. ==English== As mentioned above, verb forms that are used attributively in English are often called verbal adjectives, or in some cases deverbal adjectives (if they no longer behave grammatically as verbs). The truly \\"verbal\\" adjectives are non-finite verb forms: participles (present and past), and sometimes to-infinitives. These act as verbs in that they form a verb phrase, possibly taking objects and other dependents and modifiers that are typical of verbs; however that verb phrase then plays the role of an attributive adjective in the larger sentence. In the following examples, the attributive verb is bolded, and the verb phrase acting as the attributive adjective is shown in italics. *The cat sitting on the fence is mine. *The actor given the prize is not my favorite. *This is a great place to eat. Deverbal adjectives often have the same form as (and similar meaning to) the participles, but behave grammatically purely as adjectives — they do not take objects, for example, as a verb might. For example: *It was a very exciting game. *Interested parties should apply to the office. Sometimes deverbal adjectives additionally take prefixes, as in hand-fed turkeys, uneaten food and meat-eating animals. Some compound adjectives are formed using the plain infinitive form of the verb, as in a no-go area or no-fly zone,Further examples: no-fly list, non-stick pan, no-lose situation, no-rinse shampoo, no-bake cookies. Although some of these words could arguably be nouns, that is not the case with fly, stick, lose, bake. Compare no-flight zone, no-loss guarantee, which use attributive nouns. See Language Log: No what zone? and take-away food. Occasionally they are finite verb phrases: a must-see movie; their can-do attitude. Verbal and deverbal adjectives can often also be used as predicate (rather than attributive) adjectives, as in The game was exciting; The cat was sitting on the fence. Deverbal adjectives may form further derivatives, such as adverbs (excitedly, interestingly). English has analogous types of verbal nouns (truly verbal kinds — gerunds and infinitives — and deverbal nouns). Deverbal nouns may also be used attributively, as noun adjuncts, as in a swimming competition. For more details of the usage of some of the above verb forms, see Uses of non-finite verbs in English. == Japanese == Japanese allows attributive finite verbs, and the following characteristics of Japanese are common among verb-final languages. For example, in Japanese, predicative verbs come at the end of the clause, after the nouns, while attributive verbs come before the noun. These are mostly equivalent to relative clauses in English; Japanese does not have relative pronouns like who, which, or when: :{class= 昨日あの人が歩いた。 - Kinōanohito-gaaruita. - yesterdaythatpersonwalked } :That person walked yesterday. :{class= あの 昨日歩いた人。 - ano kinōaruitahito - thatyesterdaywalkedperson } :That person who walked yesterday... Japanese attributive verbs inflect for grammatical aspect, as here, and grammatical polarity, but not commonly for politeness. For example, the polite form of hito ga aruita is hito ga arukimashita, but the form arukimashita hito is not common (felt to be too polite and paraphrastic), though it is grammatically correct. Except for this, modern Japanese verbs have the same form whether predicative or attributive. (The only exception is the copula, which is da or desu when used predicatively and na when used attributively.) Historically, however, these had been separate forms. This is still the case in languages such as Korean and Turkish. The following examples illustrate the difference: Classical Japanese: *hito arukiki - a person walked *arukishi hito - the person who walked Turkish: *Adam şiir okur \\"The man reads poetry.\\" *Şiir okuyan adam \\"The man who reads poetry.\\" Notice that all of these languages have a verb-final word order, and that none of them have relative pronouns. They also do not have a clear distinction between verbs and adjectives, as can be seen in Japanese: *Sora (ga) aoi. \\"The sky is blue.\\" *Aoi sora \\"A blue sky.\\" In Japanese, aoi \\"blue\\" is effectively a descriptive verb rather than an adjective. == Bantu languages == In the Bantu languages, attributive verbs are formed by the addition of the \\"pre-prefix\\" (or \\"initial vowel\\"). For example, in Luganda: * Abasajja batambula \\"The men walk\\" (predicative) * Abasajja abatambula \\"The men who walk\\" (attributive) This is similar to the behaviour of attributive adjectives: * Abasajja bagagga \\"The men are rich\\" (predicative) * Abasajja abagagga \\"The men who are rich\\" (i.e \\"the rich men\\") (attributive) The attributive verb formation is the usual way of forming relatives in Luganda when the antecedent is the subject of the subordinate verb, and is sometimes called the \\"subject relative\\". Relative pronouns do exist, but they are only used for \\"object relatives\\", i.e. relative clauses where the antecedent is the object of the subordinate verb. ==See also== *Attributive adjective *Noun adjunct (also referred to as attributive noun) ==References== Category:Verb types de:Japanische Grammatik#Rentaikei ","title":"Attributive verb"},{"id":"19263397","text":"Hot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution—And How It Can Renew America is a book by New York Times Foreign Affairs columnist Thomas Friedman, proposing that the solutions to global warming and the best method to regain the United States' economic and political stature in the world are to embrace the clean energy and green technology industries. The title derives from the convergence of Hot (global warming), Flat (globalization, as discussed in Friedman's book The World Is Flat) and Crowded (population growth). The book was released on September 8, 2008, by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The audiobook was released simultaneously by Macmillan Audio. The cover art is taken from Hieronymus Bosch's The Garden of Earthly Delights. Release 2.0 Updated and Expanded was published in November 2009. == Summary == In the book, Friedman addresses what he sees as America's loss of focus and national purpose since 9/11 and the global environmental crisis. He advocates that global warming, rapidly growing populations, and the expansion of the global middle class are leading to a convergence of hot, flat, and crowded. He argues that the solution to the environmental threat and the best way for America to renew its purpose are linked: take the lead in a worldwide effort to replace wasteful, inefficient energy practices with a strategy for clean energy, energy efficiency, and conservation. This means that the big economic opportunities have shifted from IT (Information Technology) in recent decades to ET (renewable Environmental Technologies). Friedman frequently uses 2050 as a marker for when it will be too late for our world to reverse the harmful effects of climate change. Friedman writes that the needed green revolution of the title would be more ambitious than any project so far undertaken: It will be the biggest innovation project in American history; and it will change everything from transportation to the utilities industry. This project is described in terms of nation-building. The book alleges we've gone from the \\"Cold War Era\\" to the \\"Energy-Climate Era\\", marked by five major problems: growing demand for scarcer supplies, massive transfer of wealth to dictators, disruptive climate change, the lower class falling behind, and an accelerating loss of biodiversity. He argues that a green strategy is not simply about generating electric power, it is a new way of generating national power. Many of the primary points of the book were built out of Friedman's New York Times Magazine essay \\"The Power of Green\\" and the \\"Foreign Policy\\" article \\"The First Law of Petropolitics.\\" The book has been criticized for ignoring overpopulation as the root cause of the problems it analyzes, as Friedman writes extensively about resource scarcity, but does not address excessive demand. == Chapter 18 Project == Hot, Flat, and Crowded contains 17 chapters; Friedman has asked readers to submit ideas for the expanded edition's 18th chapter. He will use these ideas in a forthcoming expanded hardcover edition or the paperback edition. Users can submit their ideas and vote on others' ideas online.The Chapter 18 Project at Friedman's website == Editions == * 1st edition, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2008, * Unabridged Audio book, Macmillan Audio, 2008, * Abridged Audio book, Macmillan Audio, 2008, * Release 2.0 Updated and Expanded November 2009. ==See also== *An Inconvenient Truth *Collapse *Merchants of Doubt *Requiem for a Species *Storms of my Grandchildren *What's the Worst That Could Happen?: A Rational Response to the Climate Change Debate *Why We Disagree About Climate Change == References  External links == * Category:2008 non-fiction books Category:2008 in the environment Category:Climate change books Category:Farrar, Straus and Giroux books ","title":"Hot, Flat, and Crowded"},{"id":"19263412","text":"The Birthday Eve is the first studio album by Japanese heavy metal band Loudness.

Cacadou Look's debut Tko mari za čari (1987) was the first album by an all-female Yugoslav band. Cacadou Look was formed in Opatija in 1983. They were not the first all- female band in Yugoslavia -- at the time, already active were Tožibabe from Ljubljana and Boye from Novi Sad -- but they were the first to achieve a degree of mainstream popularity, helped by radio play of their two demo tracks, \\"Sama\\" and \\"Kao pjesma\\" (both 1987), and by TV appearances such as those on Stereovizija, a popular 1980s music show broadcast by Radio Television Zagreb. Their first album Tko mari za čari (Jugoton, 1987) was produced by Husein Hasanefendić and Tomo in der Mühlen, and featured a guest appearance by Vlada Divljan. The album yielded three hit songs: \\"Sama\\", \\"Kao pjesma\\" and \\"Tako lako\\". Apart from \\"Tako lako\\", a cover of Buddy Holly's \\"It's So Easy\\", and \\"Ne dozvoli\\", which was written by Divljan, all songs on the album were composed by the band. Despite these accomplishments, the band found working in the men-dominated music scene difficult at times, and occasional malicious remarks motivated them to work even harder. Their second and equally successful album Uspavanka za Zoroa was released in 1989. Hit tracks from the album were \\"Baum bam bam\\", \\"Budi mi prijatelj\\", and \\"Krenite s nama\\", the latter a cover of Bryan Ferry's \\"Let's Stick Together\\". An English version of \\"Budi mi prijatelj\\" — named \\"Be My Friend\\" — was also recorded, appearing on Yu-Go Pop (Jugoton, 1990), a compilation of Yugoslav pop and rock artists performing their songs in English.

A social VPN aims at providing peer-to-peer (P2P) network connectivity between a user and his or her friends, in an easy to set up manner that hides from the users the complexity in setting up and maintaining authenticated/encrypted end-to-end VPN tunnels. ==Architecture== An architecture of a social VPN is based on a centralized infrastructure where users authenticate, discover their friends and exchange cryptographic public keys, and a P2P overlay which is used to route messages between VPN endpoints.R. Figueiredo, P. O. Boykin, P. St. Juste, D. Wolinsky, \\"SocialVPNs: Integrating Overlay and Social Networks for Seamless P2P Networking\\", in Proceedings of IEEE WETICE/COPS, Rome, Italy, June 2008. For example, this allows an organization to have routed connections with separate offices, or with other organizations, over the Internet. A routed VPN connection across the Internet logically operates as a dedicated Wide Area Network (WAN) link. ===Packet capture and injection=== A social VPN uses a virtual network interface (such as TUN/TAP devices in Windows and Unix systems) to capture and inject IP packets from a host. Once captured, packets are encrypted, encapsulated, and routed over an overlay network. ===Security=== A social VPN uses online social networks to distribute public keys and advertise node address to friends. The acquired public keys are used to establish encrypted communication between two endpoints. Symmetric keys are exchanged during the process of establishing an end-to-end link by two social VPN peers. ===Routing=== Routing in the social VPN is peer-to-peer. One approach that has been implemented uses a structured P2P system for sending IP packets encapsulated in overlay messages from a source to destination. ===Private IP address space=== A social VPN uses dynamic IP address assignment and translation to avoid collision with existing (private) address spaces of end hosts, and to allow the system to scale to the number of users that today's successful online social network services serve (tens of millions). Users are able to connect directly only to a small subset of the total number of users of such a service, where the subset is determined by their established relationships. ===Naming=== A social VPN uses names derived from the social network service to automatically assign host names to endpoints. These names are translated to virtual private IP addresses in the overlay by a loop-back DNS virtual server. ==Related systems== *The MIT Unmanaged Internet ArchitectureUnmanaged Internet Architecture (UIA)provides ad hoc, zero- configuration routing infrastructure for mobile devices, but the ad hoc connections are not established through a social networking infrastructure.Bryan Ford, Jacob Strauss, Chris Lesniewski-Laas, Sean Rhea, Frans Kaashoek, and Robert Morris, \\"Persistent Personal Names for Globally Connected Mobile Devices\\", in Proceedings of the 7th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI '06), Seattle, WA, November 2006. *\\"Friend Net\\" is a similar concept put forth in a 2002 blog entry.Lucas Gonze \\"Friendnet\\", blog entry (2002-12-15). Retrieved on 2008-09-23. *Hamachi is a zero-configuration VPN which uses a security architecture different from that of social VPN.LogMeIn Hamachi Security Architecture . The leafnetworks VPN also supports the creation of networks using the Facebook API. ==Software== An open-source social VPN implementation based on the Facebook social network service and the Brunet P2P overlay is available for Windows and Linux systems under MIT license. It creates direct point-to-point secure connections between computers with the help of online social networks, and supports transparent traversal of NATs. It uses the P2P overlay to create direct VPN connections between pairs of computers (nodes). To establish a connection, two nodes advertise their P2P node address (as well as public keys for secure communication) to each other through an online social network. Once each node acquires the node address (and public keys) of the other node, an IP-to-nodeAddress mapping is created and IP packets can be routed through the VPN tunnel. ==References Category:Free network-related software Category:Virtual private networks ","title":"Social VPN"},{"id":"19263445","text":"Clinton Avenue Historic District may refer to: * Clinton Avenue Historic District (Albany, New York), listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in New York * Clinton Avenue Historic District (Kingston, New York), now part of the Kingston Stockade District, listed on the NRHP in New York ","title":"Clinton Avenue Historic District"},{"id":"19263458","text":"Admiralty law in the United States is a matter of federal law. ==Jurisdiction== In the United States, the federal district courts have jurisdiction over all admiralty and maritime actions; see . In recent years, a non-historically-based conspiracy argument used by tax protesters is that an American court displaying an American flag with a gold fringe is in fact an \\"admiralty court\\" and thus has no jurisdiction. Courts have repeatedly dismissed this as frivolous.United States v. Mackovich, 209 F.3d 1227, 1233–1235, fn. 2 (9th Cir. 2000). In United States v. Greenstreet, the court summarized their finding to this argument with, \\"Unfortunately for Defendant Greenstreet, decor is not a determinant for jurisdiction.\\"United States v. Greenstreet, 912 F. Supp 224 (N.D. Tex. 1996). ==Applicable law== A state court hearing an admiralty or maritime case is required to apply the admiralty and maritime law, even if it conflicts with the law of the state, under a doctrine known as the \\"reverse-Erie doctrine.\\" The Erie doctrine, derived from Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, directs that federal courts hearing state actions must apply state law. The \\"reverse-Erie doctrine\\" directs that state courts hearing admiralty cases must apply federal admiralty law. This distinction is critical in some cases. For instance, U.S. maritime law recognizes the concept of joint and several liability among tortfeasors, while many states do not. Under joint and several liability, where two or more people create a single injury or loss, all are equally liable, even if they contributed only a small amount. A state court hearing an admiralty case would be required to apply the doctrine of joint and several liability even if state law does not contemplate the concept. ==Limitation of shipowner’s liability== One of the unique aspects of maritime law is the ability of a shipowner to limit its liability to the value of a ship after a major accident. An example of the use of the Limitation Act is the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912. Even though the Titanic had never been to the United States, upon her sinking the owners rushed into the federal courts in New York to file a limitation of liability proceeding. The Limitation Act provides that if an accident happens due to a circumstance which is beyond the \\"privity and knowledge\\" of the ship's owners, the owners can limit their liability to the value of the ship after it sinks. After the Titanic sank, the only portions of the ship remaining were the 14 lifeboats, which had a collective value of about $3,000. This was added to the \\"pending freight\\"--which means the ship's earnings from the trip from both passenger fares and freight charges--to reach a total liability of about $91,000. The cost of a first-class, parlor suite ticket was over $4,350. The owners of the Titanic were successful in showing that the sinking occurred without their privity and knowledge, and therefore, the families of the deceased passengers, as well as the surviving passengers who lost their personal belongings, were entitled only to split the $91,000. Another example was when Transocean filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas in 2010 to limit its liability to just its interest in the Deepwater Horizon which it valued at $26,764,083. This was in the wake of billions of dollars liabilities resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that followed the sinking.http://phx.corporate- ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=113031&p;=irol-newsArticle&ID;=1426526&highlight;= The Limitation Act does not apply just to large ships. It can be used to insulate a motorboat owner from liability when he loans his boat to another who then has an accident. Even jet ski owners have been able to successfully invoke the Limitation Act to insulate themselves from liability. An unusual application involved the case Grubart v. Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company, where a vessel performing piling operations in the Chicago River punctured a tunnel and caused the 1992 Chicago flood of many underground areas of the city’s downtown; the courts ruled that the vessel was in navigable waters covered by the admiralty law limitation clause. Many shipping contracts include \\"safe berth\\" clauses that assure that the area around the intended dock is clear for the arriving vessel. This has been determined by the Supreme Court to be a warranty of safety from the entity requesting the shipping, placing the burden of clearing the area and any subsequently liability for failure to do so on that entity rather than the vessel owner, as determined in the 2020 case CITGO Asphalt Refining Co. v. Frescati Shipping Co. resulting from the oil spill on the Delaware River in 2004. ==Cargo claims== Claims for damage to cargo shipped by ocean carrier in international commerce into and out of the United States are governed by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), which is the U.S. enactment of the Hague Rules. One of its key features is that a carrier is liable for cargo damaged from \\"hook to hook,\\" meaning from loading to discharge, unless it is exonerated under one of 17 exceptions to liability, such as an \\"act of God,\\" the inherent nature of the goods, errors in navigation, and management of the ship. A shipowner is generally entitled to limit its liability to $500 per package, unless the value of the contents is disclosed and marked on the container. There is significant litigation as to what constitutes a \\"package\\" for purposes of determining liability under COGSA. This practice has resulted in substantial and continuing litigation in the United States. Federal Courts in the United States, however, are reluctant to treat an ocean shipping container as a single COGSA package. The statute of limitations on cargo claims is one year. ==Personal injuries to seamen== Seamen injured aboard ship have three possible sources of compensation: the principle of maintenance and cure, the doctrine of unseaworthiness, and the Jones Act. The principle of maintenance and cure requires a shipowner to both pay for an injured seaman's medical treatment until maximum medical recovery (MMR) is obtained and provide basic living expenses until completion of the voyage, even if the seaman is no longer aboard ship. The seaman is entitled to maintenance and cure as of right, unless he was injured due to his own willful gross negligence. It is similar in some ways to workers' compensation. The doctrine of unseaworthiness makes a shipowner liable if a seaman is injured because the ship, or any appliance of the ship, is \\"unseaworthy,\\" meaning defective in some way. The Jones Act allows a sailor, or one in privity to him, to sue the shipowner in tort for personal injury or wrongful death, with trial by jury. The Jones Act incorporates the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), which governs injuries to railway workers, and is similar to the Coal Miners Act. A shipowner is liable to a seaman in the same way a railroad operator is to its employees who are injured due to the negligence of the employer. The statute of limitation is three years. Not every worker injured on board a vessel is a \\"seaman\\" entitled to the protections offered by the Jones Act, doctrine of unseaworthiness, and principle of maintenance and cure. To be considered a seaman, a worker must generally spend 30% or more of his working hours onboard either a specific vessel or a fleet of vessels under common ownership or control. With few exceptions, all non-seamen workers injured over navigable waters are covered instead by the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, , a separate form of workers' compensation. == Emergency Expenditures == In the United States, U.S. individuals \\"evacuated on US government-coordinated transport, including charter and military flights or ships, even if those transports are provided by another country's government, must sign an Evacuee Manifest and Promissory Note (Form DS-5528) note prior to departure.\\" This note is used as a reference, which is later used to issue a bill to these evacuees for the maximum practical reimbursement. Evacuees taking coordinated U.S. government transportation are required by law to pay the cost of reasonable commercial transport fare to the destination that was designated prior to the incident that resulted in the need for evacuation. There is an option for a repatriation loan program, which is issued by the Secretary of State in regards to 11 different requirements, including requiring a verifiable address and social security number and a written agreement with a repayment schedule from the borrower. The payment of the loan should be issued to the U.S. Department of State through the Comptroller and Global Financial Services office, in full and on time. Therefore, avoiding interest payments and other legal penalties, including the prevention of renewal or issuance of a U.S. passport. ==Agony of collision== The \\"agony of collision\\" is a defense to a statutory claim of negligence in ship collisions. ==See also== * Dock (maritime) * General average * List of maritime disasters * List of oil spills * Prize (law) * SS Andrea Doria * United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ==References== Category:Federal common law ","title":"United States admiralty law"},{"id":"19263461","text":"Nan Hua Temple in Bronkhorstspruit, South Africa is the largest Buddhist pagoda in Africa.

The 24th edition of the Liberty Bowl featured the Illinois Fighting Illini of the Big Ten Conference and the Alabama Crimson Tide of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Alabama won the game, 21–15. Alabama entered the game with a 7–4 record, having lost their final three regular season games. The team was led by coach Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant, who was coaching his final game after twenty- five years with the program, announcing he would retire and hand over control of the team to Ray Perkins following the game. Bryant's retirement made the Liberty Bowl one of the most covered games of the season as many news stations and newspapers sent reporters to cover the game. Illinois was led by head coach Mike White and quarterback Tony Eason. The team was making their first bowl appearance since 1964, having won each of their previous bowls. == Game == In the first quarter, Ricky Moore began the scoring as he punched in a 4-yard touchdown run to give Alabama an early lead. Illinois scored their own touchdown in the second quarter as Joe Curtis scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, but kicker Mike Bass missed the extra point which gave Alabama a 7–6 halftime lead. Wide receiver Jesse Bendross extended Alabama's lead when he scored on an 8-yard touchdown run off a reverse. Illinois rallied behind quarterback Tony Eason following a touchdown pass to Oliver Williams and a 23-yard field goal from Mike Bass. Craig \\"Touchdown\\" Turner scored the final points in the fourth quarter for Alabama from a 1-yard touchdown run. Defensive back Jeremiah Castille was named the game's MVP after intercepting three passes from Tony Eason. Despite giving up 444 total offensive yards from Illinois, 423 passing yards by Eason, Alabama won the game 21–15. The Tide intercepted seven passes in this game, four from Eason and three from backup quarterback Kris Jenner. Jenner was in the game for only three plays, all of which came after Eason had to leave the game after taking a hard hit from the Alabama defense. On all three plays, Jenner attempted a pass which was intercepted. Bear Bryant finished with a collegiate record of 323 victories, 85 losses, and 17 ties. Bryant died of a heart attack January 26, 1983—less than four weeks after the Liberty Bowl. == Scoring summary == {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" ! rowspan=2Quarter !! rowspan=2Team !! rowspan=2Scoring summary !! colspan=2Score - !

St Paul’s is a modern looking post war church which has been designated as a Grade II listed building.Sheffield City Council website. A list of all listed buildings in Sheffield. ==History== St Paul’s was opened in 1959 to serve the New Parson Cross estate which had been constructed on previous greenfield land in the late 1940s as the City of Sheffield cleared its slum housing and expanded into the countryside. The church was designed by the Scottish architect Basil Spence who was forced to work with a limited budget. Spence was working on his most famous design Coventry Cathedral at the same time that he was overseeing the construction of St Paul’s.\\"A History of Sheffield\\", David Hey, , Page 277 Gives some information on post war housing development in Sheffield. When St Paul’s was opened in 1959 it did not have its own parish and was purely a daughter church to St. Mary‘s, Ecclesfield. However the area around St Paul’s was declared a Conventional District within the Ecclesfield parish and in 1973 the separate parish of St Paul, Wordsworth Avenue was created. The new housing estate never had an official name, so the parish is one of the few which is identified by its street address rather than by its district. The parish was badly hit by the collapse of the Sheffield steel industry in the 1980s and a high level of unemployment was created and today \\"New Parson Cross is part of one of the most deprived areas of the city\\".Sheffield City Council. Gives this quote.A Church Near You. Gives history of church and parish. ==Architecture== Spence’s design for St Paul’s is quite simple although this is not obvious at first glance. The church is basically two brick walls joined by a shallow barrel vault roof strengthened by diagonal steel bracing. The ends of the church consist almost entirely of glass with Spence integrating some the ideas he had used at St Oswald’s, Tile Hill in 1957. To the front of the church is a 15 metre high campanile consisting of just two brick walls with concrete ties in between. There is a six-metre cross on top of the campanile. The church hall stands just to the north within the church grounds. The interior has a balcony reached by steps on which the organ stands. While the altar is screened to give it some privacy from the big end window by a hardwood panel made from African Teak . Spence’s personal gift for the church were the altar ornaments which are made from hammered iron.\\"Pevsner Architectural Guides - Sheffield\\", Ruth Harman & John Minnis, , Page 37 Gives details of architecture. ==References== Category:Churches in Sheffield Category:Church of England church buildings in South Yorkshire Category:History of Sheffield Category:Churches completed in 1959 Category:20th-century Church of England church buildings Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Sheffield Category:Grade II* listed churches in South Yorkshire ","title":"St Paul's Church, Wordsworth Avenue"},{"id":"19263502","text":"A shar is a country subdivision in Iran and Azerbaijan.

However, the subsequent TENERE head-to-head comparison trial reported that \\"although permanent discontinuations [of therapy] were substantially less common among MS patients who received teriflunomide compared with interferon beta-1a, relapses were more common with teriflunomide.\\" The drug was approved for use in the United States in September 2012 and for use in the European Union in August 2013. ==Mechanisms of action== Teriflunomide is an immunomodulatory drug inhibiting pyrimidine de novo synthesis by blocking the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. It is uncertain whether this explains its effect on MS lesions. Teriflunomide inhibits rapidly dividing cells, including activated T cells, which are thought to drive the disease process in MS. Teriflunomide may decrease the risk of infections compared to chemotherapy-like drugs because of its more-limited effects on the immune system. It has been found that teriflunomide blocks the transcription factor NF-κB. It also inhibits tyrosine kinase enzymes, but only in high doses not clinically used. ==Activation of leflunomide to teriflunomide== The branded drug teriflunomide is the main active in vivo metabolite of the generically available leflunomide. Upon administration of leflunomide, 70% of the drug administered converts into teriflunomide. The only difference between the molecules is the opening of the isoxazole ring. This is considered a simple structural modification and a technically simple one-step synthetic transformation. Upon oral administration of leflunomide in vivo, the isoxazole ring of leflunomide is opened and teriflunomide is formed. Teriflunomide is the only active metabolite of leflunomide, completely responsible for its therapeutic actions. It results from the reaction of isoxazole ring opening, which occurs in vivo. Teriflunomide then can interconvert between the E and Z enolic forms (and the corresponding keto-amide), the Z-enol being the most stable and therefore most predominant form. \\"Regardless of the substance administered (leflunomide or teriflunomide), it is the same molecule (teriflunomide)—the one exerting the pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action in view of restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions, and does not present, in clinical use, a new chemical entity to patients.\\" Because of this, EMA initially had not considered teriflunomide being a new active substance. == See also == See leflunomide for information on pharmacokinetics, side effects, contraindications and other data. == References  External links == * Category:Anilides Category:Enols Category:Human drug metabolites Category:Immunosuppressants Category:Nitriles Category:Sanofi Category:Trifluoromethyl compounds ","title":"Teriflunomide"},{"id":"19263543","text":"Ratfaces Home Videos Presents Useless ID is Useless ID's first DVD which was released on September 23, 2006, in a special release show in Tel Aviv, Israel.

The thirteenth tropical cyclone, eighth named storm, and fifth hurricane of the season, Hernan developed as a tropical depression from a tropical wave to the south of Mexico on September 30. The depression quickly strengthened, and became Tropical Storm Hernan later that day. Hernan curved north-northwestward the following day, before eventually turning north-northeastward. Still offshore of the Mexican coast on October 2, Hernan intensified into a hurricane. Six hours later, Hernan attained its peak as an 85 mph (140 km/h) Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). After weakening somewhat, on 1000 UTC October 3, Hurricane Hernan made landfall near Barra de Navidad, Jalisco, with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). Only two hours after landfall, Hernan weakened to a tropical storm. By October 4, Tropical Storm Hernan had weakened into a tropical depression, and dissipated over Nayarit on the following day. The storm dropped heavy rainfall along the west coast of Mexico, with some areas experiencing over of precipitation. As a result of the large amounts of rain, Hurricane Hernan caused moderate flooding. Despite impacting a relatively sparsely populated area of Mexico, no deaths were reported in the country, though one was reported missing. In all, flooding from the storm washed-out highways, disrupted telephone service, caused power outages, and damaged at least 1,000 homes. However, at least 100 injuries were recorded. In addition, the remnants caused flooding in southern Texas, and one person was presumed to have drowned. ==Meteorological history== A tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa during mid-September and moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean. Even though convection associated with the system increased on two separate occasions, the tropical wave did not develop further. After emerging into the Pacific Ocean, the system entered the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September 28. Meanwhile, deep convection began to consolidate while the cloud pattern continued to improve. By late on September 29, classifications began on the system via the Dvorak technique, a technique used to measure a tropical cyclones intensity. By 0600 UTC on September 30, satellite imagery indicated that Tropical Depression Eleven-E had developed while centered over south-southeast of Acapulco. Three hours later, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on the depression, stating that it was over warm sea surface temperatures and outflow was becoming well-established. Subsequently, it was predicted that the depression would intensify into a hurricane before October 3. Later on September 30, satellite intensity classifications estimated wind speeds of at least 40 mph (65 km/h). Based on this, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Hernan. By October 1, the atmospheric circulation of Hernan became difficult to locate on infrared satellite imagery. As a result, the NHC reported that it no longer anticipated that Hernan would intensify into a hurricane. Later that day, Hernan strengthened slightly; subsequently, visible satellite images indicated that the center of the storm redeveloped. Most of the computer models anticipated that Hernan would parallel the coast of Mexico, though the Global Dynamics Fluid Model (GDFL) noted that Tropical Storm Hernan would turn sharply northward and eventually make landfall in Mexico. Early on October 2, deep convection began wrapping around the center, and meteorologists noted that an eye feature may have been forming. Subsequently, Hernan also developed very cold cloud tops while tracking slowly to the northwest. Hernan at landfall in Mexico. At 0600 UTC on October 2, it is estimated that Hernan had intensified into a hurricane. Operationally, however, Hernan was not upgraded to a hurricane until nine hours later. The storm strengthened a little more, and at 1200 UTC on October 2, Hernan attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 980 mbar (hPa); 28.94 inHg. By late on October 2, radar imagery remarked that the northern eye wall was affecting portions of the west coast of Mexico. Shortly thereafter, the eye of Hernan became less distinct on satellite images. By 0900 UTC on October 3, based on data from radars in Cuyutlán, Colima, the NHC reported that Hurricane Hernan had executed a cyclonic loop to the southwest of Manzanillo. About an hour later, Hernan made landfall near Barra de Navidad, with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). Hernan rapidly weakened inland, and it was estimated that it had weakened to a tropical storm only two hours after landfall. By 0000 UTC on October 4, Hernan weakened further, and was downgraded to a tropical depression. Shortly thereafter, Hernan re-emerged into the Pacific Ocean, and the NHC noted that possibility for the depression to restrengthen into a tropical storm. Hernan weakened further as a large portion of its circulation remained on land, while the low-level center became difficult to locate. By 2100 UTC October 4, satellite images and surface reports indicated that Hernan had degenerated into a broad area of low pressure. Hernan finally dissipated at 0000 UTC the next day while centered over Nayarit. ==Preparations and Impact== Hurricane Hernan's rainfall totals in Mexico Thirty-six hours after formation, on October 1, a tropical storm warning was issued from Acapulco, to Manzanillo. Early on the following day, a hurricane watch was put into effect from Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, to Manzanillo, . Three hours later, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning. At 1500 UTC on that same day, a tropical storm warning was issued from Manzanillo, to San Blas, Nayarit. By 0300 UTC on October 3, the hurricane warning was extended from Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco to San Blas; the tropical storm warning was also extended, and included areas between Mazatlán and San Blas. As the storm rapidly weakened inland, all watches and warnings in effect were discontinued midday on October 3. In addition to these warnings, several ports and harbors were closed in the states of Guerrero, Michoacan, Jalisco, and Colima, a span of some . Much of Jalisco was drenched with rain for nearly 12 consecutive hours, resulting in flooding. Country-wide; however, the highest total was recorded in Petacalco and La Union, with being measured at both locations. The National Water Commission reported waves of up to . Along the coasts of Colima and Jalisco, waves caused by Hernan were not as large, reaching 13 ft (3.9 m) in height. High winds were also recorded. Because the storm made landfall in a sparsely populated area, no deaths were reported by the NHC. However, one boy was swept away in the Uxpana River and was thus reported missing. Due to flooding caused by the storm, three rivers in Veracruz overflowed their banks. Flooding from the storm also washed-out portions of two Mexico highways. Furthermore, telephone service was interrupted and power outages occurred. Around 1,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and 100 people were injured. Overall, damage from the system was not widespread. After dissipating, the remnants of Hernan, in combination with a low pressure area that eventually became Tropical Storm Josephine, brought heavy downpours to southern Texas. Rainfall reached in Brownsville, which caused street flooding and forced several families to evacuate their homes. In addition, coastal flooding was reported in the town of South Padre Island. As a result of heavy rainfall, a flash flood watch and warning were issued for Cameron, Hidalgo, Kenedy, and Willacy Counties. One boy in Brownsville was classified as missing and later presumed to have drowned during the storm. ==See also== *Other storms of the same name *1996 Pacific hurricane season ==References *Monthly Weather Review *Hurricane Hernan Advisory Archive Hernan Hernan Hernan Hurricane Hernan ","title":"Hurricane Hernan (1996)"},{"id":"19263569","text":"The Hull triple trawler tragedy was the sinking of three trawlers from the British fishing port of Kingston upon Hull during January and February 1968. A total of 58 crew members died, with just one survivor. The three sinkings brought widespread national publicity to the conditions in which fishermen worked, and triggered an official inquiry which led to major changes to employment and working practices within the British fishing industry. ==The sinkingsSt Romanus=== The St Romanus sailed from Hull on 10 January 1968 and the last firm contact with the vessel was a radio telephone call the same evening. However, despite a company policy that ships should report their position and catch details daily, the alarm was not raised until 26 January, after a number of failed attempts by the owners to contact the ship by radio. It was then discovered that a liferaft found on 13 January by another vessel had come from the St Romanus. A search began, but by 30 January the families were told that there was little hope for the vessel and her crew of 20. Later, at the official enquiry, it was stated that a mayday call from the ship had been heard on 11 January by another ship, but had not been passed on. ===Kingston Peridot=== The Kingston Peridot had also sailed from Hull on 10 January with a crew of 20, and by 26 January she was fishing off north-east Iceland in foul weather. She told another trawler by radio that she was having difficulties with ice build-up on the ship, and arranged to move east to join them, but no further contact was established and on 29 January one of her liferafts was washed ashore. This, with debris found subsequently, indicated that the vessel had sunk. News of her loss was received in Hull on 30 January, just as hope was fading for the crew of St. Romanus.Creed, 33–40 ===Ross Cleveland=== Ross Cleveland sailed on 20 January, before the loss of the first two trawlers became known. She was bound for the north coast of Iceland with a full crew, but one man, Colin Ireland, was put ashore for medical treatment, leaving 19 on board. Conditions were very poor and on 3 February, following a weather warning, she made for Grænahlíð, a narrow and relatively sheltered inlet on Iceland's north-west coast. A number of other ships were there to wait out what became a long and exceptionally severe storm, with hurricane- force winds and blizzards, causing dangerous amounts of ice to form on the vessels' superstructure and radar. The Ross Cleveland's captain attempted to move her from a dangerous position to a safer one during the evening of 4 February, but the ship was overwhelmed by the wind and sea, capsized and sank. The last radio message received by the other ships was from the captain, and ran: Other ships attempted to assist the Ross Cleveland but were defeated by the storm, and two more vessels, the Notts. County and the Heiðrún II, were wrecked in Ísafjörður that night, the latter lost with all hands. News of the sinking reached Hull on 5 February, six days after that of the Kingston Peridot. At first it was believed all aboard Ross Cleveland had died, but on 6 February Harry Eddom, the mate, was discovered alive, having been washed ashore in a liferaft the previous day. Two other men had been with him in the raft, but both had died of exposure before reaching the shore.Creed, 49–54 ==Safety campaign== The trawlermen and their families formed a close-knit community in Hull, and the first two losses were a devastating blow. A safety campaign led by fisherman's wife Lillian Bilocca began; meetings were arranged between trawlermen's wives and trawler owners, and also with government ministers, and some wives picketed the dock to ensure all departing ships carried radio operators, attracting much national media attention. As the wives' deputation arrived at the dock in front of TV cameras and journalists on 5 February for the meeting with the trawler owners, news broke of the loss of Ross Cleveland. The following day the women travelled to London, again with massive media coverage, and met ministers to discuss a variety of reforms to the fishing industry. The same day, trawler owners were instructed to implement new safety arrangements based on the outcome of the meeting, with immediate effect. ==Inquiries== There were official inquiries into the sinking of each ship. These concluded that St. Romanus had probably been lost on 11 January for reasons unknown; that Kingston Peridot had probably capsized on either 26 or 27 January due to instability in the extreme weather conditions; and that Ross Cleveland had been insufficiently stable to cope with the weather and the build-up of ice at the time. Various recommendations were made, and these were considered in greater detail by a government Committee of Inquiry, led by Admiral Sir Deric Holland-Martin, into safety in the British fishing industry. Its report, published in May 1969, brought about wide- reaching changes. These included tighter regulation of trawler design and construction; more and better safety equipment; legal standards for radio equipment, operators and reporting procedures; and a mass of improvements to employment, training and working practices and industrial relations.Creed, 79–84 The tragedy continued to influence subsequent UK legislation on maritime safety: Harry Eddom's survival was cited in Parliamentary debates in 1986 over improvements in the provision of lifejackets and of emergency clothing in liferafts (Safety at Sea Bill 1986). Isafjordur ==Aftermath== In 2002 the wreckage of the Ross Cleveland was located in Ísafjörður by a BBC team, and filmed via mini submarine. The pictures appeared to confirm the belief that a build-up of ice on the superstructure had contributed to the sinking. In January and February 2008, the 40th anniversary of the tragedy was commemorated at a series of events in Hull. The 50th anniversary was marked on 4 March 2018 with a service at Hull Minster mirroring the 1968 service. ==NotesFurther reading== * Svensson, Ottar, Doom in the Deep: An Extraordinary Storm, a Miraculous Survival.

Bispinors are, for example, used to describe relativistic spin-½ wave functions. In the Weyl basis, a bispinor :\\\\psi=\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c}\\\\psi_{\\\\rm L}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_{\\\\rm R}\\\\end{array}\\\\right) consists of two (two-component) Weyl spinors \\\\psi_{\\\\rm L} and \\\\psi_{\\\\rm R} which transform, correspondingly, under (½,0) and (0,½) representations of the \\\\mathbf{SO}(1,3) group (the Lorentz group without parity transformations). Under parity transformation the Weyl spinors transform into each other. The Dirac bispinor is connected with the Weyl bispinor by a unitary transformation to the Dirac basis, : \\\\psi\\\\rightarrow{1\\\\over\\\\sqrt2}\\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{cc}1&1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\-1&1 \\\\end{array} \\\\right]\\\\psi= {1\\\\over\\\\sqrt2}\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c}\\\\psi_{\\\\rm R}+\\\\psi_{\\\\rm L}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_{\\\\rm R}-\\\\psi_{\\\\rm L} \\\\end{array}\\\\right) . The Dirac basis is the one most widely used in the literature. ==Expressions for Lorentz transformations of bispinors== A bispinor field \\\\psi(x) transforms according to the rule :\\\\psi^a(x) \\\\to {\\\\psi^\\\\prime}^a(x^\\\\prime) = S[\\\\Lambda]^a_b \\\\psi^b(\\\\Lambda^{-1}x^\\\\prime) = S[\\\\Lambda]^a_b \\\\psi^b(x) where \\\\Lambda is a Lorentz transformation. Here the coordinates of physical points are transformed according to x^\\\\prime = \\\\Lambda x, while S, a matrix, is an element of the spinor representation (for spin ) of the Lorentz group. In the Weyl basis, explicit transformation matrices for a boost \\\\Lambda_{\\\\rm boost} and for a rotation \\\\Lambda_{\\\\rm rot} are the following:David Tong, Lectures on Quantum Field Theory (2012), Lecture 4 :S[\\\\Lambda_{\\\\rm boost}] = \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{cc} e^{+\\\\chi\\\\cdot\\\\sigma / 2}&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&e;^{-\\\\chi\\\\cdot\\\\sigma / 2} \\\\end{array} \\\\right) :S[\\\\Lambda_{\\\\rm rot}] = \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{cc} e^{+i\\\\phi\\\\cdot\\\\sigma / 2}&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&e;^{+i\\\\phi\\\\cdot\\\\sigma / 2} \\\\end{array} \\\\right) Here \\\\chi is the boost parameter, and \\\\phi^i represents rotation around the x^i axis. \\\\sigma_i are the Pauli matrices. The exponential is the exponential map, in this case the matrix exponential defined by putting the matrix into the usual power series for the exponential function. ==Properties== A bilinear form of bispinors can be reduced to five irreducible (under the Lorentz group) objects: # scalar, \\\\bar{\\\\psi}\\\\psi ; # pseudo-scalar, \\\\bar{\\\\psi}\\\\gamma^5\\\\psi ; # vector, \\\\bar{\\\\psi}\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\psi ; # pseudo-vector, \\\\bar{\\\\psi}\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\gamma^5\\\\psi ; # antisymmetric tensor, \\\\bar{\\\\psi}(\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\gamma^ u-\\\\gamma^ u\\\\gamma^\\\\mu)\\\\psi , where \\\\bar{\\\\psi}\\\\equiv\\\\psi^\\\\dagger\\\\gamma^0 and \\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma^\\\\mu,\\\\gamma^5\\\\\\\\} are the gamma matrices. A suitable Lagrangian for the relativistic spin-½ field can be built out of these, and is given as : \\\\mathcal{L}={i\\\\over2}\\\\left( \\\\bar{\\\\psi}\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\psi-\\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\bar{\\\\psi}\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\psi\\\\right)-m\\\\bar{\\\\psi}\\\\psi\\\\;. The Dirac equation can be derived from this Lagrangian by using the Euler–Lagrange equation. == Derivation of a bispinor representation  Introduction === This outline describes one type of bispinors as elements of a particular representation space of the (½,0)⊕ (0,½) representation of the Lorentz group. This representation space is related to, but not identical to, the (½,0)⊕ (0,½) representation space contained in the Clifford algebra over Minkowski spacetime as described in the article Spinors. Language and terminology is used as in Representation theory of the Lorentz group. The only property of Clifford algebras that is essential for the presentation is the defining property given in below. The basis elements of are labeled . A representation of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group will emerge among matrices that will be chosen as a basis (as a vector space) of the complex Clifford algebra over spacetime. These matrices are then exponentiated yielding a representation of . This representation, that turns out to be a representation, will act on an arbitrary 4-dimensional complex vector space, which will simply be taken as , and its elements will be bispinors. For reference, the commutation relations of are with the spacetime metric . === The gamma matrices === Let γμ denote a set of four 4-dimensional gamma matrices, here called the Dirac matrices. The Dirac matrices satisfy where } is the anticommutator, is a unit matrix, and is the spacetime metric with signature (+,-,-,-). This is the defining condition for a generating set of a Clifford algebra. Further basis elements of the Clifford algebra are given by Only six of the matrices are linearly independent. This follows directly from their definition since . They act on the subspace the span in the passive sense, according to In , the second equality follows from property of the Clifford algebra. === Lie algebra embedding of so(3;1) in Cℓ4(C) === Now define an action of on the , and the linear subspace they span in , given by The last equality in , which follows from and the property of the gamma matrices, shows that the constitute a representation of since the commutation relations in are exactly those of . The action of can either be thought of as six-dimensional matrices multiplying the basis vectors , since the space in spanned by the is six-dimensional, or be thought of as the action by commutation on the . In the following, The and the are both (disjoint) subsets of the basis elements of Cℓ4(C), generated by the four-dimensional Dirac matrices in four spacetime dimensions. The Lie algebra of is thus embedded in Cℓ4(C) by as the real subspace of Cℓ4(C) spanned by the . For a full description of the remaining basis elements other than and of the Clifford algebra, please see the article Dirac algebra. === Bispinors introduced === Now introduce any 4-dimensional complex vector space U where the γμ act by matrix multiplication. Here will do nicely. Let be a Lorentz transformation and define the action of the Lorentz group on U to be :u \\\\rightarrow S(\\\\Lambda)u = e^{i\\\\pi(\\\\omega_{\\\\mu u}M^{\\\\mu u})}u;\\\\quad u^\\\\alpha \\\\rightarrow [e^{\\\\omega_{\\\\mu u}\\\\sigma^}]^\\\\alpha{}_\\\\beta u^\\\\beta. Since the according to constitute a representation of , the induced map according to general theory either is a representation or a projective representation of . It will turn out to be a projective representation. The elements of U, when endowed with the transformation rule given by S, are called bispinors or simply spinors. === A choice of Dirac matrices === It remains to choose a set of Dirac matrices in order to obtain the spin representation . One such choice, appropriate for the ultrarelativistic limit, is where the are the Pauli matrices. In this representation of the Clifford algebra generators, the become This representation is manifestly not irreducible, since the matrices are all block diagonal. But by irreducibility of the Pauli matrices, the representation cannot be further reduced. Since it is a 4-dimensional, the only possibility is that it is a representation, i.e. a bispinor representation. Now using the recipe of exponentiation of the Lie algebra representation to obtain a representation of , a projective 2-valued representation is obtained. Here is a vector of rotation parameters with , and is a vector of boost parameters. With the conventions used here one may write for a bispinor field. Here, the upper component corresponds to a right Weyl spinor. To include space parity inversion in this formalism, one sets as representative for . It is seen that the representation is irreducible when space parity inversion is included. === An example === Let so that generates a rotation around the z-axis by an angle of . Then but . Here, denotes the identity element. If is chosen instead, then still , but now . This illustrates the double valued nature of a spin representation. The identity in gets mapped into either or depending on the choice of Lie algebra element to represent it. In the first case, one can speculate that a rotation of an angle will turn a bispinor into minus itself, and that it requires a rotation to rotate a bispinor back into itself. What really happens is that the identity in is mapped to in with an unfortunate choice of . It is impossible to continuously choose for all so that is a continuous representation. Suppose that one defines along a loop in such that . This is a closed loop in , i.e. rotations ranging from 0 to around the z-axis under the exponential mapping, but it is only \\"half\\"\\" a loop in , ending at . In addition, the value of is ambiguous, since and gives different values for . === The Dirac algebra === The representation on bispinors will induce a representation of on , the set of linear operators on U. This space corresponds to the Clifford algebra itself so that all linear operators on U are elements of the latter. This representation, and how it decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations, is described in the article on Dirac algebra. One of the consequences is the decomposition of the bilinear forms on . This decomposition hints how to couple any bispinor field with other fields in a Lagrangian to yield Lorentz scalars. ==See also== *Dirac spinor *Spin(3,1), the double cover of SO(3,1) by a spin group == Notes  References == * *.

After several years of individual work (though officially presented as the work of multiple Congress commissions), Bello delivered a complete project of the Code on November 22, 1855, which was sent to Congress by President Manuel Montt, preceded by a foreword by Bello himself. Congress passed the Civil Code into law on December 14, 1855. It then came into force on January 1, 1857. Although it has been the object of numerous alterations, the Code has been kept in force since then. ==Sources== Traditionally, the Napoleonic Code has been considered the main source of inspiration for the Chilean Code. However, this is true only with regard to the law of obligations and the law of things (except for principle of abstraction), while it is not true at all in the matters of family and successions. The indisputable main source of the Civil Code is the Siete Partidas (Seven-Part Code) of King Alfonso X, perhaps the pinnacle of Spanish ius commune. For instance, in relating the acquisition of property, the code makes a clear distinction between the titles and the actual acquisition of property, similarly to the Roman Law and the German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch. The traditional Spanish law is also manifested strongly in the matter of successions. This is true notwithstanding the important modernisations made by the Code, such as eliminating the preference for the males in the adjudication of the estate, the end of mayorazgos (the adjudication of the whole estate to the elder male son) and the adoption of a rule against successive usufructs. Similarly, it adopted the Canonical Law provisions regarding marriage. The Code made important changes, inspired by the examples of European Codes in place or in preparation. Regarding the real estate, the Code was inspired by the old German registry system, adapting it to the necessities of the post-colonial economy. It was the first Civil Code containing especific provisions regarding the legal persons systematically. The Code based its method of interpretation on the Louisiana Code creating a system original to its era. Although the Napoleonic Code influenced the Chilean Code largely regarding the law of obligations, this influence is in no case a mere transcription. For instance, while the French Code's final book is entitled \\"On Contracts\\", the Chilean Code's last book, second title, is named \\"On the declarations of will\\", comprising a general theory of contract. The Chilean Code is of clear neoclassic inspiration. Each institution is introduced through an axiom and then the articles or sections cite examples or consequences of the axiom with a didactic purpose. ==Summary== * Preliminary title (articles 1 to 53): the title deals with law in general. Similar to the French Code, it establishes that laws could only be applied if they had been duly promulgated and if they had been published officially (including provisions for publishing delays, given the means of communication available at the time). Thus, no secret laws were authorized. It prohibited ex post facto laws (i.e. laws that apply to events that occurred before them). It also prohibits judges from passing general judgments of a legislative value, see above. It also defines certain concepts general to the whole civil law. * Book I: On persons (articles 54 to 564): the book deals with the birth and death of persons, marriage and paternity. It also deals with the creation and liability of legal persons. This section of the Code has been highly modified in the last 20 years, along with the Book III, in order to eliminate discriminations between children born from married and unmarried couples. * Book II: On goods, its property, possession, use and profit (articles 565 to 950): the book contains the general dispositions relative to the distinct kinds of goods, the means of property acquisition, possession, the rights different from property and the judicial remedies to protect them. * Book III: On successions and donations (articles 951 to 1436): it makes provisions regarding the destination of the property after the death of a person, the formation and execution of wills and, finally, it deals with donations. * Book IV: On obligations in general and contracts (articles 1437 to 2524): the book regulates the general theory of contracts, the most important contracts in particular, the annulment and satisfaction of contracts. It also deals with torts. * Final article: On the obedience of the Code: the title determines the date in which the Code would come into force and the derogation of all laws relative to the matter of the Civil Code. ==Influence== The Chilean Code is an original work in confront with the French code both for the scheme and for the contents (similar to the Castillan law in force in that territory). This code was integrally adopted by Ecuador in 1858, El Salvador in 1859, Venezuela in 1862 (although only for that year), Nicaragua in 1867, Honduras in 1880 (until 1899 and again since 1906), Colombia in 1887 and Panama (after its separation from Colombia in 1903). According to other Latin American experts of its time, like Augusto Teixeira de Freitas (author of the Esboço de un Código Civil para Brasil) or Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield (main author of the Argentine Civil Code), it is the most important legal accomplishment of Latin America. ==See also== * Civil Code * Civil law (area) ==References== *Tapia Rodríguez, Mauricio, \\"Código Civil 1855-2005.

The current minister is Ivica Dačić, in office since 27 April 2014. Its headquarters are located in the Ministry of Forestry and Mining and Ministry of Agriculture and Waterworks Building. ==History== The foreign policy and diplomatic tradition of Serbia derive from its independent state in the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Specific foreign policy and diplomatic experience of the Serbian state was drawn upon the vassal or autonomous state of the Serbian people during the various periods of the Ottoman domination in the Balkans, from the fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries. In the nineteenth century, when the movement for independence from the Ottoman Empire became irrepressible, especially after the First Serbian Uprising (1804) under Karađorđe and the Second Uprising (1815) under Miloš Obrenović, Serbia embarked upon an ever-broader diplomatic rapport with the Porte in Constantinople, with Russia, Austria, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and other European nations and neighboring states, such as Romania, Bulgaria and Greece. Serbia became fully independent and internationally recognized at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. Among the states with which Serbia established diplomatic relations first (before that time diplomatic relations were limited to certain diplomatic functions) were Russia, Austria, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and a number of other European countries. The diplomatic relations with the United States, however, were established only in 1882, through the ratification of the Convention on trade and navigation and the Convention on consular relations. Following the end of World War I, in which Serbia fought on the side of the Entente, Serbia became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In the interwar period the Kingdom was a founding member of the League of Nations and of the Little Entente with Romania and Czechoslovakia as well as of the Balkan Treaty with Romania, Greece and Turkey. The Kingdom's joining of the Axis Tripartite Pact on March 25, 1941 was revoked, by the will of the Serbian people, on the streets of Belgrade two days later. During World War II, in which Yugoslavia was allied against the Axis Powers, a new Yugoslav federal state came into being that was proclaimed and internationally recognized in 1945. The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was a founding member of the United Nations in 1945 and of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in 1975. It was also one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement, which held two summit conferences in Belgrade, in 1961 and 1989. In the early fifties Yugoslavia was a member of the Balkan Treaty with Greece and Turkey. The ministry in current form was established on 15 January 1991. ==Officials and organization== The current Minister of Foreign Affairs is Ivica Dačić. The State Secretary is Vera MavrićState Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Serbia and the Secretary General is Zoran Marković. Assistant Ministers are Goran Aleksić for bilateral relations, Roksanda Ninčić for multilateral affairs, Duško Lopandić for the European Union, Zoran Vujić for security policy, and Šani Dermaku for consular affairs.Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Officials Organization scheme of the ministry:The Organisational Structure of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs *Office of the Minister **Diplomatic Protocol **Special Services ***Service for Investigation and Documentation ***Security Service ***Service for International Legal Affairs ***Translations Service ***ICT Department **Secretariat General ***Directorate of Personnel and Legal Affairs ***Accounts and Payments Directorate ***Directorate of Archival Affairs ***Service for Property-Legal, General and Common Affairs ***Out-of- Hours Contact Office ***Inspector General ***Office of the State Secretary ****Directorates General *****Directorate General of Bilateral Relations ******Directorate for Neighboring and South-East European Countries ******Directorate for Europe ******Directorate for Russia and Eurasia ******Directorate for Americas ******Directorate for Africa and the Middle East ******Directorate for Asia, Australia and the Pacific ******Directorate of Bilateral Economic Cooperation ******Directorate for Borders *****Directorate General of Multilateral Cooperation ******Directorate for the United Nations ******OSCE and CoE Directorate ******Directorate of Multilateral Economic Cooperation ******Directorate of Human Rights and Protection of the Environment *****Directorate General for the European Union ******Directorate for the Institutions of the European Union Countries ******Directorate for Sectoral Affairs ******Directorate for Regional Initiatives *****Directorate General for NATO and Defense Affairs ******Directorate for NATO ******Partnership for Peace Directorate ******Directorate for Weapons Control ******MoD Coordination Section *****Directorate General of Information and Culture ******Directorate of Information ******Directorate of International, Cultural, Educational, Scientific, Technological and Sports Cooperation *****Directorate General of Consular Affairs and Diaspora ******Directorate of Consular Affairs ******Directorate of Development, Diaspora and Social Security Conventions **Councils ***Council for Foreign Policy Strategy ***Legal Council of the MFA **Diplomatic Academy ==Serbian representation abroad== Serbia has a significant number of diplomatic missions abroad, representing its growing ties with the West along with Yugoslavia's historical ties with eastern Europe and the Non-Aligned Movement. Serbia inherited about a third of the diplomatic facilities that belonged to the former Yugoslavia. After 2001 embassies in Chile, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Lebanon, Mongolia, North Korea, Pakistan, Thailand, Venezuela, Vietnam and Zimbabwe were closed due to financial or reciprocal reasons. In June 2008, the government of Serbia made the decision to close consulates in Bari, Graz and Malmö, and later that year Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić announced plans to open a consulate-general in Knin, Croatia and an embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. On November 30, 2006, the Government of Serbia adopted the Memorandum of Agreement between the Republic of Montenegro and the Republic of Serbia on Consular Protection and Services to the Citizens of Montenegro. By this agreement, Serbian diplomatic missions provide consular services to the Montenegrin citizens on the territory of states in which Montenegro has no missions of its own.Memorandum on Services to Montenegrin Citizens Takes Effect Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintains the following missions abroad: *65 embassies; *23 consulates in 15 countries; *55 honorary consuls; *7 diplomatic missions to the: COE, EU, NATO, OSCE, UN - New York, UN - Geneva, and UNESCO. Serbia hosts 65 foreign embassies in Belgrade, 5 Consulates- Generals (two in Niš and Subotica and one in Vršac) and 4 Liaison offices (in Priština). Serbia also hosts representatives of the Palestinian National Authority and Sovereign Military Order of Malta and 13 Honorary Consuls, some accredited as Ambassadors. ==Diplomatic Academy== The first modern law on diplomatic service was passed in 1886 during the reign of King Milan. The Diplomatic Academy was formed in 1998 from the former diplomatic school of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ==Diplomatic Archive== The diplomatic archive of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is based on former activities of the diplomatic archive of the Kingdom of Serbia and Kingdom of Yugoslavia. It was founded on May 5, 1919 on the basis of the Decree, and it consisted of Documentation and Library of the Ministry, taken over from the Ministry of the Kingdom of Serbia and Montenegro. The Main Archive started to operate more effectively in the fall of 1924 since it was then that the Minister of Foreign Affairs formed an expert commission whose task was to inspect gathered documents on the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and make a plan of future operation of the Main archive. The Law on archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and diplomatic and consular missions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia abroad has from April 5, 1930 been precise in stating which holdings of the archive would become part of the Main Archive. The Diplomatic Archive has published the collections of public documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY between 1945 and 1950 in eight volumes called Blue edition. ==List of ministersForeign Ministers of Serbia prior to formation of Yugoslavia=== This is a list of all the Foreign Ministers (and the Acting Foreign Ministers) of the Revolutionary Serbia, the Principality of Serbia and the Kingdom of Serbia from the creation of this post in 1811 to the formation of Yugoslavia after World War I, in the late 1918.

Ahmad Ismail is known for controversial actions and remarks made in the fields of politics, business and sports, including the latest controversy in which he uttered incendiary remarks about the Chinese community during and after the Permatang Pauh by-election in August 2008, leading to his suspension by UMNO in September 2008. == Political career  Accusations of racism ===  \\"Chinese as squatters\\" remark  In late August 2008, Ahmad Ismail was highlighted over racist remarks uttered during campaigning in a by-election in Permatang Pauh that primarily pitted Barisan Nasional candidate Arif Shah Omar Shah (UMNO) against Pakatan Rakyat candidate Anwar Ibrahim (PKR) for the Permatang Pauh parliamentary seat. On 25 August 2008 local Chinese daily Sin Chew Daily reported a speech made by Ahmad Ismail on the evening of 23 August 2008 at Kampung Pelet to campaign for Arif Shah, in which he allegedly stated Malaysian Chinese were \\"immigrants\\" and \\"squatters\\", and could not have equal rights. In a 6 September statement by Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi, Ahmad was quoted that he merely uttered the remark based on historical facts and claimed it was not a racist statement as reported by Sin Chew Daily, accusing the paper of misinterpreting him. Despite criticism of his remark in the by- election and expressing regret that it resulted in controversy, Ahmad remained defiant and refused to apologise. In a further outburst during a press conference on 8 September, Ahmad seditiously warned the Chinese community not to seek political power: > \\"The patience of the Malays and Muslims has a limit. Do not push us to the > wall, as when we turn back we will be forced to push the Chinese in the > interests of our own survival [...] The Chinese should not try to be like > the Jews in America. It is not enough they control the economy, now they > want political control.\\" Following a meeting with Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi on 9 September, Ahmad would later be quoted in stating Malays were \\"frustrated\\" and that Malay \\"dignity\\" was at stake, remaining convinced that he is more nationalistic defending the Malays rather than being racist: > \\"Half the Chinese say I'm a racist but most Malays say I'm a nationalist > defending my race [...] What I see now is a rise of the Malay people, and I > feel we should capitalise on the strength, the support we get from the Malay > people... I know they are with me.\\"  Reaction to His Comments  Revelations of Ahmad Ismail's comments during and after the by-election drew widespread criticism predominantly from the Chinese community. On 27 August, the youth wing of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) demanded an apology from Ahmad, with secretary-general Wee Ka Siong stating Ahmad had angered the Chinese as well as other non-Malay communities; Wee had also received numerous complaints from the Chinese community in the past two days. On 9 September, Gerakan president Koh Tsu Koon announced Penang Gerakan has dissociated itself from UMNO's Penang branch, holding leaders of UMNO Penang accountable for failing to condemn Ahmad's conduct: > \\"We no longer want to be associated with Penang UMNO. We condemned the > statement and irresponsible behaviour by Ahmad and his supporters. We are > also extremely disappointed and saddened by the fact that many Penang UMNO > leaders were present and condoned such irresponsible and insensitive > statement and behaviour. He had twisted and turned a personal mistake into a > conflict and crisis among BN component parties and the communities.\\" Views among members of UMNO were less conclusive. Following revelations of Ahmad's comments in the by-election, Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi stated party leaders expressed \\"regret and anger\\" over Ahmad Ismail's remark, as UMNO considered actions to be taken against Ahmad. Former Law Minister Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz and former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad voiced similar views that Ahmad Ismail should be held accountable for his remarks and issue an apology. In a 6 September report published by Utusan Malaysia, Muhammad Muhammad Taib reiterated Ahamd's defence, asking the public, especially politicians, not to put forward baseless accusations against Ahmad, claiming his remarks could merely be used in the context of history rather than politics.  Suspension from UMNO  In 2008, UMNO imposed a suspension on Ahmad for three years. === Reactions to His Suspension === However stronger action than had been expected in a bid to soothe growing anger from the Chinese community and among parties in Barisan Nasional ruling coalition. On 12 September 2008 Sin Chew Daily reporter Tan Hoon Cheng who reported the speech made by Ahmad Ismail, had been arrested under the Internal Security Act at 8.30pm at her home in Bukit Mertajam, Penang. The MCA, a component party of the Barisan National, has expressed shock that Ahmad Ismail, who made racist remarks has not been taken to task but reporter Tan Hoon Cheng, who wrote about the incident, has been arrested instead. \\"The perpetrator who vowed to conduct a nationwide roadshow on his remarks without any remorse is still at large,\\" MCA vice-president Datuk Ong Tee Keat said. == Business == In 1995, Peninsular Metroworks was founded with Ahmad Ismail as its executive chairman. The company was a special purpose vehicle, intended to receive concession to develop the Penang Outer Ring Road (PORR), a project which was subsequently delayed by the federal government in 2008 following the 2008 general election. Additionally, a majority stake in Peninsular Metroworks was indirectly linked to Ahmad Ismail: A 55% stake in the company was held in its early years by Nadi Senandung Sdn Bhd, which Ahmad was the director of; the remaining 45% was held by Setegap Bhd and Kumpulan Pinang Holdings Sdn Bhd, the latter a full subsidiary of Yayasan Bumiputra Pulau Pinang . Ahmad Ismail was also the director of Popular Profile Sdn Bhd, which the Penang Development Corporation believed had wrongfully taken and kept RM500,000 from the state in a botched land transaction for Bukit Minyak in 1998, before winding up in 2005; Ahmad was believed to have cut links with the company in 1998. A police report was lodged by Penang Development Corporation on 3 September 2008. Crossback Arowana Farm at Bukit Merah Perak is Ahmad's latest business venture. He is a major shareholder for this golden arowana breeding farm and most of his pricey arowanas are exported to Mainland China. == Sports == In addition to interests in politics and business, Ahmad Ismail was also the president of the Malaysian Sepak Takraw Association. During the 2007 Southeast Asian Games in Korat, Thailand, Ahmad led the pullout of Malaysia's sepak takraw team at the last minute. ==References== Category:1955 births Category:Anti-Chinese sentiment in Asia Category:Living people Category:Malaysian people of Malay descent Category:Malaysian businesspeople Category:Malaysian people of Indian descent Category:Malaysian Muslims Category:People from Penang Category:Political scandals in Malaysia Category:Members of the Dewan Negara ","title":"Ahmad Ismail (Malaysian politician)"},{"id":"19264071","text":"The Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Workers Union (KPAWU) is a trade union which represents 200,000 agriculture sector workers (2005 estimateWangui, M. 2004, 'Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Workers Union: Workshop on collective bargaining for agricultural workers' , International Labour Organisation, 28 May.

The KPAWU is affiliated to the Central Organization of Trade Unions. ==Political activities== The KPAWU is engaged with a number of labour issues. Some of its work is focused on the elimination of child labour in Kenya's agricultural sector. Where plantation owners are seeking Fair Trade certification for their produce, the KPAWU plays a role in the implementation of international labour standards required under the Fair Trade rules.Great Britain Parliament House of Commons International Development Committee 2007, Fair Trade and Development: Seventh Report of Session 2006-07, Vol. 2: Oral and Written Evidence, The Stationery Office, London, p. 98. The KPAWU is opposed to mechanization of plantations on the grounds that the introduction of machines is a threat to jobs. For example, in 2006 it threatened strike action against a plantation owner which sought to introduce tea-picking machines.Onchana, E. 2007, 'Minister's decision to ban use of tea plucking machines halted' , Kenya Law Reports, January.

(2013). L2/13-071 Proposal to Encode the Uyghur Script. The term \\"Old Uyghur\\" used for this alphabet is misleading because Qocho, the Tocharian-Uyghur kingdom created in 843, originally used the Old Turkic alphabet. The Uyghur adopted this script from local inhabitants when they migrated into Turfan after 840. It was an adaptation of the Aramaic alphabet used for texts with Buddhist, Manichaean and Christian content for 700–800 years in Turpan. The last known manuscripts are dated to the 18th century. This was the prototype for the Mongolian and Manchu alphabets. The Old Uyghur alphabet was brought to Mongolia by Tata-tonga. The Old Uyghur script was used between the 8th and 17th centuries primarily in the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, located in present-day Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. It is a cursive-joining alphabet with features of an abjad and is written vertically. The script flourished through the 15th century in Central Asia and parts of Iran, but it was eventually replaced by the Arabic script in the 16th century. Its usage was continued in Gansu through the 17th century.Pandey, Anshuman. (2019). L2/19-016 Revised proposal to encode Old Uyghur in Unicode. Like the Sogdian alphabet (technically, an abjad), the Old Uyghur tended to use matres lectionis for the long vowels as well as for the short ones. The practice of leaving short vowels unrepresented was almost completely abandoned.Clauson, Gerard. 2002. Studies in Turkic and Mongolic linguistics. P.110-111. Thus, while ultimately deriving from a Semitic abjad, the Old Uyghur alphabet can be said to have been largely \\"alphabetized\\".Houston, Stephen D. 2004.

It is a unit of Carrier Global Corporation and is headquartered in Lewisburg, Tennessee, United States. ==About== ICP is a United Technologies subsidiary (and part of its Carrier operating unit). ICP makes oil and gas furnaces, heat pumps, and central air-conditioning systems for residential and commercial customers. It manufacturers, markets, and sells residential heating and cooling systems under the Arcoaire, Comfortmaker, Day & Night, Heil, KeepRite, Lincoln, and Tempstar brands; its commercial units, with up to 25 tons of cooling capacity, are sold under the ICP Commercial brand. ICP's Tempstar has international sales with support in Shanghai, China; Canoas, Brazil; Bucharest, Romania and Wiener Neudorf, Austria. ICP produces more than a million units a year at various manufacturing complexes in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Oil furnaces are also produced at the Canadian plant in Sherbrooke, Quebec. ==History== ICP has been growing through the years by developing diversified brands and acquiring competitor brands. Its goal was to establish its presence in all available market niches. International Comfort Products Corporation brands trace their roots back many years. Arcoaire were made by ARCO (Atlantic Richfield Company.) Both Comfortmaker and Arcoaire were parts of the SnyderGeneral Corporation (which was based in Dallas, Texas but had its residential and light commercial operations in Red Bud, Illinois and Hutchins, Texas) until in 1991 they sold their Residential Operations to Inter-City Products. Before SnyderGeneral, Comfortmaker was a brand of American Furnace Company that originated in the 1950s, which was bought out by Singer's Climate Control division, which was spun off by Richard Snyder to create SnyderGeneral. Arcoaire was a brand name of the ARCO. The KeepRite brand has been a major brand in Canada for 50 years. High efficiency oil furnaces, produced exclusively at the Quebec plant, carry the Lincoln name. Day & Night began as a solar water heater company in 1909 in Monrovia, California, providing Californians with round-the-clock hot water. It ventured into space heating in 1930s. After extinguishing the name in 1997, the Day & Night brand name was resurrected in Western US and Canada in 2009. Heil was established in 1962; the Tempstar brand was introduced in the 1980s in response to increased market demands for a full line of heating and cooling products. International Comfort Products has the largest North American distribution system in the industry. Independent wholesalers sell residential and light commercial products to installers in the replacement and renovation sectors and to contractors in new construction. ICP became a wholly owned subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation in 1999. Before this event happened, ICP was known as Inter-City Products. In October 2002, ICP became the exclusive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of Kenmore brand residential central heating and cooling equipment for Sears, Roebuck and Company. ==Brands== * Arcoaire * Comfortmaker * Day & Night * Grand Aire * Heil * ICP Commercial * KeepRite * Lincoln * Tempstar * Payne ==References== Category:United Technologies Category:1999 mergers and acquisitions Category:Companies based in Tennessee ","title":"International Comfort Products"},{"id":"19264156","text":"Christopher Michael Thompson (born 7 February 1982) is an English former professional footballer, who played as a striker.

He also designed Agricola, a genre-changing game that dethroned Puerto Rico as the highest rated game on BoardGameGeek.com in September 2008 and stayed at the top of the rankings until March 2010. Rosenberg is well known for the development of complex, economic eurogames, as well as innovative card game mechanisms. Many of his designs have been recognized as being excellent for solitary play. Born in Aurich, Germany, Rosenberg first began to occupy himself with the development and mechanisms of games at the age of 12. He published a number of play-by-mail games during his school years. While he was still in college, Amigo published his first major success, Bohnanza. Since finishing his statistics studies in Dortmund (the subject of his thesis was \\"Probability distributions in Memory\\"), his main occupation is the development of games. In 2000, he founded the publishing company Lookout Games, together with a few other authors. It published a number of expansions to Bohnanza, partly in cooperation with Hanno Girke. Larger projects were at first published at other publishers, such as Amigo and Kosmos.Autobiography at BoardGameGeek Since 2005, Rosenberg has concentrated mostly on complex strategy games with an economic theme: his first, Agricola, was released in October 2007, went on to win a Spiel des Jahres special award for the best complex game of 2008, and has become a staple in the European game subgenre of worker placement games. A second game in this series, Le Havre, was published in October 2008. His highest rated game is currently Caverna, which was rated eleventh on BoardGameGeek.com as of October 2017.

Its last assignment was with the 58th Tactical Fighter Training Wing, being inactivated at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona on 1 October 1976. The unit was originally formed as the 418th Night Fighter Squadron in 1943. After training, it was deployed to Fifth Air Force and ordered to New Guinea to provide air defense interceptor protection against Japanese night air raids on USAAF airfields. It later served in the Philippines Campaign where in addition to night interceptor missions it also flew day and night interdiction missions against enemy troop movements, bridges and other targets of opportunity. It later served in Occupied Japan and Okinawa where it was inactivated in 1947. During the Cold War, the squadron was briefly activated in the Philippines in 1958, then became an F-104 Starfighter training unit for the West German Air Force at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona in the early 1970s. ==HistoryWorld War II=== The squadron was activated on 1 April 1943 at the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics, Orlando AAF, Florida. After several months of training with Douglas P-70 Havoc night fighters, the unit was deployed to the Pacific Theater, moving first to Camp Patrick Henry, near Newport News Virginia where they boarded the USS General John Pope, sailing through the Panama Canal to Milne Bay, New Guinea.Northrop P-61 Black Widow—The Complete History and Combat Record, Garry R.

In New Guinea, the squadron was assigned to Fifth Air Force and initially stationed at Dobodura airfield in November 1943. It was the first dedicated night interceptor squadron assigned to the Pacific Theater. However, it was found that the P-70 was not very successful in actual combat interception of Japanese fighters at nightBaugher Douglas P-70 and after a short time, Fifth Air Force modified some Lockheed P-38F Lightnings in the field as single-seat night fighters by fitting an SCR540 radar with yagi antennae on the nose on both sides of the central nacelle, and above and below the wings. The Lightnings were much more successful than the P-70s, and Lockheed sent field representatives to new Guinea to study the modified aircraft for a new production model (P-38M) which it began producing in 1944.Baugher, Lockheed P-38M Lightning As the fortunes of war progressed, the squadron moved west along the northern coast of New Guinea, moving to several advance airfields on the island throughout 1943 and 1944. In September 1944, the squadron was re-equipped with P-61 Black Widows and moved to Morotai Island in the Dutch East Indies where they engaged enemy aircraft. In the East Indies, additional B-25 Mitchells and P-38s were assigned, using the B-25s for night intruder operations, P-61s for night fighter operations and the P-38s for searchlight cooperation operations. In November the squadron moved to the Philippines, arriving on Leyte on 14 November. The unit was attached frequently to different units throughout the war, and remained in the Philippines until July 1945 when it moved to Okinawa. From Kadena Airfield, the unit attacked a wide range of enemy targets on Hainan Island, Hong Kong, and along the east China coast. Its first mission against targets on the Japanese Home Islands took place on 28 July when it attacked targets on Kyūshū and also in the Shanghai area of enemy-controlled China. After V-J Day, the 418th NFS moved briefly to Atsugi Airfield, Japan during October 1945 where it was part of the occupying forces. It returned to Okinawa on 15 June 1946, conducting training operations until 20 February 1947 when the unit was inactivated. Its assigned personnel, aircraft and equipment were transferred to the 4th Fighter Squadron (All Weather). ===Cold War=== The squadron was briefly activated by Thirteenth Air Force at Clark Air Base, Philippines in late 1957. It was programmed to be an F-100A Super Sabre daylight air superiority squadron, however no record of any aircraft actually assigned to the unit can be found. The squadron was inactivated on 1 July 1958 due to overall budget reductions in the Air Force.AFHRA 418th Fighter Squadron (Day) On 1 October 1969 the squadron was again reactivated, by Tactical Air Command under the 58th Tactical Fighter Training Wing (TFTW) at Luke AFB, Arizona. It assumed the personnel and equipment of the provisional 4518th Combat Crew Training Squadron, which had been flying GAF TF-104G Starfighters at Luke AFB since 1964.

He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1836, graduating four years later standing 31st out of 42 cadets. He was appointed a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Dragoons on July 1, 1840.Eicher, p. 508.

IOOC, an independent legal entity, is based in Tehran and operates in southern Iran. Its activities cover important areas of the Persian Gulf and its main operations are in Bushehr Province and on Kharg Island, Sirri Island and Lavan Island. ==History== After Iranian Revolution, all partnership contracts with aforementioned companies were abolished, and a year later, the Iranian Offshore Oil Company (IOOC) was established by combining those companies. The objective underlying establishment of IOOC was to achieve an optimized production as well as to safeguard oil and gas reservoirs in the Persian Gulf area, along with an increase in the production rate and prevention of oil and gas migration in the common fields. During the Iraq-Iran War, the IOOC suffered considerable damages to offshore and onshore facilities. ==Operations== The IOOC operations in the Persian Gulf are divided into two zones: the northern zone which includes oilfields around Kharg Island and ones near Iranian port of Bahregan. The Southern zone of the company's operations includes areas near islands Sirri, Lavan, Kish, Qeshm. The IOOC has the production capacity of over 640,000 b/d. In 2012, IOOC signed a contract worth $6.6 billion, with Iran’s power projects management company (MAPNA) for developing the Forouz B gas field in the Persian Gulf and generating electricity from the produced natural gas. In early 2015, IOOC acquired the \\"world’s largest oil tanker\\" with a capacity of 2.2 million barrels of crude oil. It is named \\"Persian Gulf\\".

Published by Digital Praise, it uses contemporary Christian music with gameplay akin to that of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band games, although it is only compatible with its own wired and cordless USB guitar controllers. A second guitar can be connected for two-player mode. The games can be played on a computer running Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X. While the game does not contain a mode for vocals, it does display the song's lyrics on-screen during the song. It also supports online leaderboards but the website is currently down. ==Development== Guitar Praise was developed in response to the popularity of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises, popular demand directly received by CEO Tom Bean via emails, and as a follow-up to Dance Praisea dance game focused on Contemporary Christian music which proved successful within its market. As with Dance Praise, Guitar Praise was designed to be a family-oriented game and provide a \\"positive experience\\" for all players. As a result of this mandate, its soundtrack consists of primarily Christian rock music with no offensive content, and the game additionally does not feature any animated avatars for playersas the company viewed the characters of Guitar Hero to be negative role models for its intended audience. However, some reviewers also attributed the lack of characters in the game as a result of the budgetary requirements modelling and animating 3D characters would require. ==Soundtrack== At launch, the game included 52 songs from 43 different artists. An expansion pack titled \\"Expansion Pack 1\\" added 25 new songs from various artists. Digital Praise later released a five-song downloadable pack that could only be purchased online. The final official expansion pack, Guitar Praise: Stryper, was created to celebrate Christian band Stryper's 25th anniversary. It featured 25 songs, all performed by Stryper: eleven from 7 Weeks: Live in America, 2003, nine from Murder by Pride, and five from Reborn. Expansion packs were manufactured on CD-ROM, but they are now out of print. Songs can still be downloaded online from Digital Praise. Unlike Guitar Hero and Rock Band games released as expansion packs, which are full games in and of themselves, the Guitar Praise expansion packs require the Guitar Praise game. == Reception == The game was generally well received in both Christian and non-Christian gaming reviews. Christian entertainment site ICE gave the game a 7 out of 10, summarizing their thoughts by calling Guitar Praise \\"[a] 'rock-solid' product that can stand up with the competition. While some of the problems were downers overall the game was quite fun.\\" However, they also noted that this style of game is better suited for console play, citing small text size and poor use of screen layout as major issues. \\"As a PC and Mac only title it is heavily limited by the nature of the beast.\\" It was also noted that Guitar Praise does not support any peripherals from any other music game, hindering the use of existing Guitar Hero controllers. PluggedIn Online, a website authored by the American evangelical organization Focus on the Family, concluded that \\"yes, Guitar Praise is indeed a Guitar Hero clone. Only this clone is better than the original.\\" Some non-Christian gaming outlets were also impressed with the game. Tracey John of MTV's Multiplayer blog wrote that the game \\"is no doubt a slick and surprisingly competent 'Guitar Hero' knock-off aimed at the game- playing Christian market,\\" and noted that the game stayed true to its market instead of attempting to re-invent the genre, and aside from songs making references to such themes, had little overtly religious imagery or tones.\\" U.S. Military site Stars and Stripes says that \\"Developer Digital Praise obviously has an idea that strikes a chord with Christian youth and a few tweaks would make this a popular item. Even as it is, it’s fun — just not as fun as the others.\\" Wired's Eliot Van Buskirk noted that while \\"there’s no way to battle the devil\\", he considered Guitar Praise an acceptable alternative to the Rock Band and Guitar Hero series for Christian families, even though it did not contain as much functionality and polish as other major music games (noting the lack of characters, and the lack of hammer-ons and pull-offs in songs, and its easier difficulty), and also noted that the game's wireless guitar peripheral did not have a sleep mode, which could drain the battery easily. The game exceeded sales expectations, according to icepowered.com. In response, Digital Praise has considered expanding the franchise to include support for full band gameplay, and has also actively considered the possibility of bringing the series to game consoles, however it has considered the idea a potential financial risk. ==See also== *Dance Praise *Christian video games ==References *Guitar Praise.com Official Website *Digital Praise Official Website Category:2008 video games Category:Christian video games Category:Guitar video games Category:MacOS games Category:Music video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games ","title":"Guitar Praise"},{"id":"19264381","text":"USS Richland is a name used more than once by the U.S. Navy: * , a cargo ship commissioned 22 April 1945 for service in World War II. * , a floating drydock commissioned as YFD-64 on 28 November 1944.

In order to keep the building from being turned into condominiums, the Logan Square Neighborhood Association (LSNA), a grass-roots community organization, organized neighbors, veteran Cooper workers, and the U.S. Green Building Council to form the Cooper Lamps Task Force. As Cooper began to lay off workers during the summer of 2005, the Task Force negotiated for severance benefits from the owners and applied for enhanced job-training from the city. With the support of 1st Ward Alderman Manuel Flores for a jobs-focused use for the plant, the building was sold to Baum Development, LLC, a triple bottom line commercial developer who agreed to pursue a use for the building that would create jobs.http://www.shelterforce.org/article/991/taking_the_leed_in_your_community/P1/ Baum Development worked with the Commission on Chicago Landmarks and the National Park Service to win landmark protection for the building.

The tower underwent significant rehabilitation in 2008 to restore the façade’s original architectural ornamentation. The building‘s conversion has been headed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture. The first and second floors have retail stores and showrooms while the third and fourth floors are for shared and individual office spaces. Additional tenant amenities include bike rooms, showers and environmentally friendly meeting and event space. The , four story building is U-shaped, divided into two wings separated by a courtyard. This layout allows natural light to penetrate from more than 600 windows that surround the building. The roof of the parking structure features a sky garden that is accessible from the second floor. Rain is collected in a 41,329-gallon cistern underneath the ground floor and used to irrigate plants and grass on the roof and the working organic garden at grade level. The building lowers utility costs in part due to a building envelope consisting of highly insulated walls and roofs combined with 600 high performance windows. The escalator slows down when no one is using it, thereby reducing energy usage by as much as 30 percent when compared to standard models. A sophisticated computerized Intelli-Building Automated Building Controls System with over five miles of wire and conduit controls the energy efficient HVAC mechanical system that allows for individualized control of tenant spaces and increased occupant comfort.

Working at a variety of jobs in the frontier town of Port Angeles, he quietly bought land at his proposed site of the dam. With a partner he founded the Olympic Power and Development Company to gather commitments from potential users for the power he would generate. Construction began in 1910 and the dam was completed in 1913. Its reservoir of Lake Aldwell was named after him. Later the Glines Canyon Dam was built several miles upriver by other private interests to generate more electricity for the northern Olympic Peninsula. ==Biography== Thomas Theobald Aldwell was born in Toronto, Ontario, in Canada on June 14, 1868 to a family of Scots ancestry. After completing local schools, he first trained as a banker but yearned for more. At the age of 22, he went to Port Angeles, Washington on the Olympic Peninsula in 1890 looking for adventure and opportunity. The lumbering industry was expanding in the region. For some time he worked a variety of jobs in the rough frontier town, while slowly buying bottom land along the Elwha River. He believed it was a prime location for a dam to generate power for the industries he was sure would be developed in Port Angeles and other towns along the coast. Aldwell acquired as a partner George Glines, a wealthy real estate man from Winnipeg.John Kendall, The Elwha Dams, Part I (historical series) — \\"Aldwell stakes a claim to build ‘opportunity'\\", The Peninsula News, 11 September 2011, accessed 9 March 2018 Trying to gain financing for the dam, Aldwell and Glines founded the Olympic Power and Development Company, in order to gain commitments from potential customers. They persuaded prominent men to join its board of directors, including R.D. Merrill, who owned Merrill & Ring, and Michael Earles, \\"a timber baron\\" who would own the “Big Mill” in Port Angeles. Aldwell appealed to local governments as well as United States military installations to gain their commitments as customers: the city of Port Angeles, Citizens Electric Co. of Port Townsend, nearby Army forts Worden and Flagler, and the Bremerton Navy Yard, located south on the Olympic Peninsula. They gained financing from a firm in Chicago, which insisted on choosing the engineering firm for the project. Aldwell said the experience taught him not to take on responsibility without control; the engineering firm failed to secure the dam to the bedrock below the river. There was a failure at the bottom of the dam that required expensive repairs before operations could start. ==References== Category:American civil engineers Category:1868 births Category:1954 deaths ","title":"Thomas Aldwell"},{"id":"19264475","text":"Civil service reform is a deliberate action to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, professionalism, representativity and democratic character of a civil service, with a view to promoting better delivery of public goods and services, with increased accountability. Such actions can include data gathering and analysis, organizational restructuring, improving human resource management and training, enhancing pay and benefits while assuring sustainability under overall fiscal constraints, and strengthening measures for performance management, public participation, transparency, and combating corruption. The academic literature on civil service reform has provided arguments and counterarguments clarifying how several approaches to reform affect the overall performance of the civil service. The increasing availability of empirical data allows to test the effectiveness of specific reforms in a given context. While designing effective civil service reforms is a tremendously complex task considering that the right mix of corruption control and performance improvements may vary greatly across and within countries, empirical as well as qualitative research can contribute to the body of evidence-based knowledge on civil service reforms in developing countries. == Approaches to civil service reform  The influence of Weberian bureaucracy === Max Weber's model of the ideal type of public administration has been an influential approach to civil service reforms in the 20th century. The bureaucratic type of administration contrasts with the patrimonial type in its underlying organizing principles. Weber’s organization of the public administration relies on a clearly defined hierarchical structure with a system of subordination and supervision, a division of labor and specified positions with assigned responsibilities. Contrary to the patrimonial system in which there is no distinction between private and public domains, the Weberian bureaucracy is defined by its impersonal and impartial character. Civil servants operate according to a set of rules and procedures they must observe. Impartiality is in part attained through the professionalization of the civil service and meritocratic recruitment through competitive examinations. For full-time and professionalized civil servants, public office-holding becomes a 'vocation'. Weberian ideal-typical principles have served as foundations for civil service reforms in developing countries. Scholars and policymakers have been interested in identifying the specific features that determine bureaucratic efficiency and corruption and the mechanisms through which these features increase effectiveness and restrict corrupt behaviour in the civil service. Empirical studies found that meritocratic recruitment of public officials in particular is associated with lower corruption levels. There are several ways in which meritocratic recruitment and promotion can restrict corrupt behaviour. To begin with, administering entry examinations and educational attainment requirements enable the selection of competent civil servants. As a matter of fact, a study by the IMF shows that better-educated civil servants are related to lower levels of corruption, better performance including better public finance management and higher tax revenue mobilization as well as higher economic growth. Furthermore, the internal promotion and career stability of merit- recruited civil servants create a sense of shared commitment to the 'vocation' of office-holding that establishes 'esprit de corps', making it harder for corruption to occur. Other evidence suggests that a professional merit-based civil service preempts corruption not necessarily through the selection of capable officials but rather through the appointment of civil servants whose interests differ from politicians'. Misaligned interests create a coordination problem which prevents corrupt practices and instead introduces a system of mutual monitoring. === Employment and pay reforms === During the 1980s, developing countries subject to structural adjustment programs (SAPs) experienced fiscal austerity notably manifested through pressures to reduce the public wage bill. R. Klitgaard raised concerns that falling civil service wages could exacerbate bureaucratic inefficiencies and corruption. Low public sector wages have been associated with lower performance and motivation. Salaries below opportunity cost can induce civil servants to opt for potentially harmful adaptive strategies and seek opportunities for own-account activities. Public officials may ask for compensation through informal or illegal means and these coping strategies compromise the efficiency and honesty of civil service organizations. Given these arguments, increasing public officials' wages and other employment benefits has been an important aspect of the civil service reform agenda in developing countries. Economic models based on the early work of Becker and Stigler have had a particular influence on the policy debate. Principal-agent models of corruption in the civil service provide a theoretical analysis of the relationship between public service pay and corruption. The shirking model (Shapiro-Stiglitz) is centred on the choice public officials who have the opportunity to be corrupt must make. These rational utility-maximizing agents decide to engage in morally hazardous behaviour based on a cost-benefit analysis equating the expected returns to corruption (bribes) to the costs of being corrupt (penalties, potential foregone future earnings). Corruption is detected with a certain probability and is punished by job loss or other penalties. The model predicts that, all else equal, higher wages can deter corruption by increasing the value of behaving honestly. However, when bribes are high and punishment and the probability of detection are low, substantial increases in public official's wages may be required to preempt bribery. Another model explaining bureaucratic corruption, the fair-wage model, makes a distinction between need-based and greed-based corruption. According to this theory, public officials are not necessarily driven by greed but find corruption tempting when their salaries do not allow to meet subsistence levels. 'Fairness' is also determined by other factors, such as the salaries of peers within the civil service, private sector wages, social expectations and the status of civil servants. The perception of not being paid a fair wage increases corruptibility and also reduces the moral costs of corruption. This model therefore suggests that even modest increases in salaries ensuring 'fair wages' can reduce civil servants' propensity to solicit and accept bribes. The theoretical linkage between public salary increases and corruption remains ambiguous. In a context of constrained government fiscal resources, the question of cost-effectiveness to design optimal wage policies arises. A cross-country study by Van Rijckeghem and Weder endeavours to find empirical support for the fair-wage and efficiency wage hypotheses. The authors conclude that relative government wages are negatively and significantly correlated with measures of corruption but that eradicating corruption would necessitate unrealistic increases in relative wages. These correlations, however, cannot be interpreted as evidence of a causal relationship going from public sector wages to corruption. Causality may run in the reverse direction, pervasive corruption has been shown to reduce tax revenue collection and public expenditures. Poor public finance performance and strong budgetary pressures due to corruption may in turn sustain low civil service salaries. This endogeneity problem complicates the understanding of the relationship between pay reforms and corruption. Klaus Abbink also tests the fair salary hypothesis in a laboratory experimental setting. The controlled environment in this experiment allows to isolate and identify the impact of 'fair income' considerations on corrupt behaviour. He finds that public officials in two treatments with different perceptions of 'fairness' behave similarly in a bribery game. In other words, high relative public officials salaries do not alter decisions to be corrupt through fairness considerations. These experimental results substantiate Van Rijckeghem and Weder's findings and cast doubt on the cost-effectiveness of increasing public salaries to combat corruption. Di Tella and Schargrodsky provide additional evidence with their micro-empirical analysis on wages and auditing during a crackdown on corruption in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1996-97. They argue that wage increases can be effective only when combined with intermediate levels of monitoring intensity (the probability of detection in the shirking model). They test their hypotheses using variations in audit intensity during the crackdown on corruption in public hospitals and find that procurement officers’ wages alone have no statistically significant effect on corruption but detect a negative relationship when wages are interacted with audit intensity. The authors make the case that higher wages and monitoring (“carrots and sticks”) should be used simultaneously to act as an effectual anti-corruption strategy. The literature on public officials' salaries and corruption offers mixed or inconclusive evidence and seems to indicate that pay increases is a necessary but insufficient condition for curbing corruption. Wage hikes could also have varying effects depending on whether reforms focus on base-salary (unconditional) increases or performance-related pay increases. === Decentralization === Following the dissatisfaction with centralized forms of governance, decentralization of public service provision to sub-national governments became a global trend, particularly in developing countries. Decentralization is the transfer of authority, resources and responsibilities from higher to lower levels of government. Scott and Rao distinguish three types of decentralization: *Administrative decentralization refers to the ability of local governments to hire, fire and set terms of reference for their own employees and on the human resource management and government organization framework. *Under Political or Democratic Decentralization, power is transferred to lower levels of government, public officials are elected by local citizens and are accountable to citizens rather than to the central government. *Fiscal Decentralization involves assigning responsibilities for expenditures and revenues to local governments. The degree of fiscal decentralization varies according to local governments' ability to raise revenues and the extent to which they are given autonomy in allocating their expenditures. Countries differ in their degree of administrative, political and fiscal decentralization. For instance, in China there is a devolution of administrative and fiscal responsibilities but no political decentralization whereas it is the opposite in India. There are several theoretical arguments supporting that decentralization can improve governance and reduce corruption. To begin with, decentralization is believed to bring the government closer to its citizens and to improve the allocation of resources at the local level. The optimal output level of a local public good (at which citizens' marginal benefit equals marginal cost of providing the good) varies across localities because of differences in preferences and costs. Considering that sub-national governments have better information about the preferences and circumstances of their constituencies, they can tailor the provision of public goods according to these preferences, thereby increasing efficiency and total welfare. This idea goes back to F. Hayek's argument in his essay \\"The Use of Knowledge in Society\\" (1945). Hayek asserts that since knowledge is decentralized (\\"the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place\\"), it follows that decisions and control over resources should be decentralized (a necessary although not sufficient condition for achieving optimal allocation). However, principal-agent models demonstrate there can be tradeoffs in transferring decision-making responsibilities. Under these theoretical frameworks, central public officials are assumed to be public- spirited principals and local officials act as self-interested agents. On the one hand, public good delivery can be better adapted to local needs but on the other hand, the decisions are made by agents whose interests differ from the principal. Delegating authority can result in 'control loss' or 'abuse of power'. Decentralization can be more effective than centralized decision- making if the gains from adaptability can outweigh the control loss. The overall effects of decentralization on governance and welfare will therefore depend on the degree to which the principal's and agent's interests are opposed and the principal's ability to exert control over the agent's actions. It has also been argued that decentralization can enhance accountability in the service delivery mechanism. Local governments' proximity makes it more feasible for citizens to monitor and hold public officials accountable. The accountability mechanisms work through political decentralization. In a functional local democracy, local elections constitute an 'incomplete contract' enabling citizens to remove non-performing local officials from office. However, as Bardhan and Mookherjee argue, local democracy may not operate effectively in practice in developing countries and may be captured by local elites. Furthermore, decentralization can reduce corruption by creating horizontal competition between local governments. Tiebout make the case in a 1956 paper that residents' and factors of production's mobility across localities can reduce the monopoly power exercised by local public officials with respect to regulations and bribes. Fiscal and political decentralization encourages inter-jurisdictional competition that pressures sub-national governments to efficiently deliver local public goods. If citizens are dissatisfied with their local government's performance, they can move to other regions, thereby decreasing tax revenues in less efficient jurisdictions. A similar argument concerning the relationship between a decentralized bureaucratic structure and bribe payments has been explored in the academic literature. Rose-Ackerman suggests that a decentralized civil service can reduce bribery since competition between public officials would bid down bribe payments. Vishny and Shleifer further develop this argument, they build a model where citizens and businesses require more than one service or good from several public officials. If government services are substitutes, then the competitive regime still applies. However, when government services are complementary and in the case of a decentralized bureaucratic structure, firms or citizens are facing several independent bureaucrats. Decentralization might therefore lead to a lack of coordination among bribe-seeking bureaucrats and a \\"Tragedy of the Commons\\" outcome where public officials ask bribe payments that are too high, thereby increasing the burden that corruption imposes on firms and citizens. Diaby and Sylwester empirically test these hypotheses in a cross-country regression and find that bribe payments are higher under a more decentralized bureaucratic structure. Yet Fisman and Gatti detect a strong negative correlation between fiscal decentralization (as measured by subnational share of total government spending) and corruption. Treisman (2000) examines correlations between eight different measures of decentralization with various measures of corruption and service delivery performance. The same measure of fiscal decentralization used by Fisman and Gatti appears not to be significantly correlated with corruption measures. Decentralization is a complex process which manifests itself in various forms. The design and impetus for decentralization are specific to each country, which complicates comparisons of a single conception of decentralization. The literature on decentralization experiences in several developing countries suggests the effects of decentralization on public sector performance and corruption are likely to be ambiguous and highly context-specific. The empirical work appears to be inconclusive as various types of decentralization were examined using different measures. What's more, measuring corruption as bribery without paying attention to special interest capture may provide an inaccurate assessment of the impact of decentralization. As Bardhan and Mookherjee argue, bribery may decrease while being replaced by local elite capture as a result of decentralization. Treisman purports that the theoretical and empirical arguments about decentralization and governance refer to specific types of decentralization. He identifies five types: structural, decision, resource, electoral and institutional decentralization and develops arguments clarifying how each type affects the quality of government. While some types of decentralization can improve governance and reduce corruption, others can undermine government performance, this can in part explain the mixed empirical evidence on the effects of decentralization. === Top-down performance monitoring === Rather than structuring rewards and penalties for corrupt behaviour, another approach to civil service reform seeks to increase the probability that corrupt activity will be observed. Theoretically, monitoring can reduce information asymmetries so that the principal can induce the agent to choose the optimal level of effort and the optimal degree of corrupt activity. As the agent compares his expected payoff of being honest to that of being corrupt, increasing the probability of getting caught and punished will deter corrupt behaviour. Civil service auditing by the principal or third parties serves an accountability function. The inherent conflict of interest as well as the lack of oversight require independent third parties to certify the reliability of financial reporting, performance results and compliance to rules. Auditors can help exercise oversight by evaluating the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the delivery of government services. These audits must rely on efficiency measures and pre- determined criteria and benchmarks to assess public servant's performance and the impact of government's programs. Performance auditing can also help detect corruption in public entities. Audits highlight irregularities and areas of inefficiencies that may indicate the existence of corruption. Based on suspicious circumstances, auditors can identify illegal behaviour and collect evidence on misdeeds which can subsequently be used to prosecute public servants at fault. As previously mentioned, successful detection efforts by performance auditing can have a deterrent effect on corrupt activities. Auditing and prosecution were important elements in Justice Plana's campaign to curb corruption in the Bureau of Internal Revenue in the Philippines. Appointed as the new Commissioner of the corrupt Bureau of Internal Revenue, Justice Plana's anti-corruption strategy focused on implementing a new performance evaluation system, gathering information on corruption through intelligence agents and audits and effectively prosecuting corrupt tax officers. While Justice Plana's campaign was a multi-faceted approach, the higher monitoring intensity combined with a highly credible threat of punishment were particularly successful in deterring corrupt behaviour in the Bureau of Internal Revenue. According to Professor Magtolis-Briones, the threat of being detected and prosecuted decidedly lead officials to reconsider their decisions to engage in corrupt activities. In Georgia, the success of anti-corruption reforms especially relied on top-down monitoring and prosecution but Schueth warns about the potential abuses of monitoring when fighting corruption. The crackdown on corruption in the tax agency involved coercion such as the use of extra-legal surveillance systems to ensure public officials' observance of the new procedural codes. Laboratory experiments provide evidence on the impact monitoring. In a controlled bribery experiment in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, Armantier and Boly observed that monitoring and punishment can be an effective anti-corruption policy. The researchers had two treatments, low monitoring and high monitoring. While the 'low monitoring' treatment proved effective in curbing bribery, they could not detect significant treatment effects on bribery in the 'high monitoring' treatment. The authors suggest that high monitoring intensity can crowd out intrinsic motivations to behave honestly. Serra compare the effectiveness of top-down and bottom-up monitoring in a laboratory bribery game between public officials and private citizens. The experimental results suggest that top-down auditing is ineffective in deterring bribery, this may be especially true in weak institutional environments. However, the researcher found that combining formal top-down auditing and bottom-up monitoring created an accountability mechanism that was effective in curbing corruption. === Bottom-up Monitoring and reforms === An alternative approach to improving governance and combating corruption that has gained prominence in recent years is encouraging grassroots participation by community members in local monitoring to induce bottom-up pressures for reform. The 2004 World Development Report: Making Services Work for Poor People is centred on this grassroots approach to development. Community participation is now considered an important component of reforms aiming to improve public service delivery and corruption at the local level. Bottom-up models of governance involve community members participating in the service provision process by allowing them to monitor public officials, to have a say in policymaking, and keep service providers accountable to incentivize them to deliver public goods and services efficiently. J. Stiglitz argues that community members, as beneficiaries of public goods and services, will have more incentives to monitor and ensure that governments programs are successful compared to indifferent central bureaucrats. In particular, project involving local citizens will be more likely to succeed since community participation helps sustain efforts towards the long-term continuation of projects necessary to keep them effective. Nevertheless, B. Olken contends that grassroots monitoring for public goods and services may be impaired by a free-rider problem and suggests that government provision of private goods (subsidized food or health care) may generate more incentives to monitor service provision as each community member has a personal interest in securing the effective delivery of goods and in minimizing extortion by public officials. Stiglitz indeed recognizes that grassroots monitoring of public good delivery is in itself a public good and that as such, it is under-provided. A bottom-up project, the Citizen Report Card (CRC), pioneered by the NGO Public Affairs Center (PAC) was implemented in 1993 in Bangalore, India. This project aimed at gathering local citizens' feedback on civil service performance and publicizing the results through the media, thereby exerting public pressures for the public service to improve its performance and launch reforms. In 1993, the report cards revealed low levels of citizens' satisfaction with service providers, and the expectation was that report cards would serve as an accountability mechanism that would bring forward issues of service provision quality and corruption levels in the public service. While this initiative did raise awareness on such issues, there was some but not dramatic improvement in service delivery quality between 1994 and 1999. However, the difficulty of measuring improvements in service quality other than through subjective measures restricts opportunities to rigorously evaluate this bottom-up initiative. Participatory Budgeting in Porto Alegre, Brazil is known among scholars and policymakers as an enduring example of bottom-up reforms. Participatory budgeting allows citizens to voice their demands regarding service delivery improvements, and through negotiations to influence budget funds allocation at the municipality level. This project was initiated in 1989, and is said to have improved access to and the quality of public service provision, especially for lower segments of society. For instance, 27,000 new public housing units were created in 1989 (compared to only 1,700 in 1986), the number of schools quadrupled between 1986 and 1997 while the share of Porto Alegre's budget going to education and health went from 13% in 1985 to about 40% in 1996. Participatory budgeting still has to address some limitations, including lack of representation of the poorest, but its success has led other municipalities in Brazil and public entities in other countries to adopt this initiative. == Evidence on reform effectiveness in developing countries  Pay reforms experiences ===  Base salary increases for police officers in Ghana  In 2010, the Ghanaian government implemented a civil service salary reform, the Single Spine Salary Structure (SSSS) to mitigate pay disparities in the public service. Police officers were the first beneficiaries of this new salary structure as the police service has historically been the least well-paid of public services in Ghana. Their wages unilaterally doubled in an attempt to increase their living standards to reduce bribery (fair-wage hypothesis). Foltz and Opoku-Agyemang assess the impact of this salary reform using a difference-in-difference analysis taking advantage of the exogenous change induced by the policy. While police officers' wages doubled, the salaries of other civil servants in Ghana and police officers in Burkina Faso stayed the same. The researchers identified two groups, the Ghanaian policemen who received the treatment (higher wages) and the control group consisting of other civil servants (Ghanaian custom officers and Burkinabé policemen) whose wages did not increase. Using data on bribes paid from 2,100 truck trips between Ghana and Burkina Faso, Foltz and Opoku-Agyemang can observe the differences in interactions with truck drivers between the treated and the control group before the salary reform (2006-2010) and after the salary reform (2010-2012). If we assume group differences would have stayed constant in the absence of the reform (parallel trend assumption), the difference-in-difference coefficient estimate measures the causal impact of the salary increase on Ghanaian police officers' propensity to ask for bribes. The results suggest that the salary reform counterintuively increased police officers' efforts to extort bribes, the value of the bribes and the total amount truck drivers had to pay on the road. This evidence goes against theoretical arguments on pay reforms in the civil service. Foltz and Opoku-Agyemang posit that these results could be due to the lack of enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Without changing the environment and other incentives facing civil servants, it appears that increasing wages may not have the predicted effects on corruption.  Pay for performance reforms for tax collectors in Pakistan  Corruption in tax administration has particularly detrimental effects on tax revenue collection, fiscal balance and overall economic performance. Khan, Khwaja and Olken implemented a large-scale randomized experiment in Punjab, Pakistan to assess the impact of performance-based payment schemes for tax collectors. In collaboration with the Punjab provincial government, they randomly allocated tax officials in the provincial urban property tax department into four groups, a control group and three treatment groups corresponding to different pay-for-performance designs. The three treatment groups differed in the degree to which tax officers' pay was based on revenue collection performance and on other subjective evaluations from taxpayers and the tax department. The 'Revenue' treatment provided incentives depending only on revenue collection exceeding a benchmark while the 'Revenue Plus' scheme tied salaries to tax collection performance as well as accuracy of tax assessment and taxpayers' satisfaction. The last treatment 'Flexible Plus' added several criteria set by the tax department to determine wages. After two fiscal years, Khan, Khwaja and Olken found that across the three treatment groups, tax revenues increased by 9 log points on average which is equivalent to 46% higher growth of revenues compared to the control group. The 'Revenue' scheme was the most effective in increasing tax collection but the researchers found no effects on accuracy of tax assessment or the satisfaction of taxpayers. They note that pay-for-performance schemes may have tradeoffs: giving excessive incentives to tax officers might increase their bargaining power with taxpayers and lead to more extortion and taxpayers' dissatisfaction. However, Khan, Khwaja and Olken point out that the benefits of pay-for-performance contracts outweigh their costs and suggest they can effective in increasing tax revenue collection. === Monitoring reforms ===  Random audits in Brazilian municipalities  In 2003, the federal government of Brazil created the Controladoria Geral da União (CGU) charged with corruption prevention and internal control. The CGU launched an anti- corruption program, Programa de Fiscalização por Sorteios Públicos (Monitoring Program with Public Lotteries), which consists in randomly selecting municipalities for audits and publicly disseminating the findings. As of 2015, 12 years after the beginning of the reform, there have been 2,241 audits in 1,949 municipalities. Researchers Avis, Ferraz and Finan exploited the random selection to measure the impact of this anti-corruption program. While some municipalities had been audited several times in the past (treatment group), others were being audited for the first time (control group). Since the municipalities were randomly selected, comparing corruption levels among municipalities in the control and treatment group can provide causal estimates of the effects of the reform. Based on audit reports, they estimate that 30% of the federal funds transferred to municipalities were stolen. However, they find that corruption levels were 8% lower in municipalities that had previously undergone government audits, thereby suggesting that random audits can be an effective policy against corruption. The researchers posit that random audits can reduce corruption by increasing public officials' perceived probability of being detected. They observed that audits also generated spillover effects, neighbouring municipalities were also affected, having an additional neighbour audited decreased their corruption levels by 7.5%. The local media played a role in disseminating information about other municipalities' audit outcomes. Avis et al. identify several mechanisms through which the audits led to lower local corruption. First, the new program introduce a system of political accountability whereby local citizens can punish dishonest incumbents or reward those who are honest. Audits may have also altered the types of candidates who enter into politics. What's more, negative audit results can generate reputational costs and potential legal punishments.  Monitoring a road building project in Indonesia  The Kecamatan Development Project (KDP) is an Indonesian government program, financed by the World Bank which funds village-level small-scale infrastructure programs. Benjamin Olken implemented a randomized experiment in which he randomly assigned 608 villages into groups with different audit probabilities prior to the start of a nationwide infrastructure project. A random sample of villages were informed that the project would be audited by an audit agency once completed. This increased the probability of detection from 4% to 100%. The audit results were publicly disseminated by the auditors during village meetings. Olken also designed experiments to increase local members' participation in 'accountability meetings' where officials in charge of the road-building project expose how the budget will be spent. To assess the impact of both monitoring mechanisms, the researcher uses a quantitative measure of corruption levels based on engineers' assessment of the quantity of materials used to build the roads and estimated costs. The discrepancies between project’s official costs reported by village project leaders and the costs estimated by independent engineers measures missing expenditures which are used as a proxy for corruption in Olken's study. It was estimated that on average 24% of materials were missing based on road samples, suggesting that part of the project funds were diverted. Olken finds that increasing the probability of external audits significantly reduced missing expenditures (by 8%), and that this approach to fighting corruption is cost-effective. Top-down audits were more effective when village elections were close, which implies that local level accountability can be effective in restraining corrupt behaviour. However, the interventions to increase grassroots participation did not have any significant effects on missing funds. == Challenges and barriers to effective civil service reforms == Political economy dynamics condition the success of civil service reforms. North et al. argue that some developing countries function as 'limited access orders' in which elites exclude broad cross-sections of society to maintain an equilibrium that enables them to extracts rents. In such an equilibrium, political elites have no incentives to break down their patronage networks and introduce meritocratic recruitment reforms in the civil service as it would threaten their position and reduce their opportunities for rent-seeking. The clientelist system on the contrary can be a powerful mechanism through which elites maintain this 'limited access order'. Considerably depending on clientelist and patronage networks increases the costs of implementing public sector reforms. Elites will therefore be likely to oppose reforms as they stand to lose the most. What's more, civil service reforms are costly to implement in the short-term while their benefits will be manifested and reaped in the future. Governments are thus unwilling to make such unappealing investment. The long-term nature of reforms and the reluctance to initiate, gather and maintain support for reforms prevent their implementation in the first place. In a background paper for the 2011 World Bank Development Report, de Weijer and Pritchett appraise that it would take about 20 years to witness improvements in the functional capability of the state. In almost every countries, this exceeds the average duration of a term of office, political incumbents would have no incentives to incur the costs to carry out reforms while the benefits will accrue to future incumbents. In addition, bureaucratic inertia and resistance to change should not be overlooked. Bureaucrats may be disinclined to accept changes brought by civil service reforms. This is especially true in countries where bureaucrats depend on informal or illegal channels to complement their meager salaries. Institutional structures or types of political regimes also matter for reform implementation and success. In a democratic regime, political incumbents may see it in their interests to initiate bureaucratic reforms if voters value and acknowledge the public benefits of reforms. However, demand for civil service reforms remains weak in developing countries. Even if bureaucratic corruption is condemned across countries, the internal demand for anti-corruption reforms is undermined by a collective action problem. Indeed, Persson, Rohstein and Teorell argue that civil service reforms have failed as a result of their mischaracterization of corruption. Most approaches to civil service reform rely on principal-agent frameworks that assume that 'principled principals' are public-spirited and will always take on the task to fight corruption and improve bureaucratic performance. However, the authors contend that, in contexts where corruption is pervasive, actors will not necessarily respond to incentives aiming at altering their behaviour but instead behave based on the extent to which corruption is the expected behaviour in society. == Sources for further research  Overview === *Rao, S. 2013.

Information includes: * Utility bills (such as electricity, gas, and heating oil) * Telecommunications bills (such as landlines and mobile telephones) * Rental payments * Electronic payments (remittances, withdrawals, transfers, etc.) * Social media activity * Psychometric data * Telco data * Smartphone device metadata ==Alternative data for credit in North AmericaUnited States=== In the United States, credit files include negative information, such as delinquencies as well as positive information, such as repayment of debts. Still, an estimated 35 to 54 million Americans have insufficient credit information to qualify for mainstream credit. If immigrants in the United States are included, that number exceeds 70 million. Access to credit is thus a Catch-22 for many poor Americans—one needs credit to get credit. Research suggests that the inclusion of alternative data in credit files could bring many of these individuals into the credit fold.Give Credit Where Credit Is Due That is, non-financial positive payment information, such as rents or utility payments, may give credit agencies enough information to rate previously unscorable individuals known as the unbanked. These newly scored individuals have risk profiles similar to those already in the mainstream credit system.You Score, You Win Furthermore, loans become smarter. Including alternative data has little effect on the credit mainstream, those already scorable in the current system. Furthermore, this increase in data decreases the number of bad loans Experian purchased RentBureau in June 2010, which houses rental payment histories on over 7 million US residents, this data will now be included in consumer credit reports as of January 2011. This will benefit those that overlap with the 50 million US underbanked consumers. The danger with this, is that it will provide a further variable to damage credit scores of those that do not for example manage their rental payments on time in addition to their other credit arrangements Experian Credit Reports Include Rental Data Current use of alternative data Since the financial crisis of late 2008, many Americans have struggled with the negative change to their credit score. Reduced credit lines resulting in a new group of consumers in need of liquidity forced this growing consumer segment to seek alternative financial services providers. Businesses relying on traditional credit reports to make credit decisions have had limited to no visibility on the new credit usage behaviors of this growing portion because alternative data is not information that the traditional bureaus capture or tend to report. Utilities and telecoms firms in several states have started reporting their data to CRAs. PRBC, a consumer credit reporting agency based in Kennesaw, Georgia, allows consumers to self-enroll and build a positive credit file based on their timely payments for bills such as rent, utilities, cable, telephone, and insurance that are not automatically reported to the other bureaus. TransUnion, First American CredCo, and LexisNexis have all recently released products involving alternative data. Concerns about the use of alternative data in credit files Some concerns about the use of alternative data have been raised over the long-term consequences of fully reporting utility and telecom payments to credit rating agencies.Margot Saunders, Testimony before Congress, 1 Mar 2006 There are concerns that state and local incentives to not pay bills on time (for example, some states provide heating oil subsidies if payments are missed) may cause deterioration in credit scores over time. There is also concern that people who open accounts with only alternative data will become over-extended. Recent research shows, however, that the inclusion of alternative data does not degrade credit scores over a one-year period.Turner, Michael A, Alyssa Lee, et al. You Score You Win, Political and Economic Research Council, p 17, Chart 2. ==Alternative data for credit worldwide== Fully reported non- financial payment data has been included in consumer credit reports in many countries around the world including the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Australia, China, Mexico, and Colombia to name a few. Indeed, Colombia has used this data successfully for more than 40 years. Recently, the World Bank issued a global credit information sharing standard that included a section on alternative data. The World Bank steadfastly endorses the use of fully reported non-financial payment data in credit origination processes and considers it a powerful tool for driving financial inclusion in emerging markets. More recently, in the Financial Inclusion 2020 Roadmap, Accion highlighted the great value of alternative data as an instrument to increase financial inclusion and help achieve their FI2020 objectives. In low-income nations, alternative data is often the only type of data available for credit scoring. The population is often not formally employed, lacks a credit history, cannot fulfill loan application requirements, and has insufficient capital. Even when these requirements are fulfilled, lending institutions often have very little experience with clients’ economic activity leading to untailored loan products. Electronically-available alternative data, such as social media activity, bill payments, mobile telephone bills and metadata, rental payments, and electronic transaction data, could be used to score these individuals and enter millions in low-income countries into a more modern credit ratings system. An especially promising option is the full reporting of trade credit data, such as records from cash and carry warehouses.Turner, Michael, Robin Varghese, et al.

While the Elwha Dam was in operation, Indian Creek sustained populations of kokanee sockeye salmon, which spawned in Lake Sutherland and migrated to Lake Aldwell to use as their ocean. It also contained stream resident coastal rainbow trout, coastal cutthroat trout, and introduced eastern brook trout.

Byham (born September 14, 1936) is an American entrepreneur, author and industrial/organizational psychologist. ==Overview== Byham, co-founder (with Dr. Douglas Bray), Chairman and CEO of Development Dimensions International (DDI) is an Industrial/Organization Psychologist who has developed many significant human resource technologies over the course of his career.http://www.ddiworld.com/company/ddi-history-founders These innovations include the assessment center method, behavior-based interviewing, the use of behavior-modeling in supervisor and management training, behavioral job analysis methodology as the basis for selection and training programs, and Acceleration Pools to select and rapidly develop people for high-level leadership positions. These technologies have been described in 23 books and more than 300 monographs and articles. In addition, he has appeared on numerous radio and TV programs through the world.http://www.ddiworld.com/company/our-management-team/william-byham Byham earned a Ph.D. in Industrial Organizational Psychology from Purdue University where he also received an honorary doctorate degree in Social Sciences.http://www.purdue.edu/uns/x/2007a/070502VrugginkHondoc.html He earned a M.S. and B.S. from Ohio University. Byham founded DDI in the basement of his home in 1970. The human resources consulting firm has since grown into an international organization with 42 offices in 26 countries. Byham authored the book Zapp! The Lighting of Empowerment,https://www.amazon.com/Zapp-The- Lightning-Empowerment-Productivity/dp/0449002829 Zapp! The Lighting of Empowerment which has sold more than 4.5 million copies and was named the best business book of the decade by Schwartz Books. ==Innovation== Assessment Centers for Business Applications For the last 40 years, Byham has been an advocate for the Assessment Center Method and has helped assessment centers become a widely used management practice worldwide. In an assessment center, individuals go through simulations that mirror the challenges they would face in a higher level job. Their behavior in the simulations is observed relative to competencies associated through research with job success. Before Bray applied the Assessment Center Method to business at AT&T;, it was used in the British Army and the Office of Strategic Services (predecessor to the CIA). Byham was manager of selection, appraisal, and general management development for J. C. Penney, where with Bray's help he implemented the first Assessment Centers in a retail environment. Byham wrote the first general business article (“Assessment Centers for Spotting Future Managers”) about the Assessment Center Method in the Harvard Business Review, generating interest in the methodology.https://www.ddiworld.com/DDIWorld/media/white- papers/AssessmentCenterMethods_mg_ddi.pdf?ext=.pdf In 1970, Bray and Byham formed DDI to introduce the method to businesses throughout the world. In 1972, Byham founded the International Congress on the Assessment Center Method and has been active in its leadership ever since. Each year more than 200 practitioners from around the world meet to share research findings and practical knowledge. Byham's books, Assessment Centers and Managerial Performance (co-authored with George Thornton)https://www.amazon.com/Assessment-Managerial-Performance- Organizational-Occupational/dp/0126906203 and Applying the Assessment Center Method (co-edited with Joseph Moses),https://www.amazon.com/Applying- Assessment-Center-General- Psychology/dp/0080195814/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1439572863&sr;=1-1&keywords;=Applying+the+Assessment+Center+Method are still standard references. Behavior-based Interviewing In addition to his work with assessment centers, Byham developed a new way to conduct hiring interviews. This method markedly improved the validity of selection decisions. Generically known as behavioral interviewing, DDI named the methodology Targeted Selection in 1975. Millions of managers have been trained in Targeted Selection and it has been adopted by 3,000 organizations around the world.http://www.ddiworld.com/products/targeted-selection Inc. Magazine said “What Tom Peters is to excellence and Jim Collins is to leadership, Bill Byham might very well be to hiring.”http://www.inc.com/magazine/20030301/25209.html Behavioral Modeling Byham's assessment centers proved the potential of behavioral modeling as a new way to teach supervisors and managers to be leaders. Trainees who went through a behavioral modeling program did much better in assessment centers. Created by Mel Sorcher and Arnold Goldstein, behavior modeling approached supervisor and management training as skill development, rather than an effort to provide cognitive understanding of why people behave as they do. The common methodology at that time was lectures. With Jim Robinson, a training manager from Agway, Byham developed the first commercial behavior modeling training system, called Interaction Management. Every year, more than one million people are trained using this methodology. ==Publications== Byham has a wide repertoire of publications ranging from how to be an effective Industrial Organizational Psychologist to teams to assessment centers to interviewing.https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search- alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords;=bill+byham Byham is the author of 23 books including Zapp!, which helps managers understand how to empower employees and improve productivity. Byham co-authored three books on teams, two books on the Assessment Center Method, and a book to guide individuals and managers in Japanese companies in their relationships to Western workers.

Director  Frederick Krantz - ! Research Chairman  Baruch Cohen - ! Board Chairman  Jack Kincler - ! Founded  1988 - ! Website  } The Canadian Institute for Jewish Research (CIJR) is a non-profit, independent, internationally- recognized academic think-tank based in Montreal and Toronto. Its research is devoted mainly to data and analysis of Israel, the Middle East, and Jewish issues for students, media, and university campuses, and to the Jewish and non-Jewish communities of Canada and the rest of the world. CIJR was created by Professor Frederick Krantz, the institute's Director, in 1988, to strengthen public understanding of Jewish Israel as a progressive, democratic society in its Middle Eastern context. CIJR manages a database of news and opinions, hosts seminars and colloquia with academics, and publishes materials. == Creation and early years == Concerned by the sudden anti-Israel media of the first Palestinian Arab intifada, a small group of Montrealers began meeting at the home of Professors Frederick (intellectual history) and Lenore (art history) Krantz. The media's perspective of the conflict began reflecting a Palestinian inversion – Israel as Goliath, the Palestinians as David – paralyzing the organized Jewish community. The group began responding to the newspapers, radio, and TV stations, and eventually, received invitations to speak at community events to counter the anti-Israel wave.Frederick Krantz, \\"Celebrating CIJR—Bis Zu [Hundert Un] Zwanzig!\\" ISRAFAX, August 27, 2008, 2. Following the proposed, secret Arab-Jewish \\"dialogue\\" conference in Montebello, Quebec, the Canadian Jewish News published a letter by Baruch Cohen, a Romanian Holocaust survivor, on August 4, 1988 in support of Prof. Krantz's position against appeasement. Krantz, noticing the letter, contacted Cohen to join his group. Today, Baruch Cohen is CIJR's Research Chair.Mike Cohen, \\"Canadian Institute for Jewish Research to mark 20th anniversary,\\" , The Jewish Tribune, August 20, 2008. Without endowments from Montreal's or Canada's organized Jewish communities and functioning year-to-year on fundraisers, CIJR operates a small office that produces online and print publications, manages a database, offers academic programming for college students, and sustains annual speakers' programs.Janice Arnold, \\"Institute celebrates 20 years of defending Israel,\\", Canadian Jewish News, August 21, 2008. == Mission == \\"The Canadian Institute for Jewish Research's purpose is to strengthen public and student understanding of Jewish Israel as a unique democratic society in its difficult Middle Eastern context, and of key Jewish-world issues in general. The Institute is staffed by respected, academic Fellows, and aims to bring objective data and analysis of Israel, Middle East and Jewish-related issues to students and university campuses, Jewish and non-Jewish, and to the media and government.\\" == The Institute's seminars, colloquia, and activities == The Institute's Insider Briefing seminars and Community Colloquia feature its own and other experts on Israel, the Middle East, Jews, and Jewish world issues. Speakers have included journalist and political analyst Yossi Klein Halevi; Palestinian Media Watch Director, former Canadian MP Stockwell Day, Itamar Marcus; Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations, Dan Gillerman; Commentary magazine founder and editor-at-large, Norman Podhoretz, former Canadian Minister of Justice and human-rights leader the Hon. Irwin Cotler, terrorism expert Steven Emerson, former Israeli IDF Chief of Staff, General Moshe Ya'alon; former CIA Director James Woolsey, Israel's former Ambassador to Canada Alan Baker; and Jewish Diaspora leader and The Jerusalem Post columnist Isi Leiber. == Student programs == In 2007, CIJR launched the Student Israel- Advocacy Seminars Program, a year-long training initiative to counter worsening on-campus anti-Israelism and anti-Zionism. CIJR is active in engaging with students and supports student-written/edited Dateline: Middle East. The Institute's Israel Learning Seminar (ILS) is a year-long training initiative focused on students but also open to the public. Given by CIJR Academic Fellows, it is designed to counter anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism on campus and in the media. CIJR also offered the Baruch Cohen Student Research Internships during the summer and academic year. == Notable mentions == \\"Since 1988, the CIJR has supported an independent analysis of Israeli and Middle East regional issues. Its publications and activities continue to be trusted source of news and perspective on the State of Israel, its achievements and the challenges it faces in an unstable part of the world\\". -Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister, Liberal Party of Canada. \\"CIJR combats anti-Israel bias and presents a clearer picture of the challenges Israel faces in this all too troubled region. I thank you for your important efforts over the years to strengthen understanding for Israel and Canada.\\" -Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, Likud Party, State of Israel. \\"The vital work being done by CIJR … is in fact, far more effective than most of the efforts carried out by other organizations within the Jewish community.\\" -Alan Baker, Former Ambassador of Israel to Canada. == Frederick Krantz Education=== Professor Frederick Krantz is a history professor at Concordia University's Liberal Arts College. Achieving his B.A. History from Columbia College in 1961, Professor Krantz then received a Ph.D. in Early Modern European Intellectual History from Cornell University in 1971.

In Montreal, Baruch worked as a financial officer. When he retired, he enrolled in graduate school to pursue a Master's degree in Jewish Studies at Concordia University. He now serves as a full-time volunteer Research Chair at CIJR, which he helped to create. He has conducted research, written, and mentored student interns. Baruch is also an active volunteer with the Montreal Holocaust Memorial Centre, where he has served as a docent and speaker. Twenty years ago, he spearheaded and launched the first Montreal Holocaust Commemoration in memory of Jews murdered in Romania and Transnistria, which has since become an annual event. == ISRAFAX == ISRAFAX is the institute's quarterly research print publication. It provides CIJR members with data and a digest of international analysis and opinion on issues, mixing original content with articles from newspapers, magazines, scholarly journals, official documents, and websites from around the world. The Israeli and Arab media are also scanned for reports, opinions, and other documents. The magazine is distributed internationally. == Middle East and Jewish world databank == The DataBank, an archive of Israel, Middle East, and other materials related to the Jewish world, is accessible on CIJR's website, with entries on issues ranging from Israeli society and regional politics to international Jewish communities, human rights, and the Holocaust.Janice Arnold, \\"CIJR's archives to go online August 18,\\" Canadian Jewish News, August 4, 2005. == Dateline: Middle East == Published by the Student Coalition for a Just Peace in the Middle East, Dateline: Middle East, a journal on Israel, the Middle East and Jewish-world, is made possible by the support of the Canadian Institute for Jewish Research.QMBN Appearing several times per year on university and college campuses, it is distributed across Canada, Israel and the United States. From an academic perspective, Dateline examines the Middle East and covers issues related to the politics, economics, and cultures of the region. ==Daily Isranet Briefing== As of autumn 2000, CIJR began sending Daily Isranet Briefings via email and fax to counter anti-Israel propaganda, and to keep readers informed of daily issues affecting the Jewish people.

It was a mirror of the Court of King's Bench in England. The King's Bench was one of the \\"Four Courts\\" which sat in the building in Dublin still known as \\"The Four Courts\\". The Four Courts, present day == Origins == According to Elrington Ball,Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221–1921 John Murray London 1926 the Courollalled the King's Bench can be identified as early as 1290. It was fully operational by 1324, headed by the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, who was assisted by at least one associate justice, although for brief periods he was forced to sit alone due to the lack of a suitably qualified colleague. == Role == The King's Bench was the principal court of criminal jurisdiction and civil jurisdiction, and its Chief Justice was the most senior judge in Ireland after the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Its workload was more onerous than that of the Court of Exchequer and the Court of Common Pleas, and there was a tradition that its judges must be of higher calibre than those of the other common law courts.Ball Judges in Ireland In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the Crown expressed a strong preference for appointing English-born judges, especially to the office of Chief Justice.Ball Judges in Ireland From the beginning of the eighteenth century however no objection was made to the appointment of Irish-born judges. ==Abolition== The Court of Queen's Bench was abolished in 1878 by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877. The Court's jurisdiction passed to a new High Court of Justice. The High Court was itself abolished by Section 40 of the Government of Ireland Act 1920. That section created a High Court in Northern Ireland, which still contains a Queen's Bench Division, with similar jurisdiction to its counterpart in England and Wales.

He made frequent public appearances promoting mutual understanding among those with and without physical disability. Following appearances on the Animal Planet television network, he was popularly dubbed Wheely Willy. ==Background== Willy was found abandoned in a cardboard box with spinal injuries and a cut throat. Taken in by a veterinary hospital and treated, Willy stayed there for a year unadopted. Learning that the dog would be euthanised if not adopted, pet groomer Deborah Turner decided to bring him home. Initially, the two pound (one kilogram) Willy needed to be carried everywhere, but Turner made several attempts to allow the dog to move autonomously. She tried attaching large helium-filled balloons to the dog's hindquarters and then placing him on a skateboard, with little success. Ultimately, an advertisement for K-9 Carts, a type of wheelchair designed for canine applications, came to her attention. Willy adapted to this mode of transportation in short order; curiosity from Turner's customers and acquaintances led to local news coverage and steadily increased to international notability. Willy made visits internationally, most often to hospitals, but he also participated in such events as the Cystic Fibrosis Fun Walk and the Los Angeles Marathon. He made several appearances on television talk shows and news programs. The dog's tenacity and good nature are frequently cited as an inspiration by people who have encountered him. Wheely Willy died on December 22, 2009. He and his owner had both sustained injuries when the owner slipped on a porch made wet and slick from a rainstorm. Willy was unable to recover from his injuries. ==Bibliography== *Deborah Turner, Diana Mohler, authors; Rhonda McHugh, illustrator (1998).

Previously, he held positions with the professional teams: the Los Angeles Lakers, the Sacramento Kings, the Golden State Warriors, the Orlando Magic, the Cleveland Cavaliers, and the New Orleans Hornets in Oklahoma City, OK, Post-Katrina. ==Chronological Career History== Moser's career started in 1984 with his coaching experience at his junior college in Minnesota, and has continued over multiple parallels and leagues, including basketball operations, coaching, scouting, management and ownership, both domestic and international, and most notably within the NBA, CBA, D-League, and NCAA. ===Modest Beginnings=== Moser started his passionate basketball career in college, coaching at Fergus Falls Community College as the Head Assistant Coach between 1983-1987, where he helped lead the team to three Northwest Division Championships in three years with one player eventually playing professionally. He helped the team to two notable milestones, the school's first championship in 1984 with the Minnesota State Conference, and the school's first National Tourney Appearance at the 1984 NJCCA Region XIII Championships. He graduated from the UW-LaCrosse with a BS in Physical Education with a Sport Management Emphasis which led him to working under Jim Valvano at NC State. Upon graduating, Moser headed East where he worked for Valvano at North Carolina State University as an Assistant Coach from August 1987-August 1989. During this time, he worked as a Recruiting Coordinator, during four signing periods, where he signed twelve players, including Derrick Chandler, Bryant Feggins, Tom Gugliotta, Mickey Hinnant, Pancho Hodges, Jamie Knox, David Lee, Gary Madison, Donnie Seale, Kevin Thompson, Byron Tucker, and Craig Tyson. Through Moser's time with this team, they achieved two consecutive NCAA tournament appearances, a 1989 Sweet 16 Appearance, and were Champions in the 1989 Atlantic Coast Conference. 7 of the 12 players he recruited played in the NBA, and two others played in other pro leagues, respectively. Moser assisted in all aspects of Basketball Operations, including game/practice preparation, academic monitoring, player development, recruiting, on floor practice. This led to him operating The Jim Valvano Basketball School, which was an extremely profitable venture. ===The Rise & Fall of the CBA=== In August 1989, Moser accepted a position with the Sioux Falls Sky Force in South Dakota within the former Continental Basketball Association (CBA) as an Assistant Coach and Assistant Director of Basketball Operations. Between 1990-91, the Sky Force jumped to the 4th most improved team in the CBA with 23% more wins, and led the CBA in scoring with 117.3 ppg. Moser was promoted within the franchise to General Manager in 1992, and Vice President in 1993. During this time, he participated in the Great Midstates Recruiting Review as the Creator, Owner, and Founder from 1993-1996 in Sioux Falls, SD. He spent his summers of '90 and '91 as the Head Coach for the Southern California Summer Pro League in Los Angeles, CA which held an overall record of 13-7 with 1-3 Playoffs where each team made playoffs. Here, he coached many free agents in the NBA division, including Danny Manning, Robert Pack, David Wingate, Chris Corchiani, Byron Scott, and Pat Cummings. They advanced to the Free Agent Finals in 1990. He was named to Coach Free Agent All-Stars for the years 1990 and 2004. In July 1994, Moser moved his young family to St. Louis, Missouri where he accepted the position with the CBA as Vice President of Basketball Operations. He received a promotion in October 1996 to Senior Vice President, and eventually left for the position of CEO, President, General Manager and eventual Part Owner of the Idaho Stampede in Boise, ID in April 1997. While in this position, he advanced within the CBA to Western Regional Vice President of the league in May 2000. December 2000, he joined, for the second time in his career, the USA Basketball Board of Directors in Colorado Springs, CO for two years. Moser ended his relationship with the Stampede during the CBA shutdown in February 2001, a result of league bankruptcy due to the controversial management of Isiah Thomas, where Thomas forfeited the CBA as the primary player development league.http://www.espn.com/moresports/s/2001/0208/1071705.html In response, the NBA created their own developmental league, which played its first game the following season in November 2001.https://nbahoopsonline.com/History/Leagues/NBDL/index.html This is where Moser's career took an incredible turn, that although challenging and unpredictable, is responsible for fueling the diversity in his career that has led him to his current path of success. He accepted a position with Treasure Valley Community College in Ontario, OR as the men's basketball head coach and PE Instructor from 2001-2002. With his help, he increased wins by 30% from the previous season, 14-16 record overall. For the first and only time in the school's history (1-40), TVCC beat Utah Valley State, set the school record for largest margin of victory (70) on 12/2/01 (117-47), and defeated Rick's College at Rick's for the first and only time in school history. Additionally, he moved the team into a positive scoring margin for the season, an improvement from a negative margin (increase of over 7 PPG), and increased scoring by 12.5% (80.5 from 70.4), topping the century mark 6 times. Moser recruited and signed 11 players from April to August to fill the roster, with only three scholarships to give. TVCC played in the NJCAA DI division, and in Region XVIII, eventually producing a national champion and three NBA players. ===Transition To NBA=== Moser worked as an Advanced Scout for the Golden State Warriors in Oakland, CA under Eric Musselman for the 2002-2003 season where the team was most improved in the NBA, and Coach Musselman was runner-up coach-of-the-year. Moser's work included X's and O's, statistical analysis, and personal analysis of upcoming opponents for coaching staff. This was the beginning of the professional friendship between Moser and Musselman for future years to come. Between 2003-2004, Moser heads back to the CBA to accept a position as Head Coach and President for the Great Lakes Storm in Birch Run, MI. During this time, he recorded at least one win over each team in the league. He signed free agents Anthony Bonner and Stais Boseman, future all- stars, and Jimmy King and Shelton Jones, two CBA MVP's. During this difficult time in CBA history, with over half of the teams in bankruptcy, Moser increased this franchise revenue by nearly 500%. ===Chinese Basketball Association=== In the wake of the CBA's bankruptcy, Moser saw opportunity overseas. Specifically, in Changchun City as the Coach and Team Consultant for the Jilin Northeastern Tigers from 2004-2005. Working in the People's Republic of China presented many occupational difficulties with culture shock and translation technicalities, yet Moser raised this team up in Jilin Province, clinching the North Division Playoff Berth with 19 days remaining in the regular season, and holding a 15-9 North Division record, including winning 12 division games at home. The Club set specific goals for the 04-05 season of which Moser achieved the following victories: recorded the first ever road win over Shanxi 16/2/05, 116-111, brought the team to the playoffs, played younger players more minutes during this season than previous seasons to gain experience, and improved the team defensively, where the PPG improved from 107 to 99. As the only foreign coach in the league to last the entire season, he held a regular season record 19-19 playing 9 games without the best import or overall player in the mid-season stretch. His other notable improvements and achievements with the team included coaching the 22 year old Wang Bo to first All-Star selection after sixth year in League, and bringing his coaching staff to the All-Star bench versus the Korean Basketball League (KBL). The Jilin Northeastern Tigers held a 2-6 playoff record for this season. ===Return to the United States=== Moser had a busy summer upon his return to the US. He was the Westchester Wildfire Head Coach in the USBL for the 2005 Summer Playoffs. He directed the first ever American coach run basketball camp for USBL in Beirut, Lebanon in conjunction with Med Quest, a partner of Super Agency, Interperformances. He participated in the NBA Summer League as Assistant Coach for the San Antonio Spurs where he assisted summer head coach in all facets of successful pre-league mini camp and Rocky Mountain Revue. He continued the year as an NBA Consultant for Team Business Operations and International Business Development in New York City, NY. He worked with Owner, President, CMO and CFO of New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets post Hurricane Katrina to transition the team from New Orleans to Oklahoma City, as well as developed a comprehensive review of all aspects of the Chinese Basketball Association for the NBA by analyzing rules, venues, lodging, accommodations, travel, revenue, expenses, and league viability. This relationship lead to the position of Vice President of Business Development for the newly relocated Oklahoma City Hornets for the 2005-2006 season. With the Hornets, Moser ran the ticket sales and operations department where he managed 37 full-time employees and nearly 32 million dollars in sales. He assisted with interdepartmental Sales & Marketing collaboration to reach 22 sellouts, 10 standing room only crowds that included setting the largest sports crowd in Ford Center history on two different occasions while ranking 1st in the league for customer satisfaction and likelihood to renew season tickets. During the regular season, he also supervised the ticket sales and operations for four unprecedented separate facilities: Ford Center, Lloyd-Noble Center, New Orleans Arena, and the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. ===Back to Coaching Roots=== For the 2006-2007 season, Moser joined Head Coach Eric Musselman as the Advanced Scout for the Sacramento Kings. During this time, he became proficient in XOS Play Tools Software while perfecting his X's and O's, statistical, and personnel analysis of upcoming opponents for the coaching staff. With this team, he joined the summer league as a member of the assistant coaching staff, as well as a member of the Basketball Without Borders coaching staff where he returned to the People's Republic of China in Shanghai, July 2007. While in Shanghai working with BWB, he received the opportunity to extend his stay in China by working for the Vlade Divac Children's Foundation in Shanghai, Haikou, Hainan, PRC, Hong Kong, SAR, as a Celebrity Coach where he conducted fundraising and philanthropic camps and clinics. He returned that summer to a position with the Orlando Magic as their Advanced Scout for the 2007-2008 season where his primary work involved X's and O's and statistical analysis of opponents while on the road. The 2008-2009 season took Moser to McAllen, Texas as Head Coach for the Rio Grande Valley Vipers where his team held a 21-29 record and improved the team's road record by 80%. He was entrusted in leading the league in promotional and charitable appearances, bringing his team honorable recognitions through their season. During this time, he produced NBA Call-Up Jawad Williams to the Cleveland Cavaliers, and developed him into D-League Player of the Month in March 2009. He led his team to the franchise's first ever wins in Austin, Idaho, and Utah while also setting the franchise's best 11-game stint where they won 8. As a coach that operated his department with fiscal responsibility, he was able to develop Trent Strickland to D-League honorable mention at his career best, Kurt Looby to the league's leading shot blocker, Ernest Scott to D-League All-Star \\"Dream Factory\\" Friday Night (another franchise first), as well as produced three players to the Chinese Basketball Association. Moser's work with the Vipers caught the attention of the Cleveland Cavaliers for the 2009-2010 season where he provided the tools as Regional Advanced Scout to help the team finish with the best record in the NBA. Summer of 2010 was spent in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic as the First Assistant for the Dominican Republic national basketball team where the team went undefeated in pool play and finished 5-1 overall. With Moser's help, the team qualified for Pan American Games and FIBA America's Pre-Olympic Qualifier where they secured the silver medal in Centrobasket at the tournament. Reno, Nevada received Clay as the Associate Head Coach under Eric Musselman for the 2010-2011 season. He helped set franchise records under the salary line including: a 34-16 record (.680), becoming Western Conference Champions, promoting franchise's first and second ever call-ups Steve Novak, and Danny Green (basketball) to the San Antonio Spurs, made D-League Semifinals and won the franchise's first playoff series. The Bighorns finished first in the league in opponents PPG (98.1) and FG% (.440) while also holding the best home and road record in franchise history, ending with the 2nd best overall record in the D-League, and 2nd in league in turnovers committed per game (15.3). The team didn't lose one game from January 26, 2011 – February 25, 2011, and set records against Illinois with margin of victory (41 vs Springfield), fewest points allowed (72 vs Springfield), and fewest turnovers (5 vs Springfield) all on February 2, 2011. They carried their winning streaks on to at least seven other games, three separate times, holding a franchise record. Unsurprisingly, the team's success increased attendance and increased the 2011-2012 season ticket renewals. ===The Los Angeles Lakers=== Moser moved to Los Angeles in August 2011 as Associate Head Coach for the LA D-Fenders in the D-League. The team held first place in its league when he was promoted to the Lakers as Advanced Scout for the 2011-2012 season. During his time with the Lakers, he received three promotions: Head Advanced Scout in August 2012, Assistant Coach/Head Advanced Scout in 2014, and finally to Assistant Coach and the Director of Basketball Strategy,https://basketball.realgm.com/staff/Clay-Moser/Summary/964 a newly created position specifically for his talents, in 2015.

It was discovered in 1949 by an American expedition in Iraq sponsored jointly by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago and the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania.Kramer, S.N., November 1951, Scientific American, pp. 54–55. ==Tablet== The farmer's almanac is a small clay tablet of by with an inscription that is more than 3,500 years old. It was found in the ancient Sumerian site of Nippur. The tablet had to be completely restored as it was in poor condition when discovered.Kramer, pp. 65–69, History Begins At Sumer (1959). The \\"Nippur tablet\\" has 35 lines of text and is part of the middle of the complete overall document. Different parts of the agricultural \\"primer\\" were already known in eight other clay tablets and fragments before the Nippur part was discovered. The complete Sumerian Farmer's Almanac document has 111 lines of text. It was originally made by a farmer for his son. The document has prime importance in the history of agriculture and its techniques. The document consists of a series of instructions for the purpose of guiding one throughout their yearly agricultural activities. Before this document was discovered there were two similar farmer's \\"handbooks\\" known from ancient times. One was Virgil's Georgics and the other was Hesiod's Works and Days. Hesiod's \\"handbook\\", written probably in the eighth century BC, was considered the earliest known farmer's almanac then known until the Sumerian Farmer's Almanac officially took the title in 1951. The Sumerian Farmer's Almanac predates Hesiod's almanac by approximately a millennium. ==Instructions== The instructions start with the flooding of the fields in the spring and ending with the cleaning and winnowing of the freshly harvested crops. The Sumer's soil was parched so irrigation was important. The almanac instructions began with advice concerning putting water into the fields and caring for the ground. The farmer was instructed to have his help prepare in advance all the necessary farming implements and tools. The farmer was instructed to make sure that he had an extra ox for the plow. The instructions were that before plowing, the farmer should have the ground broken up twice by the mattock and once by the hoe. The hammer was to be used to pulverize the clods. The farmer was instructioned to make sure he had a good manager to control the laborers to make sure they didn’t slough off. The instructions from the Sumerian Farmer's Almanac were for the farmer to plow eight furrows to each strip of land, which was approximately 20 feet (6 metres) long. Plowing and sowing was carried on simultaneously. It was done with a seeder. A plow was used that had an attachment that carried the seed. A container dropped the seed through a narrow funnel down to even depths of just plowed furrows. The depth was to be that of the width of two fingers and if not the plow was to be adjusted to make it come out this way. The furrows that had been plowed straight this year were to be plowed diagonal the next year and vice versa. The almanac gives instructions for the farmer to pray to Ninkilim, the goddess of field mice and vermin. This was so the pests would not harm the grain when it would start growing. There were special instructions on when to water the growing grain. There were three different watering times. If the farmer spotted reddening of the wet grain it was the dreaded samana-disease that endangered the crops. If the crop came out of this, then there was to be a fourth watering which usually yielded an extra ten percent. When the farmer was to harvest the barley, he was not to wait, but was to harvest just at the right moment. This was when the barley stood tall and did not bend over under its own weight. Three men were to do the harvesting as a team using a reaper and a binder. The threshing was done by means of a sledge for a period of five days. This was a device drawn back and forth over the heaped-up grain stalks. The barley was then \\"opened\\" with an \\"opener\\". A team of oxen drove this primitive machine to crush the barley-(sheaves). The barley, kernels and sheaves, were then winnowed-(of the sheaves) with pitchforks and laid on sticks to make clean. The writer of the Sumerian Farmer's Almanac said that the agricultural instructions were not his, however those of the god Ninurta, the son and \\"true farmer\\" of the leading Sumerian deity, Enlil.

He has won ten medals at six Games from 1988 to 2008. ==Personal== Scott was born in Gympie, Queensland, with cerebral palsy, as the youngest of three children. and moved to Brisbane with his family when he was two years old. At the age of eight, a soccer coach refused to let him join his team because he could not kick the ball with his right foot as well as he could with his left, a rule not enforced on able-bodied players. He consequently joined the next age group's soccer team so he could play with his brother. Scott attended Salisbury State High School and it was here where he began to participate more in sport and became involved in the Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association. He works as a records clerk in the Brisbane suburb of Sunnybank. He has been married to his wife, Karen, since March 2008, and has a stepdaughter. ==Career== Chris Scott gold medallist individual pursuit at the 2008 Beijing Games Scott first competed at the Paralympics in 7-a-side Football at the 1988 Soul Games. He also competed in athletics in the 1992 Paralympics in Barcelona., retrieved 15 January 2012. He switched to cycling due to a broken ankle. At the 1996 Atlanta games, he won a gold medal in the Mixed 5,000 m Time Trial Bicycle CP Div 4 event, and a silver medal in the Mixed 20k Bicycle CP Div 4 event. In 1998 and 1999, he held an Australian Institute of Sport Athlete with a Disability scholarship. At the 2000 Sydney Paralympics, he won a gold medal in the Mixed Bicycle Time Trial CP Div 4 event and a bronze medal in the Mixed Bicycle Road Race CP Div 4 event. At the 2004 Athens Games, Scott was the male captain for the Australian Paralympic team. In the Men's Team Sprint LC1-4/CP 3/4 event at the 2004 Games, Scott, the captain of the Australian cycling team, relinquished his place in the team in the finals so that fellow cyclist Peter Homann could get a chance to win a gold medal at his last Paralympics; the Australian team won the event so Homann received the gold medal along with Scott and the rest of the team. In a 2008 interview, he said of this action: \\"I already had my gold medal. It's what you do in a team. Peter deserved his chance on the podium.\\" He won two further gold medals in the Men's Road Race / Time Trial Bicycle CP Div 4 and Men's Individual Pursuit Bicycle CP Div 4 events at the 2004 Games. At the 2008 Beijing Games, he won a gold medal in the Men's Individual Pursuit CP4 event, a silver medal in the Men's Individual Time Trial CP4 event and a bronze medal in the Men's 1 km Time Trial CP4 event. The year before these Games, he had had back surgery and then was struck down by a car. He announced his retirement from Paralympic competition in Beijing due to \\"old age\\". He has since become an ambassador for the Cerebral Palsy League. ==Recognition== In 1997, Scott received a Medal of the Order of Australia for his 1996 Paralympic gold medal. In 2000, Scott received an Australian Sports Medal. He received the Australian Paralympic Committee's Senior Male Athlete award in 2002, and Sporting Wheelie of the Year in 2002 and 2005.

He was born in Bernburg, the eldest son of Victor Amadeus, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg, by his wife Elizabeth of Palatinate-Zweibrücken, daughter of Frederick, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken. ==Life== After the death of his father in 1718, the fifty-year-old Karl Frederick inherited Anhalt-Bernburg. His reign, which lasted only two years until his death, was unremarkable. ==Marriages and Issue== In Bernburg on 25 June 1692 Karl Frederick married his cousin Sophie Albertine (b. Sonnenwalde, 2 October 1672 - d. Bernburg, 12 June 1708), daughter of George Frederick, Count of Solms-Sonnenwalde, by his wife Anna Sophia of Anhalt-Bernburg (sister of his father Victor Amadeus, and daughter of Christian II, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg). They had six children: # Elisabeth Albertine (b. Bernburg, 31 March 1693 - d. Arnstadt, 7 July 1774), married on 2 October 1712 to Günther XLIII, Prince of Schwarzburg- Sondershausen. # Frederick William (b. Bernburg, 3 September 1694 - d. Bernburg, 28 December 1694). # Charlotte Sophie (b. Bernburg, 21 May 1696 - d. Sondershausen, 22 July 1762), married on 19 July 1721 to Augustus I Günther, Prince of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen-Ebeleben. # Auguste Wilhelmine (b. Bernburg, 3 November 1697 - d. Harzgerode, 22 June 1767). # Victor Frederick, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg (b. Bernburg, 20 September 1700 - d. Bernburg, 18 May 1765). # Frederica Henriette (b. Bernburg, 24 November 1702 - d. Köthen, 4 April 1723), married on 11 December 1721 to Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. From 1711 Karl Frederick began to live with Wilhelmine Charlotte Nüssler (b. Harzgerode, 10 May 1683 - d. Gernrode, 30 May 1740), the daughter of a non- noble chancery counselor. They had two sons: # Frederick [\\"Imperial Count of Bährnfeld\\" from 12 June 1723] (b. Harzgerode, 13 March 1712 - d. Gernrode, 8 September 1758). Born illegitimate, he was legitimized after the wedding of their parents. # Karl Leopold [\\"Imperial Count of Bährnfeld\\" since 12 June 1723] (b. Plötzkau, 1 July 1717 - d. Kassel, 3 October 1769). Karl Frederick and Wilhelmine Charlotte married secretly in Bernburg on 1 May 1715 and Karl Frederick immediately tried to have his wife raised to the rank of countess by the Emperor. When Prince Victor Amadeus learned of his son's actions, he wrote to the Emperor on 15 November 1715 to prevent the elevation, and added a codicil to his testament dated 13 July 1716 denying the children of the union any succession rights. The Emperor approved this codicil one year later, on 15 July 1717. The Emperor also sent a rescript to Karl Frederick dated 20 August 1717 instructing him not to call his wife princess or their sons princes. Nevertheless, after his father died in 1718, Karl Frederick obtained from the Emperor a patent to elevate his wife to the title Countess of Ballenstedt (German: Gräfin von Ballenstedt) on 19 December 1719, and their two sons to the rank of Imperial Counts of Bährnfeld (German: Reichsgrafen von Bährnfeld) on 12 June 1723; this, however, without prejudice of the rights of the agnates. Karl Frederick died in Ballenstedt, and in 1722, the Reichshofrat forbade his widow to use the princely title for herself or her sons. However, on 16 November 1742, the Emperor Charles VII raised the Counts of Bährenfeld to the rank of Princes of Anhalt-Bernburg with all rights of succession. Victor I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym, protested, but the Emperor died in 1745. The Prince brought up the matter to the College of Electors gathered in 1745, but they declined to take up the matter in the electoral capitulation. He then brought the matter to the Reichshofrat, which ruled on 6 May 1748 by repealing the diploma of 1742 and forbidding the Counts of Bährenfeld from calling themselves Princes of Bernburg or Princes of Anhalt-Bernburg, and allowing them only to call themselves Princes of Bährenfeld. They died unmarried. ==References== * Morganatic and Unequal Marriages in German Law * * Genealogical database by Herbert Stoyan Category:1668 births Category:1721 deaths Category:Princes of Anhalt-Bernburg Category:Burials at Schlosskirche St. Aegidien (Bernburg) ","title":"Karl Frederick, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg"},{"id":"19265287","text":"Serie Diamante is the fifth hits album by iconic Mexican pop singer Verónica Castro.

Each one has a minimum of 5 seats and a maximum of 70. For the 72 members of the Senate, each province (plus the City of Buenos Aires) has a fixed number of three senators. == Armenia == Beginning with the 2017 parliamentary election, the Armenian National Assembly elects members by proportional representation. Half the seats are filled from closed national party lists. The other half are chosen from 13 electoral districts allowing open list voter choice. As seat distribution is calculated at the national level, each electoral district is not guaranteed to return a specific number of seats. Each marz is coterminous with an electoral district with the exceptions of Vayots Dzor and Syunik (which are merged into one) and the Yerevan capital region, which is divided into 4 electoral districts. ==Australia== In Australia, federal constituencies are officially termed divisions, and their state counterparts electoral districts. At both levels, though, they are popularly referred to as electorates or seats. ==Bangladesh== Bangladesh has 300 parliamentary constituencies. There is one member of Parliament for each constituency. According to the constitution, the 50 seats reserved for women are allocated to the political parties according to their proportional representation. ==Bosnia and HerzegovinaBotswana== Botswana has 57 parliamentary constituencies. There is one member of Parliament for each constituency. ==Brazil== In Brazil, seats in the lower chamber of the federal congress (Câmara dos Deputados) are split throughout the 26 States and the Federal District in a roughly proportional manner. Each federal entity has a minimum of 8 seats and a maximum of 70. The States of São Paulo and Minas Gerais have the largest number of seats. Within each federal entity, representatives are chosen by open-list proportional voting. For the senate, each federal entity (state or federal district) has a fixed number of three senators. ==Bulgaria== In Bulgaria there are 31 constituencies arranged so as to coincide with the administrative division of Bulgaria, with the exception of Sofia City and Plovdiv provinces, where there are 3 additional constituencies (Sofia City is divided into 3 constituencies and Plovdiv is divided into 2). They are numbered according to their alphabetical order in Cyrillic. Experimentally in the 2009 Bulgarian parliamentary election, 31 out of the 240 Members of Parliament were elected by majority vote, while the remaining 209 were elected by proportional vote. This mixed electoral system was rejected later. ==Canada== In Canada, constituencies are legally known as electoral districts (in French, circonscriptions) for Members of Parliament; and Members of Legislative Assemblies or Members of Provincial Parliament (Ontario), Members of the National Assembly (Quebec), or Members of the House of Assembly (Newfoundland and Labrador) at the provincial level, although \\"constituency\\" and the informal term \\"riding\\" (or \\"comté\\" in French) are also used. ==Chile== Chile's bicameral Congress consists of a Chamber of Deputies (lower house) and a Senate (upper house). The country is divided into 28 electoral districts for the lower house and 15 senatorial constituencies for the Senate. Each electoral district elects between 3 and 8 deputies and each senatorial constituency elects 3, 4 or 5 senators; there are 155 deputies and 43 senators in total. From 2022 the number of senators will increase to 50 because only the half of the senators are elected every election. Before the 2017 election, both seats in two-seat electoral districts were filled in the same election; after 2017, there are plurinominal districts. ==Croatia== The Croatian Parliament electoral districts () are the special territorial subdivisions of Croatia used for the country's parliamentary elections. Croatia has 12 electoral districts. Ten of these are geographical districts within Croatia, each electing 14 members of Croatian Parliament. District XI is for Croatian citizens living abroad, with 3 members of parliament (until 2011, it elected a maximum 12 members of parliament, depending on turnout). District XII is for national minorities, with 8 members of parliament. The first ten districts are roughly based on geography, and arranged so that each district has roughly the same amount of registered voters, around 400,000. These districts therefore do not correspond to the boundaries of top-level administrative divisions within Croatia, and each district contains one or more or parts of several Croatian counties. ==Estonia== There are 12 electoral districts (valimisringkonnad) for the parliamentary elections in Estonia. Each district elects 5 to 14 members to the 101-member Riigikogu. The capital and largest city Tallinn constitutes three electoral districts, and the second largest city Tartu one. Other districts are divided by the 15 counties. Two of the districts are each made up by 3 counties; 3 districts by 2 counties; and the three remaining counties each make up a separate electoral district.Electoral Districts and Voting Districts All municipalities have at least one electoral district in their local elections. In the 2005, 2009 and 2013 local elections, Tallinn had 8 electoral districts, one for each administrative district of the city. In 2009 Vändra Parish, which merged with Kaisma Parish, also had 2 electoral districts. In 2005 Suure-Jaani Parish, merged from 4 different parishes, had 4 electoral districts and Türi Parish had 2 electoral districts. In elections to the European Parliament the whole country constitutes one electoral district. ==Falkland Islands== The Falkland Islands are divided into two constituencies, the Camp and Stanley which return three and five members respectively to the Legislative Assembly. The Camp constituency includes any part of the Falklands which is not within the boundaries of the Stanley constituency (which are defined by a 3.5 mile radius from the cathedral spire). A referendum had been held in 2001 in which both Camp and Stanley voters rejected a change to a single constituency. The Constitution now specifically allows for the constituencies and their boundaries to be amended, but such an amendment must be supported in a referendum and, as a protection, there must be a two-thirds majority in each constituency. A further referendum was held on 3 November 2011: Stanley voters narrowly supported a single constituency (but without a two-thirds majority) and Camp voters emphatically rejected a single constituency. (Mercopress report on the 2011 referendum result) ==Finland== The Finnish Eduskunta, or Parliament, is made up of 200 members, elected from 15 separate geographic areas, or electoral districts. All of the constituencies, with the exception of Åland, elect multiple members, ranging between six and 35 depending on the constituency's population. The constituency division is based on the old (1634–1997) provinces of Finland, and has remained more or less the same since the first elections for the Eduskunta in 1907. A special case is the constituency of Åland, which only elects one member of parliament. Even though the region of Åland is much smaller than any of the other constituencies, Finnish law gives a special status for the region and it gets a seat even if its population would not entitle it to one. ==France== In France, electoral constituencies are known as circonscriptions électorales. For parliamentary elections, they are known as circonscriptions législatives, and for departmental ones, France uses cantons. ==Germany== In Germany, there are 299 basic electoral constituencies (called Wahlkreise), accounting for half of the 598 nominal seats in the German Bundestag in a \\"first past the post\\" electoral system. These constituencies are divided so that each has approximately the same number of voters. The constituencies for the rest of the seats are the federal states, representatives being drawn from the top of their respective electoral lists. German electoral law dictates that the deviation from average of all constituencies shall not exceed a certain figure.See for example § 3 Abs. 1 Nr. 3 in German electoral law Other restrictions prevent abuses such as gerrymandering. Similar provisions apply for many of the federal state parliaments, though constituencies are generally smaller and boundaries change more frequently. Members of the European Parliament are elected by party list proportional representation at the national level. ==Greece== The Greek Parliament (Voulí ton Ellínon) has 300 members, elected for a four-year term by a system of 'reinforced' proportional representation in 56 constituencies, 48 of which are multi-seat and 8 single-seat. Seats are determined by constituency voting, and voters may select the candidate or candidates of their choice by marking their name on the party ballot. However, the party receiving the largest number of votes receives a 50-seat premium, which is filled by candidates of that party not declared elected on the lower rungs (the constituencies). ==Hong Kong== The unicameral Legislative Council has 70 members, 35 returned from five geographical constituencies based on the Hare quota and largest remainder method, and the remaining 35 returned through 28 functional constituencies accounting for 30 seats and 1 district council representatives voted on by all registered voters that are not affiliated with any functional constituency, thus ensuring each voter has the same number of votes (2) - although the uneven electoral base remains controversial. ==Iceland== In Iceland, there are 6 constituencies, which are Norðvesturkjördæmi \\"Northwest\\", Norðausturkjördæmi \\"Northeast\\", Suðvesturkjördæmi \\"Southwest\\", Suðurkjördæmi \\"South\\", Reykjavíkurkjördæmi norður \\"North Reykjavik\\", and Reykjavíkurkjördæmi suður \\"South Reykjavik\\". The Icelandic word for constituency is kjördæmi. ==India== In India a constituency is an area, where people of this notified area elect their representative either to Lok Sabha or the state legislature or local governing bodies. India has a multi-tier democratic system. The apex legislative body of India which forms part of the Union government is Lok Sabha (lower house); then there are state legislatures, also called legislative assemblies (Vidhan Sabha), then Zilla Parishad, Taluk Panchayat and Grama Panchayat. Hence every area has a constituency under which it falls. ==Indonesia== For People's Representative Council (DPR), there are 80 multi-member electoral districts called daerah pemilihan. Number may various from 3-10 member every districts. Indonesians abroad are represented in Jakarta's 2nd electoral district which also representing Central and South Jakarta. Regional assembly (province and municipalities) also have their electoral districts. Regional Representative Council (DPD) elects 4 member every province, regardless of size and population. ==Ireland== Constituencies in the Ireland elect between three and five Teachtaí Dála (TDs) using the STV method. ==Italy== For the election of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, since 1993 Italy is divided in 27 districts called circoscrizioni. However, the distribution of seats is calculated at national level, and the districts serve only to choose the single candidates inside the party lists. In the election of the Italian Senate, according to the Constitution, each Region is a single district, without connections at national level. In the regional elections, the districts correspond to the Provinces, even if some seats are allocated at regional level. For the Provincial elections, a special system is used, based on localized lists: even if the competition is disputed on provincial level, candidates are presented in single-member districts, and their final position inside each party list depends by the percentage of votes they received in their own districts. Finally, for the Communal elections no districts are used. ==Japan== Japan's National Diet consists of two houses. The House of Representatives, also known as the Lower House, consists of 295 single-member districts and 11 multi- member (6-29 members) proportional representation blocks that represent broader regions of the country. This gives a total of 475 members in the house. The House of Councillors (Upper House) has 47 districts of 2-10 members that correspond with the 47 prefectures of Japan and a national proportional representation block that elects 96 members, giving a total of 242 members in the house. As a result of imbalances in the representation of rural and urban voters, legislation has changed the number of members representing some districts, while some rural districts will be merged by 2019. ==Kuwait== There are five electoral districts in Kuwait. ==Lebanon== Lebanon has multi-seat constituencies. ==Liberia== In Liberia, there are 64 electoral districts, each of which sends a single member to the House of Representatives. Each representative is elected by the first past the post system. ==Liechtenstein== The 11 municipalities of Liechtenstein are divided into the two electoral districts (Wahlkreise) of Oberland and Unterland. Politics and electoral districts of Liechtenstein ==Luxembourg== Luxembourg has four parliamentary multi-seat constituencies called electoral circonscriptions. The respective numbers of seats are proportional to the numbers of voters living in each constituency. The election method used is the system of open lists of party candidates, which means that in each constituency the respective parties obtain a number of seats in proportion to the total of votes given to their candidates, with the voters choosing the candidates they prefer (panachage). Each circonscription is composed of cantons (administrative districts). These are their names, the cantons they are composed of (in brackets the canton names in French and Luxembourgish) and the number of parliamentary seats: * South (Esch/Alzette - Esch/Uelzecht; Capellen), 24 seats * Centre (Luxembourg - Lëtzebuerg; Mersch - Miersch), 21 seats * North (Clervaux - Klierf; Diekirch - Dikrech; Wiltz - Wolz; Redange - Réiden; Vianden - Veianen), 9 seats * East (Echternach - Ierchternach; Grewenmacher - Gréiwemaacher; Remich - Réimech), 6 seats ==Malaysia== There are 222 parliamentary constituencies in Malaysia. The seats are indicated as P.xxx. Each constituency is represented by an elected Member of Parliament who sits at the lower house of the Parliament of Malaysia called Dewan Rakyat. With the exception of Federal Territory parliamentary seats, these constituencies are further divided into 587 state legislative assembly districts, whose representative will sit at their respective state legislative assembly. The state assembly seats are indicated as N.xx. ==Malta== There are currently 13 electoral districts, each consist of various localities, although in some cases, localities are divided between districts in order to obtain a roughly equal spread of population. Each of these districts elects 5 members to parliament, using the single transferable vote (STV) method. ==Mexico== The Federal Electoral Districts are the 300 constituencies or electoral districts into which Mexico is divided for the purpose of federal elections. Each district returns one Federal Deputy, who sits in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Federal Congress. An additional 200 deputies are elected by proportional representation from 5 electoral regions. ==Namibia== Constituency is used as an administrative division. ==NepalNew Zealand== New Zealand uses a proportional representation system, with a parliament nominally consisting of 120 seats. Of these, 65 are general electorate seats, with 14 of these seats being for South Island constituencies and the other 51 being for the North Island. A further seven seats are specifically for the Māori population with this number determined by the size of the Māori electoral roll. Voters are each entitled to two votes, one for their local electorate contest, and one for the nationwide party vote. The remaining 48 seats are allocated from party lists on a proportional basis, based on the nationwide party vote tally. Occasionally, as in the 48th Parliament, this results in an \\"overhang\\" - a 121st seat being required to accommodate the correct proportion of Members of Parliament. Only parties which record either 5% of the nationwide party vote or win one or more electoral seats may be awarded list seats. The size of New Zealand electorates is determined on a population basis such that all electorates have approximately the same population. ==Philippines== The Philippines has a bicameral legislature: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The senators are elected nationwide at-large as one \\"district,\\" with the twelve candidates with the most votes winning the twelve seats contested every election. In the House of Representatives, four-fifths of its members are elected via first past the post in single member districts, while the remaining one-fifth is elected via a party-list system nationwide. There are currently 243 congressional districts in the country, each electing one congressman to the House of Representatives. Each province is automatically entitled to one legislative district. If a province or city is divided into congressional districts, its representation in either its Sangguniang Panlalawigan (provincial board) or Sangguniang Panlungsod (city council) is coterminous with its congressional districts. If a province is composed of a single congressional district, the Commission on Elections divides it into two districts for purposes of elections to the provincial board. If a city just has one congressional district, it depends on its charter if there will be districts for its city council; if it doesn't provide for that, the council is elected at an at-large basis. All municipalities and barangays (villages) for purposes of electing members to the Sangguniang Bayan (municipal council), Sangguniang Barangay (village council) and Sangguniang Kabataan (youth council) are not divided into districts. All local legislatures are multi-member districts elected via plurality-at-large voting. From 1916 to 1935, senators were also elected via districts, with eleven districts electing two senators, while the two senators in the twelfth district were appointed by the American governor-general. While most legislators are elected via geographical districts, they represent their constituents; party-list representatives' constituents is the sector they represent, while the senators' constituency is the entire nation. ==Poland== Electoral districts of Poland () are defined by Polish election law. Electoral districts can be divided depending on whether they are individual entities or parts of a larger electoral district with regard to elections to 1) parliament (Sejm) and Senate 2) local offices and 3) European Parliament. Each district has a number of mandates calculated on the basis of its population. ==Portugal== The 22 constituencies of Portugal are named círculos eleitoriais (singular: círculo eleitoral, meaning \\"electoral circle\\"). They are used for the election of the deputies of the Portuguese unicameral national parliament, the Assembleia da República (Assembly of the Republic). Each círculo eleitoral elects a number of deputies (from two to 47), that varies according with the number of electors of the constituency. The area of 20 of the constituencies coincides with the first level administrative divisions of Portugal, which are the 18 districts of the mainland Portugal and the two autonomous regions of the Portuguese islands. The two remainder constituencies represent the Portuguese who live in foreign countries, existing one círculo eleitoral for Europe and other for outside Europe. ==Singapore== In Singapore, there are 15 group representation constituencies (GRC) and 12 single-member constituencies, giving a total of 23 constituencies. Group representation constituencies elect between four and six MPs to the Parliament of Singapore, while single member constituencies elect one (accurate as of 2011 general elections). Both GRCs and SMCs are elected with a plurality method. ==Spain== In Spain, electoral constituencies are known as circunscripciones. Under Article 68 of the Spanish constitution Spanish Constitution the boundaries must be the same as the provinces of Spain and under Article 141 this can only be altered with the approval of Congress. Voting is on the basis of universal suffrage in a secret ballot. Article 68 also states that the number of deputies must not be less than 300 nor exceed 400, that the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla should be single member districts, that provinces should be guaranteed an initial minimum representation and that the electoral system should be proportional representation, although it does not specify a particular type. Constituency magnitude has normally been small. Currently 27 of the 52 districts elect between three and five members. A further ten elect six or seven members. This has tended to favour the larger parties at the expense of smaller lists. Consequently, it has been common for smaller parties to form ad hoc alliances with larger parties by forming joint lists. The electoral system used is closed list proportional representation with seats allocated using the D'Hondt method. Only lists which poll 3% or more of all valid votes cast, including votes \\"en blanco\\" i.e. for \\"none of the above\\" can be considered for seats. In practice the 3% threshold has usually been unnecessary as the effective representation threshold has been much higher. The sole exception was the 1993 election in Madrid where a minor party list lost a seat. ==Sri Lanka== Members of the Sri Lankan Parliament are elected from 22 multi-member electoral districts. ==Sweden== In elections to the Swedish Parliament (Riksdag), the 349 seats are divided into 310 fixed seats and 39 adjustment seats. The 310 fixed seats are distributed into 29 multi-member districts (valkretsar). These follow county borders with the exception of the three largest counties, Stockholm, Västra Götaland and Skåne, which are divided into two, five and four districts respectively. Counties are also divided into several districts for elections to the county councils, while municipalities above a certain size must be divided into several districts for the purpose of elections to the municipal assemblies. ==Switzerland== In Switzerland, the Canton of St. Gallen uses the Wahlkreise (constituency or electoral district) in place of the previous, and more usual, district. See . ==Taiwan== As of 2016, there are 73 legislative districts in Taiwan, each with a representative in parliament elected by first-past-the-post. An additional 34 and 6 seats are elected by proportional voting and single non-transferable vote respectively, with a total of 113 seats. ==Turkey== There are 600 seats elected from 87 electoral districts in Turkey to the Grand National Assembly. The districts generally correspond to Turkey's provincial divisions with the exception of Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir and Bursa, which are divided into smaller districts owing to their large electorates. Voting last took place nationally across all of the below districts on 24 June 2018. ==UkraineUnited Kingdom== In the United Kingdom, a parliamentary constituency is sometimes called a parliamentary seat or division. Constituencies for local government elections are called either wards or electoral divisions. As of 2020, there are 650 House of Commons constituencies in the UK: *List of Parliamentary constituencies in the United Kingdom *List of MPs elected in the 2019 United Kingdom general election lists the constituencies after that election. Northern Ireland has 18 constituencies, each of which elect five MLAs to the Northern Ireland Assembly under the Single Transferable Vote system. The Scottish Parliament has 73 single-member constituencies elected on a first past the post basis, with the remaining 56 seats in the parliament being selected by the Additional Member System (AMS). Since the passage of the Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Act 2004, the constituencies of the Scottish Parliament are no longer identical to those of the House of Commons. The Senedd Cymru (Welsh Parliament) has 40 constituencies elected by first past the post which are identical to the Welsh constituencies of the House of Commons. Its remaining 20 seats are selected by AMS. The London Assembly has 14 constituencies elected by first past the post, described in the article on London Assembly constituencies. Its remaining 11 seats are also selected by AMS. ==United States== In the United States, electoral districts for the federal House of Representatives are known as congressional districts (of which there are presently 435; the number can be changed but has remained at 435 since 1912, except for a brief period from 1959-1962 when two seats were temporarily added for the then-new States of Alaska and Hawaii), while the electoral districts for the variously named state legislatures go by a variety of names (and have differing numbers). Long standing practice, reinforced and modified by several U.S. Supreme Court decisions, require the equalization of populations of electoral districts after each decennial census, a process known as redistricting. Electoral districts within the U.S. are subdivided into individual units known as precincts. ==Vietnam== In Vietnam the number of electoral divisions varies from election to election. The most recent parliamentary election in 2011 had 183 electoral divisions which elected 500 delegates of the National Assembly of Vietnam. As the National Assembly of Vietnam is unicameral, the delegates are elected based on the population of that area. ==Others== Most of the rest of the Commonwealth of Nations also use constituencies as electoral divisions.

The lake can hold of water. The lake was named after Charles Henry Leake a member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council. At the 2006 census, Lake Leake had a population of 176. ==Features and location== The lake is used for recreational fishing, for brook trout, brown trout and rainbow trout. The village is built on land owned by the Northern Midlands Council. Inhabitants must purchase a license to have a building there are restricted in the number of days per year they can live there. The main purpose is to accommodate recreational anglers. Water flowing out from the lake has an electrical conductivity of 56 μS/cm. Rawlinna is a locality located between the south side of the lake and Lake Yaleena, another water impoundment. Lake Yaleena is a privately built dammed lake, specifically for fishing. It is a business that includes accommodation in cabins. ==History== The traditional custodians of the area were the Peenrymairmemener clan of the North Midlands Nation. The area was originally a wetland, or series of lagoons, and was transcribed by Europeans as koan.ner.we (written in palawa kani as kunawi). The area was described by contemporary colonial British as a 'resort of the natives' - an aboriginal meeting place, and contemporaries describe finding several aboriginal huts in the area. The area contains remains of aboriginal artifacts and a quarry where the Peenrymairmemener crafted stone tools. The area was renamed by colonials 'Kearney's Bogs' and then Lake Leake after the dam was constructed. The reservoir was constructed after a long debate. A high dam was finished in 1884. The initial capacity was and an area of . In 1971 the spillway highest point was raised by to increase storage capacity. Water is released for irrigation and also stored to maintain a fishing facility.

Once known as Sugarloaf Mountain, it received its present name in 1928. It contains the ruins of an old fire lookout at the summit. It dominates the view from Barnes Point and Lake Crescent Lodge. It is accessible by trail from the Spruce Railroad Trail. On a clear day, Mount Baker is visible in the Cascade Range across the Puget Sound. From the summit, it is easy to see the landslide that blocked Indian Creek and dammed Lake Crescent. Below the landslide is Lake Sutherland and the Indian Creek valley down to the Elwha River. Pyramid Mountain and Lake Crescent in summer ==Climate== Set in the north-west portion of the Olympic Mountains, Pyramid Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. ==Geology== The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times. ==See also== * Olympic Mountains * Geology of the Pacific Northwest * Geography of Washington (state) ==ReferencesPyramid Mountain weather: Mountain Forecast { View of the landslide that dammed Lake Crescent Aurora Ridge across Lake Crescent in Feb } Category:Landforms of Olympic National Park Category:Mountains of Clallam County, Washington Category:Mountains of Washington (state) Category:Olympic Mountains Category:Landslide-dammed lakes ","title":"Pyramid Mountain (Clallam County, Washington)"},{"id":"19265380","text":"Takasu Station may refer to: * Takasu Station (Hiroshima), a railway station in Hiroshima, Japan * Takasu Station (Kōchi), a tramway station in Kōchi, Japan ","title":"Takasu Station"},{"id":"19265389","text":"The Wolf Creek Shooting Complex, now known as the Tom Lowe Shooting Grounds, is a shooting range located southwest of Atlanta, Georgia, United States, in Fulton County.

He played Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs in 1959. He played college baseball, football, and basketball at the University of Michigan from 1951 to 1955. He was an All-American in baseball and an All-Big Ten Conference selection in basketball. ==Early years== Eaddy was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1934. He graduated from Ottawa Hill High School. ==University of Michigan== Eaddy attended the University of Michigan from 1951 to 1955. He was a three-sport athlete at Michigan, competing in baseball, basketball and football. In football, Eaddy played at the halfback position in 1951.(Enter \\"Eaddy\\" in the \\"Last Name\\" box to retrieve roster information.) He appeared in three games for Michigan during the 1951 season, completing a pass against Michigan State for a 23-yard gain. He carried the ball nine times for the Wolverines for -49 net yards resulting from plays in which he was sacked. The halfback was the player with principal passing responsibility in the Michigan offense of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Eaddy dropped football after his freshman year. He later recalled: \\"First of all, I was too small to mess around with those big fellows, being a 160-pound halfback. And, secondly, I preferred to concentrate on baseball and basketball.\\" In basketball, he played at the guard position and was selected as an All-Big Ten Conference player. In baseball, Eaddy was a third baseman and was selected as an All-American in 1955. He helped lead the Michigan Wolverines baseball team to the NCAA baseball championship in 1952. In 1955, he compiled a .353 batting average in Big Ten play and led the conference with 11 stolen bases in 15 games. After receiving his bachelor's degree, Eaddy returned to Michigan in the fall of 1955 to pursue a master's degree in education. ==Professional baseball== After graduating from Michigan, Eaddy signed to play professional baseball with the Chicago Cubs. He explained his choice as follows: \\"I thought I would have a better chance to reach the major leagues sooner with them, because they are not loaded with material.\\" Eaddy played in the minor leagues for Burlington Bees in the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League in 1955. He compiled a .304 batting average in 32 games with three doubles and three triples. In a March 1956 feature story about Eaddy in The Sporting News, Chicago coach Ray Blades predicted great things for Eaddy: > \\"I've seen him for only a couple of weeks now and I know that he has less > than a years's experience in professional ball. However, I can promise you > at this early stage of his career that this young fellow is destined to be a > big leaguer. He just can't miss.\\" Blades added that Eaddy was already \\"a big leaguer on defense\\", and the only question was with his hitting. Eaddy was assigned to the Des Moines Bruins in the Western League in 1956. In 41 games with Des Moines, he hit .390. After a fast start with Des Moines in 1956, Eaddy's career was interrupted when he was drafted to serve in the United States Air Force. He missed the most of the 1956 season and the entire 1957 and 1958 seasons to military service. After completing his military service, Eaddy returned to the Chicago Cubs organization. He made his major league debut with the Cubs as a pinch runner on April 24, 1959, and appeared in 15 games during the 1959 season. He was used principally as a pinch runner, and his only appearance as a position player in the major leagues was on August 1, 1959, as a third baseman. He replaced Art Schult in the bottom of the fifth inning, committed an error in the bottom of the sixth that allowed a run to score, and struck out in the top of the seventh inning. Despite striking out in his only at bat, he scored three runs for the Cubs. Eaddy spent most of the 1959 season playing in the minor leagues for the Lancaster Red Roses of the Eastern League and the Fort Worth Cats of the American Association. Eaddy continued to play minor league baseball for another five years, but did not return to the major leagues. He had his best minor league season in 1960 at Lancaster, batting .304 in 457 plate appearances with a .425 on-base percentage, 17 doubles, eight triples, eight home runs, 33 RBIs and nine stolen bases. Eaddy also played in Cuba during the winter of 1960 for the Cienfuegos. He led the Cuban league in bases on balls and helped lead the Cienfuegos to the 1960 Caribbean Series title. ==Later years== After retiring from baseball, Eaddy became a franchisee for the Burger King restaurant chain. He was inducted into the Grand Rapids Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. In July 2008, he died of cancer in Laconia, New Hampshire at age 74. ==References *Baseball-Reference.com page *Baseball-Almanac Category:1934 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American football halfbacks Category:Guards (basketball) Category:Major League Baseball third basemen Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Michigan Wolverines baseball players Category:Michigan Wolverines football players Category:Michigan Wolverines men's basketball players Category:Burlington Bees players Category:Des Moines Bruins players Category:Fort Worth Cats players Category:Lancaster Red Roses players Category:Salt Lake City Bees players Category:San Antonio Missions players Category:All-American college baseball players Category:United States Air Force airmen Category:Sportspeople from Grand Rapids, Michigan Category:Players of American football from Michigan Category:Baseball players from Michigan Category:Basketball players from Michigan Category:African- American players of American football Category:African-American baseball players Category:African-American basketball players Category:Deaths from cancer in New Hampshire Category:American men's basketball players ","title":"Don Eaddy"},{"id":"19265595","text":"Akalla is a station in the Stockholm metro in the Akalla district of Stockholm.

One of his poems, \\"The Blue and the Gray\\", is frequently reprinted to this day. ==Biography== Francis Miles Finch was born on June 9, 1827, in Ithaca, New York. He was educated at Yale University, where, according to a contemporary, he was a \\"thoughtful scholar in the class-room, a prizeman in the essay competitions, an influential editor of the Yale Lit an impressive speaker in the Linonian Society, hail-fellow-well-met on the campus, sedate, impulsive, big-hearted, wise, witty, everywhere he was the ideal collegian.\\" Because of his achievements, he became a member of Skull and Bones. Having been graduated in 1849, he returned to Ithaca, became a lawyer, and speedily distinguished himself in his profession. He soon became as a speaker in the political campaigns which preceded and followed the Civil War.The Blue and the Grey and other verses, by Francis M. Finch, foreword by Andrew D. White, 1909 He was a friend of Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, and at the organization of Cornell University, he became warmly interested in the institution, was one of its trustees, and its counsel and friendly adviser through its early troubles.Landmarks of Tompkins County, New York by John H. Selkreg, 1894 As Secretary of the Board of Trustees, Finch was left in charge when both Cornell and White were travelling out of town. He also lent the university his literary skills, as a contemporary relates: \\"His indignation at the attacks upon Mr. Cornell by the enemies of the university aroused him to fight strenuously and successfully in the courts, in the press, and in public meetings, while the music of the university chime, heard at dawn, noon, and nightfall above the ripple or roar of the adjacent waters, inspired him to write songs which have been sung by Cornell students from their first arrival forty years ago until the present hour.\\" Early in Ulysses S. Grant's first presidential term (circa 1870) he was appointed collector of internal revenue for the Twenty-sixth District, New York, which office he resigned after holding it for four years. In May 1880, he was appointed a judge of the New York Court of Appeals to fill the vacancy caused by the appointment of Charles J. Folger as Chief Judge. In January 1881, he was re-appointed to fill the vacancy that continued after Folger's election as Chief Judge in November 1880. In November 1881, Finch was elected to a full fourteen-year term, and remained in office until December 31, 1895. He lectured at the Cornell's School of Law from 1887 onwards, and on the death of Hon. Douglass Boardman in the year 1891, was unanimously elected as dean of the Law School. Finch wrote poetry throughout his life, but declined a chair in rhetoric literature at Cornell, thinking his poetry was \\"only incidents along the line of a busy and laborious life.\\"Francis Miles Finch from the Strangers to Us All – Lawyers and Poetry website Perhaps his best known poem, \\"The Blue and the Gray\\", written in remembrance of the dead of the American Civil War, was inspired by a women's memorial association in Columbus, Mississippi, who on April 25, 1866 tended the graves of Confederate and Union soldiers, treating the dead as equals despite the lingering rancor of the war.Conversations in Management from Trinity River Seminars and Consulting Francis Finch was married May 25, 1853 to Elizabeth A. Brook, who died on March 28, 1892. They had three children: a son, Robert Brooke, and two daughters, Mary Sibley and Helen Elizabeth.

It is directed away from an axis which is parallel to the axis of rotation and passing through the coordinate system's origin. If the axis of rotation passes through the coordinate system's origin, the centrifugal force is directed radially outwards from that axis. The magnitude of centrifugal force F on an object of mass m at the distance r from the origin of a frame of reference rotating with angular velocity ω is: The concept of centrifugal force can be applied in rotating devices, such as centrifuges, centrifugal pumps, centrifugal governors, and centrifugal clutches, and in centrifugal railways, planetary orbits and banked curves, when they are analyzed in a rotating coordinate system. The term has sometimes also been used for the reactive centrifugal force that may be viewed as a reaction to a centripetal force in some circumstances. In the inertial frame of reference (upper part of the picture), the black ball moves in a straight line. However, the observer (brown dot) who is standing in the rotating/non-inertial frame of reference (lower part of the picture) sees the object as following a curved path due to the Coriolis and centrifugal forces present in this frame. ==Introduction== Centrifugal force is an outward force apparent in a rotating reference frame. It does not exist when a system is described relative to an inertial frame of reference. All measurements of position and velocity must be made relative to some frame of reference. For example, an analysis of the motion of an object in an airliner in flight could be made relative to the airliner, to the surface of the Earth, or even to the Sun. A reference frame that is at rest (or one that moves with no rotation and at constant velocity) relative to the \\"fixed stars\\" is generally taken to be an inertial frame. Any system can be analyzed in an inertial frame (and so with no centrifugal force). However, it is often more convenient to describe a rotating system by using a rotating frame—the calculations are simpler, and descriptions more intuitive. When this choice is made, fictitious forces, including the centrifugal force, arise. In a reference frame rotating about an axis through its origin, all objects, regardless of their state of motion, appear to be under the influence of a radially (from the axis of rotation) outward force that is proportional to their mass, to the distance from the axis of rotation of the frame, and to the square of the angular velocity of the frame.Feynman Lectures on Physics, Book 1, 12-11. This is the centrifugal force. As humans usually experience centrifugal force from within the rotating reference frame, e.g. on a merry-go-round or vehicle, this is much more well- known than centripetal force. Motion relative to a rotating frame results in another fictitious force: the Coriolis force. If the rate of rotation of the frame changes, a third fictitious force (the Euler force) is required. These fictitious forces are necessary for the formulation of correct equations of motion in a rotating reference frame and allow Newton's laws to be used in their normal form in such a frame (with one exception: the fictitious forces do not obey Newton's third law: they have no equal and opposite counterparts). ==Examples Vehicle driving round a curve === A common experience that gives rise to the idea of a centrifugal force is encountered by passengers riding in a vehicle, such as a car, that is changing direction. If a car is traveling at a constant speed along a straight road, then a passenger inside is not accelerating and, according to Newton's second law of motion, the net force acting on him is therefore zero (all forces acting on him cancel each other out). If the car enters a curve that bends to the left, the passenger experiences an apparent force that seems to be pulling him towards the right. This is the fictitious centrifugal force. It is needed within the passenger's local frame of reference to explain his sudden tendency to start accelerating to the right relative to the car—a tendency which he must resist by applying a rightward force to the car (for instance, a frictional force against the seat) in order to remain in a fixed position inside. Since he pushes the seat toward the right, Newton's third law says that the seat pushes him toward the left. The centrifugal force must be included in the passenger's reference frame (in which the passenger remains at rest): it counteracts the leftward force applied to the passenger by the seat, and explains why this otherwise unbalanced force does not cause him to accelerate. However, it would be apparent to a stationary observer watching from an overpass above that the frictional force exerted on the passenger by the seat is not being balanced; it constitutes a net force to the left, causing the passenger to accelerate toward the inside of the curve, as he must in order to keep moving with the car rather than proceeding in a straight line as he otherwise would. Thus the \\"centrifugal force\\" he feels is the result of a \\"centrifugal tendency\\" caused by inertia. Similar effects are encountered in aeroplanes and roller coasters where the magnitude of the apparent force is often reported in \\"G's\\". ===Stone on a string=== If a stone is whirled round on a string, in a horizontal plane, the only real force acting on the stone in the horizontal plane is applied by the string (gravity acts vertically). There is a net force on the stone in the horizontal plane which acts toward the center. In an inertial frame of reference, were it not for this net force acting on the stone, the stone would travel in a straight line, according to Newton's first law of motion. In order to keep the stone moving in a circular path, a centripetal force, in this case provided by the string, must be continuously applied to the stone. As soon as it is removed (for example if the string breaks) the stone moves in a straight line. In this inertial frame, the concept of centrifugal force is not required as all motion can be properly described using only real forces and Newton's laws of motion. In a frame of reference rotating with the stone around the same axis as the stone, the stone is stationary. However, the force applied by the string is still acting on the stone. If one were to apply Newton's laws in their usual (inertial frame) form, one would conclude that the stone should accelerate in the direction of the net applied force—towards the axis of rotation—which it does not do. The centrifugal force and other fictitious forces must be included along with the real forces in order to apply Newton's laws of motion in the rotating frame. ===Earth=== The Earth constitutes a rotating reference frame because it rotates once every 23 hours and 56 minutes around its axis. Because the rotation is slow, the fictitious forces it produces are often small, and in everyday situations can generally be neglected. Even in calculations requiring high precision, the centrifugal force is generally not explicitly included, but rather lumped in with the gravitational force: the strength and direction of the local \\"gravity\\" at any point on the Earth's surface is actually a combination of gravitational and centrifugal forces. However, the fictitious forces can be of arbitrary size. For example, in an Earth-bound reference system, the fictitious force (the net of Coriolis and centrifugal forces) is enormous and is responsible for the sun orbiting around the Earth (in the Earth-bound reference system). This is due to the large mass and velocity of the sun (relative to the Earth). Weight of an object at the poles and on the equator If an object is weighed with a simple spring balance at one of the Earth's poles, there are two forces acting on the object: the Earth's gravity, which acts in a downward direction, and the equal and opposite restoring force in the spring, acting upward. Since the object is stationary and not accelerating, there is no net force acting on the object and the force from the spring is equal in magnitude to the force of gravity on the object. In this case, the balance shows the value of the force of gravity on the object. When the same object is weighed on the equator, the same two real forces act upon the object. However, the object is moving in a circular path as the Earth rotates and therefore experiencing a centripetal acceleration. When considered in an inertial frame (that is to say, one that is not rotating with the Earth), the non-zero acceleration means that force of gravity will not balance with the force from the spring. In order to have a net centripetal force, the magnitude of the restoring force of the spring must be less than the magnitude of force of gravity. Less restoring force in the spring is reflected on the scale as less weight — about 0.3% less at the equator than at the poles.\\"Curious About Astronomy?\\" , Cornell University, retrieved June 2007 In the Earth reference frame (in which the object being weighed is at rest), the object does not appear to be accelerating, however the two real forces, gravity and the force from the spring, are the same magnitude and do not balance. The centrifugal force must be included to make the sum of the forces be zero to match the apparent lack of acceleration. Note: In fact, the observed weight difference is more — about 0.53%. Earth's gravity is a bit stronger at the poles than at the equator, because the Earth is not a perfect sphere, so an object at the poles is slightly closer to the center of the Earth than one at the equator; this effect combines with the centrifugal force to produce the observed weight difference. == Derivation == For the following formalism, the rotating frame of reference is regarded as a special case of a non-inertial reference frame that is rotating relative to an inertial reference frame denoted the stationary frame. === Time derivatives in a rotating frame === In a rotating frame of reference, the time derivatives of any vector function of time—such as the velocity and acceleration vectors of an object—will differ from its time derivatives in the stationary frame. If are the components of with respect to unit vectors directed along the axes of the rotating frame (i.e. ), then the first time derivative of with respect to the rotating frame is, by definition, . If the absolute angular velocity of the rotating frame is then the derivative of with respect to the stationary frame is related to by the equation: {\\\\operatorname{d}t} = \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\boldsymbol{P}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t}\\\\right] + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{P}\\\\ ,}} where \\\\times denotes the vector cross product. In other words, the rate of change of in the stationary frame is the sum of its apparent rate of change in the rotating frame and a rate of rotation \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{P} attributable to the motion of the rotating frame. The vector has magnitude equal to the rate of rotation and is directed along the axis of rotation according to the right-hand rule. === Acceleration === Newton's law of motion for a particle of mass m written in vector form is: : \\\\boldsymbol{F} = m\\\\boldsymbol{a}\\\\ , where is the vector sum of the physical forces applied to the particle and is the absolute acceleration (that is, acceleration in an inertial frame) of the particle, given by: : \\\\boldsymbol{a}=\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}^2\\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t^2} \\\\ , where is the position vector of the particle. By applying the transformation above from the stationary to the rotating frame three times (twice to \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} and once to \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t}\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t}\\\\right]), the absolute acceleration of the particle can be written as: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{a} &=\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}^2\\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t^2} = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t}\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} \\\\left( \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t}\\\\right] + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{r}\\\\ \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}^2 \\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t^2} \\\\right] + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\times \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d} \\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} \\\\right] + \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{r} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}^2 \\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t^2} \\\\right] + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\times \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d} \\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} \\\\right] + \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{r} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\times \\\\left( \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t}\\\\right] + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{r}\\\\ \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}^2 \\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t^2} \\\\right] + \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{r} + 2 \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\times \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d} \\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} \\\\right] + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\times ( \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{r}) \\\\ . \\\\end{align} === Force === The apparent acceleration in the rotating frame is . An observer unaware of the rotation would expect this to be zero in the absence of outside forces. However, Newton's laws of motion apply only in the inertial frame and describe dynamics in terms of the absolute acceleration . Therefore, the observer perceives the extra terms as contributions due to fictitious forces. These terms in the apparent acceleration are independent of mass; so it appears that each of these fictitious forces, like gravity, pulls on an object in proportion to its mass. When these forces are added, the equation of motion has the form:Taylor (2005). p. 342. : \\\\boldsymbol{F} - m\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{r} - 2m \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\times \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d} \\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} \\\\right] - m\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\times (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{r}) = m\\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}^2 \\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t^2} \\\\right] \\\\ . From the perspective of the rotating frame, the additional force terms are experienced just like the real external forces and contribute to the apparent acceleration. Taylor (2005). p. 329. The additional terms on the force side of the equation can be recognized as, reading from left to right, the Euler force -m \\\\operatorname{d}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}/\\\\operatorname{d}t \\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{r}, the Coriolis force -2m \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\times \\\\left[ \\\\operatorname{d} \\\\boldsymbol{r}/\\\\operatorname{d}t \\\\right], and the centrifugal force -m\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\times (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{r}), respectively. Unlike the other two fictitious forces, the centrifugal force always points radially outward from the axis of rotation of the rotating frame, with magnitude , and unlike the Coriolis force in particular, it is independent of the motion of the particle in the rotating frame. As expected, for a non-rotating inertial frame of reference (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\omega=0) the centrifugal force and all other fictitious forces disappear. Similarly, as the centrifugal force is proportional to the distance from object to the axis of rotation of the frame, the centrifugal force vanishes for objects that lie upon the axis. == Absolute rotation == immiscible liquids rotating around a vertical axis is an upward-opening circular paraboloid. When analysed in a rotating reference frame of the planet, centrifugal force causes rotating planets to assume the shape of an oblate spheroid. Three scenarios were suggested by Newton to answer the question of whether the absolute rotation of a local frame can be detected; that is, if an observer can decide whether an observed object is rotating or if the observer is rotating. * The shape of the surface of water rotating in a bucket. The shape of the surface becomes concave to balance the centrifugal force against the other forces upon the liquid. * The tension in a string joining two spheres rotating about their center of mass. The tension in the string will be proportional to the centrifugal force on each sphere as it rotates around the common center of mass. In these scenarios, the effects attributed to centrifugal force are only observed in the local frame (the frame in which the object is stationary) if the object is undergoing absolute rotation relative to an inertial frame. By contrast, in an inertial frame, the observed effects arise as a consequence of the inertia and the known forces without the need to introduce a centrifugal force. Based on this argument, the privileged frame, wherein the laws of physics take on the simplest form, is a stationary frame in which no fictitious forces need to be invoked. Within this view of physics, any other phenomenon that is usually attributed to centrifugal force can be used to identify absolute rotation. For example, the oblateness of a sphere of freely flowing material is often explained in terms of centrifugal force. The oblate spheroid shape reflects, following Clairaut's theorem, the balance between containment by gravitational attraction and dispersal by centrifugal force. That the Earth is itself an oblate spheroid, bulging at the equator where the radial distance and hence the centrifugal force is larger, is taken as one of the evidences for its absolute rotation. == Applications == The operations of numerous common rotating mechanical systems are most easily conceptualized in terms of centrifugal force. For example: * A centrifugal governor regulates the speed of an engine by using spinning masses that move radially, adjusting the throttle, as the engine changes speed. In the reference frame of the spinning masses, centrifugal force causes the radial movement. * A centrifugal clutch is used in small engine-powered devices such as chain saws, go-karts and model helicopters. It allows the engine to start and idle without driving the device but automatically and smoothly engages the drive as the engine speed rises. Inertial drum brake ascenders used in rock climbing and the inertia reels used in many automobile seat belts operate on the same principle. * Centrifugal forces can be used to generate artificial gravity, as in proposed designs for rotating space stations. The Mars Gravity Biosatellite would have studied the effects of Mars-level gravity on mice with gravity simulated in this way. * Spin casting and centrifugal casting are production methods that use centrifugal force to disperse liquid metal or plastic throughout the negative space of a mold. * Centrifuges are used in science and industry to separate substances. In the reference frame spinning with the centrifuge, the centrifugal force induces a hydrostatic pressure gradient in fluid-filled tubes oriented perpendicular to the axis of rotation, giving rise to large buoyant forces which push low-density particles inward. Elements or particles denser than the fluid move outward under the influence of the centrifugal force. This is effectively Archimedes' principle as generated by centrifugal force as opposed to being generated by gravity. * Some amusement rides make use of centrifugal forces. For instance, a Gravitron's spin forces riders against a wall and allows riders to be elevated above the machine's floor in defiance of Earth's gravity. Nevertheless, all of these systems can also be described without requiring the concept of centrifugal force, in terms of motions and forces in a stationary frame, at the cost of taking somewhat more care in the consideration of forces and motions within the system. ==History of conceptions of centrifugal and centripetal forces== The conception of centrifugal force has evolved since the time of Huygens, Newton, Leibniz, and Hooke who expressed early conceptions of it. Its modern conception as a fictitious force arising in a rotating reference frame evolved in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Centrifugal force has also played a role in debates in classical mechanics about detection of absolute motion. Newton suggested two arguments to answer the question of whether absolute rotation can be detected: the rotating bucket argument, and the rotating spheres argument. An English translation is found at According to Newton, in each scenario the centrifugal force would be observed in the object's local frame (the frame where the object is stationary) only if the frame were rotating with respect to absolute space. Nearly two centuries later, Mach's principle was proposed where, instead of absolute rotation, the motion of the distant stars relative to the local inertial frame gives rise through some (hypothetical) physical law to the centrifugal force and other inertia effects. Today's view is based upon the idea of an inertial frame of reference, which privileges observers for which the laws of physics take on their simplest form, and in particular, frames that do not use centrifugal forces in their equations of motion in order to describe motions correctly. The analogy between centrifugal force (sometimes used to create artificial gravity) and gravitational forces led to the equivalence principle of general relativity.Barbour, Julian B. and Herbert Pfister (1995). Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity. Birkhäuser. , p. 69.Eriksson, Ingrid V. (2008). Science education in the 21st century. Nova Books. , p. 194. ==Other uses of the term== While the majority of the scientific literature uses the term centrifugal force to refer to the particular fictitious force that arises in rotating frames, there are a few limited instances in the literature of the term applied to other distinct physical concepts. One of these instances occurs in Lagrangian mechanics. Lagrangian mechanics formulates mechanics in terms of generalized coordinates {qk}, which can be as simple as the usual polar coordinates (r,\\\\ \\\\theta) or a much more extensive list of variables.For an introduction, see for example For a description of generalized coordinates, see Within this formulation the motion is described in terms of generalized forces, using in place of Newton's laws the Euler- Lagrange equations. Among the generalized forces, those involving the square of the time derivatives {(dqk ⁄ dt )2} are sometimes called centrifugal forces. In the case of motion in a central potential the Lagrangian centrifugal force has the same form as the fictitious centrifugal force derived in a co-rotating frame.See p. 5 in . The companion paper is However, the Lagrangian use of \\"centrifugal force\\" in other, more general cases has only a limited connection to the Newtonian definition. In another instance the term refers to the reaction force to a centripetal force, or reactive centrifugal force. A body undergoing curved motion, such as circular motion, is accelerating toward a center at any particular point in time. This centripetal acceleration is provided by a centripetal force, which is exerted on the body in curved motion by some other body. In accordance with Newton's third law of motion, the body in curved motion exerts an equal and opposite force on the other body. This reactive force is exerted by the body in curved motion on the other body that provides the centripetal force and its direction is from that other body toward the body in curved motion. Mook, Delo E. & Thomas Vargish (1987). Inside relativity. Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press. , p. 47. Signell, Peter (2002). \\"Acceleration and force in circular motion\\" Physnet. Michigan State University, \\"Acceleration and force in circular motion\\", §5b, p. 7. Mohanty, A. K. (2004). Fluid Mechanics. PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd. , p. 121. This reaction force is sometimes described as a centrifugal inertial reaction, that is, a force that is centrifugally directed, which is a reactive force equal and opposite to the centripetal force that is curving the path of the mass. The concept of the reactive centrifugal force is sometimes used in mechanics and engineering. It is sometimes referred to as just centrifugal force rather than as reactive centrifugal force although this usage is deprecated in elementary mechanics. == See also == * Balancing of rotating masses * Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration * Equivalence principle * Folk physics * Lagrangian point * Lamm equation ==References External links == * Category:Acceleration Category:Fictitious forces Category:Force Category:Mechanics Category:Rotation ","title":"Centrifugal force"},{"id":"19265718","text":"Marvin Wilfred Feldman (December 20, 1915 – August 6, 2000) was a Major League Baseball player.

It was a conventional biplane design with staggered wings, and seated the pilot and observer in tandem in an open cockpit. Like Knoller's preceding C.I design, the upper wing was swept back, but not as far as it had been on the earlier aircraft. The structure was wooden throughout, with the wings skinned in fabric and the fuselage in plywood. The interplane struts were made of steel and arranged in a warren truss configuration. Initial production was undertaken in three batches of 24 aircraft, one each by Aviatik, Lohner, and WKF, with the first machine delivered to the Army in September 1916.

A single example is preserved at the National Technical Museum in Prague. ==Operational history== Relatively few Knoller C.II aircraft were issued to front-line units, with almost unanimous criticism of the strength, build quality and flying characteristics.

Her best-known books are the Evan Delaney novels, first published in 2002. In June 2008, she published the first novel in a new series, featuring forensic psychiatrist Jo Beckett. More recently she has published three stand-alone novels—Ransom River (June 2012), The Shadow Tracer (June 2013), and Phantom Instinct (June 2014)—and two novels in a new series, Unsub (2017) and Into the Black Nowhere (2018). Her first novel, China Lake, received the 2009 Edgar Award for Best Paperback Original novel upon its publication in the United States in 2008. Her first Jo Beckett novel, The Dirty Secrets Club, won the 2009 The Romantic Times Reviewers' Choice award for Best Procedural Novel. Her ninth novel, The Nightmare Thief, won the 2012 Audie Award for Thriller/Suspense Audiobook of the Year. ==Biography== Gardiner was born in Oklahoma and grew up in Santa Barbara, California. She currently lives with her husband, Paul Shreve, in Austin, Texas. She has two sons- Mark and Nathaniel and a daughter- Katherine. Gardiner has said: \\"I write thrillers.... I used to practice law. I taught writing at the University of California. Of course, there's more – and because the Internet can fact- check you, faster than you can type 'Sarah Palin', I'm going to come clean: It's true that I used to be a mime. But only before mimes became annoying. And yes, I did go in costume to the Star Trek exhibition in Hyde Park. But I did not wear the Ferengi ears. Gardiner is the daughter of English professor Frank C. Gardiner and Sally (née Love) Gardiner. Meg attended Dos Pueblos High School in Goleta, a community just north of Santa Barbara, graduating in June 1975. Following graduation, she attended Stanford University, where she attained her Bachelor's degree in Economics and lettered in track. She went on to graduate from Stanford Law School and to practice law in Los Angeles, before returning to Santa Barbara to teach legal research and writing at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She lived in Surrey, near London, until 2013, when she moved to Austin. ==Writing career== Writing is her \\"third career ... In earlier incarnations, I practiced law in Los Angeles and taught writing at the University of California, Santa Barbara. After living in California most of my life, in the early 1990s, I moved with my family to the United Kingdom\\", said Gardiner. It was during her freedom in those early years in the UK that she wrote her first novel, completing a task she'd set for herself a decade earlier. \\"I always wanted to write a novel. And it was time to put up or shut up.\\" Her first novel, China Lake, was published by Hodder & Stoughton in 2002. Since then, Gardiner has written full-time and published eleven additional titles. \\"It's a job I'm immensely lucky to have.\\" Gardiner says that she writes crime fiction because it \\"gets to the heart of the human condition. It's about people facing a severe danger, or confronting an evil that has invaded their world. It's also fun. I get to slingshot readers into situations they would hate to face in real life. A kid in danger? Bring It On. Sadistic killers? Here, have another helping. My book gave you nightmares? Thank you, that's wonderful.\\" She likes thriller fiction \\"because it grabs readers, takes them on a menacing ride to places they'd hate to go in real life and returns them safely, feeling thrilled. And especially because crime writing is about morality: finding justice, restoring order out of chaos.\\" As the daughter of an English professor, \\"I was obviously in a home where books and reading and writing mattered,\\" Gardiner told the Santa Barbara Independent newspaper. At Dos Pueblos High School in Goleta, California, she reported for the Charger Account, the school paper, but her father urged caution to his budding writer. \\"He said I could write novels after college and be another novelist who waits on tables or I could become a lawyer who writes novels.\\" She heeded his warning, but later left the law behind and began writing. \\"I decided I didn't want to argue for a living\\", she said. Instead, as the title of her blog \\"Lying for a Living\\" implies, she now lies for a living. ==Gardiner on writing== Gardiner says that she tries, in her writing, \\"to explore the boundary between morality and wrongdoing. When is it justified to go outside the law to right a wrong? When can you use ruthless violence to defend somebody you love?\\" She considers no subject to be taboo. \\"No subject should be off-limits. That road leads to timidity and repression. However, I think certain approaches to subjects are repulsive. Gratuitous, protracted, explicit violence is sometimes offered as a feast, and portrayed with such lurid and eager detail that it becomes almost pornographic. But we should argue about such approaches, not forbid them.\\" She credits her training as an attorney as part of the foundation for her writing skills. \\"The intellectual rigor prepared me for a lot of things. The grounding in legal knowledge has been helpful in practice, in teaching, and in being a writer. I learned not to write in legalese. I learned how to tell a story and take a position.\\" ==Gardiner on Evan Delaney== Gardiner has described Evan Delaney as a woman who is \\"spirited, quick-witted, and fights hard for the people she loves . . . She thinks the world is tragic and so you'd better laugh whenever you can. Pour her a glass of Jack Daniel's and ask her about finding that FBI agent hogtied to her bed, stripped and ranting. Just don't get on her bad side, because she may have a heat-seeking missile stashed in her car.\\" Asked whether the character is autobiographical, Gardiner has said, \\"Evan is me with the brakes off. She says and does things I would never have the chutzpah to say or do myself. We share a background as lawyers, Californians, and tomboys. And we share a sense of humor, though hers is darker than mine. However, I live a calm life compared to Evan. I've never had to defend myself with a ferret.\\" ==Gardiner on Jo Beckett== The lead character in Gardiner's second series, Jo Beckett, MD, is a forensic psychiatrist from San Francisco. Interviewed by Poe's Deadly Daughters, Gardiner explained Beckett's role in this way: \\"Jo calls herself a deadshrinker. She analyzes the dead for the police. She's the last resort in baffling cases. When the cops and the medical examiner can't determine the manner of a victim's death, they turn to Jo to perform a psychological autopsy and figure out whether it was accident, suicide, or murder.\\" Gardiner has summarized Beckett's work in this way: \\"Jo doesn't pick up gory bits of trace evidence with tweezers. She digs into people's passions, obsessions and secrets to find out what killed them. Her territory is the psyche and the human heart.\\" ==Book Reviews== Both of Gardiner's series and all of her stand-alone novels have received positive reviews. In his Entertainment Weekly column, Stephen King said \\"I need to tell you about Meg Gardiner, who simply must be part of the Big Plan. And if you love great thrillers, you'll want to listen.\\" King called the Evan Delaney novels \\"simply put, the finest crime-suspense series I've come across in the last twenty years.\\" Kirkus Reviews named The Shadow Tracer one of its Best Mysteries and Thrillers of 2013. About Phantom Instinct, the Associated Press wrote: \\"'Phantom Instinct' is simply a fantastic story, told at breakneck speed. Gardiner is one of the best thriller writers around, and this is arguably her best work yet...one of this summer's best reads.\\" ==Bibliography== To date, Gardiner has written fourteen published novels, including five in the Evan Delaney series, four in the Jo Beckett series, two in the Unsub series, and three standalone works. ===Evan Delaney novels=== #China Lake (2002) #Mission Canyon (2003) #Jericho Point (2004) #Crosscut (2005) #Kill Chain (2006) ===Jo Beckett novels=== #The Dirty Secrets Club (2008) #The Memory Collector (June 2009) #The Liar's Lullaby (June 2010) #The Nightmare Thief (June 2011) ===Unsub novels=== #Unsub (2017) #Into the Black Nowhere (2018) #The Dark Corners of the Night (2020) ===Other novels=== *Ransom River (June 2012) *The Shadow Tracer (June 2013) *Phantom Instinct (2014) (Published in the UK under the title The Burning Mind (2014), as M.G.

The episode first aired in the United States on November 26, 2000, on Fox and on March 1, 2001, on Sky1 in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It was written by Vince Gilligan and directed by Rod Hardy. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.3 and was watched by 13.6 million households. The episode received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. The series centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and her new partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)—following the alien abduction of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Scully, working alone, pursues a cult that worships a slug-like organism that it believes it to be the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. But in her efforts to save an injured stranger, she discovers she is in over her head. The episode was written by Gilligan to be intentionally \\"creepy\\". Furthermore, Gilligan wanted to show the audience that John Doggett was a good person and an ally of Scully's. The parasitic creature that was used in the episode was designed to look like a banana slug and was created via animatronics. Several of the scenes were so gruesome that producer Paul Rabwin later noted that some of the cameramen \\"start[ed] to lose it\\" during filming. == Plot == In the desert near Sugarville, Utah, a hitchhiker catches a ride from a passing bus, which soon stops without explanation. The hitchhiker watches a man with crutches leave the bus, joined by the other passengers. Following them, he sees them stone the man to death. They later surround the hitchhiker as he futilely tries to escape. FBI special agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) goes to investigate the murder. The victim, a twenty-two-year-old backpacker, now shows signs of body decay usually associated with old age. Later, at a pay phone, she asks her partner, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), to check the X-Files for cases mentioning glycoproteins. While discussing the case with Doggett, the bus passes her, and she follows it to a gas station in the middle of the desert. A man with an injured hand learns that she is a medical doctor and fills her car with gasoline laced with water. After her car stalls, Scully returns to the gas station and is told that rain got into the gas canister. The attendant tells Scully that Mr. Milsap is the only person with a working phone, but she discovers that the line is dead. Mr. Milsap offers Scully a room at the local boarding house, but Scully tries the rest of the town only to be ignored by everyone; they are all too engrossed in Bible-study groups. Disturbed by the turn of events, she keeps her gun close at hand. The next morning, Mr. Milsap tells Scully that there is a man who needs help downstairs. She goes with him and finds the hitchhiker from the episode's opening scene having a seizure. She advises them to take him to the hospital, but they pretend that they do not have any cars. While examining the man, Scully discovers a strange, circular wound on his back. Meanwhile, Doggett calls the sheriff at Scully's original destination and learns that Scully has not yet arrived. So he sets out to find her. The sick man begins to recover, and Scully talks to him while the townspeople are gone. He does not seem to know who he is or how he arrived. She inspects his wound again and finds a lump moving along the man's spine; digging into the open wound, she pulls out a piece of a large worm. Scully talks with the hitchhiker, Hank, about the creature and believes she cannot get it out without killing him. Scully goes to find a car but, moments after leaving, Hank immediately tells the townspeople what she is up to and that \\"another swap\\" is needed. Concurrently, Doggett arrives in Utah and informs the Sheriff about a series of X-Files involving similar back wounds and death by stoning. Scully is eventually captured by the townspeople and the worm is inserted into her body. Eventually, Doggett finds Scully, cuts the worm out of her, and shoots the creature dead. Later, Scully is packing her things in the hospital when Doggett comes in to inform her about the trial of the cult members; they are offering little defense except that they claim that they are being persecuted for their religious beliefs. Scully muses that they thought the worm was the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. She apologizes to Doggett for going out on the mission alone and promises never to do so again. ==ProductionWriting=== right \\"Roadrunners\\" was written by Vince Gilligan and was inspired by the thriller film Bad Day at Black Rock (1955). The script, called \\"uncharacteristically brutal\\" for Gilliganwho had been noted for his comedic episodes like season five's \\"Bad Blood\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 238 and \\"X-Cops\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 239was written with the expressed intent to make, according to Gilligan, \\"a really all-out scary, creepy, get under-your-skin—literally and figuratively—X-File.\\" Gilligan also wanted the episode to show the audience that John Doggett was on the side of the heroes.Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 187 The writer explained, \\"I wanted this gangbusters episode, one that showed Doggett was a good guy; someone to be counted on.\\" Many fans were unhappy with Doggett's condescension towards Scully during her apology.Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 189 Robert Patrick, the actor who portrayed Doggett, however, had a different interpretation: \\"The whole essence of the scene was, 'Look, I'm here for you. I've got your back. We're partners now.' And you give that the weight of a marine saying to someone, 'I'll jump on a grenade for you, so you can trust me.' The idea was to really assure the fans that the show was continuing on.\\" Several of the characters in the episode were named after real-life individuals, including: the character of Hank, who was named after the brother of Vince Gilligan's girlfriend; Mr. Milsap, whose name is a reference to the American country music singer and pianist Ronnie Milsap; and Sheriff Ciolino who was named after Gilligan's mortgage broker. ===Directing=== The episode was directed by Rod Hardy, making it his first credit for the series.Hardy, 4:30–4:35 Hardy was offered the role after an unknown individual working at The X-Files saw his TBS remake of the film High Noon.Hardy, 9:40–9:55 The parasitic creature that was used in the episode was created using animatronics and was designed to look like a banana slug. During the scene where the creature is inserted into Scully's back, the production crew created a false fiberglass back for Gillian Anderson. To create the illusion that the creature was crawling up the body, the fiberglass was placed on top of Anderson, and then the animatronic slug was pressed against the fake back. Anderson later described the scene as \\"fun to shoot\\", although she also called it \\"exhausting\\" because she had to struggle on the bed, all the while tied down, with her arms being attached to the headboard and her legs to the footboard. Paul Rabwin later noted that he had several cameramen \\"start to lose it\\" during the scene. ==ReceptionRatings=== \\"Roadrunners\\" first aired in the United States on Fox on November 26, 2000. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.3, meaning that it was seen by 8.3% of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 8.37 million households, and 13.6 million viewers. The episode ranked as the 38th most-watched episode for the week ending November 26. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the episode made its first appearance on television on March 1, 2001, on Sky1. \\"Roadrunners\\" was the seventh most watched program that week and received 0.67 million viewers. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e Feb. 26-Mar 4, 2001\\", listed under Sky 1 Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"A desolate town. A bizarre cult. A horrifying ritual. And Scully may be the next victim.\\" ===Reviews=== \\"Roadrunners\\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the \\"finest stand-alone episode\\" of the show's eighth season. Harrisson praised the character development in \\"Roadrunners\\" and noted that the episode \\"effectively brings [Scully and Doggett] together as partners.\\" Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five.Shearman and Pearson, p. 232 The two note that, \\"for the first half-hour, this works as a slow burn horror story ... It's the transition of Gillian Anderson's performance from wry exasperation to outright paranoia ... which makes this so effective.\\" Shearman and Pearson did, however, slightly criticize the cutting of John Doggett's role to a minimum. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"A–\\" and wrote that it \\"is an episode that’s dedicated to helping us move past the Mulder era.\\" She praised the creepiness of Gilligan's script, as well as the characterization of Scully, writing that even though she is in a situation that is over her head, she is still smart in her attempts to escape; he also praised Anderson's acting. However, VanDerWerff was more critical of the final scene, noting that it made Doggett come across as \\"kind of an asshole\\". Paul Spragg of Xposé wrote positively of the episode, saying it features a \\"return to the body horror stories that had worked so well in the early seasons\\". Spragg added that \\"Roadrunners\\" is \\"certainly close\\" to the highly acclaimed first-season episode \\"Ice\\". Not all reviews were positive. George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of the Knight Ridder Tribune wrote that the episode's slug \\"continued the series' fine tradition of monsters that made us queasy as we squirmed in our seats\\". Despite enjoying the gore and the reality of Scully's isolation, the two were critical of the cult's motivations, writing that \\"we were given absolutely no clue as to why the Utah cult members believed the slug represented the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.\\" The two ultimately concluded that \\"Roadrunners\\" fell \\"well short of a classic.\\" Sarah Stegall highly criticized the episode, calling it \\"a bad mix of The Fly and The Kindred, with plenty of X-Files classic paranoia but none of the finesse we've seen before.\\" Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it no stars out of four. She heavily derided the plot, sarcastically referring to Doggett as a \\"man's man\\" and the parasite a \\"phallic-shaped giant slug\\". Furthermore, she criticized Scully's actions to go off on an assignment without telling her partner. Dave Golder from SFX criticized the episode and called it a retread of the first season episode \\"Ice\\". == Notes FootnotesWork cited== * * * == External links == * * \\"Roadrunners\\" at TV.com Category:2000 American television episodes Category:Television episodes written by Vince Gilligan Category:The X-Files (season 8) episodes Category:Television episodes set in Utah Category:Television episodes set in Washington, D.C.

The episode first aired in the United States on January 13, 2002, on the Fox network. It was written by executive producer Vince Gilligan, and directed by co-executive producer Michelle MacLaren. The episode is a \\"monster-of-the-week\\" episode, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the mythology, or overarching fictional history, of The X-Files. \\"John Doe\\" earned a Nielsen rating of 5.0 and was viewed by 5.28 million households. The episode received largely positive reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett wakes up in Mexico with no memory of who he is or how he got there. Meanwhile, Reyes and Scully struggle to locate him. The two later discover that Doggett's memory has been taken by a \\"memory vampire\\" that works for a drug cartel. \\"John Doe\\", which was written after Gilligan had been thinking of a story involving a \\"memory vampire\\" for months, was MacLaren's directorial debut. Noted director Kim Manners helped guide her through the process. Director of photography Bill Roe used specific lighting for the episode; indoor scenes are dark and hard to make out whereas outside scenes are bright and over-saturated with light. The Mexican hotel apartment was created from Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) old apartment set. == Plot == John Doggett (Robert Patrick) awakens inside an abandoned warehouse to find a man stealing one of his shoes. Doggett chases the man outside, where he summons two Mexican police officers. One of the policemen hits the man with his nightstick, while the other demands his identification. When Doggett finds he has no papers, the officer asks him his name. Doggett is shocked to realize he can't remember his own identity. Doggett is taken to the local jail, where he meets a fellow prisoner named Domingo. Domingo is eventually freed and offers to have Doggett bailed out as well, under the condition that Doggett help him perform his criminal tasks. Doggett agrees, but changes his mind once he is released. Nestor, Domingo's friend, pulls a gun, but Doggett quickly overpowers him and takes the weapon. Doggett returns to the warehouse in hopes of finding clues to his identity. From time to time, he experiences flashbacks of his wife and son, but has no idea who they are. In the meantime, in Washington, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) examine video footage from a security camera positioned at the Mexican border. FBI Deputy Director Alvin Kersh disbands the task force searching for Doggett, believing the video is proof that he entered Mexico on his own free will and was not abducted. Meanwhile, Doggett phones a U.S. Marine Corps public affairs office, hoping his Marine tattoo will shed some light on his true identity. Before he is able to ask any questions, he notices policemen nearby and flees. Scully traces Doggett's phone call and has Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) travel to the Mexican town where he was last seen. It is revealed that Caballero, an enforcer for the local drug cartel, is a \\"memory vampire\\": he can absorb the memories of those posing a threat to the cartel. Reyes finds Doggett and faces gunfire from the police, who are likewise controlled by the cartel; all the while, Reyes attempts to remind Doggett of who they are. Doggett remembers his son. The agents are rescued by Skinner and the Mexican Federales. Doggett tearfully admits that he is happy to have all of his memories, even the bad ones, \\"as long as I remember the good.” == Production Writing and directing=== right \\"John Doe\\" was written by executive producer Vince Gilligan and directed by Michelle MacLaren. The episode marked Gilligan's first solo episode for the ninth season. Gilligan had \\"fiddled\\" with the story of a \\"memory vampire\\" for months, before writing it. The notion to set the story in Mexico and center it around Robert Patrick's character was Frank Spotnitz's idea. From there the story \\"went together fairly easily.\\" \\"John Doe\\" was co- executive MacLaren's directorial debut. Although she had never helmed an episode before, MacLaren had learned much working with Kim Manners, one of the series' prolific directors. She later noted, \\"Kim taught me how he breaks down a script and prepares his shot list. The most powerful thing he said to me was that he imagines the show all cut together and sees the movie in his head and really visualizes it.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 202 Gilligan later said that MacLaren \\"really rose to the occasion and really did her homework.\\" The bus crash scene was created with the use of elaborate \\"smoke and mirrors\\", according to Gilligan. Over nine cameras were used to film the entire scene. Several of the cameras were under-cranked in order to give the illusion that the bus was going faster than it really was. A steel ramp was buried in the ground to flip the bus. Despite the finished product, Gilligan later joked, \\"You could have stood there and had a sandwich while the thing was backing up: it was so slow.\\" ===Filming and effects=== Director of photography Bill Roe borrowed motifs from Steven Soderbergh's film Traffic (2000) for some of the shots. Roe also made the decision to shoot the outdoor scenes using \\"exteriors three, four stops over what you should shoot it at\\", resulting in very washed- out palate. When talking about the episode, Roe said: \\"It was really dark so we had this huge contrast of lighting. It was dark and warm and brown. When you go inside, you can barely see things, but when you're outside, it's just blaring.\\" To create the Mexican town featured in the episode, scenes were filmed at a small town located outside of Los Angeles. A matte of the town's background and blue sky were then cut and a faux Mexican background was added. Special effects expert Mat Beck also digitally added a number of posters into outdoor scenes. When creating the Mexican hotel apartment, the crew redecorated what was once Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) apartment set. Production Designer Corey Kaplan said of the development of the episode that, \\"It was very creative and very rewarding for us as an art department, to create the complete total look of being in another culture.\\" Several Spanish songs are featured in the episode. When the characters are at the cantina, the song \\"La Calentura\\" by Roberto Ruiz is playing. During scenes in the garage, \\"Juana La Cubana\\" by Fito Olivares is featured. == Reception == \\"John Doe\\" first aired in the United States on January 13, 2002. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 5.0, meaning that it was seen by 5.0% of the nation's estimated households and was viewed by 5.28 million households. \\"John Doe\\" was the 66th most watched episode of television that aired during the week ending January 13. The episode later aired in the United Kingdom on December 16, 2002 on BBC Two. The episode received largely positive reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A– rating. Juliette Harrisson of Den of Geek named \\"John Doe\\" the best stand-alone episode of season nine and called it \\"a refreshing change of pace\\". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two praised Gilligan's script and Patrick's performance, noting that the former \\"writes the script with a dirtiness that gives it real power\\" and the latter's acting was \\"extraordinary\\". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson wrote that \\"'John Doe' shows that there's still a fresh take to be had on The X-Files after all\\".Shearman and Pearson, p. 265–266 Meghan Deans of Tor.com applauded the episode and called it \\"a clear bright spot in a dark and dismal season, both in its script and in its shooting.\\" She felt that the focus on Doggett was effectively done, and the script focused on \\"strong character arcs\\", which worked towards its advantage. In the end, she concluded that the episode was \\"part of the X-Files, more so than would an alien or a mutant\\" because it focused on the idea that \\"pain makes you, more pain makes you better, and living within that pain keeps you alive.\\" M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, praised the central premise, the cinematography and Patrick's performance, calling \\"John Doe\\" a \\"stylishly produced entry\\". == Notes FootnotesBibliography== * * == External links == *\\"John Doe\\" at TheXFiles.com * * \\"John Doe\\" at TV.com Category:2002 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about amnesia Category:Television episodes set in Mexico Category:Television episodes written by Vince Gilligan Category:television episodes set in Texas Category:The X-Files (season 9) episodes Category:Television episodes set in Washington, D.C.

Barker was most notably the printer of the King James Bible, one of the most influential and important books ever printed in the English language. He and co-publisher Martin Lucas published the infamous \\"Wicked Bible\\", which contained a typographical error omitting the word not from the sentence Thou shalt not commit adultery. ==Printing career== After working in the printing business for some time, Robert began working with his father's printing company in 1589 and inherited the printing house on 29 November 1599 upon his father's death. Much of Robert's printing work was of an official nature, including prayer books, scriptures, and law books. ===King James Bible=== Reproduction of part of the title-page of the first edition of the King James Bible highlighting Robert Barker The 'Judas' Bible in St Mary's Church, Totnes, Devon, England. This is a copy of the second folio edition of the Authorized Version, printed by Robert Barker in 1613, and given to the church for the use of the Mayor of Totnes. This edition is known as the 'Judas' Bible because in Matthew ch. 26 v. 36 'Judas' appears instead of 'Jesus'. In this copy the mistake (in red circle) has been corrected by a slip of paper pasted over the misprint.According to a note in St Mary's Church, Totnes. In 1611, Robert Barker printed the first edition of the King James Bible. Although it was called \\"Authorized\\" it was not actually \\"authorized\\" by the king, who did take some interest in the work; the entire cost of the printing was undertaken by Barker who ultimately gained little financial reward but some fame for the work. The printing itself was substandard with uneven printing lines, the blackletter typeface used was considered of poor quality, and it contained many mistakes which were corrected in subsequent printings. ===The Wicked Bible=== The Wicked Bible, also known as \\"The Adulterous Bible\\" or \\"The Sinners' Bible\\" was published in 1631 by Robert Barker and Martin Lucas, both royal printers in London, and was intended to be a word-for-word reprint of the King James Bible. However, in the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:14) the word \\"not\\" in the sentence \\"Thou shalt not commit adultery\\" was omitted. About a year later, Barker and Lucas were fined £300 (roughly equivalent to 33,800 pounds today) and were deprived of their printer's licences. The fact that this edition of the Bible contained such a flagrant mistake outraged Charles I of England and George Abbot, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who said then: By order of the king, the authors were called to the Star Chamber, where, upon the fact being proved, the whole impression was called in, and they were fined. The majority of copies of the Wicked Bible were immediately cancelled and burned, and it is rumoured that only eleven survive. ==Imprisonment== In 1635, Barker was imprisoned. In spite of working on what should have been very lucrative business, Robert was not a good businessman and it may well have been this lack of experience and desperation that led him into trouble with the law, not to mention the controversy surrounding the Wicked Bible and resultant fine. Barker never profited from his history-making enterprise: he died in debtors' prison in 1643. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Plomer, Henry R. A Short History of English Printing 1476–1898.

The range was named in honor of future President of the United States, then U.S. Secretary of State James Madison by Meriwether Lewis as the Lewis and Clark Expedition travelled through Montana in 1805. The range extends from West Yellowstone, Montana to Bozeman, Montana and is flanked by the Madison River on the west and the Gallatin River to the east. The highest point in the range is Hilgard Peak at , a remote peak that wasn't climbed until 1948. The Madison Range is the westernmost section of what is collectively referred to as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Most of the range lies within Beaverhead-Deerlodge and Gallatin National Forests. A small portion of the range has been further protected with the creation of the Lee Metcalf Wilderness. The region has grizzly and black bears and at least one pack of wolves. Most other larger mammal species native to the region continue to exist in the range. Quake Lake lies not far to the south of Hilgard Peak. The lake was created by a landslide which dammed the Madison River at the time of the M7.5 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake. ==See also== * List of mountain ranges in Montana ==Notes== Category:Mountain ranges of Montana Category:Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem Category:Landforms of Madison County, Montana Category:Gallatin National Forest Category:Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest Category:Mountain ranges of Idaho ","title":"Madison Range"},{"id":"19266308","text":"Athletes from the Islamic Republic of Iran competed at the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul, South Korea. ==Competitors== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! width=200Sport !! width=60Men !! width=60Women !! width=60Total -  align=leftAthletics  16   16 -  align=leftGoalball  6   6 -  align=leftPowerlifting  1   1 -  align=leftVolleyball  12   12 - !

Charles, a co- founder, with his brother of the town of Evergreen, California, now part of San Jose, was a blacksmith, who found success in real estate (Smith Phelps Realty) and lumber (President of Union Mill and Lumber, Co.) Henry studied at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was mentored by James Hamilton Windrim (1840-1919). Upon graduation, Smith spent four years working with the firm of James H. Windrim & Son (John Torrey Windrim, 1866-1934), returning to the San Francisco bay area to set up practice with a partner, Louis S. Stone, in 1900. The partners specialized in schools, apartments and houses until they dissolved their partnership in 1909. He subsequently practiced solo, continuing the development of a signature talent in the siting of buildings on San Francisco's hilly terrain, and became known as \\"The Hillside Architect.\\" Smith was adept at many architectural styles; there are fine examples in Spanish, Mission and Tudor Revival, Italian Renaissance and Neo-Classicism, often informed with an Arts and Crafts sensibility. He was awarded the Jury Prize \\"for schoolhouse architecture\\" at the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition. Smith was married in Philadelphia on April 25, 1900, to Lillian Troth. They had a son, John Windrim Smith, and a daughter, Elizabeth Clay Smith. They made a home in Los Gatos, California, \\"Far Hills,\\" where Smith could indulge his artistic imagination and love of landscape architecture.

It premiered on the Fox network on . The story for the episode was developed by Steven Maeda and Daniel Arkin, the teleplay was written by Maeda, and the episode was directed by Peter Markle. \\"Redrum\\" is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. The episode received a Nielsen rating of 8.1 and was viewed by 13.2 million households. Overall, the episode received moderately positive reviews from critics. The series centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and her new partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)—following the alien abduction of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, a lawyer friend of Doggett's named Martin Wells tries to clear his name of the crime after his wife is murdered. Unfortunately for him, his perception of time regresses backwards, day by day. This leads to confusion, but ultimately an answer as to who killed Wells' wife. \\"Redrum\\", described as a \\"Twilight Zone- type thriller\\" by critics, heavily featured the actor Joe Morton, who had previously played a role in the 1991 sci-fi film Terminator 2: Judgment Day alongside series co-star Robert Patrick. The title of the episode was purposely picked by episode writer Steven Maeda to be \\"murder\\" spelled backwards, a reference to Stephen King's The Shining. The episode's main character, Martin Wells, was named after famed 19th century author H. G. Wells. ==Plot== Martin Wells, a renowned Baltimore prosecutor, wakes up in a prison cell and notices a stitched-up wound on his right cheek. A guard enters and takes him for his transfer. Wells' long-time friend, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Doggett's partner, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), await him and warn of reporters outside. As he exits the building, a man Wells recognizes draws a pistol and shoots him. Wells stares at Scully's watch as he dies. The hands stop and then begin to turn backwards. Upon waking up again, Wells is surprised to find no bullet wounds on his body. Scully and Doggett arrive to interrogate Wells, but he is confused about what is going on. A furious Doggett claims that he has been accused of murdering his wife, Vicky, and initially believes that Wells is faking his confusion in order to build an insanity defense. However, Doggett shows signs of doubt when he notices Wells' genuine anguish over Vicky's death. Wells is brought into court and he recognizes his father-in-law, Al Cawdry, as the man who shot him. When Wells' next court date is announced to be Thursday, he realizes that he has somehow travelled back to the day before his shooting. When the judge decides to transfer Wells to a different cell, he makes a scene in the court and accuses Cawdry of planning to kill him during the transfer. In his second meeting of the day with Scully and Doggett, Wells explains that he cannot remember the last few days. Scully suggests that maybe he did do it. Wells begins having flashes of the murder but they are unclear. Waiting in his cell, he kills a spider. Later, a nanny cam from his house reveals that the only person to arrive between the police's arrival and the last time his wife is on camera is Martin Wells. Eventually, Wells meets his lawyers and tells them about the nanny cam. However, it turns out that it is Wednesday: Wells is somehow “living the week backwards”. While going to meet Doggett and Scully, Wells gets shoved into a dominos game and while picking them up gets slashed on his right cheek from a man with the spider web tattoo on his hand. Wells tells Doggett and Scully that he is moving backwards in time and cannot recall the past few days. Doggett is skeptical, but Scully hears him out. Wells says there must be a reason for it and Scully suggests that the answer may already be within him. Studying the evidence of the case, Wells has a flash of the murder that reveals the knife in a hand with a spider web tattoo. Martin next awakes in Doggett's home. Wells tells Doggett the description of the killer but the man isn't in lock-up yet because that won't happen until Wednesday. Doggett and Wells arrive at the apartment and retrieve the nanny cam, but discover that someone disabled the cam and used its remote control, a device no one knew about except Mr. and Mrs. Wells and their nanny, Trina Galvez. At Trina Galvez's home, Wells and Doggett discover the killer, a man named Cesar Ocampo, who threatened to kill Galvez's family if she refused him entrance. At the station house, Doggett informs Wells that Ocampo only wants to talk to him. Ocampo reveals that his brother, Hector, was sentenced to time in prison for a false conviction. Wells bargains with Cesar Ocampo, saying that if Cesar confesses to Vicky's murder, he will take a look at his brother's case. Cesar tells him that Hector hung himself in a jail cell a few weeks ago. Doggett calls Martin Wells out into the hall and the police arrest Martin because they have a case against him. Evidence against Ocampo isn't strong enough yet. Martin wakes up in a hotel room, having moved back to the night of the day before, a little over two hours before the murder of his wife is supposed to take place. Desperate to save her, but unable to contact her over the phone, Martin instead visits Doggett, and admits to evidence suppression, explaining that Hector Ocampo's brother is out for revenge. Doggett contacts the local police, while Wells rushes home and finds his wife, still alive. Suddenly, they hear someone else at the door. Ocampo appears and accosts Wells. Vicky Wells comes out of hiding but is thrown through the coffee table. As Ocampo prepares to slit her throat, he is shot dead by the timely arriving Doggett and Scully. Wells notices Scully's watch once more, seeing that its hands start moving forwards again, indicating that whatever phenomenon that sent him backwards in time has reached its conclusion. Wells eventually goes to prison for his evidence suppression, a punishment he feels he deserves. ==Production== Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles200pxthumbright \\"Redrum\\", described as a \\"Twilight Zone-type thriller\\" in The Complete X-Files, was developed by Steven Maeda and Daniel Arkin, while the teleplay was written solely by Maeda. Maeda purposely picked the title to be the backwards spelling of \\"murder\\". (the same plot device was used by novelist—and one-time X-Files writer—Stephen King in his book The Shining.)Miles, Pearson, and Dickson p. 28 Maeda used the spider and its web to symbolize Martin Wells' confusion at being trapped in his situation. Several of the names in the episode were allusions to historical figures or acquaintances of the writer. Most notably, Martin Wells is named after famed 19th century author H.G. Wells, noted for his contributions to science fiction with The Time Machine in 1896 and The War of the Worlds in 1898. Furthermore, the character of Janet Wilson, the lawyer of Wells, was named after Maeda's wife. Wells was played by noted actor Joe Morton who had previously played a role in the 1991 sci-fi film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Robert Patrick later noted that \\"Joe Morton is a fantastic actor. We never worked together in [Terminator 2], but we're in that movie together. And Joe was The Brother from Another Planet.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 189 The scene in which Martin Wells is assassinated was at the \\"legendary\\" Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. This location, which has been the shooting location for over 200 productions, is perhaps more infamous as the site of Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy's assassination by Sirhan Sirhan in 1968. ==Reception== \\"Redrum\\" first aired on Fox on December 10, 2000. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.1, meaning that it was seen by 8.1% of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 8.16 million households, and 13.2 million viewers. The episode ranked as the 40th most-watched episode for the week ending December 10. The episode subsequently aired in the United Kingdom on the BBC Two on April 14, 2002. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"How do you stop a murder that's already happened?\\" Critical reception to the episode was moderately positive, although several reviewers criticized the episode's monologues. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode a \\"B+\\". Morgan criticized the episode's narrative, sardonically noting that Martin Wells was a \\"man who may get a second chance. At life. At truth. At pretentious, overlong monologues.\\" Juliette Harrisson of Den of Geek wrote positively of the episode, calling it \\"an excellent backwards episode, in which the audience is left satisfied that the horrific event that sparked it off has been prevented, but the guest protagonist has to pay a high price for the happy outcome.\\" However, she was slightly critical that the episode \\"barely features the regular characters at all\\". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. She called the episode \\"a double mystery: on one hand Martin's investigation of his wife's murder; and on the other, an investigation into the workings of his own soul.\\" Vitaris, too, was critical of the ending monologue, noting that \\"the voiceover ruins the mood of the final shot.\\" Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B+\\", writing that it was an \\"example of an episode that starts off strong, only to fumble when it comes to the follow through\\". He was particularly praiseworthy towards Morton's performance, noting that his presence \\"more than makes up for\\" the lack of Doggett and Scully. He concluded that the episode is \\"a smart that the script makes Wells in some way culpable for what happened, and tries to establish him as a merciless hard-ass\\" but that the \\"reveal is never really satisfying.\\" Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a moderately positive review and rated it three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the episode was \\"constructed with great skill by Steven Maeda and Daniel Arkin.\\" Despite this, Shearman and Pearson noted that \\"with the series in flux, this is an especially unhelpful time to attempt an episode which so abandons the house style; The X-Files urgently needs to assert what it is, not what it isn't.\\"Shearman and Pearson, p. 233–234 == Notes FootnotesBibliography== * * * == External links == * *\\"Redrum\\" at TV.com Category:2000 American television episodes Category:Television episodes set in Baltimore Category:Television episodes about murder Category:The X-Files (season 8) episodes Category:Television episodes set in Washington, D.C.

Kuppenheimer & Co., or simply Kuppenheimer, was a men's clothing manufacturing and retail operation based in Chicago, Illinois and later Atlanta, Georgia. == History Kohn, Clayburgh & Einstein=== In 1852, Bernard Kuppenheimer, who immigrated to America in 1850, founded a retail clothing store in Terre Haute, Indiana. In 1863, Julius Kohn, Martin Clayburgh, and Morris Einstein founded Kohn, Clayburgh & Einstein at 27 Lake Street in Chicago. Only two years later, in 1865, Kohn retired and Bernard Kuppenheimer, who relocated to Chicago leaving the Terre Haute store under the supervision of his brother John, and David Lindauer became members. Clayburgh, Einstein, Kuppenheimer, and Lindauer continued to operate the company without changing the name. They operated out of the Lake Street location until the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, when their building was burnt to the ground and they suffered losses totaling $200,000 (). After rebuilding, they resumed business and in July 1872, moved to the corner of Randolph Street and Wabash Avenue where they remained until the fall of 1876. ===B. Kuppenheimer & Co.=== Kuppenheimer store in Chicago in 1900In 1876, the business was dissolved and Kuppenheimer formed B. Kuppenheimer & Co. The new company was composed of him, his son Jonas Kuppenheimer, and Samuel Nathan. The remaining members of the Kohn, Claybugh & Einstein reorganized as Einstein, Longini & Co. B. Kuppenheimer & Co. started in business on Wabash Avenue and stayed there until 1880. In January 1880, Kuppenheimer & Co. moved to Madison Street and Louis B. Kuppenheimer, the second son of Bernard Kuppenheimer, was admitted as a partner. As of 1884, Kuppenheimer & Co had annual sales of nearly $1,000,000 (). In 1903, Kuppenheimer died and was buried at Rosehill Cemetery and Mausoleum in Chicago. In 1906, the company operated \\"The House of Kuppenheimer\\" branches in Boston and New York, with sales in Washington, D.C. handled by Isidor Grosner of 1013 Pennsylvania Ave., NW.Display Ad, The Washington Post, Nov 25, 1906, p. 8. During the World War I, Kuppenheimer manufactured the uniforms for the U.S. Army. By 1910, the company employed close to 2,000 men and women at shops in and around Chicago.Encyclopedia of Chicago, Dictionary of Leading Chicago Businesses (1820-2000) Entries: Kuppenheimer (B.) & Co. (accessed Sep 1, 2008) In 1912, Louis became vice- president of the company. In 1920, Albert Kuppenheimer retired from the company. He died in California in 1931 at the age of 64 although his residence in Chicago was the Drake Hotel. Later in 1920, Louis Kuppenheimer became president of B. Kuppenheimer & Co. In 1921, Jonas Kuppenheimer, who had been serving as president of \\"The House of Kuppenheimer,\\" died. In 1926, Louis Kuppenheimer retired as president of the company. In 1936, Louis, the last living son of founder Bernard Kuppenheimer, died. In 1959, Lester E. Frankenstein succeeded Bertram J. Cahn to become president of the company. Frankenstein was previously the vice-president. ===Sale and closure=== In March 1963, the firm was purchased by Louis Roth & Co., Inc. of Los Angeles for $3 million ().\\"Kuppenheimer Sold,\\" The Washington Post, Times Herald Mar 24, 1963, p. A25. The firm continued as a leading manufacturer of men's clothing until 1982, when it was purchased by Hart Schaffner & Marx (later known as Hartmarx), a Chicago-based apparel-maker and wholesaler. By the mid-1990s, after the headquarters moved to Atlanta, sales were lagging, many of its stores were closing, and it entered into bankruptcy.\\"Men's Wearhouse to liquidate remaining Kuppenheimer stores,\\" Atlanta Business Chronicle, March 4, 1997. In 1995, Hartmarx sold Kuppenheimer to Kupp Acquisition Corp. for $14 million () in cash ($12 million upfront and an additional $2 million over the next four years) and a $2.5 million promissory note secured by one of Kuppenheimer's manufacturing facilities. Kupp was formed by an investment group led by Gene Kosack, former president and chief executive of NBO Stores Inc., a clothing retailer. In 1997, The Men's Wearhouse purchased Kuppenheimer Manufacturing Co. from Kupp Acquisition Corp. At that time, Kuppenheimer consisted of 43 men's clothing stores, mostly in the Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta areas and the manufacturing facilities. The sale included the rights to Kuppenheimer's trademark and customer list. Men's Wearhouse closed the remaining Kuppenheimer stores and folded the business into its own by liquidating the remaining assets. ==In popular culture== *In the 1960s, Kuppenheimer was the supplier of Rod Serling's wardrobe on his television series, The Twilight Zone. *Kuppenheimer is known for commissioning American illustrator J.C.

The series reprinted Mickey Mouse comic strip stories from 1930, including the first two sequences, \\"Lost on a Desert Island\\" and \\"Mickey Mouse in Death Valley\\". Only two issues were published. While these early sequences had been reprinted in Italy in the 1970s, The Uncensored Mouse was the first English-language reprint since the strip's newspaper run. The word \\"Uncensored\\" in the title referred to content that the Walt Disney Company no longer wanted to associate with their star Mickey Mouse. \\"Lost on a Desert Island\\" contains stereotyped portrayals of Africans, and \\"Mickey Mouse in Death Valley\\" includes gunplay and kidnapping, as well as a blackface gag in which Mickey, in the dark, appears with wide eyes and big lips, crying \\"Minnie!\\" in the style of Al Jolson's famous performance of \\"My Mammy\\". ==History== According to conventional wisdom cited by scholar Thomas Inge, the 1930 Mickey Mouse strips had fallen into the public domain in 1986. Comics historian Bill Blackbeard discovered this supposed fact in his research, and Malibu Graphics considered it an opportunity to present this early material. Not wanting to draw the wrath of the notoriously protective Walt Disney Company, Eternity printed the comic with completely black covers that did not mention the name \\"Mickey Mouse\\". Instead, The Uncensored Mouse cover described the book as \\"A classic collection of uncensored Floyd Gottfredson comic strips from the 1930s\\". The comic was sold in a bag, so that potential customers wouldn't flip through it in the store and think it was an official Disney product. The first issue contained strips from January 13 to March 5, 1930, about two-thirds of the way through \\"Lost on a Desert Island\\"; the second issue printed the March 6 to April 26 strips, completing \\"Desert Island\\" and beginning \\"Mickey Mouse in Death Valley\\". A third issue was planned, and the company hoped to publish all of the strips up to the mid-1930s. Disney brought an action against Malibu, claiming that the comic infringed on their copyrights. While, as noted above, it was popularly assumed that the strips in The Uncensored Mouse were in the public domain—and Blackbeard and Malibu evidently believed they were—the first week of strips was actually copyrighted on January 3, 1930 and renewed September 23, 1957. At the time of The Uncensored Mouse, this renewal effectively protected the first week of strips for 75 years from publication: in effect, through 2005. A story about the lawsuit was broadcast on the syndicated entertainment news program Entertainment Tonight on April 20, 1989. Disney and Malibu settled the suit before it went to court, and Malibu did not publish any further Mickey Mouse strips. In 1998, Disney and other companies lobbied Congress to support the Copyright Term Extension Act, which extended the copyright on Mickey Mouse items through at least 2023. While Disney comics fans in the United States feared, following the cancellation of The Uncensored Mouse, that the early years of Mickey Mouse would never be reprinted, the complete run of the strip was eventually published in the Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse collection published by Fantagraphics Books. The first volume, 2011's \\"Race to Death Valley\\", reprinted both the \\"Desert Island\\" and \\"Death Valley\\" sequences, although the first story was printed in an \\"archival feature\\" section in the back of the book, with an explanation of the historical context for the African stereotypes. ==References * Category:Mickey Mouse comics Category:Disney comics titles Category:1989 comics debuts ","title":"The Uncensored Mouse"},{"id":"19266487","text":"The museum in 2011The is a museum in Gyōda, Saitama, Japan.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 18, 2009. This is the twentieth \\"Treehouse of Horror\\" installment, containing three self-contained stories: In \\"Dial 'M' for Murder or Press '#' to Return to Main Menu\\", Lisa is forced into a Hitchcock-esque murder scheme by Bart; in \\"Don't Have a Cow, Mankind\\", Springfield is once again overrun by zombies thanks to Krusty Burger's latest sandwich; and in the Sweeney Todd parody, \\"There's No Business Like Moe Business\\", Moe the bartender bleeds Homer dry to create the perfect microbrewed beer. An estimated 8.59 million viewers tuned in to watch the episode. ==PlotOpening=== Traditional horror movie characters such as Frankenstein's Monster, the Mummy, the Wolf Man, and Dracula roam the streets of Springfield on Halloween night. After they are teased by Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney, they get new, more modern costumes from a Halloween store. They then go to an adult Halloween party thrown by Homer and Marge, but are soon confronted by their wives, who are angry that their husbands lied about going out to kill children tonight. Homer tries to intervene as the wives begin to assault their husbands, only to be decapitated, and his eyes are then replaced with two red x's, the title of the episode then appears onscreen. ===Dial \\"M\\" for Murder or Press \\"#\\" to Return to Main Menu=== In a parody of Alfred Hitchcock's films, Lisa wants revenge after being sent to detention by Ms. Hoover for disrupting class as she claims another student topped her through a tutor. Bart hatches a \\"criss-cross\\" plan and tells Lisa that if she pulls a \\"ding-dong ditch\\" on Mrs. Krabappel, he will do the same to Ms. Hoover. Lisa thinks this means ringing the bell at Mrs. Krabappel's apartment and leaving. However, Lisa soon learns that Bart meant for her to kill Mrs. Krabappel (and dump the corpse in a ditch), as he has killed Ms. Hoover. Bart attempts to coax Lisa into killing Mrs. Krabappel with a paper cutter, but she refuses. Eventually, Bart decides to blackmail her into it with help from Willie, who would frame Lisa for the decapitated Skinner to honor his side of the \\"criss-cross\\" in which Bart killed Skinner. Realizing that Bart would frame her for these incidents, Lisa tricks him into believing that she was submitting at his will only to get a knife from his hands and attempts to kill Bart in self-defense, beginning a chase sequence. Bart finally finds shelter at a crowded playground carousel, but is left at Lisa's mercy when the other children leave to get ice cream. Lisa, however, recognizing that she would not be better than Bart, says she will never be a murderer, and attempts to throw the knife away. The knife cycles out of control and ends up nailing Bart in the head just as Mrs. Krabappel appears, pleased at his death. Despite her shock for accidentally killing Bart, Lisa agrees that it is better this way and she and Krabappel walk away smiling, leaving the murdered Bart to spin around on the carousel. ===Don't Have a Cow, Mankind=== Krusty the Clown introduces a new version of his Krusty Burger, the Burger2, made from cattle that have eaten other cattle in their feed. Upon eating a burger on live television, Kent Brockman begins to comment on the taste before turning gray, red-eyed, and cannibalistic, starting a chain reaction of people getting attacked and eaten. Twenty-eight days later, Springfield has become overrun by zombies called munchers. The Simpsons are established to be one of the few survivors. One day, Bart, tired of eating fruit, escapes from his family's barricaded house and eats one of the tainted burgers, but turns out to be immune to its effects. Over the phone, a besieged Dr. Hibbert tells them that Bart's immunity may be the key to developing a cure to the muncher epidemic and that they must bring Bart to a so-called \\"safe zone\\" being established in Shelbyville. The Simpsons are attacked after a failed attempt to sneak out but are saved by Apu, driving an armored off- road truck. Apu explains that he was never infected because, as a vegan, he did not eat any of the tainted beef, and as a convenience store owner, he is \\"armed to the teeth\\" (with a large arsenal of military-grade firearms). The group tries to leave Springfield, but Apu crashes the truck on top of a pile of smashed cars at the edge of town. Apu goes to push the car off the pile, but the Simpsons drive away thinking Apu sacrificed himself, when he actually wanted the Simpsons to wait for him. After Apu is killed by the munchers, the Simpsons drive on but run out of gas in the middle of the highway, walking the remaining 20 miles to the safe zone. During their journey, Homer is bitten by Mr. Burns, thus turning him into a muncher himself. The family decide not to kill him in the hopes of finding a cure. They reach the safe zone, where Bart –being immune to the virus –is worshiped as the \\"chosen one\\". However, the people there believe that cannibalizing Bart will save them from the virus. The Simpsons think of another solution: vaccinating the remaining populace by having Bart bathe in their food before eating it. ===There's No Business Like Moe Business=== In a parody of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, presented as a stage musical, Moe is lonely and upset that he does not have a girlfriend and is jealous when he sees Homer and Marge together. When Homer falls into the basement of the bar and is impaled by the microbrew pipes, his blood becomes the secret ingredient in Moe's new beer. Everyone loves this new beer, saying that it makes them feel warm, secure and cozy on the inside. Moe uses this to his advantage and woos Marge, tricking her into thinking that Homer came out of the closet as gay and left Marge, when in reality, Homer is slowly dying from losing blood. Homer emerges, alive, despite being impaled by Moe's microbrew machine, hurls Moe (represented as a dummy) across the room, and reunites with Marge. ===Ending=== The whole audience except for Kang and Kodos gathers onstage and conclude the episode by singing \\"Number XX\\" when Kang then shushes the audience, gesturing at Kodos, who has fallen asleep with the playbill over his helmet. ==Cultural references== Mike B. Anderson directed the episode. The first segment includes parodies of the Alfred Hitchcock films Psycho, Strangers on a Train, North by Northwest, and Spellbound, as well as a reference to the film Vertigo (in particular the Vertigo effect). The main theme from Psycho by Bernard Herrmann is used extensively during the first part. The title of the segment takes its name from the film Dial M for Murder. The second segment is a parody of the 2002 British horror film, 28 Days Later, and the 2006 science fiction film, Children of Men. The title of the segment takes its name from Bart's catchphrase, Don't have a cow, man. The title of \\"There's No Business Like Moe Business\\" is a parody of the song \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" from Annie Get Your Gun. The episode was inspired by the 2007 film Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. ==Reception== In its original American broadcast, \\"Treehouse of Horror XX\\" was watched by 8.59 million viewers and was the most watched of Fox's Animation Domination, ahead of American Dad! and The Cleveland Show. The show was the fourth most watched episode on Fox after House, The OT, and Family Guy in the 18/49 rating. Robert Canning of IGN praised the episode, saying \\"it was a fine addition to the series' Halloween specials\\". He enjoyed all of the stories, and said that the Sweeney Todd segment was \\"a nice treat\\". He also said that the airing of this Treehouse of Horror episode before Halloween, the first time that this had happened in ten years, \\"[had to] count for something\\". Screen Rant called it the best episode of the 21st season. The episode won an award for \\"Best Writing in a Television Production\\" at the 37th Annie Awards. ==ReferencesCategory:The Simpsons (season 21) episodes Category:2009 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about zombies Category:Treehouse of Horror it:La paura fa novanta XI-XX#La paura fa novanta XX ","title":"Treehouse of Horror XX"},{"id":"19266551","text":"RTP Açores is a Portuguese regional television channel operated in the Autonomous Region of the Azores by the national broadcaster, RTP (Rádio e Televisão de Portugal). The channel began broadcasting programmes produced at its studios in Ponta Delgada on 10 August 1975. ==History== The broadcast studio/headquarters of RTP Açores in Ponta Delgada In 1975, during the transformative phase of Portugal's transition from Estado Novo regime to Third Portuguese Republic, Ramalho Eanes, then president of the administrative council at RTP solicited a dossier already published by João Paz on the future of regional broadcasting, then referred to as RTP-Açores.Catarina Duff Burnay (March 2012), p.132 After studying the process, its implications and conditions, Ramalho Eanes informed António Borges Coutinho that this project would be implemented swiftly. Along with Sousa Gomes and Sidónio Paes, the administrative council saw the public station in the Azores: \\"...as to contribute to the eradication of illiteracy...an instrument for education and culture...an instrument to promote cultural democracy...a vehicle that contributed to a better knowledge for all citizens...a means to appeal to unity and social responsibility for all...and a contribution that [served] positive collaboration in the transition and institutionalization of democracy\\". Instability at the national/regional levels and the move towards more autonomy and independence meant that RTP's motives were met with anxiety and distrust, the national broadcaster at that time being a tool of the Armed Forces Movement (MFA). In the streets of Ponta Delgada, for example, local cultural brigades were already trying to mould values and guide the transformation towards democracy. Following the Carnation Revolution, the move towards a decentralized constitution, with an autonomous status for regional authorities, the island of São Miguel in the archipelago of the Azores, was chosen for the broadcasting centre. Local news and entertainment was broadcast from its first studios in a building in the outskirts of the urban area of Ponta Delgada, in the locality of Sao Gonçalo. ===First broadcast=== Following some adaptations of the spaces, the first broadcast was aired on 10 August 1975, and lasted six hours. The first broadcast began at 3:30 in the afternoon, with a speech by President of the Board of Governors, General Altino Pinto de Magalhães, and lasted until 9:30, at the end of a newscast. This first transmission was marked by several gaffes, firstly by General Pinto (who was thrust into the position of regional leader only months earlier), then in the transmission of the programming, that included General à Força. After this film, Telejournal published local/regional and national news (already two days late) before a caption appearing to round out the emission, stating \\"Silence...we are going to laugh\\".Catarina Duff Burnay (March 2012), p.133 At the conclusion of this first emission, a technical flaw did not permit the playing of the national anthem, resulting in one viewer calling in to berate the studio, stating \\"...this here is still Portugal\\".Correio (2005), p.11-12 During these early broadcasts, the regional operator produced three hours of daily broadcasts per day for two months. In the successive years, the Azoreans began to trust the local broadcasters, with improvements made to the functioning of the service, including the operation of the Estação Terrena de Satélites da Marconi, which allowed signals from the continent to reach the Azores directly (rather than time-delay broadcasts). But, coverage was not even, as many of the islands were not covered, and many of the programming was stilled delivered from the continent and the content was censured, due to concerns for \\"public morality\\". ===Modernization=== Even so, television in the Azores was seen a \\"mirror\\" on Azorean culture, and a \\"window\\" on the other islands of the archipelago. This changed during the administration of Lopes Araújo; in July 1984, after completing a course in Law on the continent, he returned to the Azores, and at the age of 26, assumed an approach to revitalize regional programming and promote RTP Açores internationally. He contracted new professionals (such as producer José Medieros), produced programming directed towards the Azorean population and links to the diaspora in the United States. This included transmitting direct from Ponta Delgada, via satellite, the festivals of Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres in 1985, as well as broadcasting the news from the Azores to services in North America, Canada and Bermuda, starting in 1987. Programming during this period began to diversify and became more polished, with a concentration on information programming (Jornal de sábado, Notícias, Sumário), entertainment (with talk shows like Aqui Açores and Gente Nossa) and the beginning of the production of fiction programming. Until this time, production of fictional storytelling was not full-developed; Lopes de Araújo considered this \\"the noble stage of production\\", due to the demands on people, technical requirements and financial means, in addition to a level of experience and maturity necessary to realize large productions.Catarina Duff Burnay (March 2012), p.134 To this, on July 1986, the Regional Centre of the Azores produced Xailes Negros (a mini-series) which attempted break the mould and provide dynamic fiction and storey-telling, from scratch, while other productions have moved to adapt pre- existing public literature and works by celebrated Azorean authors. The channel launched nationwide on cable and satellite providers on 7 May 2015 on MEO, NOS and Vodafone, and on the remaining providers the following day during the Feast of the Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles.

It was the first of two seasons that the show was renewed for by Fox, and also the first season of the show to air entirely in high definition. With this season, The Simpsons established itself as the longest-running American primetime television series surpassing Gunsmoke. The season received mainly positive reviews from critics, with many praising \\"The Squirt and the Whale\\", \\"To Surveil with Love\\" and \\"The Bob Next Door\\". The show moved up 16 positions in the Nielsen ratings from the previous season and received numerous award nominations, winning two — an Emmy Award for Anne Hathaway for her voicing in \\"Once Upon a Time in Springfield\\", and an Annie Award for \\"Treehouse of Horror XX\\". ==Production== The season featured eight holdover episodes from the season 20 (LABF) production line. John Frink was credited as an executive producer for the first time. ===20th anniversary=== In 2009, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the premiere of The Simpsons, Fox announced that a year-long celebration of the show titled \\"Best. 20 Years. Ever.\\" would run from January 14, 2009 to January 14, 2010. As part of the celebration, documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock directed and produced The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special – In 3-D! On Ice!, a documentary special that examined the \\"cultural phenomenon of The Simpsons\\". Despite the title, Spurlock said the special \\"most likely [would] not be in 3-D nor on ice.\\" Production began at Comic-Con 2009, and the show aired on January 10, 2010 on Fox. It included interviews with the cast and fans of the show. For the week of November 9, 2009, several Fox shows including House, Lie to Me, Bones and Fringe featured clues and homages to the show as part of an \\"on-air scavenger hunt\\".

They aired on Sky1 and Sky1 HD on three separate evenings from January 11 to 13, 2010. They were followed by the UK premiere of season 21's first episode, \\"Homer the Whopper\\". ==ReceptionCritical reception=== Robert Canning of IGN gave the season an 8.3 (improving 0.4 from the previous season) saying that it was \\"Impressive\\". He criticized the opening part of the season (other than \\"Homer the Whopper\\" and \\"Treehouse of Horror XX\\"), but praised almost every episode after \\"Once Upon a Time in Springfield\\", and considered \\"The Squirt and the Whale\\" and \\"The Bob Next Door\\" to be the season's best episodes. He also stated \\"the improved consistency of memorable episodes this season over years past proved that, even after 20 years, The Simpsons can still entertain\\". TV Fanatic called the season \\"great\\" while reviewing \\"Judge Me Tender\\", while Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club, while reviewing the same episode, stated \\"I think it's picked back up in the last few seasons and particularly in this season, which has had a lot of fun episodes in it.\\" \\"The Squirt and the Whale\\" was also praised for its chalkboard gag, which made a reference to the controversial South Park episodes \\"200\\" and \\"201\\", while \\"To Surveil with Love\\" was considered the \\"best episode in years\\" by Sharon Knolle of TV Squadhttp://www.tvsquad.com/2010/05/03/the-simpsons-to-surveil-with-love- recap/ Retrieved May 3, 2010 and \\"one of the better outings\\" by Ariel Ponywether of FireFox News. ===Ratings=== In the seasonal Nielsen ratings in the 18-49 demographic, the season ranked joint 33rd with a 3.4/9 average.

The following episode, \\"Million Dollar Maybe\\", was the least viewed and lowest rated, watched by an estimated 5.110 million households and receiving a Nielsen rating of 2.4/6 in the 18-49 demographic, although this was largely down to the fact that it aired against the 2010 Grammy Awards on CBS and the 2010 Pro Bowl on ESPN. ===Awards=== Anne Hathaway won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing Princess Penelope in \\"Once Upon a Time in Springfield\\", while Dan Castellaneta and Hank Azaria were also nominated for \\"Thursdays with Abie\\" and \\"Moe Letter Blues\\" respectively. \\"Treehouse of Horror XX\\" won for Writing in a Television Production at the Annie Awards. \\"Once Upon a Time in Springfield\\" also received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Animated Program, while The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special - In 3-D!

Their vision is rooted and guided by Ignatian spirituality. ==Foundation== Mother Marie Anne Blondin in 1888 Esther Blondin (1809-1890) grew up the daughter of simple farmers in the village of Terrebonne, Quebec. Through her work as a domestic servant to the teaching Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal who had opened a parochial school in the town, she came to learn how to read and write. She was accepted to the novitiate of the Sisters in 1833, but soon had to leave for reasons of health. Later that same year, having recovered her health, Blondin accepted the invitation from another former novice of the Congregation, who was running a parochial school in Vaudreuil, to join her in teaching there. Within a few years, she had become the principal of the school, then known as the Académie Blondin, where she trained teachers for the rural schools of the province. Over the years, Blondin found out that one of the causes of the widespread illiteracy in the French-speaking community was a certain Church ruling that forbade that children be taught by members of the opposite sex. Unable to finance two schools, many parish priests chose to have none. In 1848 Esther presented to the Bishop of Montreal, Ignace Bourget, a plan to found a religious congregation \\"for the education of poor country children, both girls and boys in the same schools.\\" Despite the novelty of the suggestion and possible violation of Church rules, since the Canadian government was in favour of such schools he authorized the experiment. She obtained the commitment of several young women for this endeavor and a novitiate was opened to form members for the proposed new congregation on 13 September 1848.Nadeau, Eugène. “Sureau, Blondin, Esther, Mother Marie-Anne”, Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 11, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003 The first postulants of the congregation received the habit of the new Congregation of the Daughters of Saint Anne, as it was originally named, on 15 August 1849. This group included Blondin, who received the religious name of Sister Marie Anne. Abbé Paul-Loup Archambault Of this group, Blondin and four other Sisters made their profession of religious vows on 8 September 1850, thereby allowing the congregation to become legally formed. One barrier to this, however, was a community debt of about £1,500. This debt was paid by the local pastor, the Abbé Paul-Loup Archambault (1787 – 1859),Rousseau, Louis. “Archambault, Paul- Loup”, Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 8, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003 clearing the way to their establishment under canon law. Blondin was named the superior of the congregation, becoming referred to as Mother Marie Anne. In March 1851 Bourget wrote a Rule of Life and Constitutions for the congregation. By October of that same year, the congregation had grown to such an extant that a new community was established in Sainte-Geneviève. On 22 August 1853, to accommodate their growing numbers, the Sisters were moved by Bourget from Vaudreuil to Saint-Jacques de l'Achigan. At that time, he appointed the Abbé Louis-Adolphe Maréchal as chaplain to the community. This priest began to exercise a dictatorial control of the community, determining on his own the school fees, and pressuring the Sisters not to exercise their right to go to a confessor of their choice, but solely to him. As a result of this conflict, the bishop instructed Mother Marie Anne to resign as Superior of the community as of 18 August 1854, calling for new elections. He further commanded that she neither offer her name for re-election, nor accept election. Though elected to the General Council twice, she was kept from any further participation in the administration of the congregation. At the election which was then held, Mother Marie Jeanne de Chantal was elected the superior of the congregation. In 1857 Bourget made some final revisions to the Constitutions, which he then provisionally approved. That year a new habit was adopted by the congregation, and all the Sisters underwent a new investiture. The congregation held its first General Chapter in 1860. The following year, Mother Jeanne de Chantal purchased Simpson Manor in Lachine, which became the General Motherhouse in 1864. The decretum laudis of the Holy See was received in March 1863. Final approval of the Constitutions was granted by Bourget on 13 February 1875. In 1884 final approval of the congregation was granted by Pope Leo XIII. The name of the congregation was changed to its current one on 12 July 12 1888. The practice of admitting women to serve the congregation as lay sisters began in 1891. They helped to operate its various institutions until 1926, when the practice was ended. ==Expansion== St. Ann's schoolhouse, built in 1844 as a log cabin and user by the Sisters of Saint Anne since 1858, is conserved as part of Royal British Columbia Museum In 1858, the congregation accepted a request to help Modeste Demers, the Bishop of Vancouver Island, with the education of the children of the First Nations and of the growing European immigrants in that remote mission region. Four Sisters from Saint-Jacques who had volunteered for this endeavor set sail for the western coast on April 8, traveling by way of the Isthmus of Panama due to there being no rail connection across Canada at that time. They arrived in Victoria, British Columbia, the following June 5. In 1871 St. Ann's Academy was established, followed by St. Joseph Hospital in 1876. The Sisters arrived in the United States in September 1867 at the request of the Bishop of Buffalo, opening a school in Oswego, New York. They went on to expand throughout northern New York and New England, staffing many schools of French-speaking parishes. The Sisters later established a provincial motherhouse in Marlboro, Massachusetts. By 1896 the congregation had so grown, that, on April 27, its administration was divided among four Provinces. In 1912, the Sisters of the United States Province numbered 150. During the 20th century, the Sisters established missions to serve the Third World. Foundations were made in Japan (1934), Haiti (1944), Chile (1965), and Cameroon (1969). The congregation has taught in various schools and has built schools at all levels of education and foundations, including hospitals, across western Canada, the United States, Alaska, Quebec, and Haiti, where they still operate the Collège Marie-Anne, having rebuilt after the devastating earthquake of 2010. ==Current status== At their height, the Sisters numbered some 3,900 members. Today they number about 840 members. They are joined in their work by about 300 men and women who are associates of the congregation. ==Notable members== * Sister Marie Jean-Eudes Tellier, S.S.A., a leading botanist ==References External Links == * Official website * Official website, Pacific Northwest Category:1850 establishments in Canada Category:Religious organizations established in 1850 Category:Catholic religious institutes established in the 19th century Category:Catholic teaching orders Category:Catholic female orders and societies Category:Women's congregations following Ignatian spirituality Category:History of Victoria, British Columbia ","title":"Sisters of Saint Anne"},{"id":"19266626","text":"Meadowbrook High School is a high school located in Chesterfield County, Virginia.

XXVIII:6) is an opera in three acts by Joseph Haydn first performed at Eszterháza on 29 August 1775 to mark the four-day visit of Archduke Ferdinand, Habsburg governor of Milan and his consort Maria Beatrice d'Este. The opera is designated a dramma giocoso (a comic opera) and is an example of the then Austrian fascination with Turkish subjects. Clark C. L'incontro improvviso. In: The New Grove Dictionary of Opera ed Sadie S. London & New York, Macmillan, 1997. ==Composition and Performance History== The libretto by Carl Friberth was adapted and translated from a French opéra comique by L. H. Dancourt, already set by Gluck in 1764 as the La rencontre imprévue. Rice J A. L'incontro improvviso. In: Haydn (Oxford Composer Companion) ed Wyn Jones D. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2002. In keeping with Italian practice, Friberth constructed longer buffo finale texts at the end of Acts I and II. It is not known if any further performances followed the Eszterháza production, although a German translation was made for Bratislava. Danish musicologist Jens Peter Larsen discovered the autograph score in Leningrad in 1954, and the opera was subsequently broadcast in Russian in 1956. It was first staged in the UK at the Camden Festival in 1966.Clark C. L'incontro improvviso. In: The New Grove Dictionary of Opera ed Sadie S. London & New York, Macmillan, 1997.

A square Osmin is distracted by the qalandar begging; he has little trouble in persuading the hungry Osmin to become a mendicant dervish. A room in the seraglio Rezia has been told that her long-lost love has been sighted in Cairo, and shares the news with Balkis and Dardane in a beautiful trio. A square Ali, alone, explains how he fled to Persia and fell in love with Rezia. Though betrothed to another, Rezia eloped with Ali but they were separated and she was captured by pirates. Ali watches as Osmin is taught by the Qalandar the chant \\"Castagna, castagna\\". The Qalandar recognises Ali as the Prince of Balsóra. Balkis greets Ali with news that a woman has espied him from a window in the seraglio and wishes to meet him. A room containing a banquet table Osmin is enjoying a feast with Ali arrives with Balkis, and Ali gets increasingly angry with Osmin's inebriation. ===Act II=== A room with a sofa Dardane tries to charm Ali to test his faithfulness. Rezia enters, taking Ali and Osmin by surprise. The three women tell of the unfortunate travels which brought them to Cairo. The qalandar's room Osmin informs the qalandar that Ali's lover is Rezia and solicits his help in letting the couple escape. A garden While preparations are made for a banquet before their escape, Rezia and Ali sing a love duet. The mood is shattered when Balkis and Dardane come in to announce that the Sultan has returned unexpectedly from the hunt. Everyone flees via a secret staircase. ===Act III=== Night. The qalandar's storehouse News of the Sultan's reward for the recovery of Rezia has reached the qalandar who decides to betray them to win the bounty. Ali disguises himself as a French painter to avoid arrest, but to no avail. The Sultan however forgives them and condemns the treacherous qalandar. A hall lit by chandeliers The Sultan pardons Rezia and Ali and gives them his blessing. At the couple's request the qalandar is pardoned, but banished from Cairo. Clark C. L'incontro improvviso.

The Eszterháza Operas, notes for 1980 Philips recording, Philips, 2003. ==Music== Although not Haydn's greatest success in the operatic field, L'incontro improvviso does include some high- class and varied music. As well as the 'Turkish' music, amusing scenes for Osmin and Calandro, the 'painting' aria in the last act where Ali describes the contents of a picture with orchestral help, and another aria \\"Senti, al buio pian\\" for Osmin with orchestral colouring, there is Italian lyricism evident in arias for Ali (\\"Deh! se in ciel pietade avete\\") and Rezia (\\"Or vicina a te\\"). Act II has two powerful arias for sopranos; Haydn detached Rezia's \\"Or vicino a te\\" and published it separately in 1783.

He was assigned as a midshipman to HMS Dreadnought in 1916. In May 1917 he was reassigned to and in September promoted to sub-lieutenant. In October 1918 he was promoted again, to lieutenant following technical courses in which he performed brilliantly, obtaining First Class certificates in all five subjects, and receiving the Goodenough Medal and prize as the best gunnery student in his year. After a short period serving on HMS Resolution, in 1920 he attended two terms at Queens' College, Cambridge to make up for the short education he received because of the war, followed by promotion courses into 1921. Following this he specialised in gunnery and underwent training at the Royal Navy gunnery school, HMS Excellent, in Portsmouth. He was top of his class in both theory and practical work and was awarded the Commander Egerton prize for the best examination result in practical gunnery. He joined the school as a staff member in the Experimental Department in March 1924. In August 1925 he was assigned as gunnery officer to HMS Carlisle which was serving on the China Station where he remained into 1927. He was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander in October 1926. In 1928 he returned to the Experimental Department of HMS Excellent, and in January 1930 became gunnery officer on HMS Rodney which at that time was part of the Atlantic Fleet. In March 1932 he returned once again to HMS Excellent, as head of the Experimental Department. Between 1934 and 1936 he commanded HMS Diana and then HMS Veteran. He married Barbara Jones, daughter of a jurist, Sir Francis A. Jones, in 1933. The couple had three children, of whom only one son survived. His second son died aged 8 of pneumonia, and his daughter died in a bathing accident during a holiday in Norfolk. ==Second World War== In June 1937 he was promoted to captain and the following year joined the naval staff at the Admiralty, in the Tactical Division. In May 1939, a few months before the outbreak of Second World War he became deputy director of the Training and Staff Duties Division. In October 1940 he was given command of a Dido-class light cruiser, HMS Hermione then under construction on the Clyde. The ship worked up at Scapa Flow and as part of the Second Cruiser Squadron took part in the May 1941 hunt for the Bismarck. The ship was then assigned to Force H based at Gibraltar on convoy duties to relieve Malta. The ship rammed the Italian 600-Serie Adua submarine Tembien near Tunis on 2 July 1941, for which Oliver was awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in November. In 1942 the ship was part of the force which captured the Vichy French island of Madagascar after which it was assigned to Admiral Sir Henry Harwood's Eastern Mediterranean fleet. In June 1942 as part of the 15th Cruiser Squadron the cruiser took part in Operation Vigorous, an attempt to supply Malta with a convoy dispatched from the Eastern Mediterranean whilst another Malta-bound convoy was simultaneously dispatched from Gibraltar (Operation Harpoon). On 15 June, Operation Vigorous was abandoned because of the strength of the air attacks, the depletion of ammunition and fuel caused by them and the nearby presence of the Italian Fleet. The convoy turned away from Malta and headed back towards Alexandria, but early the following morning Hermione was torpedoed and sunk by U-205 south of Crete with the loss of 87 crew out of 570. Oliver survived the sinking and served as naval liaison officer to the Nile Delta Army for the next few months, until October 1942 when he was promoted to Commodore 2nd Class and assigned in Gibraltar to organise shipping for Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa. Following the successful invasion, in January 1943 he was assigned as the senior officer of the North Africa Inshore Squadron, based at Bone, Algeria which at that time was under repeated air attack, until May 1943 when he moved to a newly captured base at Bizerte. For his work during Operation Torch, Oliver was awarded a Bar to his DSO and American Legion of Merit. In July 1943 he became commander of Force \\"N\\", with its headquarters at the Algiers naval base HMS Hannibal, for Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily which took place on 9 July. He was the naval commander of the British assault force at Salerno on HMS Hilary. Following the successful conclusion of the operation he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath and upgraded to a Commander of the American Legion of Merit. From late 1943 until February 1944 he was the chairman of a commission, \\"Accuracy of Gunnery Committee\\". He was then promoted to commodore 1st Class and assigned as commander of Force \\"J\\" for Operation Neptune, the invasion of Normandy, for which he was awarded a second Bar to his DSO. From October 1944 until February 1945 he was in command of the First Aircraft Carrier Squadron on HMS Royalist, part of the Eastern Fleet, clearing mines in the Aegean Sea and providing humanitarian relief. He was promoted to rear admiral in May 1945 when the force was attached to the Eastern Fleet's 21st Aircraft Carrier Squadron where it took part in the amphibious landing at Rangoon. When Japan surrendered in August 1945 the force was preparing for the attack on the Malay Peninsula. ==Postwar== In 1946 he was president of a committee examining aircraft maintenance, and in April was appointed Flag Officer in command of Naval Air Stations. In December 1946 he became a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty and Assistant Chief of Naval Staff, posts he held until September 1948 when he became President of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. He was promoted to vice admiral in February 1949. From April 1950 until August 1952 he was Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, and promoted to admiral in May 1952. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1951. In May 1953 he became Commander-in-Chief, The Nore, a capacity he served in until April 1955. He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire on 1 January 1955. He retired from the Royal Navy on 1 December 1955, and moved to a farm he purchased near Henfield, West Sussex. ==References== * * - - Category:1898 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Admiral presidents of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich Category:Commanders Grand Cross of the Order of the Sword Category:Commanders of the Legion of Merit Category:Companions of the Distinguished Service Order Category:People educated at Durnford School Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire Category:Lords of the Admiralty Category:People educated at Rugby School Category:Royal Navy officers of World War II Category:Royal Navy admirals Category:Royal Navy officers of World War I Category:Alumni of Queens' College, Cambridge ","title":"Geoffrey Oliver"},{"id":"19266695","text":"Aurelio's Pizza is an Illinois restaurant chain which centers its business around the thin crust variety of Chicago-style pizza.

Aurelio's Pizza is the oldest Chicago pizza franchise restaurant, franchising since 1974. ==History== James Aurelio founded Macomb, Illinois' first pizza restaurant, The Italian Village, in 1952. In the mid-1950s, one of James' nephews, Joe Aurelio Jr., came to Macomb IL to work in the restaurant. Joe eventually moved back home to the Chicago area in 1959 and his cousin Louis Gaetano became co-owner of The Italian Village. Joe then founded his own pizza restaurant, named Aurelio's. This was a small, 4 table restaurant on Ridge Rd. in Homewood. Both Aurelios specialized in a distinctive thin crust pizza that was sliced in \\"Chicago style\\" square pieces. The company's slogan is \\"Aurelio's is Pizza!\\" When James Aurelio died, Louis Gaetano sold The Italian Village and it became an Aurelio's Pizza franchise. The chain's main competition is Rosati's Pizza, Nancy's Pizza, and Home Run Inn, as well as many smaller family-owned establishments.

He was the father of the French author Victor Henri Joseph Brahain Ducange. He played an important role in the coup d'état of 22 January 1798 in the Batavian Republic, by general Herman Willem Daendels, which brought the radical unitarist faction of Wybo Fijnje and Pieter Vreede to power, and he helped write the Staatsregeling voor het Bataafse Volk of 1798 (the first Dutch Constitution). ==Early career== Little is known about Ducange's life before 1783, the year in which his son was born. As a matter of fact, the name \\"Ducange\\" seems to have been assumed, as Ducange calls himself around this time \\"Brahain, dit Ducange.\\" Still, in many sources he is designated \\"Ducange,\\" or \\"Brahain Ducange,\\" so that is the name that will be used here. In 1783 he also published Oeuvres commentées du sieur Hadoux:M. Hadoux, according to the title page, was maître de danse et citoyen à la Haye, a dancing-master and citizen of The Hague; the publication place was listed as Criticopolis, the \\"City of Critics\\". expliquées et rendues intelligibles under the elaborate pseudonym André d'Acunenga Rhiba, which is an anagram of his name.Emil Ottokar Weller, Index Pseudonymorum: Wörterbuch der Pseudonymen (1856), s.v. \\"Rhiba d'Acunenga, André\\". He was secretary of the French ambassador to the Dutch Republic, Charles Olivier de Saint-Georges de VéracCharles-Olivier de Saint- Georges, marquis de Vérac (1743-1828) until the ambassador discovered that he had leaked confidential information to a Dutch newspaper, and dismissed him.Mendels, p. 133 Before his employment at the embassy he apparently was a French tutor in a Dutch family in Amsterdam, and an occasional journalist. After his dismissal he took up journalism full-time, first in an Orangist newspaper, but after the Prussian intervention in the Patriot Revolt of 1787 he travelled for a time to Spain, where he reputedly earned a living as a swindler.Mendels, p. 134 Around 1790 he was back in the Netherlands, where he took up his journalistic work in Leiden as an editor of the French-language Gazette de Leyde; in 1792 he went to Paris, where he was active in Jacobin circles. He briefly published a newspaper there, entitled Le Batave (\\"\\"The Batavian\\"), which agitated for war against the Dutch Republic. During the next few years he apparently worked as a police spy for the French government, especially during the Reign of Terror. After the fall of the Robespierre regime he had to go abroad for a while to Germany, again apparently entering into a life of crime, until he suddenly emerged again in The Hague at the end of 1797 in the retinue of the new French ambassador to the Batavian Republic, Charles-François Delacroix.Mendels, pp. 133-134 He was appointed secretary of the ambassador, but apparently was also charged with keeping a discreet eye on the ambassador for Barras.Elias, fn. 12 ==The coup d'état of 22 January 1798 and its aftermath== At this time the politicians of the Batavian Republic were in the process of writing a Constitution amid much political strife. Roughly speaking there were three political factions vying to get the upper hand: a group of \\"federalists,\\" who wanted to maintain the decentralized structure of the old Dutch Republic; and two factions of \\"unitarists,\\" one moderate, and one radical, who wanted to transform the new Republic into a unitary state. It was Delacroix' mission to impose a Constitution following the model of the Constitution of the Year III. However, in this task he was hindered by the fact that he didn't speak Dutch. Ducange, on the other hand was fluent in Dutch, and therefore able to act as Delacroix' trusted henchman in this projet d'une constitution pour la République batave. However, Ducange acted more as an intermediary with the radical faction of unitarists, and thanks to him Delacroix in the course of January, 1798 accepted their version of the draft- Constitution in preference to the French draft.Elias,sec. Le coup d'État de 1798 This official French endorsement encouraged the radicals to impose their will by force on their political opponents. On 22 January 1798 Dutch and French troops, commanded by generals Daendels and Joubert, surrounded The Hague, and the political opponents of the radicals in the National Assembly were arrested. The rump-Assembly next declared itself to be a Constituante, ready to promulgate a new constitution. A committee was charged with drafting this new constitution. Ducange took part in the deliberations of this committee on a daily basis (reporting back to Delacroix each night), and even translated certain parts into French for the benefit of his French principals. The fact that he kept a watchful eye, and that Delacroix had to trust his reports implicitly, probably helped to smooth the acceptance of the draft by the French \\"sister republic,\\" even though it was not a slavish copy of the French model, and contained some peculiarly Dutch elements.Elias, sec. La constitution tant attendue et l'accord de la France The draft-constitution was approved in a referendum on 25 April and came into force on 1 May. However, soon discontent with the high-handed policies of the radicals began to grow. This discontent was also directed against Ducange, whose sometimes abrasive behavior and evident influential position were resented. He was specifically blamed for the decision of the radicals on 4 May to continue the rump-Assembly in office and not to hold new elections. Soon intrigues back in Paris caused the Directoire to demand his recall to France. Delacroix own recall soon followed.Mendels, pp. 152-156, 170-171 None too soon, as he had become identified with the radical regime that was overthrown by a new coup d'état in June, 1798, again by general Daendels, who had now thrown in his lot with the moderate unitarists. ==Later career== After this we again lose sight of Ducange for a few years, but in 1803 the French government sent him as a secret agent to Vienna to spy on French émigrés. When the Austrian police caught wind of this intrigue, Ducange had to flee, first to Saxony, and later back to France, where he was locked up in the Temple prison for a few years. Released in 1806 he again was arrested in 1808 and convicted as a swindler. (1908) Publications de la Société d'histoire contemporaine vol. 40, pp. 49-50, fn. 3 In later years he seems to have taken up the pen again. In 1821 he published a children's book offering models for letter-writing, Le sécretaire des enfants, ou correspondence entre plusieurs enfants propre à les former au style épistolaire. At the time he worked as a copyist. He died in Paris in 1833, the same year in which his son also died. ==ReferencesSources== * (1890) Hermann Willem Daendels, p. 133 ff. * (7 mars 2008) \\"La néerlandicité de la constitution de 1798\\", in Annales historiques de la Révolution française, Numéro 326 Category:French journalists Category:Spies of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars Category:1833 deaths Category:Year of birth missing ","title":"Pierre Auguste Brahain Ducange"},{"id":"19266719","text":" Project 1171 (Tapir) class landing ship (NATO reporting name: Alligator) is a class of Soviet / Russian general purpose, beachable amphibious transport docks (Soviet classification: Large landing ship, ). Design of Project 1171 was initiated in 1959 by the Navy, while a similar dual-purpose Project 1173 was ordered by the civilian Ministry of Shipping. Eventually both designs were merged under the Project 1171 umbrella, and the resulting ship was a compromise between military (speed, survivability) and civil (fuel economy) objectives. The design team produced four different configurations of the ship. The Navy selected the most powerful and fastest option, which was also the least fuel-efficient, and the civil Ministry withdrew from the project completely. All production ships were made for the Navy and never operated on shipping lines. Encyclopedia of ships A total of 14 vessels were completed between 1964 and 1975; all were retired in 1992–1995.

In 1834 he became head of the Paderborn general hospital and eventually also of the Paderborn maternity clinic.Katalog der wissenschaftlichen Sammlungen der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin provides the following information: \\"1834 Leitung des Krankenhauses in Paderborn, Lehrer am Hebammeninstitut und seit 1938 Physikus, Arbeit am Ministerium der geistlichen, Unterrichts- und Medizinangelegenheiten in Berlin, 1844 Sonderprof. der Geburtshilfe und Direktor der Geburtsabteilung der Charité (retrieved 11 September 2008) He wrote a textbook of obstetrics widely used in Prussia. In 1842, together with Pauline von Mallinckrodt, he founded a private institution for the blind in Paderborn. In 1844 he became an official in the Prussian Ministry of Culture, the head of the gynecological section of the Berlin Charité Clinic and professor of obstetrics at the Humboldt University of Berlin. He died in 1852 of a lung bleeding. ==Legacy== A biography on Schmidt was published in 1939.Paul Fraatz (1939) Der Paderborner Kreisarzt Joseph Hermann Schmidt: Eine aktenmässige Schilderung seines Lebens und seiner Verdienste um das Medizinalwesen Westfalens sowie seiner Beteiligung an der Medizinalreform Google books ==Controversy with Ignaz Semmelweis== Schmidt approved of obstetrical students having ready access to morgues in which they could spend time while waiting for the labor process. For this he had a controversy with Ignaz Semmelweis who identified contamination as the principal source of high mortality rates from puerperal fever. In an editorial in 1850 he wrote: > \\"A normal birth is often a slow process and it would be unreasonable to > expect every young man .. to remain in the delivery room...

Experiments were carried out before and during the Second World War in a military installation at Rawalpindi, now in Pakistan. These experiments began in the early 1930s and lasted more than 10 years. Since the publication of the story in The Guardian on 1 September 2007, the experiments are referred to as the Rawalpindi experiments or Rawalpindi mustard gas experiments in the media and elsewhere. ==Oversight by Porton Down== The experiments in Rawalpindi were part of a much larger project intended to test the effects of chemical weapons on humans. More than 20,000 British servicemen and -women were subjected to chemical warfare trials between 1916 and 1989 at the Defence Ministry's Porton Down research centre in southwest England. ==Aim of the experiments== The experiments were done to determine the effects of mustard gas, now known to be highly carcinogenic. According to documents at the British National Archives in London, British army scientists and doctors tested the effects of mustard gas on over 500 Indian soldiers over a ten-year period. Beginning in the early 1930s, scientists at Rawalpindi sent Indian soldiers, wearing shorts and cotton shirts, into gas chambers to experience the effects of mustard gas. The scientists hoped to determine the appropriate dosage to use on battlefields. Many of the subjects suffered severe burns from their exposure to the gas. ==Effects on subjects== These tests caused large numbers of burns, some of which were so damaging that the subjects had to be hospitalized. According to the report severely burned patients were often very miserable and depressed and in considerable discomfort. No long-term effects of exposure were documented or studied. ==Missing information== The patients were treated at the Indian Military Hospital Rawalpindi now known as the Military Hospital Rawalpindi. The exact place where the British Military facility with gas chambers was located in Rawalpindi is not known. ==Porton Down view== Porton Down officials have argued that trials took place in a different era, during a conflict, and so their conduct should not be judged by today's standards. ==See also== * Keen as Mustard, a documentary film about tests in tropical Australia on serviceman volunteers during WWII. ==References== * British National Archives Category:1930s in British India Category:British human subject research Category:Chemical warfare Category:History of Rawalpindi Category:United Kingdom chemical weapons program Category:Biological warfare facilities ","title":"Rawalpindi experiments"},{"id":"19267009","text":"Brenda Irving is a Canadian television sports journalist employed by CBC Television.

Ada R Habershon ==Other versionsTune variants=== The Ballad Index Robert B. Waltz and David G. Engle (2019) The Ballad Index notes that the tune now commonly sung differs substantially from the original tune by Gabriel. It also notes the first known recording of this variant, by the Metropolitan Quartet in 1927. ===Carter version=== A reworked version of the song, intended as a funeral hymn, was written by A. P. Carter and released in 1935 by the Carter Family. The Carter version, titled \\"Can the Circle be Unbroken\\", uses the same music and the same verse structure but with different verse lyrics and a modified chorus. That version has often been recorded as \\"Will the Circle be Unbroken\\", including the 1972 performance by Mother Maybelle Carter and ensemble on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album of the same title. The original version of the song does not insert \\"Lord\\" in lines 2 and 4 of the chorus, though the Carter version does. Also, the third line of the chorus is phrased as a question in the original, but as a declarative sentence in the Carter version, and the Carter version as written begins the chorus with 'Can' instead of 'Will'. The Carter version is still under copyright. ===Less-known versions=== *In 1936, Bill and Charlie Monroe recorded yet a different version. *In 1970, the music group The Doors performed their version live in Chicago. Changing the lyrics to \\"oh, the circle has been broken, me oh my Lord, me oh my.\\" *In 1988, folk singers Cathy Winter, Betsy Rose, and Marcia Taylor published an alternate lyric in the collection Rise Up Singing (ed. Peter Blood). A choral arrangement for treble voices was subsequently made by J. David Moore using these lyrics (pub. 2011 Fresh Ayre Music). *In 1988, Spacemen 3 released a version of the song titled \\"May The Circle Be Unbroken\\" as one of the B-sides on their single \\"Revolution\\". Aside from the change in the titular line, it is lyrically identical to the Carter Family version. ===Parodies=== *In 1994, Jello Biafra and Mojo Nixon included a parody \\"Will the Fetus Be Aborted?\\" on their album Prairie Home Invasion. *In 1999, \\"Will the Turtle Be Unbroken,\\" a parody, was written and released by Les Barker under the group name The Mrs Ackroyd Band. ==Recordings== *In 1961, John Lee Hooker recorded a popular version of the song with a drum, bass and guitar band. *In 1966, The Staple Singers did a recording on their album \\"Why\\". *In 1967, Bob Dylan and The Band recorded a version, released in 2014 on The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete. *In 1967, The 13th Floor Elevators recorded a version, released in 1969 on Bull of the Woods. *In 1971, Pentangle recorded a version included on their album Reflection. *In 1971, Leon Russell opened his Homewood sessions recording with the song as the musicians were entering the set. *The Canadian gospel rock group Ocean released a version of the song as the B-side to their 1971 single, \\"We Got a Dream\\" and their 1972 single, \\"One More Chance\\". *In 1972, The Youngbloods released a version of the song as the B-side to their single, \\"Light Shine\\".The Youngbloods, \\"Light Shine\\" single release Retrieved May 18, 2015 *In 1972, Shocking Blue recorded a version, released on their album Atilla *In 1973, Gregg Allman included a version of the song on his first solo album Laid Back. *In 1979, George Jones recorded the song as a duet with The Staples Singers for his LP My Very Special Guests. *In 1989, The Neville Brothers included a version of the song on their Grammy-winning album Yellow Moon. *In 1992, The Wonder Stuff included a version of the song on their EP Welcome to the Cheap Seats. *In 2002, The Avett Brothers included a version of the song on their album \\"Live at the Double Door Inn\\". *In 2009, Richie Havens performed the song in the film Soundtrack for a Revolution. *In 2014, Scottish singer Susan Boyle recorded a version as one of her tracks for her sixth studio album, Hope. *in 2014, Scottish singer and ex-Mànran front man Norrie MacIver (also of Skipinnish) included the song, as well as a cover in Scottish Gaelic titled \\"Am bi an Cearcall seo gun Bhristeadh\\", on his debut solo album, Danns an Rathaid. *In 2016, Guadeloupean punk band The Bolokos recorded a version of the song for their first LP. ==In popular culture== The Pointer Sisters and Nell Carter sing this song in an episode of Gimme a Break! titled \\"The Return of the Doo-Wop Girls\\" that originally aired on February 13, 1983. The song in its reworked version, \\"Can the Circle Be Unbroken,\\" appeared in the 2004 film Iron Jawed Angels, although the film's website shows the original song as the title. June Carter's rendition of the song plays over the Deadwood season 1 episode 8 closing credits. In the film 2012, the song can be heard on the family's way to Yellowstone Park. In 2012, Belgian film The Broken Circle Breakdown (also known as Alabama Monroe) used the song on its soundtrack. The song is covered in Treme season 2 episode 10, \\"That's What Lovers Do\\", at Harley's memorial service. A season 3 episode of Pretty Little Liars was titled after the hymn and featured the song within the episode. The hymn is sung every year at the Country Music Hall of Fame, at the conclusion of each medallion induction ceremony. It is performed by the inductees of that respective year as well as any previously inducted members of the Hall of Fame who are present. Two versions of the hymn are featured in the soundtrack for the 2013 video game BioShock Infinite: a traditional choir version, performed by Maureen Murphy, and an award-winning acoustic version performed by Troy Baker (guitar) and Courtnee Draper, the voice actors of main characters Booker DeWitt and Elizabeth, respectively. The use of the original lyrics was controversial: some commentators, apparently unaware of the differences between the original and Carter versions, criticized the omission of \\"Lord\\" from the chorus as anti-religious censorship. The choice was explained as simply being consistent with the 1912 setting of the game, at which point the word \\"Lord\\" had not been added. The song won \\"the Best Song in a Game\\" award during the VGX 2013. In March 2013, the score for BioShock Infinite contained \\"Will the Circle Be Unbroken (choral version)\\" with Ada Ruth Habershon, Charles Hutchinson Gabriel (2:56) on Track 3.

It joins with North Fork Matilija Creek to form the Ventura River. Many tributaries feed the mostly free flowing, creek,U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed March 16, 2011 which is largely contained in the Matilija Wilderness. Matilija was one of the Chumash rancherias under the jurisdiction of Mission San Buenaventura. The meaning of the Chumash name is unknown. ==Course== From its headwaters south of Sespe Creek in the Matilija Wilderness in Santa Barbara County, the creek flows east then south through a narrow V-shaped canyon into Ventura County. Below Matilija Falls it turns east and receives the Upper North Fork from the left, and almost immediately below that the West Fork (Murietta Canyon) from the right. The creek then flows east through a wider valley along the north side of the Santa Ynez Mountains before it empties into the mostly silted in Matilija Lake reservoir, formed by the high concrete arch Matilija Dam. Below the dam the creek flows southeast, through Matilija Hot Springs, and meets the North Fork Matilija Creek at the hamlet of Ojala, forming the Ventura River. The smaller North Fork Matilija Creek flows west and south from its headwaters near Rose Valley. The North Fork runs southwest, along Forest Route 6N31, and receives Cannon Creek from the right and Bear Creek from the left. It then cascades through the narrow Wheeler Gorge and through the community of Wheeler Springs. It flows briefly east and joins Matilija Creek shortly downstream. Highway 33 largely parallels the North Fork, from the top of Dry Lakes Ridge to the mouth. Fed by some perennial springs, despite its location in arid terrain, the creek flows year round, and can flood severely following winter storms. ==Ecology== Matilija poppy native to the Matilija Creek canyon. The name of the Matilija poppy (Romneya) is taken from the Matilija creek canyon. The Matilija Dam was constructed in 1947 on lower Matilija Creek for the purpose of supplying water storage and flood control, blocking access of anadromous Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to over ten miles of upstream spawning areas. Historically 5,000 steelhead trout used the upper Matilija basin. The Robles Diversion Dam on the Ventura River downstream posed a barrier to trout migration until a $6 million fish ladder was constructed in 2006. Recent genetic analysis of the steelhead in Matilija Creek (both above and below Matilija Dam) has shown them to be of native and not hatchery stocks. ==River modifications== The creek has one dam on it, Matilija Dam, built in 1947 to provide flood control and water supply for agricultural and urban uses in Ventura County. When completed, the dam was high and could impound more than of water. The reservoir has now almost completely filled with sediment, rendering it nearly useless. The dam was notched to reduce its height twice in the late 20th century, in order to allow some of the accumulated sediment to flow downstream. It is currently slated for removal. ==See also== *Rindge Dam, which Malibu Creek filled with sediment like Matilija Dam *Riparian zone restoration ==References *Matilija Dam.org Category:Rivers of Southern California Category:Rivers of Ventura County, California ","title":"Matilija Creek"},{"id":"19267084","text":"KUVA (102.3 FM, \\"U102.3\\") is a radio station licensed to serve Uvalde, Texas, United States.

It lies on the banks of the river Kushavati, east from Margao. ==History== The ancient city of Chandrapura, where Chandor now stands, served as a capital from the Bhoja period to that of the Kadambas. It also boasts of a fort and a temple within its citadel. Located from the inland of Margao, it has both ancient and modern aspects to its history. Chandor also boasts of ancient inscriptions of Bhoja kings dating back to the 3rd or 4th Century CE. Goa is believed to have been ruled by Bhojas in the 3rd Century CE. Their seat of power was Chandrapur which is present day Chandor and their kingdom included Shashti, Antruz, Bardez, North Kanara district, part of Belgaum district and some other areas around Goa. The earliest piece of evidence being the Siroda plate found in Shiroda on the banks of a river. It also has a Shiva temple with old remnants of the fortress walls and form one of the oldest structural remains in Goa. Chandor’s origins are not exact, which has been justified by the fact that there has been found pottery of the Satyavahanas which leads one to think that their dynasty was much older than the Bhoja kings, ruling far back as 200 BCE. Chandor was also the capital of the Kadambas until 1054, when they moved the capital to Govepuri/Gopakapattan (Goa Velha). Govepuri was destroyed by Muslims in 1312, prompting them to move the capital back to Chandor, until it too was sacked in 1327. Father Heras on his discovery of Chandor in 1929 CE, found a very old and shattered image of Nandi, Shiva’s Bull, believed to be affected adversely by raids in the 13th century CE. This is part of a complex housing the relics of an ancient temple dedicated to Shiva, known alternatively as Isvorachem. The first Jain sculpture belonging to the early southern Shilahara in Salcete, Chandor was discovered by Fr Henry Heras during one of his expeditions. The citizens of Chandor have long harboured a fear of marrying women, due to a \\"Queen's curse\\" dating to the Kadamba dynasty. Many men thus prefer to leave the village before marrying a woman. Chandor is home to many ruined forts. ==Geography== Chandor is located at . It has an average elevation of . ==Transport== Chandor is connected by road from Margao. It has its own railway station. ==Notable places== * Braganza House * St. James' Chapel (with historical palace step stone at the entrance) * Nossa Senhora de Belem Church * Monte Church * Nandi from Bhoja period. * Figuerado mansion == Bragança house == The Bragança House was built in the 17th century. This huge house is situated on one side of the village square. It has now been divided into two separate houses, with a common entrance. The east wing, occupied by the Pereira Bragança family, has a small chapel with a relic of St. Francis Xavier, which is a fingernail. The artefacts, collected by the family over a number of years, have added to the beauty of the house. There is a Great Salon, a large ballroom with the floor made of Italian marble, antique chandeliers from Europe adorning the ceiling, and heavily carved, ornate rosewood furniture. What stands out among the furniture is a pair of high- backed chairs, bearing the family crest, which was given to the Pereira Bragança family by King Dom Luís of Portugal. Most of the furniture dates back to the 18th century and is made from local seeso (martel wood), lacquered or inlaid with mother of pearl by craftsmen from Curtorim village. For antique aficionados, the house holds many delightful finds. The west wing of the house belongs to the Menezes Bragança family. Apart from its exquisite furniture and Chinese porcelain from Macau, it also houses a collection of family portraits, dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. The library is believed to be the first private library in Goa. It has almost 5,000 leather bound books in Portuguese, English and French collected by Luís de Menezes Bragança (1878–1938), a reputed journalist, renowned for the part he played in Goa’s independence movement. ==References External links == * Category:Villages in South Goa district Category:Comunidades of Goa ","title":"Chandor"},{"id":"19267103","text":"Conquest is a strategy board game created and published by Donald Benge. First published in 1972 with cardboard pieces, it evolved to plastic pieces and a deluxe set in pewter plated in various metals including gold. ==Development of the game== The game is based on point to point movement and capture, with an innovative recapture interspersed. Pieces may mount each other such as a soldier mounting a chariot, and both boarding a ship. The pieces also include elephants and knights. Starting with a two player version, a four player board was developed which can be played as a free for all, or as a partnership effort. There was another edition published by Donald Benge, Conquest Plus, which introduced catapults and siege engines. Followed by Grand Conquest, which was published in Germany in 2006. Grand Conquest added camels and castles with draw bridges and introduced movement into the fields between the regular movement points.

The song was released on his 1979 album, Squeezing Out Sparks. Lyrically inspired by the girls in Parker's hometown, \\"Local Girls\\" was meant to capture life in English suburbia. The song was released as a single in the US in 1979, but did not chart. The song has since become one of Parker's most famous songs. ==Background== \\"Local Girls\\" was written by Graham Parker as a commentary on the girls from his youth that were attracted to soldiers at an army camp near his town; Parker recalled in an interview, \\"You might fancy some local girls, but you know there's no chance. She thinks you're just a local kid that everybody knows\\". He later said in an interview on his website, The song was originally written as a part of a larger concept on the Squeezing Out Sparks album to capture suburban life in England. He commented on this, \\"In [Squeezing Out Sparks] I was kind of attempting a concept album about the suburbs of England, or at least trying to capture a vague approximation of suburban life. This idea succeeds in 'Saturday Nite Is Dead' and 'Local Girls' particularly well. I guess I drifted off the mark there for the rest of the record because the concept turned out to be a little confining for a whole album. I'm too restless to stick with such a narrow program\\". ==Release== \\"Local Girls\\" was released as the first and only US single from Squeezing Out Sparks, backed with a live version of the Jackson 5's \\"I Want You Back.\\" According to radio personality T. Morgan, then a member of the staff of Arista Records, the song was intended to be the Parker's breakthrough hit on Arista; he recalled, \\"['Local Girls'] was the choice to be the single to take Graham Parker to new vistas. It was to be his first hit single. We sent lovely ladies (all local) to the radio stations to hand deliver the record.\\" A promotion for the song in Birmingham, Alabama saw Arista reps dress up as women on stage. However, despite promising regional radio play, the song failed to chart. While the single was unsuccessful on the charts, the Squeezing Out Sparks album ultimately proved to be Parker's most successful album in the US and the song has become, in the words of Chronogram's Peter Aaron, Parker's \\"signature hit\\". A music video for the song was also created, featuring Parker and the Rumour performing in a living room set. ===Live versions=== Parker and the Rumour have continued to play \\"Local Girls\\" live, including during their reunion in the 2010s. The band played a version of the song in a concert for Judd Apatow's movie This Is 40, though it did not make the final version of the film.

It was led by the Berber dynasty of the Banu Razin of Houara tribe, which arrived in the peninsula after the conquest of Spain by Tariq ibn Ziyad. == Downfall == In 1167, under the pressure from the ongoing wars between the Almoravid Dynasty and the new invasions of the Almohad Caliphate, the Moorish King Muhammad ibn Mardanis - popularly known as the Wolf King - ceded the Taifa of Albarracín to a vassal of Sancho VI of Navarre, a noble from Estella-Lizarra named Pero Ruíz d'Azagra. The title was granted to d'Azagra due to his support of the Navarrese Crown against Alfonso VIII of Castile and Alfonso I of Aragón (Alfonso the Battler). In 1172, Pero Ruíz d'Azagra managed to consolidate his power over the Señorío making that territory independent of the other Christian kingdoms in the region. In 1190, with the signing of the Borja Accords, between Alfonso II of Aragon and Sancho VI of Navarre, the two monarchs agreed to a defensive pact against Alfonso VIII of Castile which gave official legitimacy to the Sinyoría d'Albarrazín with respect to the two kingdoms. ==List of Emirs Banu Razin === *Hudayl Djalaf 'Izz ad-Dawla: 1012–1045 *Abu Marwan 'Abd al-Malik: 1045–1103 *Yahya Husam ad-Dawla: 1103–1104 ==See also== * List of Sunni Muslim dynasties == References == Albarracin Category:Berber dynasties Category:History of Aragon Category:States and territories established in 1012 Category:1012 establishments in Europe Category:States and territories disestablished in 1104 Category:1104 disestablishments in Europe Category:Albarracin Category:11th-century establishments in Al-Andalus Category:12th-century disestablishments in Al-Andalus ","title":"Taifa of Albarracín"},{"id":"19267141","text":"The Acaraú Valley State University' (', UVA) is a state-operated university located in Sobral, Ceará, Brazil. ==External links== * Universidade Estadual do Vale do Acaraú (Portuguese) Ceara Category:Education in Ceará ","title":"State University of Vale do Acaraú"},{"id":"19267191","text":"Straight is a 2007 German film by director Nicolas Flessa. ==Plot== The young German-Polish Jana does everything possible to give the impression of a straight acting woman.

He was one of five sons of William Hillary and his wife Agnes, a landowning family which held properties in Lincolnshire, Warwickshire, Staffordshire, and Leicestershire, and appear to have been related to Sir William Bereford, the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; a useful connection for a nascent lawyer. In 1310 Hillary was recorded as a court attorney, and in 1324 he was made a Serjeant-at-law. In the later years of Edward II's reign Hillary kept a low profile. In spring 1320 he married Katherine, and added to his property portfolio the Manor of Fisherwick near Lichfield in 1327 and a life-grant of a mill at Bentley at around the same time. After Edward's deposition in 1327 his career began to advance; in 1329 he was made Chief Justice of the Irish Court of Common Pleas, which he held for eight years. His position within the Irish judicial system seems to have been in name only; his commissions in England began to dramatically increase. In 1332 he was tasked with investigating Breakers of the Kings Peace in Staffordshire, and in 1335 he was investigated the activities of administrators in the West Midlands. He was knighted in 1336, and on 18 March 1337 he became a justice of the English Court of Common Pleas. In August 1338, he was tasked with investigating the fate of the wealth of Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel, who had been executed in 1326, and in 1340 he worked as a tax assessor and collector in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. In 1341, he was made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas to replace Sir John Stonor, who had been removed following a purge of the administration. Stonor was returned to his position in 1342, however, and Hillary was instead made a Puisne Justice. In 1344, he was part of a special commission investigating the demands of the House of Commons in return for granting a tax, and in 1348 he was appointed a justice for an Eyre in Kent, one which never took place. In 1351, he was tasked with enforcing the Statute of Labourers in Worcestershire, and after the retirement of Sir John Stonor in 1354 he was reappointed as Chief Justice, a position he held until his death in 1356.Oxford DNB: Hillary, Sir Roger ==References== Category:1356 deaths Category:Chief Justices of the Common Pleas Category:Justices of the Common Pleas Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Knights Bachelor ","title":"Roger Hillary"},{"id":"19267438","text":"The Taifa of Arcos () was a Berber medieval taifa kingdom that existed in two periods; first from 1011 to 1068.

These are (a) the Imperial Crown (b) the Royal Arms (c) the Arms of the Prince of Wales who was the first Grand Prior under the Royal Charter of 1888 (d) the Crest of that Prince of Wales, and (e) the then Arms of the Order. With effect from 1 January 2020, and following depletion of manufacturer's stock, medals will be issued with the inscription \\"THE MOST VENERABLE ORDER OF THE HOSPITAL OF ST JOHN OF JERUSALEM\\", and \\"FOR SERVICE\\" at the bottom. In Canada the legend will be in Latin, \\"VENERABILISSIMI ORDINIS HOSPITALIS SANCTI JOHANNIS HIEROSOLYMITANI\\". On 1 January 2020 an Ultra Long Service (ULS) extension to the St John Service Medal was introduced. It is of the same design as the Service Medal using base metal with a gold or similar plate finish. This version of the Service Medal will be awarded to recognize 50 years of qualifying service. Subsequent service will be recognized by gold bars every five years. It is the only British medal to retain the effigy of Queen Victoria on a current issue, the image based on a bust of the queen created by Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll. The medal's design has been largely unaltered since its creation, though the script changed from gothic to seriffed capital letters in 1960, and the metal composition has evolved from its original silver, to silver plated base metal (1947), silver plated cupro-nickel (1960), before reaching its current rhodium-plated cupro-nickel composition in 1966. The medal had a ring suspension until 1913, when a straight bar suspension was introduced. The original practice of naming the recipient on the rim of the medal gradually ceased, except in New Zealand. The medal is suspended from a 38mm wide ribbon that has three black and two white stripes of equal width. On the ULS extension ribbon the central black stripe is dissected by a 3mm gold stripe. Where additional services beyond those required for the award have been performed, the ribbon may display a silver bar for each five years of additional service up to three silver bars. After twenty years of additional service all silver bars are removed and a gold bar is awarded. Thereafter each further five years of additional service a gold bar is awarded up to the 4 gold bars that will mark thirty five years of additional service. After fifty years of service (forty additional years) the Service Medal is removed and replaced by the Ultra Long Service extension. Gold bars are awarded thereafter for each five additional years. All bars are represented on the undress ribbon by one or more appropriately coloured Maltese crosses.St. John Ambulance Canada's Honours and Awards Pages From 1932 until after the Second World War, a top suspender broach bar was issued to recipients who served with either the Military Hospitals Reserve or the Voluntary Aid Detachments. The bar is silver and bears the letters 'M.H.R.' or 'V.A.D.', as appropriate, surmounted by crown. When the ribbon was worn alone, a roundel with the appropriate initials was worn on the ribbon. ==Qualifications== The medal is typically awarded to recognise efficient service to an eligible person who performs qualifying service in each year, which is properly recorded and certified, for the requisite period of years. While the length of service required for recognition has varied, the qualifying period of service was standardised worldwide to ten years for the Service Medal and fifty years for the ULS extension in 2020. ==Order of wear== In the United Kingdom, the Service Medal comes after the Solomon Islands Independence Medal and before the Badge of the Order of the League of Mercy in the order precedence. In Canada, the medal comes after the Queen's Medal for Champion Shot and before the Commissionaires Long Service Medal.Canadian Orders, Decorations and Medals - Precedence In Australia, the Service Medal should be worn as a long service medal after all other Imperial long service awards. In New Zealand, the Service Medal is worn after Commonwealth Independence Medals instituted by the Sovereign, and before Commonwealth Awards instituted by the Sovereign as Head of State, other than those of New Zealand or the United Kingdom. ==See also== *Order of St John *Royal Red Cross ==References== Category:Civil awards and decorations of Canada Category:Civil awards and decorations of the United Kingdom Category:Awards established in 1895 Category:1895 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Service Medal of the Order of St John"},{"id":"19267549","text":"The Taifa of Carmona () was a medieval Berber taifa kingdom.

The troops are about to be dispatched to take part in a war in the Middle East and there is believed to be a large amount of pay on the premises, to be shipped out with them. The gang enters an army barracks, disguised as soldiers and proceeds to the pay corps headquarters where, under the guise of maintenance work, they make sure that the alarms are disabled — which will give them time to make their escape once the robbery takes place. For the rest of the day they try to integrate themselves into the workings of the base, including being vaccinated for Overseas service, to avoid attracting attention. As night falls, they change into military police uniforms and head for the pay headquarters again, announcing on arrival that they have had reports of a fire. They begin searching the rooms. Starting a small blaze, they then order the premises to be evacuated. With the building empty, they break into the safe and steal over £100,000. Starting several fires to cover their activities, they then withdraw, carrying a fake casualty in a stretcher. As troops rush in from across the base to put out the fire, the men drive off to a secluded spot on the base where they had left an army truck. When an officer rings up the medics to check on the progress of the casualty, he is told nobody has arrived. Suspicious, he raises the alarm, and the whole camp is put on standby while the police are sent for. They are initially fooled into thinking the criminals have already left the camp. Meanwhile, the crooks successfully manage to escape the camp by tailing onto the end of a convoy. As the authorities slowly awake to what has happened, military police are dispatched after the convoy. After the truck leaves the convoy, it is tracked down by the army, with the criminals seemingly cornered in a disused country barn. They try to make a break for it, using a flamethrower to clear their path. Initially successful, they manage to outrun the troops, before their truck explodes. ==Cast== * Stanley Baker as Turpin * Helmut Schmid as Swavek * Tom Bell as Fenner * John Phillips as Colonel Fowler * Patrick Magee as Regimental Sergeant Major Hicks * John Westbrook as Captain Stafford * Jack May as Medical Officer * Frank Gatliff as Major Palmer * Michael Ripper as Corporal Freeman * John Rees as Sergeant Jones * Tom Adams as Corporal Glenn * Anthony Bate as Sergeant Reeves * Rodney Bewes as Private Maynard * Douglas Blackwell as Day * Glynn Edwards as Breakdown truck crewman * Stephen Lewis as Military Police Corporal (cashier's office) * Fulton Mackay as Corporal Henderson * Stanley Meadows as Sergeant White * Garfield Morgan as Military Policeman * Geoffrey Palmer as Military Policeman * Michael Robbins as Orford * Peter Welch as W.

The cathedral was closed in 1929, was converted to a cinema, a House of Officers (1939) and a museum of the Navy (1980). The Russian Orthodox Church reinstalled the cross on the main dome in 2002 and (for the first time since 1929) served the Divine Liturgy in the cathedral in 2005. Official site of Saint Petersburg Diocese In 2013, the Patriarch of Russia, with Prime Minister Dmitriy Medvedev and his spouse attending, conducted the ceremony of grand reconsecration in the now fully restored cathedral. ==Background== The first Orthodox church in Kronstadt was built in 1728–31. The wooden church remained the main place of worship in Russia's largest naval base until 1840, when the counterweights balancing the church bells broke through the rotting floors and seriously damaged the belltower structure. Emperor Nicholas I personally ordered the closure of the unsafe church and it was demolished in 1841. For the next half century worship occurred in temporary locations — in hospitals, barracks and even rented private houses; a temporary wooden church built in 1861 was inadequate for the ten thousand Kronstadt seamen from the start. Numerous Navy requests for construction funding were turned down or simply left unanswered, Official site of Saint Petersburg Diocese. Report of Protopresbyter of the Navy, 5 August 1896 despite the fact that the cost of a building as large as a contemporary cathedral (200 to 500 thousand roubles)Savelyev, 2005, pp. 97–122. Official site of Saint Petersburg Diocese. Correspondence of Director of Navy in 1896 was less than 10% of a pre-dreadnought battleship’s cost (RUB4 to 6 million). Construction management, extremely centralized until the reign of Alexander II, was gradually decentralized in the 1880s–1890s. The right to initiate individual construction projects passed from the Emperor himself to imperial ministers and department chiefs.Savelyev, 2008, p. 143. In 1896 admiral Pavel Tyrtov, director of the Imperial Russian Navy Ministry, started preparations to build a cathedral in Kronstadt in earnest. Tyrtov insisted that the cathedral be built on the site identified nearly two centuries earlier by Peter I and reasoned that it should not cost more than the new Kharkov cathedral (200,000 roubles).Tyrtov underestimated the costs. Kharkiv cathedral was consecrated in 1897 but work continued until 1901; the final cost was over 400,000 roubles (Savelyev, 2005, pp. 111–2). ==The contests== In 1897, the Navy declared an international architectural contest for the design of Kronstadt cathedral and established a fund to finance construction. Typically for Russia, the project was sponsored by the state, intended for the state Navy, but initially financed by personal donations of the Navy servicemen and general public.Savelyev, 2005, p. 174.The same applied to \\"military\\" churches in the Caucasus, where state budget or private transfers by Romanovs accounted for one third of total costs or less. The rest was paid by the Army officers. From 1898 to 1913, all servicemen of the Baltic Fleet were charged 1/400 of their salary to finance the construction; this amounted to 280 thousand roubles, not including truly voluntary donations. Official site of Saint Petersburg Diocese. Financing and development . Later, as the project unfolded, it became obvious that private donations were insufficient and the state treasury paid for most of the costs. Official site of Saint Petersburg Diocese. Construction of the cathedral The contest specified cathedral size in terms of number of worshippers — one thousand men, 16 per square sazhen. This was far smaller than contemporary cathedrals built in provincial towns (Nizhny Novgorod — 2,000 worshippers,Savelyev, 2005, p. 185. Kharkiv — 4,000Savelyev, 2005, p. 111.), more on par with \\"garrison churches\\" built in the Caucasus and Congress Poland (Kielce — 900 worshippers).Savelyev, 2005, p. 117. The client was well aware of new construction technologies and welcomed their use as long as it helped to balance the budget. The basement level was reserved only for boilers and fuel storage, saving the costs of establishing a second \\"winter (i.e. heated) church\\". The specifications did not prescribe a specific architectural style. Rather, they insisted on cutting costs and prohibited use of such \\"luxuries\\" as mosaics or paintings on the inner surface of the dome. These constraints failed the first contest. Only three architects dared to participate, reusing already familiar past drafts; all three were rejected. The second contest of 1897 also failed; the only draft deemed worthy of execution was too small for the intended purpose. Finally, in 1898, the Navy lifted some of size and cost constraints; this time, the building had to be large enough to be visible from large distance; \\"the Cross of the cathedral must be the first item visible to incoming ships\\". Antony Tomishko, author of Kresty prison, won this contest by presenting a Russian Revival draft following Konstantin Thon's Russo-Byzantine tradition. Nicholas II routinely approved the draft; John of Kronstadt called for immediate start of construction work. Official site of Saint Petersburg Diocese. Letter of St. John of Kronstadt, 27 February 1898 . However, the newly appointed commander of Kronstadt base admiral Stepan Makarov found Tomishko’s draft too weak artistically and too small for the purpose. He requested the Emperor to reconsider his choice; after nearly two years of delays, Nicholas agreed to discard Tomishko’s draft in June 1900.Savelyev, 2005, p. 175. ==Design== {  border=\\"1\\" -  200x200px  200x200px  150x150px  150x150px -  Western (main) facade Vasily Kosyakov  Structural cutaway Vasily Kosyakov  Alpha and Omega artwork Georgy Kosyakov  Ritual candelabrum Georgy Kosyakov } Makarov took control of the project and invited Vasily Kosyakov (1862–1921), already a renowned master of Neo-Byzantine architecture. The process of this choice remains undocumented, however, Kosyakov had worked for the Navy before as the architect of church of Our Lady the Merciful in Saint Petersburg. Kosyakov, still in his twenties, had perfected the optimal proportions of a single-dome, four-apse Byzantine design; his 1888–91 drafts of a church in Astrakhan (itself based on Our Lady the Merciful) were reused all over the Empire.A nearly identical copy of Astrakhan church was built in Kamianets-Podilskyi, a reduced-scale variant in Svencionys and an increased- scale variant in Nizhny Novgorod (Savelyev, 2005, pp. 257–61). Vasily's younger brother and partner Georgy Kosyakov (1872–1925) was a talented graphic artist; he worked on interiors and finishes while Vasily handled overall and structural design. Makarov personally instructed Kosyakov that the cathedral must accommodate 5,000 worshippers and follow the historical Byzantine canon. In 1900–1, Vasily Kosyakov travelled to Istanbul and Greece to refresh his understanding of genuine Byzantine art. In April 1901, he presented two preliminary drafts to the Commission of the Navy; the selected draft was approved by Nicholas II 21 May 1901. Kosyakov departed from his preferred proportions of a tall cathedral with a relatively small main dome; instead he opted for a wide (26 meters) but relatively low dome in line with the proportions of Hagia Sophia. The reason for this change remains undocumented. One version attributes it to interference by Makarov. The admiral once was an attache in Istanbul and was well aware of the genuine Byzantine tradition. Another likely version links the change to direct influence of professor Nikolay Sultanov, Kosyakov's teacher at the Institution of Civil Engineers, leader of Russian Revival school. In 1895–1904, Kosyakov was managing the construction of Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in Peterhof designed by Sultanov. By 1903, Kosyakov brothers produced a complete album containing nearly a thousand graphic sheets detailing the structure, exterior and internal design of yet unbuilt cathedral. Physically, the graphics were executed by Georgy Kosyakov. Plan, structure, external outline is credited to Vasily Kosyakov; detailed artwork of interior finishes to Georgy. Interior features were clearly influenced by Art Nouveau, skillfully integrated into a Byzantine shell and complemented with modern engineering systems. Vasily Kosyakov’s layout also demonstrates influence of Romanesque architecture, notably in the twin belltowers by the sides of the main portal — an extremely uncommon feature in Russian practice.Savelyev, 2005, p. 176. ==Construction== Original interiors in 1914. The altar is raised on a high platform. Base of the main dome is set at height.Savelyev, 2005, p. 177. The marble icon screen 27 October 1901, the 14,000 strong garrison of Kronstadt was summoned for the groundbreaking on Anchor Square. Earthwork and work on concrete foundations and a granite base continued through 1902; the walls were laid in a massive ceremony 8 May 1903, with the Emperor in attendance.Savelyev, 2005, p. 176. Despite social unrest that culminated in the Russian revolution of 1905, the cathedral was structurally complete in 1907; heating and ventilation were operational in 1908, enabling year-round work on the finishes. In 1907, Kosyakov brothers switched to producing detailed drawings and instructions to craftsmen and suppliers of interior finishes. 19 August 1908, they presented the revised album of these drawings to the Romanovs. Nicholas and Alexandra responded with numerous amendments and changes that were implemented by spring of 1909. In summer of 1909 the external finishes were completed, and the scaffolds removed. The building was clad in black granite (base and columns) and yellow brick (walls) with terra cotta inserts. Inside, the iconostasis was made of marble from the Urals. The four portals were decorated with mosaic images of Theotokos, Saint Nicholas, Peter, Paul, John of Rila and Mitrofan of Voronezh by Foma Raylian. Most interior paintings were executed by the school of Mikhail Vasilyev; icons were painted by Appolon Troitsky. Adjacent park was designed by E. G. Gilbikh. The cathedral was equipped with an independent central heating and a central vacuum cleaning system employing a complex network of pressurized manifolds and valves. Electrical lighting employed 5 thousand light bulbs. The cathedral was consecrated in a public ceremony attended by Nicholas II and his family 10 June 1913. Total cost reached an unprecedented amount of 1,955,000 roubles, not including donations in kind and unpaid labor by the seamen and civilians. ==Operation== Dmitry Medvedev and his wife at the festivities in the Naval cathedral. The cathedral operated as such for only 16 years. It was closed 14 October 1929 by the communist regime and its valuables were nationalized to the state treasury. A small portion of these relics were displayed at the Museum of Navy and the Russian Museum. In 1930—1931 the communist authorities had the cathedral defaced: its crosses and bells were toppled over and hauled to the foundries. One bell, weighing 4,726 kilograms (second largest) remained in place — either due to technical difficulties or deliberately, as an emergency alarm signal. Internal marble items, including the iconostasis and the memorial boards with names of the fallen seamen, were ripped out, broken or cut and reused for ordinary construction needs. A small number of memorial boards ended up in the Museum of Navy and were \\"written off\\" in 1970. Official site of Saint Petersburg Diocese. Cathedral in Soviet period Suspended ceiling, built in 1956 (photo before renovation) In 1932 the cathedral nave was converted to a cinema, frivolously named New Star (in English, transliterated in Cyrillic) but soon renamed to more appropriate Maxim Gorky; in 1939 the cinema was upgraded to a House of the Officers (akin to a community center) of Kronshtadt garrison. During World War II it closed; the dome received three direct artillery hits. Post-war \\"reconstruction\\" of 1953—54 finally converted the cathedral to a functioning concert hall. This time, the builders added a suspended ceiling that isolated the nave from the dome; it remained in place as of the end of 2007. Reduction of military personnel in the 1960s made the concert hall redundant; in 1980 the cathedral reopened as a branch of the Central Museum of Navy. The Russian Orthodox Church attempted to repossess the cathedral in the 1990s. The first cross to be reinstalled on the main dome was made in 1996 but was not erected due to financial problems. The second attempt, in 2002, employed a heavy helicopter and nearly ended in a disaster: the seven-meter cross fell from the dome and was damaged beyond repair; there were no human injuries. The third cross was successfully erected 24 November 2002. Three years later, 2 November 2005, the church celebrated the first Divine Liturgy in the Naval Cathedral since 1929. In September 2008 the cathedral became operational again, but services were only conducted on special occasions. The cathedral then underwent extensive repairs, restoration, and improvements, and was reconsecrated on 30 May 2013, by Patriarch Cyril, in time for the cathedral's centennial anniversary. In his remarks at the reconsecration, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said the cathedral looked \\"better than 100 years ago.\\" == See also == * List of largest Orthodox cathedrals * List of tallest domes ==References== * Savelyev, Yu.

The family were on friendly terms with the North German writer Theodor Storm. Her eldest brother Theodor died as a fifteen-year-old, her brother Ernst was an ultra-nationalist writer and eventually became a Nazi. The family Schloss at Husum While young she was in constant conflict with her mother. She was thrown out of boarding school for misbehavior and lack of respect for the authorities. After being sent to stay with a family friend in 1893, she fled to Hamburg. Here she met Walter Lübke, who financed her art studies in Munich, and whom she married in 1894. Her artistic studies also included singing, with instruction by Charlotte Lachs.https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth321607/m1/2/zoom/?q=lillebridge&resolution;=2⪫=3474.564028337197&lon;=1756.4536032888116 The marriage broke up when she set off again in 1895 to Munich, to continue her studies. They were divorced in 1897. In September of that year her son Rolf was born; she never divulged the name of the father (although it is very likely to have been the Polish-born painter & engraver Adolf Eduard Herstein). In Munich she supported herself by translation work for the Albert Langen Publishing House and by writing short articles for magazines and newspapers such as Simplicissimus and the Frankfurter Zeitung. After taking some acting lessons in 1898 she had a short engagement at the Theater am Gärtnerplatz. Otherwise she took casual jobs as a secretary, assistant cook, insurance agent and so on to keep going. As usual in Bohemian circles she also received financial help from male friends and casual acquaintances. Karl Wolfskehl, Alfred Schuler, Ludwig Klages, Stefan George, Albert Verwey. Photograph by Karl Bauer She was a friend of Ludwig Klages and thus became part of the Munich Cosmic Circle based around the mystic Alfred Schuler, which also included Karl Wolfskehl. It broke up in acrimonious circumstances in 1904. She wrote about her experiences with the Circle in her Roman à clef Herrn Dames Aufzeichnungen (1913). She also got to know Theodor Lessing, Erich Mühsam, Oskar Panizza, Rainer Maria Rilke, Marianne von Werefkin, Alexej von Jawlensky, Frank Wedekind and many others of the \\"Munich Moderns\\". With her son she travelled to Samos (1900), Italy (1904, 1907) and Corfu (1906/1907).Stein, pp. 95–111 She left Munich for Ascona in Switzerland in 1910 (Monte Verità), where she wrote her \\"Schwabing\\" novels. In 1911 married Baron Alexander von Rechenberg-Linten, a marriage of convenience, which enabled him to inherit 20,000 Marks. However, he lost this in a bank collapse in 1914. In 1916 she moved to Muralto on Lago Maggiore. She died in 1918 in a clinic in Locarno following a bicycle accident and was buried in the cemetery of the Santa Maria in Selva church in Locarno. Emil Ludwig spoke at her funeral. ==Feminism== Reventlow is best known as one of the most unorthodox voices of the early women's movement in Europe. While many of her peers were pressing for improved social, political, and economic rights for women, Reventlow argued that ardent feminists, whom she labelled \\"viragos,\\" were actually harming women by attempting to erase or deny the natural differences between men and women. Reventlow maintained that sexual freedom, and the abolition of the institution of marriage, were the best means by which women could hope to achieve a more equal social standing with men. == Works == * (with Otto Eugen Thossan) Klosterjungen.

Released in the U.S. as Scotch on the Rocks, it was adapted from the 1951 novel Laxdale Hall by Eric Linklater. ==Plot== The few car owners of Laxdale, a remote village on the Isle of Skye, refuse to pay their Road Fund taxes, in protest against the poor state of the only road linking them to the rest of the island. Summonses sent out via the local police mysteriously 'disappear'. The government sends a delegation to investigate. It is led by Samuel Pettigrew, a pompous politician and industrialist, whose Mother was born in Laxdale. He is accompanied by another MP, Hugh Marvell, and Andrew Flett from the Scottish Office. Pettigrew suggests abandoning the village and setting up a New Town, Brumley Dumps, 100 miles away. But the villagers are highly unimpressed. Flett (Fulton Mackay), a former teacher, begins romancing the local schoolteacher (Prunella Scales). Marvell spends his time with the daughter of the Laird, a retired General. The villagers see everything differently. In the middle of torrential rain, the local poacher chats casually with the undertaker saying \\"ach, there's a bit of mist on the hill\\". The hearse is used to transport his poached stag. Later, in the pouring rain, they hold an open air production of MacBeth. The play is abandoned when news arrives that there are poachers from Glasgow on the estate (local poachers are tolerated). They ambush the poachers and the police arrest them. By the time the delegation is ready to leave, Pettigrew has accepted the viewpoint of the villagers; they must have a new road. ==Production== Applecross House The external scenes were shot in Applecross and \\"Laxdale Hall\\" is in fact Applecross House, an early 18th century laird's house of formal composition.http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB459 ==Cast== * Ronald Squire as General Matheson * Kathleen Ryan as Catriona Matheson * Raymond Huntley as Samuel Pettigrew, M.P. * Sebastian Shaw as Hugh Marvell, M.P. * Fulton Mackay as Andrew Flett of the Scottish Office * Jean Colin as Lucy Pettigrew * Jameson Clark as Roderick McLeod the local poacher * Grace Gavin as Mrs. McLeod * Keith Faulkner as Peter McLeod * Prunella Scales as Morag McLeod * Kynaston Reeves as Reverend Ian Macaulay * Andrew Keir as McKellaig * Nell Ballantyne as Nurse Connachy * Roddy McMillan as Willie John Watt * Rikki Fulton as First Poacher * Eric Woodburn as Gamlie, leader of the Poachers * Archie Duncan as Police Sergeant at Kyle of Lochalsh * Ian MacNaughton as Police Constable * Howard Connell as the postman ==Critical reception== The Radio Times wrote, \\"The huge success of director Alexander Mackendrick's Whisky Galore! meant it was inevitable that film-makers would cast around for more stories of wily Scots running rings around the stiff- necked English.

The bill would have required the consent of the Prime Minister for the appointment and dismissal of the Prosecutor General by the President, given the government power to appoint local heads of government if the President rejects the candidates, stripped from the President the right to reject a candidate for Prime Minister, dismiss the Defense, Interior and Foreign Ministers, and appoint a head of the State Intelligence Service. President Yushchenko stated that a clear position on the events in Georgia was one of the conditions under which return to talks in the Parliament was possible, as well as the repeal of all the constitutional laws adopted after 3 September. Yushchenko claimed that a \\"de-facto coalition\\" was formed with 'no other aims but to conduct coup d'état and usurp power in the country'. Tymoshenko stated that the real intentions behind the President's party in 'declaring war on her' was to ensure his victory in the next presidential election, although she still called for a reformation of the coalition between the two parties. She also reiterated her position on the Georgian conflict, claiming to be neutral and more in line with the EU. Yuri Lutsenko leader of Civil Movement \\"People's Self-Defense\\" (part of the Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc) said that the breakup of the coalition was provoked by the Secretariat of the President and that \\"People’s Self Defense\\" was categorically against it. Foreign media reported that the political crisis was sparked by the armed conflict between Russia and Georgia that started in early August 2008 and began with a dispute between President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko over Ukraine's reaction to that conflict. The President gave his support for Georgia and strong criticism of Russia whereas other parties professed more balanced positions towards the two parties of that conflict. On 16 September, the collapse of the BYuT/NU-NS coalition was officially announced. Following the failure to re-create the coalition, the Ukrainian parliament was dissolved by president Yushchenko on 8 October 2008, giving way to the third parliamentary election in three years. Poland’s former President Aleksander Kwaśniewski stated dismissing Verkhovna Rada, Yushchenko \\"shot himself in the foot. There was a chance to create a wide democratic coalition of BYUT, NUNS and the Lytvyn bloc, and we were working on it. Pres Yushchenko 'may suffer a substantial pratfall'.\\"zik.com.ua, Yushchenko shoots himself in the foot – Aleksander Kwasniewski The crisis ended when the Orange Coalition was reformed on 9 December 2008, but including Lytvyn's Bloc after Volodymyr Lytvyn was elected as parliamentary speaker the day before.http://www.rferl.org/content/Ukrainian_PM_Says_Crisis_Over_Vows_New_Blood_In_Government/1358204.html == Treason accusation == During the conflict between Russia and Georgia, Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko issued a decree requiring advance notice of the movements of the Russian Black Sea Fleet into and out of the Ukrainian port of Sevastopol. He also came out strongly in support of Georgia's President Mikheil Saakashvili, condemning Russia's attacks within Georgia. Tymoshenko and her bloc put forward a less critical position towards Russia and the Prime Minister herself was out of public view during much of the conflict. On 18 August 2008 Yushchenko's office accused the Prime Minister of taking a softer position as a way to win the support of Russia during the 2010 Presidential election. Andriy Kyslynskyi, the president's deputy chief of staff, said Tymoshenko's actions showed \\"signs of high treason and political corruption\\" adding that documents supporting these allegations were being handed over to prosecutors. Tymoshenko denied the accusations and rejected the accusation that she was soft in her support for Georgia, saying that she supported the \\"sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia\\" but she does not agree with the president’s tough stance on the Black Sea Ports and defends her position as being \\"in line with the European Union and not to drag Ukraine into conflicts\\". Andriy Semchenko, an MP from the Tymoshenko bloc, called on the President and the head of the President's Secretariat Viktor Baloha to apologize to the PM before there could be constructive work in the coalition. He said it was not appropriate for the President and Baloha to spread information that Tymoshenko was a traitor. == Coalition collapses == On 1 September 2008 Prime Minister Tymoshenko put forward draft legislation which would facilitate the procedure for impeachment, though she insisted it would not affect President Yushchenko and was meant for future presidents. When the legislation came to a vote two days later, Tymoshenko's bloc voted together with the Party of Regions and Communists to pass it. They also approved legislation limiting the powers of the President while increasing the powers of the Prime Minister. In particular the parties approved legislation which would strip the President of the right to reject a candidate for Prime Minister, dismiss the Defense, Interior and Foreign Ministers and appoint a head of the State Intelligence Service. Yushchenko promised to veto the legislation. Following the vote President Yushchenko's bloc pulled out of the governing coalition saying Tymoshenko was colluding with the opposition and the President warned he would call a snap election if a new coalition was not formed within the required time. He further accused Tymoshenko of trying to set up a \\"dictatorship of the prime minister\\" and calling the parliamentary vote \\"a political and constitutional coup d'état.\\" Tymoshenko rejected the allegations and said the real reason the president \\"declared a war against me is to ensure his victory in the next presidential elections.\\" In spite of this Tymoshenko has called for restoring the coalition between the two groups. She also defended her position on Georgia saying it was \\"in line with the European Union and it is not to drag Ukraine into conflicts.\\" Parliament further increased the powers of the Prime Minister by passing legislation requiring the appointment and dismissal of the Prosecutor General by the President to receive the consent of the Prime Minister and giving the government power to appoint local heads of government if the President rejects the candidates. On 8 September, Our Ukraine MP Andry Parubij claimed Tymoshenko and Regions had already reached a deal on forming a new government and were dividing up posts for a new cabinet (a claim Tynoshenko has denied). He also said that if a coalition is formed between Tymoshenko's bloc and Regions, Our Ukraine would appeal to the Constitutional Court to assess the legality of the December 2004 changes made in the constitution which, if successful, would restore wide powers held by the office of president. During the \\"Freedom of Speech\\" program on 9 September 2008 Tymoshenko said she was \\"categorically against\\" the decrees made by Yushchenko on the Russian Black Sea Fleet saying they risked provoking a response from Russia. On 10 September, Tymoshenko reiterated her call for the coalition to be restored, but said she would not accept any preconditions for Our Ukraine to return. She also said at the moment they were not discussing any other coalition. Tymoshenko added that a snap poll would \\"destroy the normal life of the country\\" so it was not a way out of the crisis. The same day Yan Bernazyuk, Yushchenko's liaison to the government of Tymoshenko, said representatives of the Presidential Secretariat were not allowed to attend the government session. Bernazyuk claimed the reason was because the government was discussing four issues which had a \\"clear Kremlin face\\" concerning \\"permits on use of mineral products without any contests, sales, and tenders.\\" Yushchenko urged representatives and members of the regional, city and district councils to unite against the formation of a new coalition by retaining the \\"democratic coalition\\" in the local governments as well as for all other \\"national forces\\" to unite. He said the new relationship between the Tymoshenko bloc and Regions was a \\"serious threat for democratic choice of Ukraine\\" which was in danger of reconsidering \\"national priorities to principles of democratic governing, including the local one.\\" Officials from the Party of Regions accused Yushchenko of planning to impose direct presidential rule by dissolving the parliament without calling early elections. At the same time members of the Central Election Commission sympathetic to Yushchenko would resign prolonging the time without an acting parliament. Another claim said Yushchenko had secretly instructed the oblast governors and leaders of NGOs to request the imposition of a direct presidential rule by Yushchenko and that he would launch a military coup. Yushchenko denied planning to resolve the crisis with force saying Ukraine can resolve the crisis in a \\"democratic way\\" through dialogue. On 16 September, the collapse of the BYuT/NU-NS coalition was officially announced. Yulia Tymoshenko unleashed one of her harshest attacks on Yushchenko yet, accusing the President of destroying the gains of the Orange Revolution, sinking hopes of rebuilding the coalition. \\"Since 2004, this president has managed to destroy everything: people's faith in the ideals of the revolution and faith in the president himself – only 5 percent still support him,\\" she told reporters after a cabinet meeting. \\"Unfortunately, this president will leave a legacy of shattered remnants of the 'orange' promises and democratic coalitions, of his own team and even of his friends and his own political standing.\\"\\"Ukraine PM fires broadside at Yushchenko\\". Reuters. Kyiv Post. 17 September 2008. Tymoshenko also blamed Yushchenko for \\"everything bad that will happen in relations between Ukraine and Russia\\" calling for Ukraine to pursue a more \\"balanced\\" policy towards Russia. Yushchenko accused Tymoshenko and the Party of Regions of trying to create a twoparty system in parliament. The two blocs joined forces in drafting and registering a new law in parliament on 17 September that would introduce a two-round election system for parliament which would likely lead to BYuT and Regions being the only parties in parliament after the next election. Viktor Yanukovich said his party did not want to initiate early elections and added \\"The Constitution must be changed so as to provide efficient operation of authorities.\\" On 18 September, Yulia Tymoshenko refused to resign as prime minister as agreed under a coalition pact saying \\"The coalition has not collapsed.... It's the president and part of his team betraying the democratic coalition who have left it unilaterally.\\" She also made reference to the alleged poisoning plot that almost killed President Viktor Yushchenko in 2004 by saying \\"The main poisoning is the poisoning with unlimited power, a serious intoxication in the presidential secretariat.\\" Yushchenko accused Tymoshenko of not providing adequate funding for Ukraine's military and asked when she would show respect to Ukraine's soldiers. President Yushchenko later said Tymoshenko was working with the Party of Regions, and the Communist Party on decisions aimed at destabilizing the country in order to establish a new political regime. Yuriy Yekhanurov, Ukraine's Defense Minister and member of Yushchenko's Our Ukraine bloc, said he and his political force would take all effort necessary to maintain the stability of the country. On 19 September Yulia Tymoshenko called the information about the existence of an informal coalition between BYuT, the Party of Regions and Communist Part of Ukraine \\"black political propaganda\\". The Premier believed that the spreading of such information was aimed at changing the arrangement of political forces leading up to the Ukrainian presidential elections in 2010. She also stated: \\"I think that this (the creation of a coalition of a different format) can be a last resort and forced step before the dissolving of the Verkhovna Rada, the Communists have nothing to do with this\\". On 22 September Our Ukraine issued a statement which said: \\"People’s Union Our Ukraine call on everybody, for who the values of independence and freedom are more important than personal or group interests, to unite around President of Ukraine Victor Yushchenko, as a guarantor of the national state, and around Our Ukraine, as the only real force defending Ukrainian interests in the current Verkhovna Rada\\" and called on BYuT members to \\"put interests of nation before the interests of party leaders, to refuse being accomplices of the plot (to revise the Ukrainian Constitution and give all power to the hands of the pro-Kremlin parliamentary oligarchs), and to take part in the unification process of Ukrainian democratic forces\\". On 26 September 2008, Tymoshenko suggested holding early parliamentary and presidential elections as a way out of the crisis.http://www.rferl.org/content/Ukraines_Tymoshenko_Suggests_Twin_Polls_As_Way_Out_Of_Crisis/1291854.html Tymoshenko said in parliament she would accept any conditions of Our Ukraine \\"in order to preserve Ukraine's strategic orientation, to preserve the parliament and not to throw the country into a new crisis.\\" Talks were on track to reforge the orange coalition by early October 2008.http://www.rferl.org/content/Tymoshenko_Says_Parties_On_Track_To_Restore_Orange_Coalition/1293748.html But no coalition was formed on 8 October and in the evening of 8 October while visiting Italy President Yushchenko announced Ukraine's third general election in less than three years in a pre-recorded speech on Ukrainian television. ==Opposition to Presidential decree== Most politicians, besides the president's closest allies, denounced the decree,Although on 13 October 2008 the main opposition party (Party of Regions) declared although the party did not support the idea of carrying out a snap poll it wanted the snap parliamentary poll to take place as soon as possible . with even some Yushchenko sympathisers and allies from the Presidents own party, vowing to challenge his action in the courts. On 10 October the People’s Self-Defense (PSD) leader Yuriy Lutsenko announced that all democratic forces should unite into a single democratic bloc on basis of BYuT at the snap poll. Although other PSD members disagreed and rather continued to collaborate with Our Ukraine. International reactions were also negative: the European Union did hope beforehand that there will be no snap elections and Poland’s former President Aleksander Kwaśniewski, stated that by dissolving the Verkhovna Rada, Yushchenko \\"shot himself in the foot.\\"\\"There was a chance to create a wide democratic coalition of BYuT, OU-PSD and the Lytvyn Bloc, and we were working on it. Pres Yushchenko 'may suffer a substantial pratfall'\\", Poland’s former President Aleksander Kwaśniewski stated. On 16 October, after resistance, the cabinet endorsed amendments to the 2008 national budget to finance the snap elections. Proposal by (19 October) by Yulia Tymoshenko to create a \\"megacoalition\\" and by Viktor Yanukovych (23 October) to create a \\"anti-crisis government\\" in the Ukrainian Parliament and postpone the snap elections until the threat of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 had passed lead to nothing. On 29 October the Ukrainian parliament (Verkhovna Rada) voted against a bill to finance the early elections. On 31 October, the Verkhovna Rada refused to include a provision on funding snap parliamentary elections into a bill on immediate anti-financial crisis measures. ===Juridical challenge of Presidential decree=== The Kyiv District Administrative Court on 11 October 2008 suspended Yushchenko's election call, responding to a lawsuit filed by BYuT MPs.Kiev court annuls presidential decree to dissolve parliament B92, 11 October 2008 Tymoshenko refused to approve funds for the election, stating that Ukraine couldn't afford an early election and that she expected parliament to refuse the necessary funds, as well.Ukraine PM says no to early elections Associated Press, 11 October 2008 Yushchenko appealed the suspension on the basis that he had fired the judge who gave the order beforehand. Prime Minister Tymoshenko and President Yushchenko dispatched rival security forces to the appeals and Tymoshenko's supporters planned to hold a round-the-clock vigil at the court to prevent illegal action from taking place. The Kyiv Prosecutor's Office also launched an investigation of the judge who suspending the decree on the charge of \\"knowingly passing an unlawful ruling\\". On 13 October President Yuschenko liquidated the Kyiv District Administrative Court altogether. On 15 October, Kyiv Regional Administrative Court suspended the president decree on liquidation of the Kyiv District Administrative after the Supreme Court had asked Yuschenko to cancel the decree on liquidation of the Kyiv District Administrative Court. So on 15 October Yuschenko liquidated the Kyiv District Administrative Court again. On 17 October The Kyiv Central Administrative Court has overturned the ruling of the Kyiv District Administrative Court. On 28 October The Kyiv Appeal Administrative Court cancelled the suspension of Yushchenko's election decision by the Kyiv District Administrative Court. ==End of crisis== On 22 October, President Yushchenko stated that the precise date for the early election could not be set until parliament (work in parliament was blocked by protests from 21 October till 24 October) approved finances for the poll and voted for legislation to help Ukraine through the world financial crisis. So far parliament hasn't approved funding. On 12 November 2008 Yushchenko stated in an interview published in the Warsaw daily Rzeczpospolita that the election could no longer take place this year because anti-crisis actions had to be undertaken first.

The District Court ruled that The Investigator had duly researched its statements and granted the motion. Summary judgment was reversed on appeal with respect to some of the alleged defamatory statements, with the Court of Appeals stating that evidence need not be clear and convincing for the purpose of summary judgment. A majority of the Supreme Court held that when a \\"clear and convincing\\" standard applies, it applies as well to summary judgment.

It is the first installment in a series of French softcore pornography films based on the novel Emmanuelle. The film stars Sylvia Kristel in the title role about a woman who takes a trip to Bangkok to enhance her sexual experience. The film was former photographer Just Jaeckin's debut feature film and was shot on location in Thailand and in France between 1973 and 1974. Emmanuelle was received negatively by critics on its initial release and with a more mixed reception years later. On its initial release in France, it was one of the highest-grossing French films. Columbia Pictures released both the original version and an English-dubbed version in the United States theatrically,\\"Soft Sell: Emmanuelle in America\\" (DVD feature). Lionsgate making it the first X-rated film released by the company. The film was popular in Europe, the United States, and Asia and was followed in 1975 by Emmanuelle, The Joys of a Woman. Several other films influenced by Emmanuelle were released including the Italian series Black Emanuelle. == Plot == Emmanuelle flies to Bangkok to meet her diplomat husband Jean. He asks her if she had any other lovers while she was in Paris; she replies that she has not. After taking a nude swim, Emmanuelle is approached by a pretty young girl named Marie-Ange, who asks to meet Emmanuelle at her house. Marie-Ange arrives at the house and finds Emmanuelle sleeping, and takes advantage of the situation to feel her body. Emmanuelle wakes up and they go outside where Marie-Ange asks Emmanuelle if she has any photos of herself and Jean having sex. After Emmanuelle replies she does not, Marie-Ange takes a French magazine with a photo of the actor Paul Newman and begins to masturbate in front of Emmanuelle. Emmanuelle confesses to Marie-Ange that while she did not cheat on her husband in Paris, she did have sex with two strangers on the flight over to Bangkok. Emmanuelle begins to masturbate as she recounts the tryst. At night, Emmanuelle tells Jean about Marie-Ange's lack of shame, which leads to Jean encouraging her to pursue the friendship. The next day at a party, Marie-Ange introduces Emmanuelle to one of her lovers, an older man named Mario. Emmanuelle sees a French archaeologist named Bee, who is outside of most of the expatriate circles and she strikes up a private conversation with Bee, to whom she hands a bracelet. After Emmanuelle's insistence, Bee asks her to meet her at the Watsai klong at 2 p.m. Emmanuelle meets Bee at the location but Bee is uninterested in Emmanuelle. She returns Emmanuelle's bracelet but she refuses to take it back. Undeterred, Emmanuelle gets on Bee's jeep as she is about to leave for the dig site. Meanwhile, Jean is angry that Emmanuelle has left without informing him and suspects that her squash partner Ariane is behind it. On asking her, Ariane tells him that all she has to offer is consolation sex. After a horseback ride, Emmanuelle and Bee reach a waterfall site where they spend some time. Then they go to the dig site where Emmanuelle distracts Bee from her work. The two have sex, but afterward, Bee asks Emmanuelle to leave. Emmanuelle returns home in tears, feeling humiliated. Jean returns home and finds her. He tries to comfort her and suggests that she should take another lover. The next day Emmanuelle and Ariane attempt to play squash but have an argument. Ariane is jealous that Emmanuelle ran off with Bee, as she had hoped to be Emmanuelle's first female lover, while Emmanuelle is displeased at Ariane for having sex with Jean. Their argument leads to Emmanuelle to meet with Mario, stating that at his age, making love becomes so difficult that any man capable of it must be an artist. After consulting with Jean, Emmanuelle resigns herself to a meeting with Mario for dinner. Mario tells Emmanuelle that monogamy will soon die out and that she must learn to let lust, rather than guilt or reason, guide her when it comes to sex, which will lead her to greater levels of pleasure. To instill this lesson, Mario takes her to an opium den, where she is raped by one of the denizens while he watches. Mario then takes Emmanuelle to a boxing ring, where he talks two young men into fighting each other for the right to have sex with her. Mario tells Emmanuelle to choose one of the men as her favorite. After the match, her chosen champion prevails and she is so aroused by his willingness to fight for her that she licks the blood from a wound on his forehead and then allows him to have sex with her. Later, Emmanuelle is awakened by Mario, who tells her to change into a dress with a zipper down the back, allowing Mario to strip her instantly for her next sexual encounter. Emmanuelle protests that she is tired and asks Mario if he himself will ever have sex with her. Mario replies that he is waiting for the \\"next Emmanuelle\\". The film ends with Emmanuelle sitting at a mirror and applying makeup, hoping that by following Mario's instructions, she will reach the higher levels of pleasure that he has promised. ==Cast== * Alain Cuny as Mario * Sylvia Kristel as Emmanuelle * Marika Green as Bee, French archaeologist * Daniel Sarky as Jean, Emmanuelle's husband * Jeanne Colletin as Arianne * Christine Boisson as Marie-Ange * Gabriel Briand as Gaby Brian * Samantha ==ProductionPre-production=== Sylvia Kristel in 1973, two years before Emmanuelle was released in the United States. Due to the success of the film of Last Tango in Paris which contained explicit sexual scenes and rise of interest in hardcore pornography, producers became aware of an audience that was willing to watch adult films. Producer Yves Rousset-Rouard obtained the rights to Emmanuelle in 1972. Emmanuelle was not the first adaptation of the novel of the same name. The first was an adaptation made in the late 1960s from producer Pierre Thron which was less explicit than the original novel.Shipka, 2011. p.296Shipka, 2011. p.297 Rousset-Rouard offered the film to artist and photographer Just Jaeckin, who had never directed a feature film previously. After reading the novel, Jaeckin felt daunted by the film's subject matter and agreed with Rousset-Rouard to make what he described as \\"something soft and beautiful with a nice story\\" Casting sessions were held throughout Europe to find the right actress to play the leading role. Sylvia Kristel auditioned for the film in clothing with a simple tie-up string that came off during the interview accidentally as Kristel continued to take interview questions as if nothing had happened. After taking some nude photographs of Kristel, Jaeckin hired her for the role of Emmanuelle. ===Production=== Emmanuelle was shot between December 10, 1973 and February 6, 1974. The film was shot on location in Thailand while interior shots were done in Paris, France. Kristel found it very difficult to film the scene involving Emmanuelle being raped by two men in an opium den in Bangkok.Shipka, 2011. p.299 Kristel stated that she \\"couldn't see how a rape would be pleasurable. These two Thai people were not actors. I really had to fight for my life there.\\" The scene was filmed in one take using several cameras. Jaeckin has denied directing the scene that involves a young woman in a Thai bar who smokes a cigarette out of her vagina. Just Jaeckin states he first saw that scene when viewing the film in a theater. ===Post-production=== The soundtrack to Emmanuelle was composed by Pierre Bachelet. The online music database AllMusic described the soundtrack to Emmanuelle as \\"both more sophisticated and more banal than your average stroke-film soundtrack\\" as well as stating that \\"the composers strive for a complexity and intimacy largely absent from the genre\\". The review compared pieces of the music anticipating the music of British musician Brian Eno's ambient music. The soundtrack employs synthesizers and acoustic guitar. The music featured during Kristel's erotic scenes is a series of variations on Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part Two by King Crimson. ==Release== In the United States, Emmanuelle was marketed without a focus on its exploitative nature. The tagline \\"X was never like this\\" was developed to give the audience a suggestion that the film was not like other x-rated films. Emmanuelle was released in France on June 26, 1974.Chaffin-Quiray, p.g 144. 2004 The film sold 8.89 million tickets in France.Lanzoni, p. 432. 2004 In the United Kingdom, Emmanuelle was the first adult film to play in regular British theaters after receiving extensive BBFC cuts to most of the sex scenes. For its initial video release in 1990 the scene in the bar where a woman smokes a cigarette from her vagina and the scene where the character Mario encourages the rape of Emmanuelle were cut. These edits were eventually waived for the 2007 Optimum DVD release. Emmanuelle was distributed in the United States by Columbia Pictures and was their first X rated film. Columbia agreed to distribute the film after learning that the audience seen in line for Emmanuelle was mostly women.Bernstein, 2000. p. 257 The advertising for the film took a highbrow approach to marketing the film opposed to focusing on its exploitative nature. Columbia's president David Begelman and former Young & Rubicam president Steve Frankfurt developed the tagline for the film \\"X was never like this.\\" This tagline was developed to give the audience an ambiguous reaction suggesting that the film was either more graphic than other X-rated films or more sophisticated and artistic. Jay Cocks described its promotion in Time, stating \\"No exclusive linage in the sex sheets, no adhesive stickers for the walls of public toilets. Emmanuelle is being hyped as a classier breed of porn.\\" The film earned $11.5 million at United States box office,Demspsey, John. \\"One- sheet wonder.\\", Variety, July 21, 1997 and it helped Columbia to recoup from their losses after the box office failure of Lost Horizon in 1973. ==Reception== The film received generally negative reviews from American critics on its initial release. Variety described Jaeckin's direction as \\"a bit pompous\\" and that outside Alain Cuny, the \\"acting is a bit self- conscious.\\" Roger Ebert was one of the few American critics who gave the film a positive review. Ebert stated that \\"in terms of its genre (softcore skin flick), it's very well done: lushly photographed on location in Thailand, filled with attractive and intriguing people, and scored with brittle, teasing music. Now that hardcore porno has become passe, it's a relief to see a movie that drops the gynecology and returns to a certain amount of sexy sophistication.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin described the film as \\"lacking both in spirit and eroticism, while celebrating all the fashion textures of sun-on- skin and producing a series of advertisements for what can only be described as 2-D sex.\\" Later reviews had mixed opinions. PopMatters gave the film a seven out of ten rating, describing it as holding \\"up as not just an erotic classic, but a cinematic classic, period.\\" The A.V. Club gave the film a \\"C\\" rating, stating that \\"it remains easy to get seduced by the film's slightly druggy, brainless sexiness\\" but that the film's subtext has not aged well, noting that the \\"film makes a lot of noise about 'sexual freedom' — the climactic scene in which the locals gang-rape Kristel while Cuny's silver- haired lech looks on — the question arises of just whose fantasy this is...and who's supposed to be freed by it.\\" TV Guide gave the film two and a half stars out of four, finding that the film took itself too seriously but that it was still a \\"relatively well-made picture.\\" Empire gave the film three stars out of five, noting that \\"Sylvia Kristel gives the essential take on the character, adding a sweetness and innocence, actually giving the traces of a performance\\" between the sex scenes. Total Film awarded the film three stars out of five, finding its \\"theme of sensual discovery chimed with the feisty zeitgeist,\\" and \\"the rest of the film is daft, camp, over-oiled and dubbed to death, and yet... it's still a thrill.\\" ===Feminist reception=== In France, feminist viewers complained that the character of Emmanuelle was \\"an object of male fantasies.\\" In a review from 1974, Variety opined that Emmanuelle was \\"more a come-on for the civil service than for femme lib.\\" Film historian Danny Shipka wrote that \\"In Asia, many women saw it as a liberating piece focusing on the power and strength of Emmanuelle and not her exploitation.\\"Shipka, 2011. p.300 Sylvia Kristel stated that \\"Japanese feminists were rather delighted with the film because they thought Emmanuelle was dominant, just because of this one scene where she climbs on top of her husband. That was the moment when all the Japanese women stood up and applauded.\\" ==Legacy== Emmanuelle was followed up with a sequel titled Emmanuelle, The Joys of a Woman in 1975. Not wanting to be the director for the series, Just Jaeckin suggested his friend, fashion photographer Francis Giacobetti, direct the film. Sylvia Kristel reprised her role of Emmanuelle in the second film and the 1977 film Goodbye Emmanuelle.Shipka, 2011. p.305Shipka, 2011. p.306 Italian film producers wanted to capitalize on the international popularity of Emmanuelle by making a similar product that could be made cheaply. To work around copyright rules, these producers altered their spelling of Emmanuelle to create their series Black Emanuelle, starring Laura Gemser.Shipka, 2011. p.215 The British comedy film Carry On Emmanuelle is a parody of the Emmanuelle series. In Japan, the film popularized the phrase \\"emanieru suru,\\" which directly translates to \\"to do Emmanuelle,\\" meaning \\"to have a casual and extravagant love affair.\\" A later film making use of the Emmanuelle title is Emmanuelle in Soho (1981). == See also == * List of French films of 1974 == Notes  References == * * * Lanzoni, Rémi Fournier.

After this incident, Mrs. Gandhi used to call Nedumaran as her eldest son. === Human Rights === * 1981, in the name of encounters against naxalites, the police shot down many innocent youth in the Dharumapuri District of Tamil Nadu, India. At that time, Pala. Nedumaran, toured the affected villages of the district, met the people, interviewed them and uncovered the truth. He found that the landlords had been exploiting the agricultural laborers of the suppressed and backward communities and committing atrocities against them. He exposed the fact that the police force, in support of the landlords, had falsely accused innocent youth as naxalites and had suppressed them. He gave a report on his findings to the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, and brought these atrocities by the police force to an end. * Many Tamil freedom fighters from Sri Lanka, who had been badly wounded by the Sri Lankan Army were arrested and held in the special camps of Tamil Nadu. Nedumaran fought for them legally in the Courts, and made complaints to the National Human Rights Commission of India. Through these measures, many of them were retrieved from the Special Camps. * In the assassination case of Rajiv Gandhi, former Prime Minister of India, 13 Indian Tamils and 13 Sri Lankan Tamils, were sentenced to death by the Poonamalle TADA Special Court. The Supreme Court later quoted this judgment as 'a Judicial Murder'. Nedumaran, formed 'Save 26 Tamils Committee', in which more than 80 organisations were members. Through this committee he organized a campaign against the death sentence. He took the case over to the Supreme Court, and engaged Senior Advocates to appear for the accused. As a result, the Supreme Court released 19 of the 26, and reduced the death sentence of 3 to life sentence. * Even after the Supreme Court judgment, Nedumaran continued the campaign against the death sentence. He toured all over Tamil Nadu with the people released in the case, made them talk to the public about how they were brutally and inhumanly treated and falsely implicated in the case, and sentenced to death. As a result of his campaign, 'Abolition of Death Sentence' became a national issue. He also organized a signature campaign against death sentence, through which more than 10 million signatures were collected against death sentence. A huge rally for the cause was conducted in Chennai, at the end of which the signatures collected was given to the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. As a result of all this, the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, exercised his discretionary powers to reduce the death sentence of Mrs. Nalini, one of four sentenced to death by the Supreme Court. * When Kannada film actor Dr. Rajkumar (actor) was abducted by the notorious dacoit Veerappan, there arose a tense situation in the adjoining states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The situation was such that at any time racial riots could break out resulting in arson and killings of thousands and thousands of innocent people. As such, on the requisition by the Chief Ministers of both states, a team of emissaries led by Nedumaran, went into the forests, met Veerappan and rescued Dr. Rajkumar. * Nedumaran toured all over the State of Tamil Nadu, exposed the atrocities committed by the Special Task Forces of the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, in the name of capturing Veerappan. He gained the support of the people all over Tamil Nadu to fight legally against the atrocities of the Special Task Forces and to help the people thus affected. For this purpose he formed the 'Federation for People's Rights', in which various political organisations and human rights groups are members. * 121 innocent villagers were arrested under the draconian Terrorists and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), accused as Veerappan's helpers and were put in Mysore Prison for more than 8 years without any trial. Nedumaran brought the plight of these innocent people to the notice of the Karanataka State Government, and insisted on carrying out the legal proceedings quickly. He also engaged able advocates to appear for the accused in the case. Thus, through his efforts, the Special Court immediately heard the cases pending against these people and they were acquitted and released. * 2007, he organised a campaign to collect food and medicines for the people starving in Jaffna, due to the economic blockade of the Sri Lankan Government. Aids worth Rs. 10 million were collected. He sought the help of the Indian Red Cross Society to send the aid to Jaffna. Indian Red Cross Society readily agreed and in turn sought the permission of the Indian Government to carry the aids. But the Indian Government did not respond for more than 10 months. Nedumaran demonstrated several agitations seeking the Indian Government to grant permission. As all were in vain, he announced that he and his comrades would carry the aids to Jaffna by boats from Rameshwaram and Nagapattinam, the coastal towns of Tamil Nadu. The Tamil Nadu Police stopped him from doing so. Hence he undertook a fast-unto-death until a solution was attained for this issue. The fast lasted for 4 days and after the assurance from the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu through Dr. Ramadoss, Convener, PMK, he completed the fast. === Tamil Eelam === * 1982, when the Jaffna Public Library was burnt in Sri Lanka, Nedumaran personally visited the place. During that visit to Sri Lanka, he also visited Ratnapura, where several estate laborers of Indian origin were living. Further, he met various Tamil leaders, representatives of various political and social organisations and obtained an idea of the truth behind the explosive situation that prevailed in Sri Lanka; and presented an exhaustive report in the All Party Leaders meeting convened by the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Consequently, on the suggestion of Nedumaran an all party delegation headed by the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, went to New Delhi, met the then Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi, and gave a report on the happenings in Sri Lanka. * In July 1983, when an ethnic riots happening in Sri Lanka, Nedumaran gathered more than 5000 volunteers in Tamil Nadu, conducted a Sacrifice March, and brought the conflict to the attention of India and other countries of the World. * 1985, Nedumaran made a secret tour in the Tamil areas of Sri Lanka, and video graphed the atrocities committed by the Sri Lanka army there; and documented the consequences of the atrocities. He then toured the world with this evidence, and brought global attention to the issue. * 1987, when Thileepan undertook fast-unto-death, he once again visited Sri Lanka and reported home the actual situation prevailing there. * 1987, he helped to smuggle arms and explosives from Tamil Nadu to Jaffa and helped LTTE to fight against Sri Lanka army and IPKF (Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka) * 1991, Nedumaran once again toured in the Tamil areas of Sri Lanka, and gathered evidence on the atrocities committed by the Indian Peace Keeping Force there, and presented the same personally to the then Prime Minister of India, V. P. Singh, and demanded the withdrawal of the Indian Peace Keeping Force from Sri Lanka. * 1993, the Indian Navy in the international waters blocked the ship in which LTTE commando Kittu (Sathasivam Krishnakumar) was travelling. As such the ship was drowned and many of the LTTE comrades including Kittu sacrificed their lives. The crew of the ship of 9 people was arrested by the Indian Navy and was brought to India. Nedumaran took up the case of the 9 sailors to the Supreme Court of India and helped them to get acquitted. === Arrests === * For the cause of helping the affected Eelam Tamils, Nedumaran was arrested under the Terrorists and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), and put in prison, in the year 1993. He was however acquitted by the Special Court as the allegations against him were proved false. * In the year 2002, he was arrested in the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA), for having spoken in support of LTTE, and was held in prison for 18 months. Even after release in bail, he was prohibited from giving public speeches or interviews for another 18 months. ==BooksPolitical books=== * Where is Nethaji?

It existed during four distinct time periods: from 1026 to 1057, 1073 to 1090, 1145 to 1153, and 1229 to 1239, when the polity was finally conquered by the Emirate of Granada. ==HistoryFirst taifa=== The taifa was created in 1026 when Yahya I al-Mu'tali, an Arab berberised of the Hammudid dynasty who had been invited to assume the title of caliph of Córdoba, returned to his secure stronghold of Málaga and subsequently was banished definitively by the Córdobans. After his expulsion, he united under his rule the coras of Málaga and Algeciras, initially with the support of the Zirids of Granada, and thereupon declared the independent Taifa of Málaga. He regained the title of caliph, which thenceforth was exclusive to the Málagan rulers. His rule, which lasted until his death in 1035, was characterized by struggle with the Abbadid dynasty kings of the Taifa of Seville. Yahya conquered the Taifa of Carmona, of strategic importance in the area; it was, however, soon recaptured by the Sevillans. At his death in 1035, the kingdom was divided into two independent entities: the taifa of Málaga proper, under his brother Idris I al-Muta'ayyad, and the Taifa of Algeciras, under his nephew Muhammad ben al-Qasim. Struggle against Seville continued, reaching its climax in the Malagan victory in the 1039 Battle of Écija, thanks also to the support of the taifas of Almería, Granada and Carmona. Idris I was succeeded in Málaga by Yahya II al-Qa'im, who lasted only one year, being ousted in 1040 by his uncle Hasan al-Mustansir, in turn overthrown in 1042 by the Saqaliba Naya al-Siqlabi. In the same year Naya was assassinated, and the Hammudids regained the throne with Idris II al-Ali, brother of Hassan, who reigned until being deposed in 1047 by his cousin Muhammad I al-Mahdi. In 1053 or 1053 the latter was replaced by his cousin Idris III al Sami, who was also assassinated after just one year, after which Idris II held the throne until his death in 1054 or 1055. His son and successor, Muhammad II al-Musta'li, was deposed by his brother, Yahya III al-Mahdi, under which the taifa was conquered in 1057 by Badis ben Habus, Zirid ruler of Granada. After Badis' death in 1073 and the division of the Granadan taifa between his successors, Málaga went to Tamim ben Buluggin ben Badis while Abd Allah ben Buluggin gained the taifa of Granada. In 1090, the taifa was conquered by the Islamic Almoravid dynasty from Morocco. ===Second taifa=== During the so-called second taifa age, Málaga was self-ruled for eight years starting from 1145, under the Banu Hassun Abu'l-Hakam al-Husayn, who exploited a popular revolt against the Almoravids. His unpopular policies, however, as well as his alliance with the Christians, caused his fall by the hands of the Almohads and his suicide in 1153. ===Third taifa=== In 1229, in the course of the third taifa period, Málaga became shortly independent in 1229 under Ibn Zannun, from the Banu Zanum dynasty. His fall in 1238 marked the end of the taifa of Málaga, which was incorporated into the emirate of Granada. ==List of EmirsHammudid dynasty=== *Yahya I al-Mu'tali: 1026 or 1027–1035 *Idris I al-Muta'ayyad: 1035–1039 *Yahya II al- Qa'im: 1039–1040 *Hasan al-Mustansir: 1040–1042 *Naya the Usurper: 1042 *Idris II al-Ali: 1042–1047 d. 1054/5 *Muhammad I ben al-Qasim: 1047–1053 *Idris III al Sami: 1053 *Idris II (restored): 1053–1054/5 *Muhammad II al-Musta'li: 1054/5 *Yahya III al-Mahdi (in Melilla 1063–1064): 1054/5–1057/8 d. 1064 **To Taifa of Granada: 1057/8–1073 ===Zirid dynasty=== *Tamim: 1073–1090 **To Almoravids: 1090–1145 ===Hassunid dynasty=== *Abu'l-Hakam al-Husayn: 1145–1153 **To Almohads: 1153–1229 ===Zannunid dynasty=== *Ibn Zannun: 1229?–1239 **To Granada: 1239–1487 ==See also== * Solomon ibn Gabirol, 11th-century Andalusian poet and Jewish philosopher. * List of Sunni Muslim dynasties Category:1239 disestablishments in Europe Category:States and territories established in 1026 Category:History of Málaga Category:Hammudid dynasty Category:11th century in Al-Andalus Category:Arab dynasties ","title":"Taifa of Málaga"},{"id":"19267770","text":"Fatorda is a suburb of the city of Margao in Salcete, Goa.

To appeal to the New York audience of high-powered investors and research and development (R&D;) executives, the Australia Week Steering Committee added Innovation and Financial Services days to the program in 2007. ===Trade=== The Australia Week promotion has resulted in excess of $22.5 million in trade and investment across sectors as diverse as art, food, wine, fashion, tourism and business services. Fashion has become a key component in the program, allowing Australian designers to gain a foothold in the highly complex US market. Since the Australia Week Fashion Showroom was instituted in 2007, several designers have recorded significant export sales to high end fashion department/specialty stores. Food and Beverage: Australia Week has vastly improved access of Australian products to the U.S. market. During the first week of the supermarket promotion in New York, high demand forced Citarella stores to re-order several Australian products. The 2008 Bristol Farms promotion saw Australian product lines expand from 32 item in 2007 to 46 items. Citarella's second Australia Week promotion in 2008 featured 53 Australian product lines, an increase of 20 products from the previous year. The 2008 Winter Fancy Food Show attracted over 16,000 buyers from food, wine, gift & department stores, supermarkets & restaurants from around the world, with 32,000 visitors and attendees. With trade outcomes from 2008 still being collected, exhibitors predict even bigger results than 2007's 31 export deals, totaling more than $3.7 million. ===Innovation=== The Innovation Day has provided Australian companies visibility, new deals and partnerships with members of the American venture capital and R&D; industries. Tasmanian company Autech Software & Design, producers of colour visualisation software, won the inaugural Innovation Shootout in 2007;Advance (19 January 2007).\\"Australian Innovators stun the US Market at G'day USA in New York\\" http://www.advance.org/en/art/678/ \\", Discover.

On August 14, 2018, she resigned from the court effective August 13, 2018.https://wchstv.com/news/local/announcement-scheduled-tuesday-for-supreme- court ==Early life== Davis was born in Boone County, West Virginia. She received a bachelor's degree from West Virginia Wesleyan College in 1978, and master's and law degrees from West Virginia University in 1982. ==Career== From 1982 until 1996, Davis practiced law in West Virginia, concentrating on employee benefits and domestic relations. In 1996 she was elected to fill an unexpired term, and was re-elected to a full twelve-year term in 2000 and 2012; becoming the first woman re-elected to statewide office in West Virginia. Davis served one year terms as Chief Justice in 1998, 2002, 2006, 2007, 2010 and 2014. ==Impeachment and retirement== Following a series of controversies involving excessive spending, the West Virginia House Judiciary Committee voted to recommend impeachment for Davis and three other justices on August 7, 2018 \\"for maladministration, corruption, incompetency, neglect of duty, and certain high crimes and misdemeanors\\". After the articles of impeachment were approved by the full House of Delegates, Justice Davis announced her retirement from the Court, effective August 13, 2018. The timing allowed her seat to be filled through a special election rather than enabling Governor Jim Justice to appoint her successor in the event the West Virginia Senate removed her from office.http://wvmetronews.com/2018/08/14/important- announcement-scheduled-at-supreme-court/ Despite her retirement, the West Virginia Senate refused to dismiss the articles of impeachment against Justice Davis due to questions about her standing as a senior status judge as well as her eligibility to receive judicial retirement benefits.

It is located within the Naval Support Activity Panama City in Panama City Beach, Bay County, Florida. == Mission and vision == NEDU describes its mission as: \\"The Navy Experimental Diving Unit tests and evaluates diving, hyperbaric, and other life-support systems and procedures, and conducts research and development in biomedical and environmental physiology. NEDU provides technical recommendations based upon knowledge and experience, to Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command to support operational requirements of our armed forces.\\" The vision for NEDU is stated to be: \\"The Navy Experimental Diving Unit will be the most credible and respected research, development, and test and evaluation center for diving as well as the focal point of leadership for biomedical and bioengineering solutions for undersea military operations.\\" ==HistoryBrooklyn Navy Yard=== Experimental diving in the US Navy started in 1912 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard under the leadership of Chief Gunner George D. Stillson. Stillson's research program ultimately led to increasing diver capabilities from to over of depth based on Haldane's decompression work with the Royal Navy. This resulted in the first publication of the United States Navy Diving Manual and established the need for a facility dedicated to research and development of diving procedures. In 1915, Stillson's team was sent to salvage the F-4 submarine. On these deep dives, the divers experienced the debilitating effects of nitrogen narcosis leading them to try the addition of helium to their breathing mix. The navy salvage operations then came under the direction of Warrant Gunner C. L. Tibbals who led teams through the salvage of the S-51 in 1925 and S-4 in 1927 further establishing the naval need for equipment, training, and procedures for rescue operations. ===Washington Navy Yard=== NEDU was established in 1927 at the Washington Navy Yard. A Momsen lung in use during training Early developments for the unit involved evaluation and testing of the Submarine Escape Lung (Momsen lung) and the McCann Rescue Bell. This work was done by Charles Momsen and Allan McCann. In 1929, Momsen received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for personally testing the device at a depth of 200 feet (61 m). Techniques used for the rescue of submariners aboard the USS Squalus were developed by Momsen and McCann in their time at NEDU. This work lead to the rescue and recovery of 33 crewmen. Momsen and McCann received a Letter of Commendation from President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt for the Squalus effort. The first medical staff were introduced to the facility in the mid-1930s when Charles W Shilling, Albert R Behnke, and OE Van der Aue began work. Their early work improved the prevention and treatment of decompression sickness with the inclusion of oxygen rather than air. Through World War II, work continued on decompression and oxygen toxicity. Through the 1950s NEDU tested equipment and further refined procedures for divers including the US Navy 1953 decompression table. From 1957 to 1962 was the beginnings of saturation diving under the leadership of Captain George F. Bond of the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory and the Genesis Project. Genesis D was performed at NEDU in 1963. Bond then went on to head the SEALAB I saturation project in 1964. Robert D. Workman published a novel method to calculate decompression schedules in 1965 that involved estimating the limiting values of excess tissue supersaturation. Work continued in deep saturation dives, equipment testing as well as thermal protection and physiology research throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. === Naval Support Activity Panama City === In 1975, NEDU relocated to its current location in Panama City, Florida. US Navy Diver using Kirby Morgan 37 diving helmet NEDU tested and evaluated the replacement of Stillson's Mark V as the US Navy standard diving dress, the Mark 12 Surface Supplied Diving System, and eventually its replacement the Mark 21/ Superlight 17 in the 1970s and 1980s. NEDU conducts at least one saturation dive per year. These dives were used, amongst other things, to evaluate decompression and recompression procedures, equipment, carbon dioxide absorbents, as well as active and passive thermal protection. Many of these tests included ongoing evaluations of commercially available diving equipment. In 1998, the Naval Medical Research Center's diving biomedical and development group was transferred to NEDU. In response to the overseas military needs, NEDU focused on warm water diving from 1999 to 2002. This guidance to the Naval Special Warfare community influences operational needs on an ongoing basis. NEDU divers were essential to the recovery of artifacts from the wreck of the USS Monitor in 2001 and 2002. In 2002, certification of the Mark 16 Mod 1 rebreather was completed following improvement of systems including, extension of the working limit to , new decompression tables for both nitrogen-oxygen and helium-oxygen diving including new repetitive diving capabilities for helium-oxygen, test of an Emergency Breathing System with communications, the addition of an integrated buoyancy compensation device, and an improved full face mask. SEALs using SEAL Delivery Vehicle In 2004, NEDU contributed to operational guidance for diving in harsh contaminated environments. NEDU has continued research into oxygen toxicity utilizing the US Navy Mark 16 Mod 1. Development of breathing systems, thermal protection, and decompression procedures for SEAL Delivery Vehicles and the Advanced SEAL Delivery System is ongoing. In 2011, divers completed a 1,000 fsw saturation dive to evaluate the new Navy's Saturation Fly-Away Diving System (SAT FADS). The SAT FADS was designed in 2006 as a portable replacement of two decommissioned Pigeon-class submarine rescue vessels. Evaluation and testing of new breathing apparatus and application of other technologies for diving is key to their mission. ==FacilitiesOcean simulation facility=== NEDU Ocean Simulation Facility The Ocean Simulation Facility (OSF) simulates ocean conditions to a maximum pressure equivalent of seawater at any salinity level. The chamber complex consists of a wet chamber and five interconnected dry living/working chambers totaling of space. Wet and dry chamber temperatures can be set from . Equipped with the latest data acquisition capability, the OSF can accommodate a wide range of complex experiments including diver biomedical studies and testing of humans as well as small submersible vehicles and other machines in the wet chamber. Saturation dives can be performed for more than 30 days of continuous exposure in the OSF. For human and equipment testing underwater over extended periods, divers use the dry chambers as comfortable living quarters, from which they can make diving excursions into the wet chamber. The dry chambers are also capable of altitude simulation studies to heights of . ===Experimental test pool=== NEDU experimental test pool The Experimental Test Pool is a capacity freshwater tank measuring by by deep, capable of sustaining temperatures from . It is designed and constructed for manned, shallow water testing and for supporting workup dives for the Ocean Simulation Facility. The test pool is supported by a fully instrumented medical and engineering deck, from which the safety of both divers and test equipment can be monitored. The facility can accommodate a wide range of experiments, from biomedical studies of diver thermal and workload conditions to equipment studies of submersible devices. The test pool has a communications suite, full video capability, real-time computerized data acquisition and analysis, and pressure and gas monitoring. The depth is sufficient to allow divers to maintain an oxygen partial pressure of 1.3 bar on their breathing apparatus while immersed and riding a bicycle ergometer. ===Environmental chamber=== NEDU environmental chamber The Environmental Chamber is capable of simulating a broad range of temperatures from , humidity from 5 to 95%, and wind velocity from . The chamber is instrumented to conduct physiological studies and to test various types of equipment. ===Experimental diving facility=== NEDU experimental diving facility The Experimental Diving Facility (EDF) simulates unmanned pressure conditions to sea water and temperatures can be set from . As a complement to the Ocean Simulation Facility, the EDF is used to conduct unmanned testing and evaluation of diving and hyperbaric chamber systems and components. All diving practices and procedures are tested to determine their safety, conformance to established standards, and operational suitability and limits. ===Class 100,000 clean room=== NEDU Class 100,000 clean room Operated by certified technicians, the Class 100,000 Clean Room performs a variety of cleaning and testing tasks: oxygen cleaning of piping, valves, regulators, tanks, and filters, as well as hydrostatic testing up to . All components used in diving life-support systems are cleaned and certified to meet military standards. ===Gas analysis lab=== NEDU gas analysis lab The gas analysis laboratory is equipped for the precise analysis of gases, and it is used to evaluate diving- related problems such as offgassing and contaminant control. The laboratory's analytical capabilities include gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and infrared spectroscopy. The facility is currently used to develop reliable and rapid screening methods and analyzers for the Fleet. ===Cardiopulmonary lab=== The cardiopulmonary laboratory consists of machines that perform a myriad of respiratory function tests and aerobic performance measurements that are often recorded before and after pressure and/or thermal exposure. ===Library=== The NEDU Library contains over 120,000 documents on diving medicine, engineering, and history from around the world. Many of the NEDU publications have been scanned and are available online at the Rubicon Research Repository. Other articles can be found in the Duke University Medical Center Archive finding aids of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society library collection. == Personnel == The 120 person NEDU Team includes highly qualified and experienced military divers with a combined 1,000 man-years of diving experience: Sea-Air-Land (SEAL), Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), Salvage, Saturation, Seabee, Diving Officer, and Diving Medical Officer (DMO), Ph.D. scientists, engineers, various science-degreed professionals and support personnel.

Pilot Captain Fox (Guy Rolfe) and co-pilot Bill Haverton (James Donald) set the aircraft down on a glacier with a minimum of damage, but know that they will not be able to radio for help with run-down batteries and a storm setting in. Taking stock of their situation, Haverton knows he can rely on stewardess Mary Johnstone (Phyllis Calvert), who is in love with him, but some of the passengers present problems. Film star Joanna Dane (Margot Grahame), opera tenor Perami (Francis L. Sullivan) and iron lung patient John Barber (Grey Blake) are all, in different ways, difficult and demanding passengers. The wrecked aircraft provides them with shelter, as the 13 passengers and crew wait for rescue. Rescue missions have already been mounted but, when a rescue aircraft misjudges its approach, it crashes and the crew are killed. With limited food supplies, the survivors realise that a rescue in the desolate location is unlikely. The survivors have to decide whether to stay and wait for help or leave the shelter of the wrecked airliner and set out in bad weather to try to reach safety. Some people make sacrifices to allow others to live. ==Cast== * Phyllis Calvert as Mary Johnstone * James Donald as Bill Haverton * Margot Grahame as Joanna Dane * Francis L.

He commissioned Robert Westerby, who had a reputation for writing contemporary thrillers, to do a script. Michael Balcon was also developing a film based on the same story, and registered an idea with the British Producers Association, but once he heard Box was doing a film as well he withdrew his project. Westerby did a treatment in six days, then proceeded to a full draft. He wrote a role specifically for Phyllis Calvert, then one of the studio's biggest stars. Calvert was reluctant to make the film but Box managed to persuade her. It would be the last film Calvert made under her contract with Gainsborough.\\"Unnecessary agony in plane crash film.\\" The Mail, Volume 36, Issue 1,873, 24 April 1948, p. 3. via National Library of Australia.

This was attributed in part to the fact that the film came out 18 months after the accident which inspired it and was no longer topical. ===Critical=== Broken Journey was critically received as a disaster film. Reviewer A.W. Weiler of The New York Times observed that the film was effective; \\"... (an) intelligent script and a uniformly excellent cast serve to make the import a diverting entertainment. And, the rugged, spectacular mountain backgrounds are an added note of authenticity to the yarn which accents character study rather than melodramatics.\\" The reviewer, however, had a caution that \\"..'Broken Journey', which might have been a top-flight, thoroughly exciting excursion, is simply a meticulously-planned trip in which the travelers are more interesting than the itinerary.\\"Weiler, A.W. \\"Rewview: 'Broken Journey' (1948); At the Trans-Lux.\\" The New York Times, 26 May 1949.

The video features So You Think You Can Dance Canada second season winner Tara- Jean Popowich and Vincent Desjardins. The video premiered on ET Canada on 17 June 2010. In April 2010, Theo Tams sought out a new management and business team to handle his career, a move that has already demonstrated a renewed energy and strategic direction for Theo as he moves to the next level and his all important 'sophomore' album that will create a clear distinction between the 'Idol' and the long-term 'career-artist'. Tams headlined a 15 date cross- Canada tour with special guests StereoGoesStellar, which started 7 August 2010 and met with much critical acclaim as he toured smaller more intimate venues playing in an up close and personal presentation of his songs solo on piano. ===Second studio album (2011–present)=== Tams explains that his second album, which will be released in 2011 will be a real \\"artist\\" album in so far as it will showcase just exactly who he is and what he stands for as a singer- songwriter. It will dig deeper emotionally than his debut album and represent almost a \\"song diary\\" that comes from a mixture of his life experiences since \\"Give It All Away\\" and from other parts of his life before his Idol experience. One of his new songs focuses on his experience in Afghanistan. Theo has already begun the intense writing process with one of his heroes, who will also be producing the record. It is expected that the project will be formally announced towards the end of January 2011 and the production team named. On 28 September, his 3rd EP \\"Call The Doctor\\" was released under Hidden Pony records. What many critics are calling the \\"record of his career\\", Tams clearly has developed his sound and yells intimate stories of the ups and downs of relationships, coming out to his Christian family, and finally being able to let go of a painful previous relationship. ==Personal life== Tams came out as gay during the show's run by referring to a male partner during one of his post-performance interviews. This made him the first openly gay performer to win an Idol series in North America. He subsequently endorsed Adam Lambert in the 2009 edition of American Idol, and included two gay couples, one male and one female, in the video for his single \\"Lazy Lovers\\" Theo is also a fan of Ellen DeGeneres, and wants to be on her show. He also admires Mother Teresa and her work. On 28 June 2010, Tams took a trip to Afghanistan to perform for the Canadian troops on Canada Day. This was an opportunity for him to visit Canadian and allied troops not only on the base in Kandahar but he travelled by Blackhawk outside of the wire to meet with and hear the stories of the front-line troops. On 14 July, he told Canada AM that it was \\"the most surreal experiences I've ever had.\\" ==DiscographyAlbums=== *Give It All Away (2009) *Back Pocket (2014) *Call The Doctor (2018) ===Singles=== * \\"Sing\\" (2008) * \\"Christmas Dream\\" (2008) * \\"Lazy Lovers\\" (2009) * \\"Wait for You\\" (2009) * \\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\\" duet w/ Ali Slaight (2009) * \\"Manhattan Blue\\" (2010) * \\"2000 Miles\\" duet w/ Ali Slaight (2012) * \\"When You're Not Around\\" (2014) * \\"Stay\\" (2014) * \\"Back Pocket\\" (2015) * \\"Strangers\\" (2018) * \\"Silent Night\\" duet w/ Ali Slaight ==Awards and nominations== {  - !

Drumming out is the historical act of being dishonorably dismissed from military service to the sound of the Rogue's March or a drum. In modern figurative usage, it may refer to any act of expulsion or dismissal in disgrace. ==Origin== One of the earliest recorded references to drumming out occurs in Alexander Pope's Moral Essays, 3rd epistle, 1731–1733: \\"Chartres was a man infamous for all manner of vices. When he was an ensign in the army, he was drummed out of the regiment for a cheat; he was next banished Brussels, and drummed out of Ghent, on the same account.\\" It also occurs in a figurative sense in Thomas Amory's 1766 Life of John Buncle: \\"They ought to be drummed out of society.\\" ==American Revolutionary War== The earliest known discharge of an American soldier involved the drumming out of Lieutenant Frederick Gotthold Enslin for attempted sodomy in March 1778 during the Revolutionary War. The diary of Lieutenant James McMichael contains a record of the sentence being carried out: The sentencing order, approved by George Washington, called for Enslin to be permanently drummed out of the Continental Army. ==American Civil War== American Civil War officers drummed out of service might have their heads shaved and their uniforms stripped of insignia and be paraded in front of their comrades. Fellow officers were forbidden to touch the person being dishonorably discharged, but in more than one case after the war had ended, a drummed-out man was found dead after receiving a beating from his former comrades. When someone was being drummed out, the tune \\"Rogue's March\\" would be played. ==Fiction== The opening to the 1965 NBC series Branded used the ceremony in its opening credits.

The pilot and the tail gunner sat in tandem cockpits, the pilot's open, and the gunner's partially enclosed. To maximize the gunner's arc of fire, the rear cockpit was set lower in the fuselage than the pilot's. The DI-6 was developed at TsKB as a fighter that would also be capable of ground attack when fitted with different armament. Originally intended to use a liquid-cooled V-12 engine, problems with its development led to the choice of the Wright R-1820 radial engine instead. The first flight took place on 30 September 1934, and testing began in earnest in early 1935, with State Acceptance Trials following between May and November. Despite a number of weaknesses discovered during testing, the type was ordered into production, and deliveries to the Soviet Air Force commenced in the spring of 1937. Problems including excessive vibration, and a poor field of fire for the gunner, were never adequately resolved, and the various fixes implemented to cure these and other problems eventually added around 160 kg (350 lb) to the aircraft's weight. Production continued until 1939. ==Operational history== Pre-Glastnost Western sources often reported these aircraft as having participated in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol against Japan in 1939, and even in the Winter War against Finland in 1939–1940, but more recent scholarship has failed to uncover any evidence that it was deployed in either case.Mellinger ==Surviving examples== A replica DI-6 is displayed in Victory Park, at the Museum of the Great Patriotic War in Moscow. ==Variants== ;DI-6bis :Trainer with fixed landing gear. ;DI-6Sh (TsKB-11Sh, TsKB-38) :Ground attack variant with armored pilot's seat and four forward-firing PV-1 machine guns under the bottom wing; 60 built. ;DI-6MMSh :One prototype with M-300 X engine, did not enter production. ==Operators== ; *Soviet Air Force ==Specifications (DI-6)References== * * Russian Aviation Museum * Уголок неба * Category:1930s Soviet fighter aircraft Category:Kochyerigin aircraft Category:Sesquiplanes ","title":"Kochyerigin DI-6"},{"id":"19268259","text":"Colvá is a coastal village in Salcete, south Goa, on the west coast of India. Colva Beach stretches for around 2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi), part of a beach consisting of about 25 kilometres (16 mi) of powder white sand, lined along its shore by coconut palms and extending from Bogmalo in the north to Cabo de Rama in the south. Colvá is a famous tourist destination, visited for its beaches, budget hotels, guest houses, beach shacks, food stalls, restaurants, pubs and bars. The beaches are constantly monitored by lifeguards, and the swimming areas are flagged for warnings. The village had significant importance to Portugal and was the retreat for Goa's high society, who would come to Colvá for their \\"Mundanca\\" or change of air. Today the Portuguese area is dotted with houses or villas, including many ruins. On weekends, huge crowds of tourists, visitors from around the world as well as local Indians, enjoy the sunset and various activities. The beach is particularly busy in October, when hordes of religious pilgrims come and visit Colvá Church, called Igreja de Nossa Senhora das Merces, that was founded in 1630 by the Roiz family and rebuilt in the eighteenth century on the village square. The local people have been fishermen since the mid-16th century. They include Hindu converts as well as migrants from various Portuguese overseas territories such as Angola, Mozambique, Brazil, etc. as well as Portugal itself. ==History== Colvá was a vast barren uninhabited land with a scenic Arabian Sea beach that had beach plants such as scaevola sericea until a few Harim (Fisherfolk community) settled there as migrants, primarily in the neighbouring village of Benaulim. The mughals, the people of Adil Shahi dynasty preferred the north and hilly regions of Goa, where they built forts and defences, rather than the coastal belt, and hence had not settled the barren land of Colvá. It was the Portuguese conquest which established the western regions of South Goa as a full-fledged human settlement. Colvá was under Portuguese administration, as the Province of Portuguese-Goa, from 1510 until 1961 (and was still under dispute and represented in the Parliament of Portugal till 1974/75). It was the village of the Portuguese Roiz family, the descendants of D. Diogo Rodrigues, and its villagers. The village had belonged since 1550 to D. Diogo Rodrigues, who was the Lord of Colvá (Landlord of Colvá). He built the first Portuguese architecture residential house in 1551 facing away from the sea and at a distance from the shore to avoid any enemy attacks from the Arabian Sea. The entire beach called Praia da Colvá belonged to him. In the 18th century, one of Diogo's descendants, Sebastião José Roiz, ordered the village people to plant coconut trees along the entire coastline, which the villagers thought was a waste of time as the soil was white and thus infertile and unable to sustain their growth. However today the shore line is fringed by those plantations of coconut trees. The entire Colvá shore and beach property as far as Betalbatim was inherited by various descendants of the Roiz family until the late 20th century, after which parts were handed over to the Government of Goa under the post-1974 Indian administration following the 1961 annexation of Goa by India. The rest of the land was sold. Igreja de Nossa Senhora das Merces Colvá is still famous for the white-washed Our Lady Of Mercy church, also known as Igreja de Nossa Senhora das Merces, that was founded in 1630 and rebuilt in the eighteenth century in the village square. It houses the miraculous statue of 'Menino Jesus' (Baby Jesus), which was introduced by a Jesuit missionary and which is believed to have healing powers. According to local legend, the statue at Our Lady of Mercy church was found in the mid- seventeenth century along the coast of Mozambique after Rev Fr. Bento Ferreira and his party had been shipwrecked off the coast. After swimming to safety, they spotted it as it was washed ashore after being dumped into the sea by Muslim pirates. In 1648 when Father Ferreira was posted to Colvá, he placed the statue on the altar, and it soon started drawing large crowds of devotees as it granted their favours. The Menino Jesus statue is kept for public viewing in October for the annual Fama ('Fame') festival for which thousands of people assemble. This is the only time that it is removed from the triple- vault locks of the Church. It is then dipped into a nearby river after a procession, and the pilgrims use this water for anointment and good luck. ==Demographics and GeographyLocation=== Colvá has an average elevation of . Its main village market is located behind the church, which is about away from the beach; there are various other shops at the cross road near the beach. Colvá recognises three beaches; firstly the main Colvá beach which is the prime beach, secondly Sunset beach (towards Betalbatim) which is less congested, and thirdly Baywatch beach (towards Benaulim at Sernabatim). Colvá is from Margao and from Panajim. The closest railway station is in Margao followed by Vasco da Gama, Goa. The airport is Dabolim Airport (GOI) at Vasco da Gama, Goa. The neighbouring villages are Betalbatim and Benaulim and the nearest city Margao. Distances around Goa (from Colva): Margao - , Vasco - , Mapusa - , Calangute - , Ponda - , Dabolim Airport - , Panjim - , Tiracol - . ===Climate=== Colvá features a tropical monsoon climate under the Köppen climate classification.

Colva is now a famous tourist destination, enjoyed for its beach. The tourist industry is well developed with many budget hotels, guest houses, beach shacks, food stalls, small restaurants and pubs and bars, although these developments have not extended in any large degree to the nightlife. The beaches are constantly monitored by lifeguards and the swimming areas flagged with coloured flags accordingly. Being one of the famous beaches of Goa, this beach is highly crowded most of the time of the year. With a majority of its visitors being domestic Indian visitors this beach is mostly neglected by foreigners.http://www.goaholidayguide.com/beaches/colva-beach-goa.php ==Travel== The nearest airport is Dabolim Airport which is about 21 km away. The nearest railway station is Madgoan junction railway station in just 20 minutes drive. Colva beach can be reached from Margao by bus.

The traditional feast called 'Fama' is celebrated on the 2nd Monday of October every year, and pilgrims from around the world take part. ===Food and beverages=== Colvakars, or people from Colvá, love fish and seafood. The cuisine is influenced by Hindu Gaud Saraswat Brahmin origins and four hundred years of Portuguese governance and recently a blend of modern techniques. The locals enjoy rice with fish curry (xitt kodi in Konkani), which is the staple diet in Goa. Colvá cuisine is famous for its rich variety of fish dishes cooked with elaborate recipes. Coconut and coconut oil are widely used in cooking along with chili peppers, spices and vinegar, giving the food a unique flavour. Various seafood delicacies include kingfish (visvonn, the most common delicacy), pomfret, shark, tuna and mackerel. Among the shellfish are crabs, prawns, tiger prawns, lobster, squid and mussels. Colvá food has pork dishes such as vindaloo, chouriço and sorpotel. Beef dishes and chicken xacuti are cooked for major occasions amongst the Catholics. Sannas are relished. A rich egg-based, multi-layered sweet dish known as bebinca is a favourite at Christmas. Rissóis de camarão, beef croquettes, fried mussels and semolina prawns are favourite starters. The most popular alcoholic beverage in Goa and enjoyed in Colvá is feni. Cashew feni is made from the fermentation of the fruit of the cashew tree, while coconut feni is made from the sap of toddy palms. The people also drink wine, especially on feast days. == References  External links == * \\"GoaCentral.Com - Colva Beach\\" * \\"Colva Fama\\" at GoaTourism.gov.in * Colva Photographs, 2012 Category:Villages in South Goa district Category:Comunidades of Goa Category:Beaches of South Goa district Category:Beaches of Goa ","title":"Colva"},{"id":"19268305","text":"The 1977 Chatham Cup was the 50th annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.

It is located six kilometres east from the district headquarters of Margao and 35 kilometres from the State capital Panaji. ==Location== Gogol (two kilometres), Margao (three kilometres), and Aquem Margao (three kilometres) are the nearby areas to Raia. Raia is surrounded by Mormugao taluk towards the west, Queue taluka towards its south, Ponda taluka towards the north. Raia village lies close to the villages of Loutulim, Ambora, Rachol and Maina. It lies at the border of the North Goa District and the South Goa District. Ponda is North Goa District is just across Raia. Since it lies near the Arabian Sea, the weather can be humid for part of the year. Raia village falls under the Goa Assembly constituency of Curtorim for electoral purposes. Raia's PIN code is 403720 and its postal office is Raia itself. == Population == For the purposes of the Census, Raia is considered to be a \\"census town\\" (though it is a panchayat area) and in 2011 had a population of 10,706 -- comprising 5,256 males and 5,450 females as per report released by Census India 2011. Male literacy was 90.15% and female, 84.72%. There were 1037 women for every 1000 males, indicating perhaps the high out-migration from the area, mainly for temporary employment overseas and elsewhere. Raia had 1106 chidren under six years of age in 2011, of whom 585 were male and 521 female. The Christian population of Raia in 2011 was 7,574 (70.75%) and there were 2,399 (22.4%) Hindus and 705 (6.59%) Muslims. The Scheduled Tribe population was 2,968 and thre were 66 Scheduled Caste members, according to the censusndia.co.in site. Raia has a significant agrarian population, whose lives are sometimes affected by the vagaries of the monsoons. ==History== Pe. Jorge Paulino da Piedade Sequeira, a priest from the area, wrote a book titled Raia e Camorlim. Para a História das Aldeias, (Raia and Camorlim: About the History of the Villages), published by the Xaverian Press at Pilar in 1972. Camorlim is a village between Raia and Loutolim According to former Indian Union minister Eduardo Faleiro, Raia \\"derives its name from Agni Mukha Roy, one of the earlier Kadamba kings who established his headquarters in this village.\\" Faleiro cites Fr. Jorge Sequeira to suggest that, in the past, the village was known variously as Rayanagara, Rajapur and Rayapur, and with the decline of the Kadamba dynasty it became known simply as Raya and then Raia. The earlier ruling empire of the Kadambas are believed to have brought the deity of Kamakshi to the village, the temple of which was destroyed during Portuguese rule, with the deity being shifted across the river to Rai Shiroda, a locality on the other bank of the river beyond the then Portuguese territory. Raia was the first village in Salcette to have been Christianised, when its populace was converted en masse to Christianity in 1560.Sarasvati's Children: A History of the Mangalorean Christians, Alan Machado Prabhu, I.J.A. Publications, 1999, p. 101 Raia (with Margao, Verna, Curtorim, Loutolim, Benaulim, Betalbatim, Colva, Cortalim, Quelossim, Nagoa and Sancoale-Dabolim) was among 12 villages of Salcete represented at the Camara Geral do Concelho, or the general assembly of Communidades at the sub- district or taluka level. The Camaras Gerais ou Agrarias were extinguished by the Code of Communidades of 1904 and substituted by Administrators of Communidades. The Comunidades were cooperative associations governed by heads of family, called gaunkars. Originally based on collective ownership of land by a group of villagers, this system saw a certain portion of the total agrarian produce earmarked for village welfare, a part as the government share, and the balance distributed among the members as dividend or jono (zonn). Over time, Comunidades lost their original character and turned into mere societies of gaunkars who had membership based on accident of birth.Non- gaunkars who came subsequently and also contributed to the development of the village had no say in the Comunidades, with many gaunkars living outside the area from which they are entitled to jono. Women family members also have no right to membership. Comunidades ceased to be collective farming societies, and village development activities which were the preserve of the gaunkaris (a pre-Portuguese name for the Comunidades) and now entrusted to the gram panchayat. Raikars (villagers of Raia) are known as wag (tigers). == Church == Church of Our lady of Snows RaiaAfter conversions to Christianity, locals helped build a church dedicated to Nossa Senhora das Neves or Our Lady of the Snows in 1699. ==Harvest festival== Raia hosts a harvest feast, locally called the Konsache Fest in Konkani, which is celebrated on 5 August every year. The feast Mass is celebrated at Our Lady of Snows Church, Raia . ==Raikars, Konkani song and other features== Raikars of the skilled Daivadnya Brahmin (sonar) community were originally from Raia, Goa, and hence some members of the community carry the village's name as part of their surname — Raikar. Raia, together with the nearby villages of Curtorim and Loutolim, was home to, and the nursery of, many of the Mando (plural mandde) form of prominent Goan Konkani song. The village is known for some prominent food outlets, including the prominent local Nostalgia restaurant. Nostalgia has been called \\"a restaurant that has made its name by serving authentic Portuguese cuisine\\", In other parts of the village, small but noted bakeries also draw customers. Some of the local institutions have deployed solar power. == Spanish flu in 1918-19 == Spanish flu victims' memorial at Raia The village of Raia was one of the villages in the state of Goa which is believed to have suffered badly due to the Spanish flu pandemic around 1918-1919. Andrew Pereira argues that Raia was among the villages most badly hit in Goa due to the 1918-19 Spanish flu pandemic. A memorial pillar stands tall outside the present cemetery of Raia, constructed in memory of the Spanish flu victims a year later in 1919. The aftermath of the Spanish flu, as per reports, lasted for a year till 1919. The nearly nine feet tall tombstone bears the words – ‘E.M. (EM MEMORIA) DAS VICTIMAS DE GRIPE DE 1918 (In memory of the victims of flu in 1918). ==GalleryNotes External links == * Raia Category:Cities and towns in South Goa district ","title":"Raia, Goa"},{"id":"19268430","text":"The Call of the Wild is a 1908 American short adventure film directed by D.W.

CMT focused on technology projects like Water-jet scaling and mine planning, while VREX focused on mine safety, and integration, interpretation, and visualization through its Virtual Reality Laboratory (owned by Laurentian University). The combined group now focuses its efforts on creating and using software for the mining industry. Its first major software product was the Schedule Optimization Tool (SOT), which launched in June 2008. The SOT uses a Genetic Algorithm to produce optimal schedules for underground mining operations. EVO also has ongoing projects in Virtual Reality Safety, Mine Ventilation, and Long-term mine planning. In addition, EVO is building an open-source data visualization and integration product called ParaViewGeo, a derivative of ParaView. ==Open Source Software== MIRARCO is a supporter of open source software, and tries to promote use of open source software throughout the company. One of MIRARCO's projects, ParaViewGeo, is licensed under the BSD Licence. Many of the projects at MIRARCO are completed using open source programming languages, such as Python, Java, OpenGL, and Processing, and some of MIRARCO's lab computers feature the Fedora Linux Operating System instead of, or in addition to, Microsoft Windows. ===Software Freedom Day=== On September 20, 2008, MIRARCO participated in Software Freedom Day, an annual worldwide celebration of free/open-source software.

It is loosely based on the Shinto deity Susanoo. With this manga, Nagai won the Kodansha Manga Award in the Shōnen category. The original serialization of Kodansha was suspended in 1981, but the success of the novels written by Yasutaka Nagai, prompted Kadokawa Shoten to request Go to resume his work on Susano Oh. With this, the manga would be published for a period of ten years, from 1979 to 1989. Even so, the manga was left with an open ending for a possible next part. An RPG video game adaption titled Susano Oh Densetsu was released in Japan by Hudson on April 27, 1989 on the PC Engine. A board game based on the series called Dreadful Susano Oh King Go Nagai was released by a company called Epoch. ==Plot== Highschool freshman Shingo Susa follows his childhood friend and crush Sayuri Yukishiro to their school's ESP club, whose members attempt to research psychic powers. However, they later discover there are two real psychics in the school: Chigusa Mitsurugi, the beautiful president of the club, and Rei Uryu, a resident prodigy who opposes Chigusa and offers to enhance the psychic potential of anybody who follows him. Uryu tries to recruit Susa, whom he knows to have an immense power latent, in order to help him fight for justice, but Susa declines out of loyalty for Chigusa. Eventually Shingo and Sayuri become a couple, but a savage gang of delinquents attack them and rape her. The trauma blows up Shingo's bottled psychic potential and creates a violent, powerful alternate personality bent on getting revenge. Now as a changed person, and having lost track of Sayuri, Shingo fights through yakuza, thugs and his school's corrupt club alliance until discovering that the attack was ordered by a sinister organization named Nosferatu. The latter plans for world domination and has its own team of psychics, led by a mysterious woman named Carmilla, who has influence over the club federation. Shingo leads a school revolution against them, helped by Chigusa, boxing club leader Goda, kendo genius Tatsuya Mido and other students, and eventually overthrows their regime. It is then revealed that Carmilla is actually a disguised Uryu and that Sayuri worked for him all along. Uryu staged the entire plot in order to liberate Shingo's powers and use him, as an incarnation of the legendary Susanoo, to destroy human civilization, so he could rebuild the world with only psychic humans. However, his plan is too successful, as Shingo loses control of his powers: a part of his soul leaves his body, hijacks a coming star, and becomes a prophesied apocalyptic monster, the Yamata no Orochi. His influence causes demons from other dimensions to start sliding into the world, possessing humans and provoking disasters, while Shingo's body lies apparently dead. Chigusa reveals herself as the heir of an ancient clan of descendants of Atlantis, as well as the incarnation of ancient goddess Marici, and commands an Atlantean space force formed by clones of her in an attempt to destroy Yamata no Orochi. Shingo's family is also revealed to know the prophecy regarding him, and they join the Atlanteans in their fight. At the same time, Sayuri (who really fell in love with Shingo despite her duplicity) convinces Uryu to try to redeem Shingo by playing the roles of Ame no Uzume and Ame no Tajikarao, respectively. The story of the manga ends in midst of the climax. In an additional epilogue in the manga's 1996 revised re-edition, Chigusa manages to neutralize the Yamata no Orochi in a secret Atlantean outpost in the Face of Mars. In an Earth ravaged and in a postapocalyptic state, Uryu and Sayuri come out of their refuge and look for Shingo, while Goda has overcome the possession of a demon and is now hunting other monsters. Shingo then comes alive again under the form of Susanoo, apparently now in full control of his powers, and walks past Goda before stopping in front of Uryu and Sayuri. The outcome of their encounter is not revealed. ==External links== *Susano Oh at The World of Go Nagai webpage. *Susano Oh Densetsu (novel) at The World of Go Nagai webpage. *Susanoo at D/visual. *Susanoo at Gonagainet.

Following the sacking, the Oman Football Association appointed Hamad as the interim manager of the national team. In June 2008 after the sudden sacking of Julio César Ribas by the Oman Football Association, due to Oman's poor performance in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, Hamad was appointed as an interim manager of Oman national football team. He led Oman to an undefeated streak in the few months he managed the team. In July 2008, the Oman Football Association appointed Frenchman Claude Le Roy as the manager of the national team and as a result Hamad was appointed as the assistant manager. ===Oman Olympic team=== On 19 January 2011, he replaced the Frenchman Sébastien Migné as the manager of the Oman national under-23 football team. He was given the charge of leading the team in the Men's Asian Qualifiers of the 2012 Summer Olympics. He led the team to a 7-2 aggregate win over Tajikistan national under-23 football team in the Preliminary Round 1. In the Preliminary Round 2, Oman again put up a great performance against China national under-23 football team defeating them on an aggregate score of 4-1. In the Preliminary Round 3, Oman began their campaign with a 2-0 defeat to hosts South Korea. But then Oman bounced back and won back to back matches against Saudi Arabia and Qatar 2-0 and 3-0 (awarded) respectively. On 22 February 2012, Oman faced a 0-3 home loss against South Korea national under-23 football team and hence losing all the chances of finishing at the top of the group which would have earned them a direct spot at 2012 Summer Olympics for the first time. As a result of this loss, he was shown the door and the country’s London Olympics hopes were now in the hands of the national team coach Paul Le Guen who was appointed as the manager for the Playoff Round and also the AFC–CAF play-off. ===Back to Oman national team=== On 28 February 2007, the Oman Association Football sacked the Czech football manager Milan Máčala as he failed to win the nation its first ever Gulf Cup of Nations in Abu Dhabi after losing 1-0 in the finals against the hosts United Arab Emirates. Hamad was once again appointed as the interim manager of the national team. ===Back to Oman Olympic team=== On 25 May 2014, he signed a two-years contract with the Oman Football Association to manage the Oman national under-23 football team once again after a two year hiatus. His immediate task was to prepare the team for the 2014 Under 23 Gulf Cup of Nations to be hosted from August 30 – September 9 in Doha, Qatar. ==References *Hamad Al-Azani - GOAL.com *Hamad Al-Azani - GOALZZ.com *Hamad Al-Azani - KOOORA Category:Living people Category:1989 births Category:People from Al Ain Category:Omani footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Al-Nahda Club (Oman) players Category:Omani football managers Category:Oman Professional League managers Category:Al-Nahda Club (Oman) managers Category:Oman national football team managers ","title":"Hamad Al-Azani"},{"id":"19268691","text":"Mount Leonard Murray is a mountain in Papua New Guinea in central New Guinea.

Double Confession is missing from the BFI National Archive, and is included on the British Film Institute's list of \\"75 Most Wanted\\". A complete 35mm print does exist in an independent archive in the UK. In February 2013, a restored edition was released on DVD by Renown Pictures in the UK; however, this DVD is no longer available. ==Plot== Arriving late at night in the seaside town of Seagate, Jim Medway (Derek Farr) heads for his estranged wife’s isolated coastal cottage. As he arrives, he sees local businessman Charlie Durham (William Hartnell) coming out of the house, in which he then finds his wife dead. With the awareness that his wife had been having an affair with Durham, Medway embarks on attempts to blackmail the rich entrepreneur or get him arrested for murdering his wife. However, Durham's sinister homicidal sidekick Paynter (Peter Lorre) is out to protect his boss by arranging a little \\"accident\\" for Medway. As Inspector Tenby (Naunton Wayne) slowly gathers clues to solve the mystery, he begins to suspect there is a less obvious culprit. ==Cast== * Derek Farr as Jim Medway * Joan Hopkins as Ann Corday * William Hartnell as Charlie Durham * Peter Lorre as Paynter * Naunton Wayne as Inspector Tenby * Ronald Howard as Hilary Boscombe * Kathleen Harrison as Kate * Leslie Dwyer as Leonard * Edward Rigby as the Fisherman * George Woodbridge as Sergeant Swanton * Henry Edwards as Man in the Shelter * Mona Washbourne as Fussy Mother * Vida Hope as Madam Zilia * Esma Cannon as Madame Cleo * Andrew Leigh as the Reserved Man * Fred Griffiths as the Spiv * Jane Griffith as First Girl * Diana Connell as Second Girl * Hal Osmond as Gallery Attendant * Norman Astridge as Selby * Roy Plomley as Ticket Collector * Jennifer Cross as Fussy Mother's Child * Betty Nelson as Girl at Shooting Gallery * Sidney Vivian as Ring Stall Attendant * Grace Denbeigh-Russell as Nosey Woman ==Critical reception== In The New York Times, Bosley Crowther commented, \\"it rambles around in maddening fashion for what seems interminable hours while Naunton Wayne as a deadpanned detective tries to figure out who killed whom...It is all very odd and disconnected, especially when Peter Lorre pops in from time to time to behave like a degenerate and offer to kill anybody in the house\\";https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D04E1DF1231E53BBC4953DFB3668388649EDE while more recently Allmovie wrote, \\"The presence of Peter Lorre assured a modicum of American business for the British meller Double Confession...Lorre's role is largely peripheral, but he does supply a few moments of genuine menace\\"; while Sky Movies wrote, \\"Director Ken Annakin showed in an earlier film, Holiday Camp, that he liked to be beside the seaside.

It is loosely based on the Stavisky Affair, a French political scandal. A Russian con artist worms his way into the upper reaches of French society, but is finally exposed, with tragic consequences. ==Plot== In 1931 Paris, Nicole Picot (Kay Francis), a model for a fashionable dress shop, is hired by nearly-penniless Stefan Orloff (Claude Rains) to help persuade a financier to fund his ambitious plans. By 1934, Stefan has established an investment bank; in gratitude, he provides the capital that Nicole needs to set up her own business and become a successful dress designer (though she insists on paying him back). British diplomat Anthony Wayne (Ian Hunter) romances Nicole and wins her heart. However, when Stefan's crooked schemes start to unravel, he asks Nicole to marry him without divulging his main motive: the attendance of her influential friends at the well-publicized ceremony would bolster public confidence in him and buy him time. She agrees, out of friendship alone, much to the distress of her friend and assistant, Suzanne (Alison Skipworth). It is too late. At their wedding, Stefan's closest confederate, Francis Chalon (Walter Kingsford), is taken away by the police for questioning, and the other guests hastily depart. Knowing that Chalon can incriminate him, Stefan goes into hiding at a remote chateau. However, he makes a mistake, sending a letter to Nicole asking her to join him. She does so, despite Anthony's protests. Nicole gets Stefan to admit the truth, though he insists he does love her. When he sees that the police have followed Nicole and have surrounded the chateau, he excuses himself. To spare her from being dragged down with him, he goes outside. As he expected, he is shot and killed, though it is staged to look like a suicide to avoid causing further embarrassment to the government. Afterward, Anthony persists and finally gets Nicole to agree to marry him. ==Cast== * Kay Francis as Nicole Picot * Claude Rains as Stefan Orloff * Ian Hunter as Anthony Wayne * Alison Skipworth as Suzanne * Alexander D'Arcy as Leon Anatole * Betty Lawford as Helen Tuttle * Walter Kingsford as Francis Chalon * Charles Halton as LeGrande * Frank Reicher as Charles Ranier * Frank Conroy as Dupont * Egon Brecher as Bergery * Wedgwood Nowell as M.

The song was released as promotional single from her multi-platinum album Dónde Están los Ladrones? (1998), but received more attention when it created controversy while performed live in her 2002-2003 world tour Tour of the Mongoose. This song expresses Shakira's opinion about God. ==Background== In an interview with MTV News, Shakira stated that \\"Octavo Dia\\" \\"talks about God when he created the world, the eighth day he went for a walk to outer space and when he came back he found our world in an infernal mess. And he found that we were being controlled and manipulated by just a few leaders and that we were like pieces of a chess game\\". == Live performances == Shakira performed \\"Octavo Día\\" at a concert held on 12 August 1999 at Grand Ballroom, which later became MTV Unplugged. She also performed it during the 2000 Tour Anfibio. In the Tour of the Mongoose, behind the stage was a black and white backdrop video of George W. Bush and Saddam Hussein playing chess, and on the stage some of the musicians were wearing masks of Richard Nixon and Cuba's president Fidel Castro. During the video at the show, Hussein's and Bush's puppets suddenly became restless and violent as they started playing with nuclear bombs instead of chess pieces. Then the Grim Reaper appeared behind the two leaders and moved the strings that control the puppets. Shakira said during the concert that pop singers typically do not talk about politics nor about politicians, but this time, her tour had a political view. \\"I know pop stars are not supposed to stick their noses into politics\\", said Shakira during her concert in New York. \\"Sometimes people don't want to see pop stars giving their opinion about political situations. They think pop stars are made to entertain. Period. I don't see it that way. I know it was a little risky to use my show to deliver a message and many people around me told me not to do it, but, at the end of the day, it was a statement about love and what I feel this world and its leaders are lacking\\", she later told The Guardian. The symbolism of the video clip was that Bush and Hussein were treating the war as if a game, as if not treating it with much importance.

The lead-off single, \\"Don't You Know You're Beautiful\\", was debuted at the 43rd Academy Of Country Music awards and peaked at 21 on Hot Country Songs. The album was released via BNA Records/19 Recordings on September 30, 2008. Since the albums' release, three more singles have charted; \\"Best Days of Your Life\\" at number 9 (which was co-wrote with singer- songwriter Taylor Swift), \\"Didn't You Know How Much I Loved You\\" at number 14 (a re-recording of an album cut from Pickler's debut album Small Town Girl) and \\"Makin' Me Fall in Love Again\\" at number 30. ==Critical reception== Billboard contributor Ken Tucker gave praise to \\"Somebody to Love Me\\" and \\"One Last Time\\" for being \\"aching and sincere with production to match\\" and highlighted \\"Best Days of Your Life\\" as \\"one of the album's best cuts.\\" He later called Pickler's record \\"another solid step toward country stardom.\\" Chris Neal of Country Weekly also called it \\"a confident step forward that finds her developing as both vocalist and songwriter, especially with the clutch of alternately sad, angry and funny post-breakup songs that dominate the album.\\" Robert Christgau cited \\"Rocks Instead of Rice\\" as a \\"choice cut\\", indicating a good song on \\"an album that isn't worth your time or money.\\" AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine was critical of the record, saying it was devoid of the cornball charm and girl-next-door ennui that encapsulated Small Town Girl, and was replaced with overly produced country pop tracks that bring out Pickler's limitations as a vocalist. ==Track listing== All tracks are produced by Chris Lindsey. ==Personnel== * David Angell - violin * Tom Bukovac - electric guitar * John Catchings - cello * Lisa Cochran - background vocals * Perry Coleman - background vocals * J.T.

Prairie School architecture was uncommon for use in churches. This church, which has a flat roof and broad eaves but lacks a bell tower and other traditional church features, was inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright's Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois. It was designed by the firm of Purcell & Feick before George Grant Elmslie became a partner of the firm. The congregation was an offshoot of First Presbyterian Church and was named after the Reverend David Stewart. The main portion of the church is organized around a cube-shaped auditorium with light provided by a wall of eastward- facing green-tinted windows. It has a narrower section with a deep balcony that extends to the south. Decoration is relatively modest, consisting mainly of wood strips in geometric patterns. The exterior is faced in brick and stucco. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. In 1988, Redeemer Missionary Baptist Church bought the building and raised over $2 million for restoration and renovation. ==References *\\"The Architecture and Design of the Prairie School: Stewart Memorial Presbyterian Church\\" on Minneapolis Institute of Arts *\\"Stewart Memorial Presbyterian Church/Redeemer Missionary Baptist Church\\" on City of Minneapolis *\\"Redeemer Missionary Baptist Church: Minneapolis, Minnesota Case Study\\" by Maianne Preble on the Preservation Alliance of Minnesota Category:20th-century Presbyterian church buildings in the United States Category:Baptist churches in Minnesota Category:Churches completed in 1910 Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Churches in Minneapolis Category:National Register of Historic Places in Minneapolis Category:Prairie School architecture in Minnesota Category:Presbyterian churches in Minnesota Category:Purcell and Elmslie buildings ","title":"Stewart Memorial Presbyterian Church"},{"id":"19268988","text":"BridgeValley Community and Technical College (BVCTC) is a multi-campus community and technical college serving the Charleston, West Virginia metropolitan area. It was formed in 2014 by the merger of Bridgemont Community and Technical College of Montgomery, West Virginia and Kanawha Valley Community and Technical College of South Charleston, West Virginia. Its current president is Eunice Bellinger. == History  Montgomery Campus (former Bridgemont Community and Technical College) === The Montgomery campus serves the upper Kanawha Valley region of West Virginia. It was established in 1966 as the Community College at West Virginia Institute of Technology. In 1996, West Virginia Institute of Technology became a regional campus of West Virginia University and was renamed West Virginia University Institute of Technology. At this time, the community college became known as Community College at West Virginia University Institute of Technology. As a result of the 2008 reorganization of the higher education system of West Virginia, the state's community colleges were \\"divorced\\" from the general colleges and universities and had to adopt new names unrelated to their parent institutions. Community College at West Virginia University Institute of Technology became Bridgemont Community and Technical College as a nod to the many bridges and mountains in the area. === South Charleston Campus (former Kanawha Valley Community and Technical College) === The South Charleston campus, formerly Kanawha Valley Community and Technical College (KVCTC), was established in 1953 as a community college component of what was then West Virginia State College (now University). In 2003, it was accredited as West Virginia State Community and Technical College, but remained administratively linked to WVSU. In 2008, the legislature fully separated the Community and Technical College from its parent 4-year institution, however, both schools continued to share the same campus. Due to the extremely crowded conditions endured by both KVCTC and WVSU and for the schools to facilitate their missions, ongoing efforts were made to establish a separate campus. In the fall of 2012, KVCTC moved to its new campus in South Charleston at the former Dow research facility. In 2009, the school went through a name change to distinguish itself from West Virginia State University. The school's new name was officially announced on April 20, 2009 as Kanawha Valley Community and Technical College. KVCTC held its first commencement ceremony on May 16, 2009. Previously, Kanawha Valley held its commencement in a joint ceremony with West Virginia State. In May 2012, KVCTC received national recognition by earning the MAP-Works Overall Excellence Award for implementing a program aimed at student success. === Merger === In early 2013, a bill was in process to merge Bridgemont Community and Technical College with Kanawha Valley Community and Technical College. The schools combined their administrations, but maintain both campuses and all course offerings. According to former KVCTC President Joseph Badgley, \\"This is a model that should have been a place a long time ago, ... This is a good time to do it to since I’m retiring and it will make the transition much easier.\\" Then-Bridgemont President Beverly Jo Harris said \\"We have worked hand in hand [with KVCTC] over the past several years trying not to duplicate programs, ... Now under one administrative structure, we’ll have a very broad range of healthcare and technology programming.\\" Over the 2013-14 academic year, the schools operated independently. In the fall of 2014, the combined schools became officially known as BridgeValley Community and Technical College. Harris was named president of the new multi-campus college. == Degrees offered == The South Charleston campus grants more than 20 Associate in Applied Science Degrees, one Associate in Science Degree, one Associate in Arts Degree, 17 Certificate of Applied Science Degrees, and twelve Skill Sets. To meet the expressed need for nurses in the region, the college began its first associate degree in Nursing in the fall of 2005. The Business Studies Division has articulation agreements with Marshall University and West Virginia State University for students to transfer the Accounting, Finance, Management and Marketing degrees into a baccalaureate program. An agreement exists with Marshall University to transfer the Computers and Information Technology: Management Information Systems degree from BVCTC. The Paralegal Studies program has an articulation agreement with the University of Charleston to transfer students from that program into the University of Charleston's baccalaureate Political Science program. More information about the paralegal courses that transfer into that program can be found by visiting the following website: https://sites.google.com/site/bridgevalleyparalegalstudies/ == Accreditation == The South Charleston campus has met the recommended criteria to become an independently accredited institution by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In October 2004, the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association approved the South Charleston campus to receive the maximum five year initial accreditation. Following a return visit in April 2010, the school was granted the maximum ten year accreditation. The Nursing program at the South Charleston campus is fully accredited by the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission, Inc. and the West Virginia Board of Examiners for Registered Professional Nurses since 2007. At an accreditation visit in 2012, the NLNAC recommended the full eight-year accreditation of the nursing program. The Nuclear Medicine program at the South Charleston campus is accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Educational Programs in Nuclear Medicine Technology. ==Lease dispute== As of September 2017, the college is being threatened with eviction from its South Charleston campus for non- payment of rent following the June 2015 expiration of its lease. President Bellinger acknowledged that the school has not paid rent in two years for the two buildings and grounds it occupies, but school officials hope that suing their landlord, the West Virginia Regional Technology Park, might delay the actual eviction. == References  * www.bridgevalley.edu Official website.

It may lead to surgical complication in the form of impaired wound healing following oral and maxillofacial surgery, periodontal surgery, or endodontic therapy. Particular medications can result in MRONJ, a serious but uncommon side effect in certain individuals. Such medications are frequently used to treat diseases that cause bone resorption such as osteoporosis, or to treat cancer. The main groups of drugs involved are anti-resorptive drugs, and anti-angiogenic drugs. This condition was previously known as bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BON or BRONJ) because osteonecrosis of the jaws correlating with bisphosphate treatment was frequently encountered, with its first incident occurring in 2003. Osteonecrotic complications associated with denosumab, another antiresorptive drug from a different drug category, were soon determined to be related to this condition. Newer medications such as anti- angiogenic drugs have been potentially implicated causing a very similar condition and consensus shifted to refer to the related conditions as MRONJ; however, this has not been definitively demonstrated. There is no known prevention for bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw.Osteoporosis medications and your dental health pamphlet #W418, American Dental Association/National Osteoporosis Foundation, 2008 Avoiding the use of bisphosphonates is not a viable preventive strategy on a general-population basis because the medications are beneficial in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis (including prevention of bony fractures) and treatment of bone cancers. Current recommendations are for a 2-month drug holiday prior to dental surgery for those who are at risk (intravenous drug therapy, greater than 4 years of by-mouth drug therapy, other factors that increase risk such as steroid therapy). It usually develops after dental treatments involving exposure of bone or trauma but also may arise spontaneously. Patients who develop MRONJ may experience prolonged healing, pain, swelling, infection and exposed bone after dental procedures, though some patients may have no signs/symptoms. ==Definition== This condition is defined as; :1. exposed bone, or bone that can be probed through an in the mouth or through a fistula in the skin of the face, and :2. has persisted for more than eight weeks, and :3. in patients with a history of treatment with anti-resorptive or anti-angiogenic drugs, and :4. without a history of radiation therapy to the jaw or no obvious metastatic disease to the jaws. Osteonecrosis, or localized death of bone tissue, of the jaws is a rare potential complication in cancer patients receiving treatments including radiation, chemotherapy, or in patients with tumors or infectious embolic events. In 2003, reports surfaced of the increased risk of osteonecrosis in patients receiving these therapies concomitant with intravenous bisphosphonate.Appendix 11: Expert Panel Recommendation for the Prevention, Diagnosis and Treatment of Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Matrix metalloproteinase 2 may be a candidate gene for bisphosphonate- associated osteonecrosis of the jaws, since it is the only gene known to be associated with both bone abnormalities and atrial fibrillation, another side effect of bisphosphonates. In response to the growing base of literature on this association, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued a broad drug class warning of this complication for all bisphosphonates in 2005. ==Signs and symptoms== Classically, MRONJ will cause an ulcer or areas of necrotic bone for weeks, months, or even years following a tooth extraction. While the exposed, dead bone does not cause symptoms these areas often have mild pain from the inflammation of the surrounding tissues. Clinical signs and symptoms associated with, but not limited to MRONJ, include: *Jaw pain and neuropathy *Loose teeth *Mucosal swelling *Erythema *Suppuration *Soft tissue ulceration persisting for more than 8 weeks *Trismus *Non-healing extraction sockets *Paraesthesia or numbness in the jaw *Bad breath *Exposed necrotic jaw bone ==Cause== Cases of MRONJ have also been associated with the use of the following two intravenous and three oral bisphosphonates, respectively: zoledronic acid and pamidronate and alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate.American Dental Association Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Despite the fact that it remains vague as to what the actual cause is, scientists and doctors believe that there is a correlation between the necrosis of the jaw and time of exposure to bisphosphonates. Causes are also thought to be related to bone injury in patients using bisphosphonates as stated by Remy H Blanchaert in an article about the matter. ===Risk factors=== MRONJ: Duration of oral biphosphonate use vs risk of MRONJ The overwhelming majority of MRONJ diagnoses, however, were associated with intravenous administration of bisphosphonates (94%). Only the remaining 6% of cases arose in patients taking bisphosphonates orally. Although the total United States prescriptions for oral bisphosphonates exceeded 30 million in 2006, less than 10% of MRONJ cases were associated with patients taking oral bisphosphonate drugs. Studies have estimated that BRONJ occurs in roughly 20% of patients taking intravenous zoledronic acid for cancer therapy and in between 0–0.04% of patients taking orally administered bisphosphonates. Owing to prolonged embedding of bisphosphonate drugs in the bone tissues, the risk for MRONJ is elevated even after stopping the administration of the medication for several years. Patients who stopped taking anti-angiogenic drugs are exposed to the same risk as patients who have never taken the drugs because anti-angiogenic drugs do not normally reside in the body for a long period of time. Risk factors include: * Dental treatment (e.g. dentoalveolar surgery/procedure that impacts bone) – it is possible for MRONJ to occur spontaneously without any recent invasive dental treatment * Duration of bisphosphonate drug therapy – increased risk with increased cumulative dose of drug * Other concurrent medication – use of chronic systemic glucocorticoid increases risk when they are taken in combination with anti-resorptive drugs * Dental implants * Drug holidays – no evidence to support a reduction in MRONJ risk if patients stop taking bisphosphonates temporarily/permanently, as drugs can persist in skeletal tissues for many years * Treatment in the past with anti- resorptive/anti-angiogenic drugs * Patient being treated for cancer – higher risk * Patients being treated for osteoporosis/non-malignant bone diseases (e.g. Paget's disease) – lower risk === Research findings === ‘The risk of MRONJ after dental extraction was significantly higher in patients treated with ARD (antiresorptive drugs) for oncological reasons (3.2%) than in those treated with ARD for OP (osteoporosis) (0.15%) (p < 0.0001). Dental extraction performed with adjusted extraction protocols decreased MRONJ development significantly. Potential risk indicators such as concomitant medications and pre-existing osteomyelitis were identified.’ === Patient risk categories === Low: * Treatment of osteoporosis or non-malignant bone disease with oral bisphosphonates for <5 years (not taking systemic glucocorticoids) * Treatment of osteoporosis or non-malignant bone disease with quarterly/yearly infusions of intravenous bisphosphonates for <5 years (not taking systemic glucocorticoids) * Treatment of osteoporosis or non-malignant bone disease with denosumab (not taking systemic glucocorticoids) High: * Patients being treated for osteoporosis or non-malignant bone disease with oral bisphosphonates/quarterly or yearly infusions of intravenous bisphosphonates for >5 years * Patients being treated for osteoporosis or non-malignant bone disease with bisphosphonates/denosumab for any length of time as well as being treated with systemic glucocorticoids * Patients being treated with anti- resorptive/anti-angiogenic drugs/both as part of cancer management * Previous MRONJ diagnosis \\"N.B. Patients who have taken bisphosphonate drugs at any time in the past and those who have taken denosumab in the last nine months are allocated to a risk group as if they are still taking the drug.\\" === Anti- resorptive drugs === Anti-resorptive drugs inhibit osteoclast differentiation and function, slowing down the breakdown of bone. They are usually prescribed for patients with osteoporosis or other metastatic bone diseases, such as Paget's disease, osteogenesis imperfecta and fibrous dysplasia. The two main types of anti-resorptive drugs are bisphosphonate and denosumab. These drugs help to decrease the risk of bone fracture and bone pain. Because the mandible has a faster remodeling rate compared to other bones in the body, it is more affected by the effects of these drugs. # Bisphosphonate #* Bisphosphonates are either administrated orally or intravenously. They reduces bone resorption. #* Mechanism of action: Bisphosphonate binds to the mineral component of the bone and inhibits enzymes (i.e. farnesyl-pyrophosphate synthase) responsible for bone formation, osteoclast recruitment and osteoclast function. #* This type of drug has a high affinity for hydroxyapatite and stays in bone tissue for a long period of time, with alendronate, it has a half-life of approximately ten years. #* The risk of a patient having MRONJ after discontinuing this medication is unknown. #* There are suggestions that bisphosphonate may inhibit the proliferation of soft tissue cells and increases apoptosis. This may result in delayed soft tissue healing. #* Examples of bisphosphonates: : Zoledronic acid (Reclast, Zometa), Risedronate (Actonel), Alendronate (Fosamax), Etidronate (Didronel), Ibandronate (Boniva), Pamidronate (Aredia), Tiludronate (Skelid). # Denosumab #* Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody which is administrated subcutaneously. It inhibits osteoclast differentiation and activation, reduces bone resorption, improves bone density and lessens skeletal-related events associated with metastasis. #* Mechanism of action: The drug binds to receptor activator nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), preventing the interaction with RANK. #* It does not bind to bone and its effect on bone diminishes in 9 months. === Anti-angiogenic drugs === Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been identified as one of the possible complications of taking anti-angiogenic drugs; the association of the disease with the medication is known as MRONJ. This has been stated in the Drug Safety Updates by the MHRA. Angiogenesis inhibitors interfere with blood vessel formation by interfering with the angiogenesis signalling cascade. They are used primarily to treat cancer. These cancer-fighting agents tend to hinder the growth of blood vessels that supply the tumour, rather than killing tumour cells directly. They prevent the tumour from growing. For example, bevacizumab/aflibercept is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), preventing VEGF from binding to receptors on the surface of normal endothelial cells. Sunitinib is a different example of an anti-angiogenic drug; it inhibits cellular signalling by targeting multiple receptor tyrosine kinases. It reduces the blood supply to the tumour by inhibiting new blood vessel formation in the tumor. The tumour may stop growing or even shrink. ==Pathogenesis== Although the methods of action are not yet completely understood, it is hypothesized that medication-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw is related to a defect in jaw bone healing and remodelling. The inhibition of osteoclast differentiation and function, precipitated by drug therapy, leads to decreased bone resorption and remodelling. Evidence also suggests bisphosphonates induce apoptosis of osteoclasts.Lindsay R, Cosman F. Osteoporosis. In: Braunwald E, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, Hauser SL, Longo DL, Jameson JL, eds. Harrison’s principles of internal medicine. New York:McGraw- Hill, 2001:2226-37. Another suggested factor is inhibition of angiogenesis due to bisphosphonates; this effect remains uncertain. Several studies have proposed that bisphosphonates cause excessive reduction of bone turnover, resulting in a higher risk of bone necrosis when repair is needed. It is also thought that bisphosphonates bind to osteoclasts and interfere with the remodeling mechanism in bone. To be more specific, the drug interferes with the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway through the inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Over time, the cytoskeleton of the osteoclasts loses its function and the essential border needed for bone resorption does not form. Like aminobisphosphonates, bisphosphonates have shown to have antiangiogenic properties. Therefore, effects include an overall decrease in bone recycling/turnover as well as an increased inhibition of the absorptive bone abilities. Light micrograph of an osteoclast displaying typical distinguishing characteristics: a large cell with multiple nuclei and a \\"foamy\\" cytosol. One theory is that because bisphosphonates are preferentially deposited in bone with high turnover, it is possible that the levels of bisphosphonate within the jaw are selectively elevated. To date, there have been no reported cases of bisphosphonate-associated complications within bones outside the craniofacial skeleton. ==Diagnosis== A diagnosis of bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw relies on three criteria: # the patient possesses an area of exposed bone in the jaw persisting for more than 8 weeks, # the patient must present with no history of radiation therapy to the head and neck # the patient must be taking or have taken bisphosphonate medication. According to the updated 2009 BRONJ Position Paper published by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, both the potency of and the length of exposure to bisphosphonates are linked to the risk of developing bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw.Medical News Today AAOMS Updates BRONJ Position Paper, January 23, 2009 In the 2014 AAOMS update on MRONJ, a staging and treatment strategies table was created: {  style=\\"text-align:center;font-size:70%;width:100%;margin- left:1em\\" + E5AFAA;\\"Staging and Treatment Strategies + align=\\"bottom\\" style=\\"caption-side: bottom; text-align: left;\\"  *Exposed or probable bone in the maxillofacial region without resolution for greater than 8 weeks in patients treated with an antiresorptive and/or an antiangiogenic agent who have not received radiation therapy to the jaws. **Regardless of the disease stage, mobile segments of bony sequestrum should be removed without exposing uninvolved bone.

Prevention including the maintenance of good oral hygiene, comprehensive dental examination and dental treatment including extraction of teeth of poor prognosis and dentoalveolar surgery should completed prior to commencing any medication which is likely to cause osteonecrosis (ONJ). Patients with removable prostheses should be examined for areas of mucosal irritation. Procedures which are likely to cause direct osseous trauma, e.g. tooth extraction, dental implants, complex restoration, deep root planning, should be avoided in preference of other dental treatments. There are limited data to support or refute the benefits of a drug holiday for osteoporotic patients receiving antiresorptive therapy. However, a theoretical benefit may still apply for those patients with extended exposure histories (>4 yr), and current recommendations are for a 2 month holiday for those at risk. ==Management== MRONJ is an adverse reaction which can occur as a result of medicines used to treat cancer and osteoporosis. Some medications which induce these effects are bisphosphonates, denosumab and antiangiogenic agents. They involve the destruction of bone in a progressive manner, particularly associated with the mandible or maxilla. The overall effects depend on which drug is being used, the dose and the duration of taking this drug. MRONJ is associated with significant severe disease, negative affects on the quality of life and remains to be increasingly challenging to treat.Institute of Pharmacology of Natural Products & Clinical Pharmacology, Ulm University, Helmholtzstr. 20, Ulm, Germany, 89081. It is debate whether the various management techniques used for MRONJ are effective.Effectiveness of treatments for medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: A systematic review and meta-analysis. El-Rabbany M, Sgro A, Lam DK, Shah PS, Azarpazhooh A. J Am Dent Assoc. 2017 Aug The management of people taking the drugs of concern undergo initial management and continuing management. Before either of these are considered the patient must be as dentally fit as possible. Treatment usually involves antimicrobial mouth washes and oral antibiotics to help the immune system fight the attendant infection, and it also often involves local resection of the necrotic bone lesion. Many patients with MRONJ have successful outcomes after treatment, meaning that the local osteonecrosis is stopped, the infection is cleared, and the mucosa heals and once again covers the bone. The treatment the person receives depends on the severity of osteonecrosis of the jaw. ===Conservative=== Indicated in patients who have evidence of exposed bone but no evidence of infection. It may not necessarily eliminate all the lesions, but it may provide patients with a long term relief. This approach involves a combination of antiseptic mouthwashes and analgesics and the use of teriparatide. However, note that the teriparatide treatment should not be used in cancer patients, or patients with a history of skeletal radiation or active bone metastases. Splints may be used to protect sites of exposed necrotic bone. === Non-surgical=== Indicated for people with exposed bone with symptoms of infection. This treatment modality may also be utilised for patients with other co-morbidities which precludes invasive surgical methods. This approach requires antimicrobial mouthwashes, systemic antibiotics and antifungal medication and analgesics. ===Surgery=== Surgical intervention is indicated in patients with symptomatic exposed bone with fistula formation and one or more of the following: exposed and necrotic bone extending beyond the alveolar bone resulting in pathological fracture; extra- oral fistula; oral antral communication or osteolysis extending from the inferior border of the mandible or the sinus floor. Surgical management involves necrotic bone resection, removal of loose sequestra of necrotic bone and reconstructive surgery. The objective of surgical management is to eliminate areas of exposed bone to prevent the risk of further inflammation and infection. The amount of surgical debridement required remains controversial. ===Other=== *Hyperbaric oxygen therapy *Ultrasonic therapy ===Initial management === This involves patients who are about to start, or very recently have started, taking the drugs of concern. There is a small portion of observational studies which promote the idea of preventative dental treatment to decrease oral complications in patients taking these drugs. These preventative measures may require a change in the patients’ oral hygiene technique and lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption. There is also a benefit in prescribing high fluoridated toothpaste if the patient is of high caries risk. Before prescribing of any kind or when noticing a patient is on the treatment already, it is encouraged to tell the patient of the risk of developing MRONJ, although this risk is small. This is followed by personalised advice given to the patient, involving: a healthy diet, excellent oral hygiene, stop smoking, limited alcohol consumption and regular dental appointments. If a patient has a complex medical history and is of particular high risk it is advised before any treatment to commence, communication with a specialist with regards to the clinical assessment and treatment plan. It is also advised for individuals who take bisphosphonates to never allow the tablet to dissolve in the mouth as this causes damage to the oral mucosa. The patient must follow the instructions given with the tablets. ===Continuing management=== This involves patients who have a regime which actively incorporates the drugs of concern and also for the patients whom undergone initial management. In terms of dental treatment all must be done as normal, accompanied by personalised advice to the patient. If there is a need for an extraction or any procedure which implicates bone a discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits must occur. Due to bacterial resistance and possible side effects of antibiotic therapy, they are only prescribed if there is a necessity for them. There is minimal evidence to say the use of prophylactic antibiotics will reduce MRONJ. For some, it is possible to have a drug holiday during which bisphosphonates are discontinued if the benefit of discontinuing the drug outweighs the risks. If it is possible to have a drug holiday, it is recommended that treatment be carried out during that period. Some patients however have been taking the drug for a prolonged period of time and so the bisphosphonate levels have accumulated in the body. In this case, a drug holiday would be of no benefit. Medical management of MRONJ is most commonly performed for patients who have less severe cases or those whom have contraindicating health conditions. The antimicrobials therapies commonly used are topical, oral and intravenous. ===Topical antimicrobials=== A commonly used medicament, chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% is bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal making an effective agent against MRONJ. Advantages of this topical gel is the low cost, ease of use, availability and patient acceptance. The disadvantages of this are the low compliance, patient acceptance, dental staining and risk of opportunistic bacterial resistance. For some patients, it is possible to have a drug holiday during which bisphosphonates are discontinued if the benefit of discontinuing the drug outweighs the risks. If it is possible to have a drug holiday, it is recommended that treatment be carried out during that period. Some patients however have been taking the drug for a prolonged period of time and so the bisphosphonate levels have accumulated in the body. In this case, a drug holiday would be of no benefit. For some patients, it is possible to have a drug holiday during which bisphosphonates are discontinued if the benefit of discontinuing the drug outweighs the risks.

Some patients however have been taking the drug for a prolonged period of time and so the bisphosphonate levels have accumulated in the body. In this case, a drug holiday would be of no benefit. ===Antibiotics=== The use of these are based on the clinical evaluation of the condition and if pathogenic bacteria presence is indicated. This is generally a 2-week course for a person with a persistent presentation of the disease or a 4-6 week course for more severe cases. Penicillin is the first line of choice, although if this is contraindicated commonly used antimicrobials are: clindamycin, fluoroquinolones and/or metronidazole. Intravenous antibiotics may be used when specific infections are resist oral therapies. Although this method has perceived greater penetration of tissue there is little evidence of being a substantial greater efficacy when compared to other methods of management.Management of Medication-related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw, An Issue of Oral and Maxillofacial Clinics of North America 27-4. 7 Jan 2016. Salvatore L. Ruggiero == Epidemiology == The likelihood of this condition developing varies widely from less than 1/10,000 to 1/100, as many other factors need to be considered, such as the type, dose and frequency of intake of drug, how long it has been taken for, and why it has been taken. In patients taking drugs for cancer, the likelihood of MRONJ development varies from 0 - 12%. This again, varies with the type of cancer, although prostate cancer and multiple myeloma are reported to be at a higher risk. In patients taking oral drugs for osteoporosis, the likelihood of MRONJ development varies from 0 - 0.2%. ==See also== * C-terminal telopeptide, commonly known as CTX, a serum biomarker for bone turnover rate and a tool used to evaluate patient risk for complications due to BRONJ * Osteonecrosis of the jaw, see section on Bisphosphonates * Osteoradionecrosis, a term for osteonecrosis caused by radiotherapy * Phossy jaw ==References External links == * https://web.archive.org/web/20120901140540/http://www.ada.org/sections/professionalResources/pdfs/topics_ARONJ_report.pdf Category:Osteonecrosis Category:Jaw disorders ","title":"Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw"},{"id":"19269106","text":"Ross Gregory Douthat () (born 1979) is an American conservative political analyst, blogger, author and New York Times columnist.

An emerging discipline, the main application area of civionics is currently the use of electronics for structural health monitoring (SHM) of civil structures, particularly photonics (Fiber Optic Bragg Grating). In SHM, Civionics will provide engineers with feedback necessary to aid in optimizing design techniques and understanding infrastructure performance, behaviour and state of condition. The successful integration of intelligent sensing of innovative structures will allow civil structural engineers to expand the design envelope by taking risks to introduce new design concepts, materials and innovation in civil engineering. Civionic engineering applications include integrating science and technology from both new and traditional disciplines, including civil, structural, and electronics engineering; structural health monitoring, deformation monitoring, data acquisition, signal processing, metrology, telemetry, remote sensing, and other applications. ==See also== *Automatic Deformation Monitoring System *Wireless sensor network *Embedded system *Fiber Bragg grating *Accelerometer *Transducer *Tensometer ==References External links == * SHM Glossary: Civionics * ISIS Civionics Manual * ISHMII - International Society for Structural Health Monitoring of Intelligent Infrastructure * Chad Klowak, Getting Bridges to Talk * Graz University of Technology, Civionics Course * NCE Annual Report 2005-2006 * Research in the School of Engineering, University of Western Sydney - Civionics Research Node * Micron Optics: Sensing News & Events https://web.archive.org/web/20081011151259/http://www.specialtyphotonics.com/pdf/knowledge_base/sensor%20brochure%2005.pdf Furukawa Electric: Sensor Fibers] Category:Engineering disciplines Category:Civil engineering Category:Structural engineering ","title":"Civionics"},{"id":"19269120","text":"María Milagros Véliz Pinto (born January 9, 1986, in Guacara, Carabobo state, Venezuela) is a beauty pageant titleholder who represented Venezuela in Miss World 2009, held on December 12, 2009 in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Meredith Michaels-Beerbaum of Germany won the event riding Shutterfly. ==ResultsRound 1=== Thirty-nine riders competed in the Table C €110,000 opening round of the 2008 FEI World Cup Jumping Final. Michael Whitaker opened the round, and quickly set the pace by completing a clear round in 75.05 seconds. However, his time was quickly surpassed two riders later when Malin Baryard-Johnsson took nearly four seconds off of Whitaker's time while representing the host nation of Sweden. Shortly after Peter Wylde narrowly took the lead from Baryard-Johnsson, Heinrich Hermann Engemann cleared the course in under seventy seconds to set a new standard. Although Steve Guerdat was also able to clear the seventy second mark, Engemann's time held up as he took the €25,300 first place prize. Two-time champion Marcus Ehning was eliminated after his horse refused twice at the eleventh jump. {  style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" - !width=20 !width=225Rider !width=175Horse !width=75Time (s) !width=75Penalties !width=75Points -

Flying to Los Angeles, he checks into a hotel and drives out to the victim's luxurious home. Finding the man alone, he shoots him dead and makes his getaway. Back at the hotel, he discovers that his room has been stripped, including his passport and plane ticket. Emerging, he finds that he is being trailed by a hitman, who keeps trying to shoot him. To evade his pursuer, he takes a woman hostage and holes up in her apartment. On the TV news he sees the report of Kovacs' murder, but the description of the suspect does not fit him at all. With only a gun and some money, and being pursued, he cannot survive long. He calls up his boss in Paris, Antoine, who tells him to find an old friend, Nancy, who works in a topless bar. She hides him and organises a passport. When Lucien's pursuer, Lenny, finds the two of them in a motel, Lucien captures him and explains the situation. Lucien was hired to eliminate Kovacs and Lenny was hired to eliminate Lucien, but who hired them? The answer is clear: it was Kovacs' son, who has inherited his father's profitable empire and his trophy wife. The two agree to tackle young Kovacs, but fall out and Lenny is killed. Antoine arrives from Paris to attend old Kovacs' funeral, which ends in a shoot-out. Antoine kills young Kovacs, but is then shot dead by the police. Lucien gets away, but dies of gunshot wounds. ==Cast== * Jean- Louis Trintignant as Lucien Bellon * Ann-Margret as Nancy Robson * Angie Dickinson as Jackie Kovacs * Roy Scheider as Lenny * Georgia Engel as Mrs. Barnes * Felice Orlandi as Anderson *Carlo De Mejo as Karl *Michel Constantin as Antoine *Umberto Orsini as Alex * Ted de Corsia as Victor * Jackie Earle Haley as Eric *John Hillerman as Department Store Manager *Jon Korkes as First Hawk *Connie Kreski as Rosie *Ben Piazza as Desk Clerk *Alex Rocco as Miller *Talia Shire as Make-up Girl ==References* Category:1972 films Category:French films Category:English-language films Category:French-language films Category:1970s crime thriller films Category:United Artists films Category:Films scored by Michel Legrand Category:Films set in the United States Category:Films about contract killing Category:Films with screenplays by Jean-Claude Carrière Category:English- language French films ","title":"The Outside Man"},{"id":"19269188","text":"\\"Y Yo Sigo Aquí\\" is a song recorded by Mexican singer Paulina Rubio for her fifth studio album Paulina (2000).

She has represented New Zealand at three Summer Paralympic Games from 2008, winning a total of nine gold medals and six silver medals, making her New Zealand's most successful Paralympian. She also went to the Commonwealth Games to represent New Zealand. == Early life == Born in Christchurch on 8 January 1993 to Gary and Jo Pascoe, Sophie grew up on a lifestyle block near Halswell on the south-western outskirts of the city. She has one older sister, Rebecca. On 23 September 1995, Pascoe was accidentally run over by her father on the family ride-on lawnmower, resulting in both her legs being caught under the cutter deck housing in the path of the rotating mower blades. As a result of the accident, her left leg was amputated below the knee, while the rear of her right leg was left with severe scarring. She attended Halswell Primary School, and Lincoln High School in the nearby Christchurch satellite town of Lincoln. Pascoe began swimming at age 7. She is coached by Roly Crichton, and trains at the QEII swim club, which has been based at Jellie Park in Burnside since the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Park were damaged in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. == International swimming career == Pascoe is classified S10 for freestyle, backstroke and butterfly, SB9 for breaststroke, and SM10 for individual medley. At the 2008 Summer Paralympics, Pascoe won a gold and a silver medal for the 100 m breaststroke and 100 m butterfly respectively and later a gold for the women's 200 m individual medley. Pascoe then shared a gold medal for the 100 m backstroke when she drew with South African Shireen Sapiro. At 15 years of age, Pascoe was New Zealand's youngest athlete at the Paralympics, and the youngest ever New Zealander to win a medal. Following the 2008 Paralympics, Pascoe was voted New Zealand's favourite Paralympian in a nationwide voting competition run by Mitsubishi Motors. For this she won a Mitsubishi VRX Outlander. Pascoe was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2009 New Year's Honours, for her services to swimming. In February 2012, Pascoe became the inaugural winner of the Disabled Sportsperson of the Year award at the 2011 Halberg Awards. At the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Pascoe competed in six events – the four in which she won medals at the 2008 Paralympics, plus the 50m freestyle (S10) and 100m freestyle (SM10) events. She successfully defended her 200 m individual medley (SM10) gold medal, breaking her own world record by four seconds with a time of 2:25.65. She also won gold medals in the 100 m butterfly (S10), where she bettered her silver at Beijing and in the process setting a new world record with a time of 1:04.43, and in the 100 m freestyle (S10), setting a new Paralympic record with a time of 1:00.89. Pascoe won silver medals in the 50 m freestyle (S10), 100 m backstroke (S10), and 100 m breaststroke (SB9). In March 2013 Pascoe broke her own world record for the 50m butterfly at the New Zealand Swimming Championships in Auckland, setting a time of 29.21 seconds. At the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Pascoe competed in five events, dropping the 100 m breaststroke SB9. She won gold medals in the 100 m backstroke, 100 m butterfly and 200 m individual medley, the latter in world record time. She also won silver medals in the 50 m freestyle and 100 m freestyle, both behind Canada's Aurélie Rivard. Her 50 m freestyle medal holds the distinction as the 200th medal won by New Zealand at the Paralympic Games (both summer and winter editions). Her success took her gold medal count to nine and her total medal count to 15, overtaking Eve Rimmer's eight gold medals and 14 total medals to become New Zealand's most successful Paralympian. == Personal bests == {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" - !

It was founded in 1982 as an amalgam of clubs from Oyo State, backed by the Royal Nigeria Carpet company; a subsidiary of Greek corporation Leventis. Leventis won the third division in 1984, the same year they won the FA Cup. The next year, Leventis was promoted to the First Division after winning the second division with an undefeated record, the first such feat in Nigerian football. With John Mastoroudes as general manager, the team quickly built itself into one of the best financed sides in the country. However, the club suffered with the recession and coups of the late 1980s.

In his 2002 NFL season, Allen made 63 punts for 2,326 yards with 2,045 net yards and an average 36.9 yards per punt. He is famously known for attempting to pass to Rich Seubert, after a botched snap from Trey Junkin on a field goal attempt to win the game on the last play of the Giants-49ers NFC Wildcard game on January 5, 2003. The pass fell incomplete, ending the Giants' season, although an obvious pass interference penalty wasn't called by officials. Had that penalty been called, the Giants would have had another chance to kick the winning field goal, as it would have offset their ineligible man downfield penalty and resulted in an extra, untimed down. As it was not 4th down and the team had a timeout left, Allen could have spiked the ball and stopped the clock regardless of potentially being penalised for intentional rounding, or he could have taken a knee then used the time out. This play ended up being #10 on NFL Top 10's Top Ten Meltdowns and Top Ten Controversial Calls at #7. ==References External links == *Profile Category:Living people Category:1977 births Category:Sportspeople from Montgomery, Alabama Category:American football punters Category:New York Giants players ","title":"Matt Allen"},{"id":"19269281","text":"You, Me, and Everyone We Know is a rock band from Washington, D.C., fronted by singer-songwriter Ben Liebsch.

Menendez takes oath in Senate, San Antonio Express-News, March 4, 2015. A member of the Democratic Party, he is a former member of the Texas House of Representatives for District 124. He won a special election on February 17, 2015, for the state Senate, to replace Leticia Van de Putte. She resigned to run, unsuccessfully as it developed, against the short-term incumbent, Ivy Taylor, for mayor of San Antonio, Texas.Gonzalez, John W. Menéndez captures Texas Senate District 26, San Antonio Express-News, February 17, 2015. Menendez handily defeated fellow Democratic State Representative Trey Martinez Fischer for the right to succeed Van de Putte. Even though Menendez and Fischer remain political opponents, their relationship appears to have been civil. Menendez served in the Texas House from 2001 to 2015. Prior to his service in the State House, he was a member of the San Antonio City Council for District 6. == Background == Jose Menendez was born in San Juan in Hidalgo County in south Texas. He graduated in 1987 from Central Catholic Marianist High School. Four years later, he graduated from Southern Methodist University in University Park, Texas, where he received his Bachelor of Business Administration and a Bachelor of Arts in Latin American Studies. He returned to San Antonio, where he took over his family business in 1991. Menendez and his wife, Cehlia Newman-Menendez, have three children: Dominic Newman-Menendez, Victoria Newman-Menendez, and Austin Newman-Menendez. Menendez and his family reside in San Antonio and Austin, Texas. == Political career == Menendez was appointed to the San Antonio Zoning Commission for District 6 in 1994. In 1997, after a heated campaign, he was elected to the District 6 seat on the city council. In 1999, Menendez was re- elected to the council with more than 84 percent of the vote. He served on the Small Business, International, and Ethics committees. He also was the chairman of the City's Community Revitalization Action Group (CRAG). In 2000, term- limited on the council, he ran for the state House of Representatives and was sworn into his first term in 2001. As a representative, Menendez headed the House Committee on Defense and Veterans' Affairs, which put him in contact with thousands of Texas veterans and provided a basis for his successful run thereafter for the Texas Senate.Gilbert Garcia, \\"Uresti's troubles could open the door for a Gutierrez run\\" (opinion), San Antonio Express-News, February 19, 2017, p. A2. Menendez won election to a full term in the state Senate in the Democratic primary on March 1, 2016, when he defeated his former opponent, Trey Martinez Fischer, who, this time gave up the District 116 House seat, Fischer held, to run for the Senate. A number of lobbyists and political action committees which had supported Martinez Fischer switched allegiance to the incumbent Menendez, whose campaign chairman, Colin Strother, worked in numerous successful campaigns; among them U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar of Laredo in Texas' 28th congressional district. Menendez faced no Republican opposition in his heavily Democratic district.David Saleh Rauf, \\"Pair expected to battle again: Quest for Senate seat may prove pricey\\", San Antonio Express- News, January 15, 2016 In a debate before the American Association of Retired Persons in San Antonio, Menendez noted that Martinez Fischer would have become dean of the Bexar County state House delegation had he remained in the House. Martinez Fischer did assume the Bexar County legislative dean's position on February 1, 2016, with the retirement of colleague Ruth McClendon. \\"Trey did a great job in the House killing many, many bills... We have differences of opinion, we debate. We're passionate about it, but we're also respectful about it,\\" said Menendez.John W. Gonzalez, \\"Contenders for Senate seat duel at AARP debate: Menendez, Martinez Fischer have similar position on senior issues\\", San Antonio Express-News, January 30, 2016, p. 2 Buoyed by the power of incumbency for just a year, Menendez defeated Martinez Fischer, 31,046 votes (59.2 percent) to 21,383 (40.8 percent). On the last day of the regular legislative session in 2017, Menendez used a filibuster to kill a bill supported by Republican Donna Campbell of New Braunfels, which would have made it more difficult for municipalities to annex surrounding territory. In the 2017 special legislative session, Menendez spoke against a bill to increase the penalty from misdemeanor to felony when one is convicted of intentionally submitting false information on a mail-in ballot application. Menendez argued that such legislation would lead to \\"unintended consequences.\\" Kelly Hancock, a Republican senator from North Richland Hills in Tarrant County, argued that the legislation is needed because mail-in voting has been linked to illegal voting and election fraud.Allie Morris and Peggy Fikac, \\"Legislature sends 4 bills to gov as finish line nears: Tree, annexation changes await voters,\\" San Antonio Express-News, August 11, 2017, pp. 1, A21. ==References External links == * Official state website * Express News article * Bexar County election order * Chron.com Texas legislature * Yellowbot.com info * Bexar County elected officials guide * Sabor San Antonio * Texas State Directory * Capitol Annex.com * Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Texas state senators Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:People from San Antonio Category:People from Hidalgo County, Texas Category:Central Catholic Marianist High School alumni Category:Southern Methodist University alumni Category:San Antonio City Council members Category:Businesspeople from Texas Category:Texas Democrats Category:21st- century American politicians ","title":"Jose Menendez"},{"id":"19269331","text":"Alikersantti (Undersergeant in Swedish) is the lowest Finnish non-commissioned officer military rank.

This variety of drum has a round wooden body that is covered on both ends with animal skin. They are categorized as hyekbu (혁부, ) which are instruments made with leather, and has been used for jeongak (Korean court music) and folk music. ==History== In the picture titled \\"Dancing boy\\" (무동:舞童), samhyeon yukgak including a buk and janggu are depicted. The barrel drums used for court music are usually fixed with nails on the rims, while ones used for folk music are usually tied up with leather straps to form the shape. Performers in the court music usually beat these drums with a single drumstick (called bukchae, 북채) in one hand or two hands together, while drummers in the folk music commonly use a drumstick in their right hand while hitting the other side with their open left hand. In the past, the jong (종, bell) was also referred to as \\"soebuk\\" (쇠북, metal drum) and included in the drum category. Barrel drums have been used for Korean music since the period of the Three Kingdoms of Korea (57 BC – 668 AD) in light of mural paintings in Anak Tomb of Goguryeo (37 BC – 668 AD) and records of Book of Sui on the kingdoms, Goguryeo and Baekje (18 BC – 660 AD). In the 3rd of Anak Tomb, two types are depicted in the paintings titled Juakdo (주악도, , \\"painging of playing music\\") and Haengryeoldo (행렬도, , \\"painting of marching\\") such as ipgo (입고, ) and damgo (담고, ) respectively. The ipgo is a buk that performers beat as standing, while the damgo is a drum that drummers strike while carrying it on their shoulder. During the Unified Silla period (668 – 935), daego (대고, ) or keunbuk, meaning \\"a big drum\\", was used along with a percussion instrument named bak (박, ) in music played by Samhyeon samjuk (삼현삼죽, 三絃三竹) which comprises samhyeon, three string instruments such as geomungo, gayageum, and hyangbipa and samjuk such as daegeum, junggeum and sogeum. In the Goryeo period (918 – 1392), as dangak and aak were introduced to Korea from China, a lot of drums such as janggu, gyobanggo, jingo began to be used for the court music. While there are twenty types of buk used in the present Korean traditional music, most commonly used buk are jwago to perform Samhyeon yukgak (삼현육각, 三絃六角), yonggo for marching music, gyobango for bukchum (북춤, drum dance), beopgo for Buddhist ritual ceremonies, sogo used by Namsadang, and street musicians, soribuk or called gojangbuk for pansori, maegubuk (or called nongakbuk) used for nongak, and motbanggo used by farmers as working. ==Usages== Yonggo being played in a marching daechwita ensemble There are two forms of undecorated buk used in Korean folk music: the buk used to accompany pansori, which has tacked heads, is called a sori-buk (소리북),photo while the buk used to accompany pungmul music, which has laced heads, is called pungmul-buk (풍물북).photo The sori-buk is played with both an open left hand and a stick made of birch that is held in the right hand, with the stick striking both the right drumhead and the wood of the drum's body. The pungmul- buk is one of the four instruments used in samul nori, a modern performance version of pungmul. It is played by striking a single stick (usually with the right hand) on only one of its heads. Due to its similarity in shape and construction, the yonggo (hangul: 용고; hanja: 龍鼓; literally \\"dragon drum\\"), which is a barrel drum with tacked heads decorated with painted dragon designs and used in the military wind-and-percussion music called daechwita, is sometimes also classified as a form of buk. It is struck with two padded sticks. A modern set of buk (usually four) is called modeum buk (모듬북).photo They are typically placed horizontally on wooden stands and played with sticks.photo ==Gallery== Image:Airman Buk.jpgA South Korean airman playing a pungmul-buk Image:Korea-Haeinsa-23.jpgBeopgo Image:Korea-Seoul-Insadong- Sanchon-04.jpg ==See also== *Traditional Korean musical instruments ==References== *The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd ed.

However, currently it is either a reserve rank, or a rank available to professional NCOs. ==Sweden== The Översergant has the same relative rank as the Fänrik.\\"Försvarsmaktens föreskrifter om personaltjänst. 27 november 2019.\\" Försvarets författningssamling.

Built in 1892, the house was designed by architects Herman Anlauf and Franklin Ward. Adolfo Camarillo operated the ranch for 78 years, changing the operations from mostly cattle to crops. He was a leading innovator, growing lima beans, barley, corn, alfalfa, walnuts, and citrus and eucalyptus trees. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. ==History== Juan was a member of the Hijar-Padres Expedition to California in 1834 and he settled in Ventura in 1857. Juan and Martina Camarillo were married in 1840 and moved to Ventura, California in 1854, becoming the fourth European family in the town. In 1876, Juan Camarillo (1812–1880) bought the Rancho Calleguas in eastern Ventura County from Jose Pedro Ruiz for $3,000 in gold. ===Legal battles for control of the Rancho=== Juan Camarillo died in 1880, and Martina Camarillo in 1898. In 1891, Martina had deeded the Rancho to her sons, Adolfo and Juan, Jr. Following her death, the Camarillo daughters (who were bequeathed $5 each in the will) challenged the deeds and the will. The Los Angeles Times reported that it promised to be \\"the greatest legal battle yet fought\\" in the courts of Ventura County, as the family members fought over property then valued at \\"a million dollars or more.\\" While the initial suit was settled within a few months, the sisters filed a new legal action in 1905, alleging that the brothers had deceived their mother and that Juan had confessed his fraud to his sister and paid her $8500. It was also alleged that Adolfo had forced Juan to leave the country upon threats of exposure of his \\"private acts\\" that would cause disgrace and scandal. The Los Angeles Times followed the \\"spicy\\" case closely, noting that its charges and counter-charges \\"would furnish material for a sure-enough 'season's best seller.'\\" At the trial, a letter was introduced purporting to be signed by Martina Camarillo instructing Adolfo to destroy the will leaving everything to himself and his brother. Juan testified that his sister sought to blackmail him by threatening to send him to prison for \\"an infamous crime,\\" and a grandson testified that he saw Adolfo \\"mysteriously place a paper in Mrs. Camarillo's tin box within a few minutes after her death.\\" ===Adolfo Z. Camarillo=== Following Juan's death in 1880, his oldest son, Adolfo Camarillo (1864–1958) took over the ranch operations at the age of sixteen and turned it into \\"the largest bean ranch in the world.\\" Camarillo employed 700 workers on his ranch, and his production was so great that the Los Angeles Times reported in 1909 that, \\"through the enormous output of his ranch, [Camarillo] is, in a measure, able to set the price which the public must pay for beans.\\" The Ranch House was built in 1892 under instruction of Adolfo Camarillo using architects Franklin Ward and Herman Anlauf. Adolfo would have preferred to have built a home in Spanish style due to his background, but the homes surrounding the area were owned by Eastern Europeans. Despite his 4’11 stature, he was highly respected within his community, and could be seen frequently riding his pure bred white stallions. Adolfo's wife Isabella, who strived to fit into this new environment, would entertain guests with tea, jam, and tortillas. She enjoyed the English culture, and worked to infuse her own culture into it as well. Adolfo Camarillo himself had to have fresh tortillas every morning for breakfast. The Camarillo family had multiple servants who worked and lived on the ranch with them. A large hallway, also known as a breezeway, separates the living quarters between the servants and the rest of the family. Adolfo Camarillo became one of the wealthiest landowners in the county, and in 1911 he was elected chairman of the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. He also served as a member of the State Board of Agriculture. For 78 years, Adolfo operated the Camarillo Ranch, changing the operations from mostly cattle to crops. He was a leading innovator growing lima beans, barley, corn, alfalfa, walnuts, citrus and eucalyptus trees. Adolfo, sometimes referred to as “The Last Spanish Don,” was a leader within the community and a heavy donator that helped shape the City of Camarillo. ===Sale and subdivision of the Rancho=== In 1963, the family put the vast ranch property up for sale. An initial sale of in 1963 fell through, but the ranch was eventually sold off and developed into the housing tracts and commercial and industrial centers. The Camarillo family retained about , including the old ranch house. ==Architecture and use as the center of ranch operations== Camarillo Ranch House, September 2008 After receiving title to the Rancho from his mother in 1891, Adolfo Camarillo hired architects Herman Anlauf and Franklin Ward in 1892 to build a Queen-Anne style Victorian house. They also designed the House at Faulkner Farm near Santa Paula. The house has two turrets, a large veranda and sprawling lawns. Adolfo also planted many varieties of trees, including eucalyptus trees, around the house. The Camarillo Ranch House, as it is now known, became the center of the sprawling Rancho Calleguas for the next 70 years. From the ranch house, Adolfo oversaw the Rancho's production of lima beans, walnuts, and citrus. The house also became known for the barbecues, rodeos and fiestas held by Adolfo. Adolfo lived in the three-story Victorian mansion until shortly before his death from pneumonia in December 1958. Despite the Camarillo Ranch House's ideal location in Southern California, back in the early 1900s the home struggled to stay warm. Almost every room in the house has a fireplace in it. Adolfo looked to technology as a way to remedy problems that would arise on the ranch. He was the first farmer to ever purchase a refrigerator, which at that time, would take up an entire room in the house. However, he was able to safely store perishables for the first time in his life. He also had multiple heaters installed throughout the house in hopes of providing more warmth to his family. The most beautiful room in the Camarillo Ranch house belonged to Adolfo's middle daughter Carmen. Carmen was an avid equestrian who learned how to care for and maintain the horses from the Ranch Manager, Meliton Ortiz. Up until Meliton Ortiz’ death in 2010, he would visit the Camarillo Ranch House frequently to provide stories and details about his life growing up on the ranch. The home was remodeled in 1914, when the oldest daughter Carmen married. They opened many rooms by taking down walls and changing the stair design. The grand parlor had the greatest changes from this, causing it to go from multiple to rooms to one giant open grand parlor. This was in the hopes that it would open up the house more. In 1998, The Firm of Lopez Architects, A.I.A, of Camarillo, CA, provided a Historic Preservation Rehabilation to the House. Under the direction of Principal, Craig J. Lopez, A.I.A. the home was seismically upgraded, and replicated to its original room, exterior porch configuration and High Victorian exterior style. Between 1999 and 2000 the City of Camarillo and the Camarillo Ranch Foundation worked together to complete a $1.5 million restoration of the house, barn and stables. With its completion in 2001, the three-story, fourteen-room Queen Anne Victorian home is a fully furnished museum that provides tours and holds events. ==White Arabian stallions== Barn where the Camarillo white stallions were kept The Camarillo Ranch is known for the white Arabian parade stallions bred by Adolfo that he rode in the annual Fiesta of Santa Barbara dressed in colorful Spanish attire. Adolfo's original sire, Sultan, was a pure white, part Arabian and Morgan stallion. Sultan reportedly produced \\"snow white, pink skinned foals\\" no matter the color of the mares with whom he was mated. Since the 1920s, the Camarillo horses have appeared in numerous parades and at the opening of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in 1941. In 1950, the Camarillo horses led the Rose Parade and have been in many Rose Parades since. Even after Adolfo died in 1958, the family continued to carry on the tradition of breeding the white Arabians and riding them in area parades. In 1967, the Camarillos were still breeding the white horses on the remaining owned by the family, and the Los Angeles Times published a feature story on the Camarillo horses. At that time, there were about a dozen Camarillo white Arabians remaining, and the Times wrote: \\"The Camarillo horses love a parade. Any spectator who has ever watched one dance down the street -- a brightly costumed member of the Camarillo family astride a heavily ornamented silver saddle -- can attest to the predilection.\\" ==Public ownership and operation== In 1998, the Camarillo Planning Commission approved a zoning change to allow an industrial park to be built around the Camarillo Ranch House, but conditioned the approval on the developer's donating the ranch house, barn and to the city. The city then renovated the house and opened it to the public in 2001 as a museum and site for receptions and other functions. The house is operated by the nonprofit Camarillo Ranch Foundation. The renovation cost $1.5 million and was also made possible by volunteers who donated 10,000 hours to the effort. Camarillo Ranch House is a popular location not only for weddings and receptions but also for filming. One location manager noted that the house has the appearance of a rural setting \\"almost anywhere in the United States -- from Bakersfield to Nebraska.\\" ===Use and events=== The house is operated by the Rancho Camarillo Foundation and is open to the public for docent-led tours on Saturdays and Sundays. It is also available to be rented for weddings and other special events. The Camarillo Ranch Foundation sponsors annual community events intended to educate the public about Camarillo's history, and hosts over 150 private and public events annually. The Camarillo Ranch House is a wedding venue with four different venues including the Front Lawn, the Red Barn, the East Garden, and the West Garden. Around the property are several thematic gardens including a butterfly garden and a formal Victorian garden. The Camarillo Ranch House also hosts corporate and nonprofit events. ===The Camarillo Ranch Foundation=== The Camarillo Ranch Foundation was established in 1998 by the City of Camarillo as a non-profit public benefit organization. The Camarillo Ranch Foundation is operated by a 15-member board of directors. The Camarillo Ranch Foundation's mission statement is: “To preserve, restore, operate, and maintain the Camarillo Ranch as a historic site in partnership with our public and private sectors, on a self-sustaining basis; to foster its place in the rich history of California; to transform it into a focal point of the community for education, enrichment, and enjoyment; and to exhibit our diverse history and culture.” The Camarillo Ranch House offers programs aimed to benefit the community such as “Bring a Child to the Ranch” and scholarships to students directly related to the Camarillo family. ==See also== * List of Registered Historic Places in Ventura County, California * Ventura County Historic Landmarks & Points of Interest ==References * Camarillo Ranch Foundation web site Category:Houses in Ventura County, California Category:Museums in Ventura County, California Category:Historic house museums in California Category:Houses completed in 1892 Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ventura County, California Category:Queen Anne architecture in California ","title":"Camarillo Ranch House"},{"id":"19269427","text":"WDCX may refer to: * WDCX (AM), a radio station (990 AM) licensed to Rochester, New York, United States * WDCX-FM, a radio station (99.5 FM) licensed to Buffalo, New York, United States * WDCZ, a radio station (970 AM) licensed to Buffalo, New York, which simulcasts WDCX-FM ","title":"WDCX"},{"id":"19269429","text":"Vääpeli is a Finnish and former Swedish military rank above Ylikersantti and below Ylivääpeli.

In 1788 a classical theater was built under his orders. He was considered as \\"Father of the Country\\" by the citizens of his principality, primarily for his good works: one of his reforms was to give women legal influence over their inheritance.

It was the worst wildfire in local history. The disaster killed three students and two teachers at the Hong Kong Chinese Women's Club Fung Yiu King Memorial Secondary School and injured a further 13 students. The Hong Kong Government built a \\"Spring Breeze Pavilion\\" on Pat Sin Leng to commemorate the two teachers who died saving the students in the tragedy. After the disaster, the area was no longer suitable for vegetation growth, therefore suffers from soil erosion. ==Background events== On 10 February, 1996, 49 students of HKCWC Fung Yiu King Memorial Secondary School were led by five teachers in the \\"Golden Leg\\" Hiking activities which were held jointly by Geographic Society of the school and the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme (now Hong Kong Award for Young People). The plan was to hike from the Agriculture and Fisheries Department Plover Cove Country Park Visitor Centre to Hok Tau, Fanling via Section 9 and 10 of Wilson Trail on Pat Sin Leng. It was an extremely dry day with a relative humidity of 31%, the Hong Kong Observatory had issued a Red Fire Danger Warning, warning of a very high risk of wildfires. The fire was discovered at about 11:20, just as the group was around 150 metres away from Hsien Ku Fung. The fire quickly spread upwards, out of control. As the downhill escape route was blocked by the fire, the group was forced to flee up hill. Thirty-two students escaped and raised the alarm; but 18 people were trapped in Ma Lau Ai (Monkey Cliff). Teachers Chow Chi-Tsai and Wong Shuo Mei perished attempting to help students escape, while other injured students were left on the cliff in wait for rescue. ==Rescue operation== More than 200 staff and volunteers from the Hong Kong Fire Service department, Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD), and the Civil Aid Service (CAS) were dispatched and the search and rescue operation commenced at 12:23. The Government Flying Service (GFS) sent two helicopters to help fight the fire and rescue those severely injured. Rescuers provided first aid on the scene. Seriously injured victims were rushed to hospital by helicopters, while those with less severe injuries were carried away by the rescue crew. The first group of victims were sent to Tai Po Jockey Club Clinic. Ten seriously injured victims were transferred to the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sha Tin, which has a specialist burns unit. A female who suffered burns to 70% of her skin was rushed to the intensive care unit for advance treatment. ===Government Flying Service rescue accident=== An unusual incident occurred with the Government Flying Service's helicopter in the rescue operation. Two casualties were spotted when crew members landed using the helicopter's winch sling. In accordance with the Code of Practice, they fastened their safety belt before pulling the victims onto the helicopter. However, due to his sight being obscured by the smoke, the pilot was unable to see the victims. The helicopter succeeded only in lifting the rescuer as it climbed, as the harness was not properly fastened around the casualties. The helicopter returned to rescue two casualties, who were thought to be those who fell during previous rescue, but they were proved mistaken. The next day, rescuers found the last missing person, and found he was one of the victims who fell in the initial rescue attempt. ==Casualties and damage== The wildfire burnt for over 40 hours. At 11:00 the following day, all fires were extinguished. * Casualties: 5 (Teacher Chow Chi-Tsai, Wong Shuo Mei and three students) * Injured: 13 * Burnt area: 20 hectares ==Post-disaster review== The Spring Breeze Pavilion * The Coroner's Court hearings were held in May 1996. The coroner believed that the fire was caused by students smoking. The court also noted that the teacher-student ratio was 1 to 12, less than the 1 to 10 standard. The teachers also did not have appropriate telecommunication devices. * Some criticised the procedure that ambulances had to carry patients to the nearest emergency department, before transferring patients to a better- equipped hospital, prolonging the journey by four kilometres and delaying treatment. Furthermore, The Tai Po Jockey Club Clinic (the only medical centre in Tai Po at the time) lacked the ability to handle any large-scale crisis. * Another criticism was that the Hong Kong Government's emergency Co-ordination Centre was not in operation during this incident, hence the search and rescue effort was somewhat lacking in co-ordination. ==References== Category:1996 fires Category:1996 in Hong Kong Category:Fires in Hong Kong Category:1996 natural disasters Category:1990s wildfires ","title":"1996 Pat Sin Leng Wildfire"},{"id":"19269577","text":"Uksuum Cauyai: Drums of Winter, also referred to only as Drums of Winter, is a 1988 ethnographic documentary on the culture of the Yup'ik Eskimo people in Emmonak, Alaska, a village on the shore of the Bering Sea.

The risk inclination model (RIM) is composed of three constructs: confidence weighting, restricted context, and the risk inclination formula. Each of these constructs connects an outside observer with a respondent’s inner state of risk taking toward knowledge certainty. RIM ==Confidence weighting== The confidence weighting (CW) construct is concerned with indices that connect an outside observer to the respondent’s inner state of knowledge certainty toward specific content. Underpinning the CW construct of the risk inclination model is the individual's experience of coherence or rightness. It is used to calibrate the relationship between a respondent’s objective and observable measures of risk taking (i.e., weighted indices toward answer selections) with his or her subjective inner feelings of knowledge certainty (i.e., feelings of rightness). ==Restricted context== The restricted context (RC) construct is based on Jean Piaget’s theory of equilibration and allows the outside observer to measure the way a respondent manages competing inner states of knowledge certainty during the application of confidence weights among items within the restricted total point value (TPV) context of the test. RC sets the parameters where risk taking toward knowledge certainty occurs. These parameters are important because they allow an observer to scale and thereby measure the respondent’s inner state of equilibration among related levels of knowledge certainty. Equilibration is defined as a self-regulatory process that reflects the biological drive to produce an optimal state of balance between a person’s cognitive structures (i.e., inner state) and their environment. ==Risk inclination formula== The risk inclination formula (RIF) construct is based upon Varignon's theorem and quantifies feelings of rightness toward knowledge certainty.,Coxeter, H. S. M. and Greitzer, S. L. \\"Quadrangle; Varignon's theorem\\" §3.1 in Geometry Revisited. Washington, DC: Math. Assoc. Amer., pp. 52-54, 1967. RIF uses the Principle of Moments or Varignon’s Theorem to calculate the first factorial moment of probability in order to define this center point of balance among all confidence weights (i.e., the point of Risk Equilibration). The formal derivation of the RIF is divided into three separate calculations: (1) calculation of the first factorial moment, (2) calculation of inclination, and (3) calculation of the risk inclination score. ==References== Category:Actuarial science Category:Applied psychology Category:Risk Category:Educational assessment and evaluation Category:Educational research Category:Psychometrics Category:Psychological testing Category:Educational psychology instruments Category:Prediction Category:Forecasting ","title":"Risk inclination model"},{"id":"19269649","text":"Mighty Like a Moose (1926) is a Charley Chase short silent film that was directed by Leo McCarey.

Previous to this, cars had typically been lifted by crane and secured on flat wagons, but this method of loading was slow and wasted a lot of space. The wagon entered a two-year trial period, and in 1960 the wagon was modified to permit roll-on roll-off loading and unloading. By 1961, the class had expanded to 22 members over two batches. Later wagons were built to altered, extended designs, and coded ALF, later ALX or ALP, with the \\"L\\" indicating the increased capacity and the final letter indicating the bogie type - F for freight trains, X for freight but convertible to standard gauge for runs to Sydney, and P for passenger trains at 70 mph. The early usage of the wagon was for carrying finished motor cars from Melbourne to Sydney and Adelaide. The Ford plant at Broadmeadows was one major source of the traffic, with Holden being the other between Melbourne and Adelaide. This traffic ended by the 1990s and the wagons were put into storage. The other traffic was the motorail service provided to passengers on long distance trains, allowing them to bring their car along with them. From the 1970s wagons were assigned to The Vinelander from Melbourne to Mildura, with additional wagons used on the Southern Aurora between Melbourne and Sydney and The Overland between Melbourne and Adelaide. All have since ceased. ==Variants'Short' wagons=== The first car-carrying wagon explicitly designed by the Victorian Railways for this purpose was constructed in 1958. The wagon was built by recycling the underframe of a scrapped Swing Door type locomotive-hauled carriage, with skeletal truss sides supporting an upper level deck. The frame, constructed in 1902 as part of 1st class passenger carriage 4AA, was recoded 3A in the 1910 recoding then 144B in 1927, when better quality 1st class carriages had been made available. The new wagon had a capacity of three typical vehicles on each deck. In 1960 the wagon was modified to permit roll- on roll-off loading and unloading, and by 1961 a further 21 wagons of the type had entered service. These wagons, which were in length, were built at Newport Workshops and received the code 'AA'. Closed in sides were later added to the wagons. Subsequent bogie modifications saw these wagons recoded to 'AF' in 1961 and then to 'AX' between 1963-1965. Between 1969 and 1972 the underframes were strengthened. Some records mention 'new underframe' in the modifications but observation of the same vehicles much later still showed the extensions that took place when the underframes were used for Swingdoors. The modifications appear to have been new end sills and strengthened centre beams. In the early 1970s, six wagons (2, 8, 9, 11, 17 and 20) were allocated to 'Motorail' service between Melbourne and Mildura on the overnight passenger train. They were painted dark blue with white lettering, to suit the livery of The Vinelander. The other 16 vehicles were on standard gauge in freight motor car traffic between Melbourne and Sydney. With the introduction of Railways of Australia four letter codes in 1979 the class was recoded VMAX (except 8 and 17, as VMAY). In 1980, the Motorail wagons were reclassed to VMAY, bringing this class up to six wagons with as new bogies were fitted to wagons 2, 9, 11 and 20. In 1981 the VMAY wagons were painted in V/Line's tangerine livery. Over the course of 1985 these six wagons were recoded to VMAP series 5-10, though four of the vehicles spent a few months with the short-lived code VMPY. In 1991 the remaining 16 wagons were in storage, and VMAX 7 and VMAX 15 were scrapped in 1993. ==='Long' wagons=== The long motorail wagons were built at either the Newport Workshops or Bendigo Workshops from 1962, to a standard design as agreed with the South Australian and New South Wales Railways. The wagons were much like their shorter counterparts, with roll-on and roll-off ramps and track connectors and skeletal truss sides Twenty-two members of the new class were ordered at first. Wagons 1-8 were delivered as class ALF, but later wagons were fitted with bogie exchange equipment from new. The older wagons were refitted and recoded between 1963-1965. These wagons were all fitted with side sheets. The main traffic was between the car manufacturing plants in capital cities; for example, from the 'Ford' plant in Melbourne to Sydney where cars were then distributed to dealers. The vehicles were fitted with 'Track connectors', which when folded down for loading allowed vehicles to drive from one wagon to another. These 'car trains' were loaded as complete train units.http://www.pjv101.net/cd/pages/c315m.htm The main traffic was between the car manufacturing plants in capital cities; one such run on the standard gauge was from the Ford plant in Melbourne's northern suburb of Upfield, to Sydney where cars were then distributed to dealers. Twenty more motor car transports were built in 1964, and these were known as the MLX, nos. 1-20. They were of a similar design to the ALF/ALX fleet, but with exposed skeletal sides and two parallel sheet steel strips along each side. Each level could take up to five vehicles or six vehicle bodies, depending on the length and method of loading.http://www.pjv101.net/fts/u01/am736.jpg The class was used to transport incomplete Holden cars between Melbourne and Adelaide. In 1967 the class was renumbered to ALX 23 to 42. Around that time all except 30 and 37 were fitted with fluted steel sides.Norm Bray & Peter Vincent, Bogie Freight Wagons of Victoria 1979-1988 - pg127-128 It is likely that 30 and 37 were intended to be fitted as well, and that it simply never happened.http://www.pjv101.net/fts/u01/as485.gif The final batch of ALX's was built in 1969/70, and these completed the number group from ALX 43 to ALX 58. These last wagons were more like the MLX series, but without the two thin metal strips on each side. ALX 26 was damaged in a derailment at Menangle, NSW in 1975 and written off in 1976. High speed trials For a fortnight in 1978, trials were conducted using wagon ALX 46, which was recoded to ALF during the two-week testing (since the ALF code was not being used). The tests were for a new type of high-speed bogie, for use on passenger services. After the testing was completed the wagon was again relettered to ALP 46. On the 29th of March 1979, ALX 58 was reclassed to ALP 58, with the same modifications. In the 1979 recoding, the ALP class became the VMPY class. The 'PY' showed that passenger speed bogies were fitted allowing 115 km/h operation, but that the cars were not gauge convertible. 1979 recoding ALP 58 became VMPY 58 in 1979 and ALP 46 became VMPY 46 in 1982. For a few months in 1985, the class also included four short wagons - VMPY 5-7 and 9 ex VMAY 2, 8, 9, 17, but those were recoded away from the group when the different wagon capacities caused problems with rostering sufficient motorail capacity. The two remaining, longer VMPY wagons were reclassed to VMBP 1 and 2 around the same time. The rest of the long ALX wagons became VMBX 1 - 57, excluding numbers 26, 35 and 46 (and 58). In 1982, VMBX 51 was destroyed at Enfield, New South Wales and written off in 1983. Between 1988 and 1990 the class was recoded to VMBY. The class has seen very little use since because most of the traffic is transported by road. As a result, some of the class were sold interstate, for use between Adelaide and Perth. A number of these wagons were sold to the National Rail Corporation in 1994, and those were reclassed to RMBX in 1994/95 to reflect that change in ownership. ==Car Parts Transport== Aside from the above bogie wagons, there were also the KF and KW four wheel wagons, and the larger BFW/VBCW wagons used for transporting car parts. ==Liveries== The majority of the wagons received the standard Victorian Railways freight livery of wagon red. However, those used in motorail service later received a dark blue with white lettering scheme, then a tangerine scheme with the introduction of VicRail and V/Line. Also, at one point the BFW/VBCW class were labelled with a large Ford logo. ==Model railways== Strath hobbies has released resin kits of various railways' car carrier wagons including codes ALX,http://www.endofthelinehobbies.com.au/search-by- brand/strath/display/53-sar-wagon-kit-strath-sar-alx-car-carrier-skeletal-kit- hohttp://www.endofthelinehobbies.com.au/railway/ho-hon3-hon35-187/australian- rolling-stock/display/53-sar-wagon-kit-strath-sar-alx-car-carrier-skeletal- kit-hohttp://www.endofthelinehobbies.com.au/railway/ho- hon3-hon35-187/australian-rolling-stock/display/52-sar-wagon-kit-strath- sar22-sar-alx-car- carrier-t1%2B2-hohttp://www.endofthelinehobbies.com.au/railway/ho- hon3-hon35-187/australian-rolling-stock/display/313-vr-wagon-kit-strath-vr- alx-ex-mlx-car-carrier-kit-hohttp://www.endofthelinehobbies.com.au/railway/ho- hon3-hon35-187/australian-rolling-stock/display/314-vr-wagon-kit-strath-vr- alx-car-carrier-kit-skeletal- hohttp://www.endofthelinehobbies.com.au/railway/ho-hon3-hon35-187/australian- rolling-stock/display/312-vr-wagon-kit-strath-vr-alx-car-carrier-kit-t1%2B2-ho AMBP,http://www.endofthelinehobbies.com.au/railway/ho- hon3-hon35-187/australian-rolling-stock/display/327-anr%2Fan-wagon-kit-strath- sar24-an-car-carrier-kit-ambp-ho GN/GNX,http://www.endofthelinehobbies.com.au/railway/ho- hon3-hon35-187/australian-rolling-stock/display/316-cr-wagon-kit-strath- cr9-cr-gn%2Fgnx-car-carrier-kit-ho BMX/NMKXhttp://www.endofthelinehobbies.com.au/railway/ho- hon3-hon35-187/australian-rolling-stock/display/330-nswgr-wagon-kits-strath- nsw-bkx-ribbed-sided-car-carrier- hohttp://www.endofthelinehobbies.com.au/railway/ho-hon3-hon35-187/australian- rolling-stock/display/310-nswgr-wagon-kits-strath-nswgr-bkx%2Fnmkx-car- carrier-kit-ho and VMBP,http://www.endofthelinehobbies.com.au/railway/ho- hon3-hon35-187/australian-rolling-stock/display/326-vr-wagon-kit-strath-vr- overland-car-carrier-kit-vmbp-ho retailing for $109.95 each.

Sparked by dissatisfaction with heavy Dutch taxation on them but not the aborigines and extortion by low-ranking Dutch officials and servicemen, the rebellion initially gained ground before being crushed by a coalition of Dutch soldiers and their aboriginal allies. It is considered the most important uprising against the Dutch during the 37-year period of their colonisation of Taiwan. ==Background== The burden of Dutch taxes on the Chinese inhabitants of Taiwan was a source of much resentment. The falling price of venison, a chief export of the island at the time, hit licensed hunters hard, as the cost of the licenses was based on meat prices before the depreciation. The head tax (which only applied to Chinese, not aborigines) was also deeply unpopular, and thirdly, petty corruption amongst Dutch soldiers further angered the Chinese residents.\\" ==Rebellion== The revolt was led by Guo Huaiyi (; 1603–1652), a sugarcane farmer and militia leader originally from Quanzhou known to the Dutch by the name Gouqua Faijit, or Gouqua Faet. After his planning for an insurrection on 17 September 1652 was leaked to the Dutch authorities, he decided to waste no time in attacking Fort Provintia, which at the time was only surrounded by a bamboo wall. On the night of 7 September the rebels, mostly peasants-farmers armed with bamboo spears, stormed the fort. The following morning a company of 120 Dutch musketeers came to the rescue of their trapped countrymen, firing steadily into the besieging rebel forces and breaking them. Governor Nicolas Verburg On 11 September the Dutch learned that the rebels had massed just north of the principal Dutch settlement of Tayouan. Sending a large force of Dutch soldiers and aboriginal warriors, they met the rebels that day in battle and emerged victorious, mainly due to the superior weaponry of the Europeans. Multiple Aboriginal villages in frontier areas rebelled against the Dutch in the 1650s due to oppression like when the Dutch ordered aboriginal women for sex, deer pelts, and rice be given to them from aborigines in the Taipei basin in Wu-lao-wan village which sparked a rebellion in December 1652 at the same time as the Chinese rebellion. The Wu-lao-wan beheaded two Dutch translators, and in a subsequent fight with 30 Wu-lao-wan two Dutch people died, but after an embargo of salt and iron the Wu-lao-wan were forced to sue for peace in February 1653.Shepherd 1993, p. 59. ==Aftermath== Over the following days, the remnants of Guo's army were either slaughtered by aboriginal warriors or melted back into the villages they came from, with Guo Huaiyi himself being shot, then decapitated, with his head displayed on a spike as a warning. In total some 4,000 Chinese were killed during the five-day uprising, approximately 1 in 10 Chinese living in Taiwan at that time. The Dutch responded by reinforcing Fort Provintia (building brick walls instead of the previous bamboo fence) and by monitoring Chinese settlers more closely. However, they did not address the roots of the concerns which had caused the Chinese to rebel in the first place. However, the Taiwanese Aboriginal tribes who were previously allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652 turned against the Dutch during the later Siege of Fort Zeelandia and defected to Koxinga's Chinese forces. The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty; they proceeded to work for the Chinese and behead Dutch people in executions. The frontier aborigines in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on 17 May 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under Dutch rule by hunting down and beheading Dutch people and destroying their Christian school textbooks. ==References== Category:Dutch Formosa Category:Peasant revolts Category:1652 in Asia Category:Conflicts in 1652 Category:17th-century rebellions Category:17th century in Taiwan Category:Wars involving the Netherlands Category:1652 in Taiwan ","title":"Guo Huaiyi rebellion"},{"id":"19269761","text":"Golden Flake Snack Foods, is a producer of potato chips, tortilla chips, corn chips, cheese curls, fried pork skins, and other snack foods in the southern United States.

It was written by Larry McClurg and the Mind Garage while staying at Valley View Farm along the South Branch Potomac River in Romney, West Virginia. ==Different versions== Originally the song was recorded in 1968 as a demo in Glenn Cambell Studio in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. John Vaughan played lead guitar on a Gibson Firebird electric guitar. Norris Lytton played a 4 string Hagstrom bass. After nearly 40 years, in 2006, that version of Circus Farm was released on a CD titled \\"Mind Garage Early Years\\" ( alternately titled \\"A Total Electric Happening\\" Morning Glori Music ) A second version was recorded in 1969 for \\"Mind Garage Again/The Electric Liturgy\\", RCA Victor LSP-4319 in Nashville at RCA's \\"Nashville Sound\\" Studio A, on Music Row. But this time without Vaughan's Firebird electric guitar. Instead Jack Bond, used Chet Atkins' custom Martin acoustic guitar and a Leslie tone cabinet and Lytton used an 8 string Hagstrom bass guitar which produced a dramatic change in the sound. Ted Smith played a Slingerland drum set on the 1968 version and a Premier custom made chome drum set with double bass drums on the 1969 versions. ==Composition background== The upper porch of the houseHouse at Valley View at Valley View Farm overlooks a part of the valley with a wide view of the sky, which inspired the lyrics \\"Sky of blue May come my way\\".Circus Farm lyrics A circus can be a wild array of noisy disorder.

Romney was settled in 1725 by British colonial hunters and traders, but by the 1750s the residents were engaged in French and Indian War. In the 1780s, during the American Revolution, former Hessian prisoners built homes there. Valley View Farm itself was built in 1855. In the 1860s during the American Civil War the town changed hands between Confederate and Union armies an amazing 56 times.

From there he fled to Denmark in 1945, where he attended the University of Århus from 1947, where he studied history, Latin and German. He concentrated on the history of Northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, and his main work was about the Norwegian Jesuit Laurentius Nicolai, who tried to re-catholicize Scandinavia. He also has written an extensive survey about the Jesuits in Tartu and had studied the history of Scandinavian students in Southern European universities from 1536 to 1864. He is also interested in Danish-Estonian contacts, especially in the 16th Century, and also during the Estonian War of Independence. Helk's main works are written in German or Danish and some of them are also translated to Estonian. Helk worked for over 30 years (1959–1990) in the Danish National Archives, where he was leader of the 4th section from 1970 to 1990, and in 1978–1979 he was the deputy main archivist of Denmark.

Formally, where d is a nonzero vector and \\\\d\\\\_0 denotes its number of nonzero coefficients. If all the columns are linearly independent, \\\\mathrm{spark}(A) is usually defined to be \\\\infty. By contrast, the rank of a matrix is the largest number k such that some set of k columns of A is linearly independent. ==Example== Consider the following matrix A. A= \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 & 0 & 2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 & 0 & 3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & -3 & 4 \\\\end{bmatrix} The spark of this matrix equals 3 because: * There is no set of 1 column of A which are linearly dependent. * There is no set of 2 columns of A which are linearly dependent. * But there is a set of 3 columns of A which are linearly dependent. The first three columns are linearly dependent because \\\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\\\\\\\\\1\\\\\\\\\\\\1\\\\\\\\\\\\1\\\\end{pmatrix} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\\\\\\\\\2\\\\\\\\\\\\2\\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\end{pmatrix} + \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\-3\\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\end{pmatrix}. ==Properties== If n\\\\leq m , the following simple properties hold for the spark of a m \\\\times n matrix A: *\\\\mathrm{spark}(A) = n+1 \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\mathrm{rank}(A) = n (the spark equals n+1 if and only if the matrix has full rank) *\\\\mathrm{spark}(A) = 1 if and only if the matrix has a zero column *If \\\\mathrm{spark}(A) eq n+1 , then \\\\mathrm{spark}(A) \\\\le \\\\mathrm{rank}(A) + 1 ==Criterion for uniqueness of sparse solutions== The spark yields a simple criterion for uniqueness of sparse solutions of linear equation systems. Given a linear equation system A\\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\mathbf{b}. If this system has a solution \\\\mathbf{x} that satisfies \\\\\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\_{0} < \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{spark}(A)}{2}, then this solution is the sparsest possible solution. Here \\\\\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\_{0} denotes the number of nonzero entries of the vector \\\\mathbf{x}. ==Lower bound in terms of dictionary coherence== If the columns of the matrix A are normalized to unit norm, we can lower bound the spark of the matrix in terms of the dictionary coherence: :\\\\mathrm{spark}(A) \\\\ge 1+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu(A)} The dictionary coherence \\\\mu(A) is defined as the maximum correlation between any two columns, i.e. :\\\\mu(A)=\\\\max_{m eq n} \\\\langle a_m,a_n \\\\rangle . ==Applications== The minimum distance of a linear code equals the spark of its parity-check matrix. The concept of the spark is also of use in the theory of compressive sensing, where requirements on the spark of the measurement matrix are used to ensure stability and consistency of various estimation techniques. It is also known in matroid theory as the girth of the vector matroid associated with the columns of the matrix. The spark of a matrix is NP-hard to compute. == References == Category:Signal processing Category:Matrix theory ","title":"Spark (mathematics)"},{"id":"19270272","text":"This is a list of Double the Fist episodes. ==Series 1 Episode 1: Vertical Challenge === In this first episode, Steve challenges the Fist team to abseil down a cliff - without any ropes or means of suspension. Mephisto decides to construct a batsuit to glide safely down; he fails due to a lack of updrafts. Rod decides his strategy will be to jump the distance from the top of the cliff to the water; however, that distance is about 2 metres longer than the world record long jump, and even though Rod has his legs waxed in order to reduce air resistance, he fails. The Womp tests several strategies by throwing watermelons off the cliff, but every watermelon splats on the ground; he eventually succeeds by wrapping himself in over 900m of Bubble Wrap. First aired 21 May 2004. === Episode 2: Extreme Makeover === Steve challenges the Fist team to improve the lifestyles of some weak viewers. Womp is assigned a kid, Rod is assigned an old lady, and Mephisto is assigned a mediocre magician. To test the fistworthiness of the subjects at the end, they will have to get on a luge and do a jump over a ramp. The jumps of the kid and old lady end disastrously. The magician decides he will do his jump in a bag (tied up), in a locker on wheels that is chained and padlocked, which is on fire; this also ends in disaster as the fire warps the metal and is unable to roll (as told by Mephisto). The magician burns to death, but wins as he put himself in mortal danger (i.e., a position where he couldn't get out of). This episode includes Mephisto's thoughts on vegetarians and Rod teaching his elderly lady a very painful way to drink tea. First aired 28 May 2004. === Episode 3: Fistathlon === Steve pits the Fist team against each other in attempt to make sport more fistworthy. The first sport is golf; each contestant tees off as usual in a game of golf, but Panda is hidden somewhere on the course, armed with a Glock. Panda eliminates Rod and Womp (after teaching Womp to hit the ball off the tee) before they can get their ball into the hole; Mephisto then kills Panda with a knife. Mephisto triumphantly drops his ball into the hole, but does not receive any points because he was supposed to hit it in. The second game is clay pigeon shooting: each contestant is charged with making what Steve thinks is a boring sport into something more exciting. Womp decides to vary the angle at which the clay pigeons are launched, but some of them end up being directed at him, and he is pelted by them. Rodd decides to have targets that shoot back, and is killed by one. Mephisto decides that he will be launched (by catapult) as he attempts to shoot at a stationary clay pigeon on the ground; however, he shoots too late and misses. No one receives any points. Several more events are briefly summarized, including \\"Breast Stroke\\" (stroking a strangers breasts) bowling, the \\"fire sprint\\" (which resulted in all of the contestants exploding), and the smorgasbord event, which Womp won by eating 17 courses. The final challenge is a 'steeple chase', a run along the highway, over a space/time vortex, and through a \\"trap canyon\\" (basically a maze full of trapdoors, swinging blades, and spikes). The Womp gets off to a slow start and falls into the vortex; because the vortex transports him 5 minutes back in time, it effectively clones him. Womp falls in several times, so there end up being quite a few clones of him. Mephisto and Rod reach the trap canyon first, but are both quickly dispatched by it. The Womps get to the trap canyon, and by sheer numbers, one manages to get to the end. The Womp is declared the overall winner of the Fistahlon, and is granted the privilege of climbing \\"Mount Fistus\\" (a nondescript hill). This episode also divulges Mephisto's hatred of road safety campaigns and could be the first appearance of Blue Womp. The special features on the DVD of season 1 reveal that another sport, sprinting, was intended to be satired; however, there was a significant pyrotechnic mishap and the scene had to be cut. First aired 4 June 2004. === Episode 4: Fear Factory === Reality television comes under fire this week, as Steve pits the Fist team and some guests against each other inside the world's most deadly factory. This episode includes Ugly Dave Gray as well as Yvonne Strahovski as competitors in the contest, Womp and Blue Womp arguing about cookery, shark-like creatures flying through the air and eating people, and Rod fighting evil flying furniture. During this episode, Mephisto gets possessed by an ancient Aztec demi-god, steals Steve's car, and disappears from the show until episode 6. First aired 11 June 2004. === Episode 5: High School Challenge === In this episode, the Fist Team competes with some highschoolers in various challenges. Each challenge is worth 1 point. The team with the most points at the end is deemed the most fistworthy. Among the challenges were: * Library Search: the teams were given the task of finding a golden key hidden in a book in the library. They were only given one clue. The Fist Team won by stealing the golden key after the high schoolers found it. * Egg protection: Each team had to protect an egg from being smashed by Panda's cricket bat. The highschoolers made a contraption to protect it from high falls, and then dropped it off the side of the building, dissuading Panda from smashing it. The Fist Team quarrelled, so their strategy ended up being Blue Womp trying (and failing) to protect the egg with his body. * Mathematics Challenge: One designated player on each team (Rod for the Fist Team, and Emily for the High School Team) lies head-first on a skateboard, which is attached to a long rope, such that it can be dragged towards an operating lawn-mower. Steve asks the teams numerical questions, and the amount by which they are incorrect is translated into the distance the skateboards are drawn forward (much like Cliff Hangers from The Price Is Right). The Fist Team came from behind to win after the High School team incorrectly guessed Steve's weight, and Emily's head was pulverised. * History challenge (worth double points): The two teams were given the task of recreating the Gallipoli landing from World War I, with the two teams playing the ANZACs and the rest of the school students playing the Turkish forces. Showing favouritism, the rest of the school students refused to attack their friends, attacking only the Fist Team; however, this backfired for the school students, because by getting massacred, the Fist Team's more accurately recreated the actual outcome at Gallipoli. At the end of the episode, the Fist Team was the overall winner, 4-1. Also, Steve became frustrated with Blue Womp, and after beating him violently, forbade him from ever appearing again. (He did reappear in the final episode of the season, but only to be shot in the head with a cannon). First aired 18 June 2004. === Episode 6: Bush Bash === The episode begins with Steve deriding the ability of nonviolent protestors to ever accomplish anything. He then announces that there is a major logging operation taking place in a forest in Australia, and gives the fist team the assignment of stopping it; whoever eliminates the most loggers will have won. After several misadventures, the Womp, Rod, and Tina T manage to reach the main site of the logging operation, where it is revealed that Mephisto, possessed by an Aztec demigod is cloning pandas in a giant pyramid. The Womp pokes Mephisto in the eye, detaching the demigod from him. The dazed Mephisto orders the pandas to stop logging. Steve says that because Mephisto stopped the most loggers, he won the challenge. First aired 25 June 2004. === Episode 7: Terrorism === This episode is slightly different from the others - it does not feature any of the recurring segments, and instead plays as a story. Steve challenges the team to stop a mysterious terrorist group, but when they are all taken hostage, it's up to Steve to save the day - and it turns out the head terrorist has a grudge against him. The split-screen effects and timers used throughout the episode are clear homages to the TV series 24. The action-packed ending and particularly the ending credits are a parody of the 1998 film Armageddon. First aired 9 July 2004. The title \\"Terrorism\\" is often given to the episode by TV guides, but throughout the episode itself it is called \\"Episode 7\\". === Episode 8: Special Edition === This is a prank clip show episode, featuring previews for upcoming, and non-existent, episodes. It also has supposedly behind-the-scenes footage, expanded back stories for the characters, and some other miscellaneous clips like a music video featuring Rod Foxx on lead vocals. Steve claims on the website that he had a plan for a different episode, but ABC wouldn't let him broadcast it, so he had to throw together the \\"special edition\\" at the last minute. The false previews for the next eight episodes were paid off when they pretended the ABC had cancelled the series and faked being taken off air with two minutes left to go, with an intentionally bad replacement, Town and Country, being shown for the remainder of the time slot. First aired 16 July 2004. === Extra Special Edition === This DVD exclusive episode continues the prank clip show episode theme from Episode 8, which also features previews for upcoming, and non-existent, episodes. Letter of the Weak also touched upon the use of special effects in the show. (Apparently not only just for spectacular stunts, but for everything else as well.) The episode also features audition tapes from various members of the public who deem themselves fistworthy. One such tape came from Bill Karas who, according to Steve Foxx, originally had his own segments in the series which were barred from broadcast by the ABC. The segment titled \\"Fist Boy\\" had Karas take on fast food restaurant chain McDonald's for slaughtering billions of friendly cows and not giving back to the cow community by buying all their stock. The Womp's sexuality towards Steve Foxx is also questioned. The Episode ends with a rant from Steve Foxx regarding his difficulty with the ABC cancelling the show in favour of BBC Costume dramas and concludes with Steve kicking out the ABC camera crew from his house with whom he was dissatisfied in the first place. This episode has not aired on TV and is featured on the Series One volume Two DVD. ==Series 2 Episode 9: Beat The House === Steve returns to Earth (chronologically after Episode 7) to find four years have passed and weakness is at an all-time high. He encounters a pair of medieval re-enactors upon landing, and beats them up when they ask that he join them as their leader. He then sets out to find his team: Rod is spying on gymnastics performers, Mephisto is guarding a blood bank (but some vampires have him in their pocket), Womp is being crushed by cars at a derby and Panda is in a zoo. With his team reassembled, Steve tells his plan: to create the ultimate fistworthy base to eradicate weakness, particularly that of the Medieval Re-enactors, from the face of the Earth. For this, they will need $1,000,000. He has a plan: the Fist Team's new target is gambling- not gambling itself, but the losers. He plans to beat the house in the most fistworthy way imaginable: steal it. For his plan, Rod will impersonate a famous hypnotist while Panda will be his 'lovely assistant'; Womp will pretend to be a famous professional gambler and provide a distraction while Mephisto will pretend to be a guard, allowing to sneak in a vampire friend (who will not show up on the security cameras). It does not go as planned. Womp is caught up in his surprising success in gambling and does not fake a heart attack, prompting Steve to knock him out. Mephisto takes Womp down to the vault but Rod puts him to sleep due to a misunderstanding, and the vampire gets to Womp. They both then go on a rampage, causing security to lock everything down. Panda, meanwhile, has fallen in love with a mime. Rod and Mephisto barely escape, but Vampire Womp is disintegrated when he steps into the sunlight. Luckily, Steve managed to chain all the pokie machines to the prize car in the chaos and drives off with exactly $1,000,000. Due to stuffing up the least and not being disintegrated, Rod is given the new title 'Man of Fist'. === Episode 10: Council Smash=== With the money acquired in the previous episode, the Fist Team (including Womp, who is both no longer a vampire and no longer dead) and the \\"competition winners,\\" members of the public who joined the Fist Team through a competition but who are effectively kept by Steve as slave labour, set up in Prawn World, a dilapidated theme park in the bush with a giant prawn as its advertising mascot. Representatives of the council arrives to evict the Fist Team, and Steve immediately orders his team to take them down. A battle time is set for the following morning, when the council returns to evict them. Rod is sent to the council offices, to take on the mayor (a humanoid mutant who is seen to devour a baby in a single mouthful) directly. However, in doing so he comes face-to-face with the mayor's secret weapon, Tara, a beautiful and deadly assassin who, when inactive, morphs into a vending machine controlled by special tokens. Mephisto remains at Prawn World and angers Steve with his convoluted plan involving the wearing of tin-foil hats, telling him to use more force. The council arrives and the battle begins, and the council gains the upper hand. After disappointing Steve and being sent to a shed for time-out, a dejected Womp speaks with his subconscious, which instills in him the confidence he needs to reclaim his position in the fight (and causes him to grow antlers). Womp returns and helps to win the fight. Steve gives his brother Rod the 'Man of Fist' award, despite Rod being almost killed in an epic fight against Tara and contributing very little else to the battle. === Episode 11: Fist Furniture === Steve decides that comfort is the root of all weakness, so he designs a collection of fistworthy furniture (which offers pain rather than comfort) and sends the team out to destroy Steve's main competition, Vard'e furniture. Although he was not rewarded with Man of Fist in the previous episode, Steve recognises Womp's new-found confidence (and antlers) and allows him to lead the expedition. However, after orchestrating a loss in a non-contact capoeira fight at Vard'e headquarters, Womp loses his antlers and reverts to his original self. The team returns and battles valiantly, but Steve ultimately acquires Tara's jar of tokens and takes control of the assassin. She is sent into battle and saves the day, winning the Man of Fist award. Meanwhile, Panda's ongoing relationship with the mime from Episode 9 continues to anger Steve. === Episode 12: Double Dragon === Steve's fist furniture does not sell as well as Steve had hoped. Worse, the website is hacked, and is replaced with a weak website mocking Steve. Steve sends the Fist Team out to find out who has taken over the website. The team traces a physical computer cable through the streets and locates an Internet Cafe populated by medieval re-enactors, still angry about Steve's treatment of them in Episode 9. They inform the team that the website (manifested as an enormous, purple monster) has broken free and cannot be contained. The Fist Team begins to battle, but is quickly short of numbers: verbal abuse from Womp has rendered Tara useless, and Mephisto is accosted by medieval re-creationists who ask him to be their leader against Steve -- Mephisto considers this, and, in an ostensible betrayal of Steve, agrees to the proposal and does not tell Steve. So it is left to Rod to defeat the website. He succeeds, but is attacked by a smaller tendril of the site, which takes a chunk of hair from the back of his head, leaving Rod shocked and lacking confidence. The team returns victorious to Prawn World. Meanwhile, all manner of chaos has broken loose at Prawn World. Buyers are cancelling their orders of Fist Furniture, and Steve vents all of his frustration on the Mime, whose relationship with Panda and whose weak refusal to ever speak he has never approved of. Steve sets upon the Mime, physically attacking him while shouting \\"Speak! Speak!\\". The Mime, so committed to his act, tries to write Steve a note to communicate, but Steve angrily crumples it and devises a new plan. He leaves Panda a message, ostensibly from the Mime, to meet him in the field; he then sets up a bouquet of flowers booby-trapped with a shotgun, and forces the Mime to watch from afar, so that the only way to save Panda was to shout out. However, the plan backfires, and the Mime does not speak; Panda's head is blown off, the Mime hangs himself, and the viewer sees the partially crumpled note that the Mime tried to give Steve: \\"I am mute.\\" A broken Steve is met by the returning Fist Team, and he gives Panda a posthumous 'Man of Fist'. === Episode 13: House Party Challenge=== Steve, still shattered from Panda's death, wanders off into the bush. Rod immediately assumes control, and organises a house party. Rod is still reeling from the loss of his hair in the battle against the website, and he hopes to regain his confidence by donning a wig and picking up (and most likely date-raping) several girls at the party. He also harbours a grudge against Womp, whose poor effort in the fight against the website he partially blames for the loss of his hair, so he tells Womp that the house party is a challenge, and whoever picks up the fewest girls is kicked out of the Fist Team. At the party, Womp lets the competition winners go free, believing their leader that they will return. Mephisto encounters a couple of medieval re-enactors, furthering his relationship with them. Rod, meanwhile, performs reasonably well with the ladies before losing his wig, revealing his bloodied scalp and turning them off. He tries to rectify the situation by calling on Tara, telling her that her mission is to sleep with him; she initially refuses, however he destroys her tokens in an accident, which effectively kills her at the end of her mission, so she vengefully completes her mission as violently as possible, as Rod vainly attempts to apologise. Meanwhile, Steve comes across a tribe of overweight men living in the bush. He immediately proclaims them to be weak, but they tell him that the strongest thing a man can do is cry in front of another man, and eventually win him over. The men have a celebratory feast to initiate their newest member, but when Steve realises that both the food and the skin he was to wear as an initiation ritual came from Panda, he goes blind with rage, killing the entire tribe. He returns to Prawn World with a renewed focus to take over the world and use his power to destroy weakness, and declares himself the 'Man of Fist'. === Episode 14: Ultimate Weapon === Steve makes the Double the Fist Team climb a mountain where he was trained as a child to collect the \\"Ultimate Weapon.\\" However, he causes the others (not including Womp) to become frightened when he does not give them parachutes to jump out the plane. He and Rod end up in a struggle and Rod's flare goes off, and the plane crashes. Womp rushes to Steve's rescue to find him disoriented, and expecting him to be carried to the top of the mountain. Meanwhile, Mephisto (who landed safely) has gone to town and finds that all he must do is take a chairlift to get to the top. He goes up and finds that all he has to do to get into the Castle which contains the Ultimate Weapon is cross a bridge, which he finds is guarded by a highly skilled guard. Rod arrives to find Steve and tries to steal his glasses. Steve is infuriated and disowns him, making Rod run off ashamed (and imagine he has discovered terrorists). And so, Womp and Steve end up in a swirling chasm which keeps the world moving. Steve urges Womp to give up or go on without him. Womp insults Steve until he miraculously recovers from his injuries and lack of fistworthiness, and Steve rewards him with the 'Man of Fist' award. Meanwhile, during Mephisto's battle with the guard, a piece of the bridge is broken off and is lodged in the side of the swirling chasm, thus stopping Earth from rotating and nullifying gravity. This allows Womp and Steve to be lifted from the chasm, while Mephisto discovers that the monks have let the guard believe that dolphins (his favorite animal, despite the fact that he has never seen one) are extinct due to the ocean filling with sand. Showing him a picture of a dolphin he caught whilst fishing, Mephisto brings the guard onto the side of the fist. The Fist Team enters the Castle and do battle with the monks (failing miserably) while Womp goes underground to find the Ultimate Weapon. He discovers it to be guarded by two twins guards (Shane Dundas of the Umbilical Brothers), one who always tells the truth, and one who always lies. After a lengthy conversation, Womp causes the truthful guard to lie and the untruthful guard to be truthful, which causes them to explode. Womp collects the Ultimate Weapon (a chainsaw known as the Timesaw) and Steve defeats the peaceful monks by majestically tossing a flower at the leader. They all flee the collapsing castle, except for Womp who is buried alive, but digs himself free. As the episode ends, Rod imagines himself releasing a new record and becoming a huge sensation as he freezes to death. === Episode 15: TimeSaw === The Fist Team now possesses the TimeSaw, which can be used to cut holes in the time continuum, allowing them to travel through time. The Fist team goes through time to test its capabilities. During this, Rod has the rest of his hair blown off in a fight with a Futuristic Defence Force and goes insane. After this, the team goes back in time to an hour before James Cook officially discovered Australia. The purpose here is that the team will stop the unfistworthy English from settling Australia, allowing the Fist Team to guide Australia to a fistworthy future. After a long preparation, in which Mephisto builds a highly advanced catapult (which Steve criticises for being based on something too old). They and some modern day aboriginals use all their weapons to attack Cook, whose ships are fitted with futuristic laser cannons. Steve sends Womp into the future with the TimeSaw to collect some future weapons for them to even up the fight. However, Womp, to his horror, finds that the future Australia is a living nightmare in which Steve rules with an iron fist and punishes weakness by death, and in which street crime abounds but is tolerated because it is fistworthy. Womp also comes to see that he has been killed and that his Man of Fist photograph from the previous episode is being used as the personification of weakness. He is pursued by Steve's Fist Patrol for \\"being a Womp impersonator\\", but is saved by rebels. The rebels give Womp a rifle, and instruct him to kill Steve before he can \\"defeat King James in the Great Battle\\". Meanwhile, Rod, who is a whimpering, cloaked mess without his hair, has followed Womp into the future. He steals the TimeSaw from Womp to go back to when he lost his hair fighting the rogue website; however, by saving his hair, he creates a paradox, whereby saving his hair negates the future Rod returning to save his hair. Eventually, a limousine appears, and a mystical Rod informs the real Rod that his power came not from the hair on his head, but from his pubic hair. Rod then returns to the future, and he and Womp return to 1770. Back in 1770, Steve steals Cook's flag and prevents Australia from being discovered, but Cook simply begins the creation of a new one from undergarments. Soon enough, Cook tires of Steve's predatorial tactics, and challenges him to a face off (much to Steve's annoyance, he means Chess, albeit a futuristic 3D Chess with Cluedo weapons). Steve is beaten horribly in it, so resorts to violence again. Rod helps Steve gain the upper hand over the English, while Womp sets up his sniper rifle. In two minds about whether to help or protect Steve, Womp reluctantly takes aim at Steve, but averts his eyes and shoots Cook. Womp is awarded 'Man of Fist' for the second time in a row, and Steve finishes Cook by planting his own Fistworthy flag in the ground (through his neck). Mephisto, when using his catapult, was transported back to prehistoric times, and remains there at the end of the episode. === Episode 16: The Great Battle === Mephisto, having survived since prehistoric times without ageing, is released in the present to be crowned King James by the waiting medieval re-enactors, plus Ballistic Man (the guard from Ultimate Weapon) and some Imperial Stormtroopers. The rest of the team arrives in the Fist Mobile, and Steve smashes the TimeSaw with a lightsaber. Steve is infuriated at Mephisto's betrayal, and threatens to kill him right then and there, but is stopped when Mephisto suggests that he is too scared to fight his entire army. Womp drugs Steve and attempts to smother him, but just can't do it. Meanwhile, Steve has a flashback: years ago, when Steve was just a boy forcing his younger brother Rod to do idiotic stunts, Rod came upon Steve's signature glasses in a sewer pipe. Steve quickly stole them, and claimed that he found them, and thus was taken in by the Mystical Monks, as seen in Ultimate Weapon. Rod arrives to discover Steve without his glasses and they correctly conclude that Womp stole them. Rod pursues Womp as he gives the glasses to Mephisto, giving him near God-like strength. Steve is visited by the ghosts of Panda and the Mime, who tell him that they respect the fact that he killed them for what he believed in. To show their respect, they give Steve his own army, composed entirely of the many Fist Branches. Meanwhile, Rod is ecstatic to find Tara in vending machine form. He hotwires her and brings her back to life, resulting in him getting beaten up, then kissed. Tara realises that, by not relying upon tokens, Rod has given her freedom. Mephisto instructs the re-enactors to use actual weapons and the titular Great Battle begins. Ballistic Man battles Rod and gains the upper hand, but Tara, realising that fighting is in her nature, returns to assist. After Mephisto severely beats Steve, he plans on crushing him with a massive prawn statue. For a brief moment, the statue appears as a Dolphin, and having filled his greatest desire, Ballistic Man disintegrates, however he has delivered the finishing blow to Tara. Rod laments, then accidentally presses the sidekick button on the vending machine and sets her free in the form of a loveable little girl, who is almost immediately killed while skipping through the battlefield (though like all deaths on the show, whether she is actually dead is unlikely). It is then that Mephisto's plan is revealed: acting loyally upon Steve's orders from the very beginning of the series, he remained committed to killing the medieval re-enactors; however, his plan was to do so by becoming their king, killing Steve to gain their trust, then after four years, poisoning them all on an island. Womp protests Steve's death, but is bullied into standing aside. Womp then sees Steve appear to say \\"I love you\\" and whacks Mephisto in the back and sends the glasses flying onto Steve's face. Mephisto is defeated and the Fist Team is victorious. Steve awards Rod the Full Fist for offering to kill all the re- enactors by himself when Steve's glasses were stolen, and Mephisto gains the Double Fist and the 'Man of Fist' for his amazing (if misguided) efforts and loyalty. Womp, however is shot in the head for being weak and being pushed around. The dystopian future is set exactly as Womp viewed it in the previous episode, and Steve, Rod and Mephisto fly into the sky.

Once Tapas and Satabdi tie the knot, Firdaus and Rachana spend their time singing around trees in Bengal and Bangladesh. Things go from bad to worse in the second half. Tragedy strikes Tapas- Satabdi's haven as her in-laws think the new bride is evil personified, shattering the rosy dreams of the newlyweds as well as the lovebirds. Well, that's reason enough for the sisters to start sobbing non-stop. When they need a break, they mouth pathetic dialogues. The brothers, meanwhile, drown their sorrows in vodka bottles at night, singing sad songs (Jodi na paro bhalobashte amay tobe morey jabo aami!). By day though, Firdaus is fighting fit to beat the baddies to pulp. And just when you thought it was curtain call time with an all's-well-that-ends-well scene, there's more melodrama and more tears in store. In true 70's style, a pregnant Satabdi is then kidnapped by the villain's men and tied to a revolving bed! More fights follow before the family gets together for the final photo op.

He departed Melbourne on HMAT Geelong on 17 September 1914 and commenced training at Mena camp in Egypt in early 1915. Whilst in training, he faced a court martial proceeding on 23 February 1915 for not returning to camp on time from granted leave. He noted in his defence that he overstayed his leave by reason of falling asleep whilst in town. Ogilvie was sentenced to reduction to ranks. The 12th battalion was mobilised and participated in the ANZAC landing at Gallipoli. Ogilvie quickly regained rank, being promoted again to corporal, then second lieutenant by 10 July 1915.Australian Imperial Force: Appointments, Promotions, etc.: 12th Battalion: To be 2nd Lieutenants (Date of effect: 10 July 1915), Commonwealth of Australian Gazette, No.140, (Thursday, 11 November 1915), p.2900. ==Death== In August the 12th Battalion contributed two companies to the attack on Lone Pine. It was here that Ogilvie sustained a severe gunshot wound to the right eye on 7 August 1915. Ogilvie’s condition was noted as dangerously ill and on 12 August 1915 he was shipped on the Hospital Transport Dunluce Castle to the Auberge de Baviere hospital in Valletta, Malta.

The party was suppressed in Francoist Spain and was not revived when democracy returned to Spain in the late 1970s. ==History== The party had its origins in a split in Partit d'Unió Republicana Autonomista (Republican Autonomous Union Party), over disagreements on political strategy. The new organization promoted the idea of one confederation of Catalan speaking regions, which resulted in moves towards a merger with Esquerra Republicana del País Valencià (Republican Left of the Valencian Country), which were initially proposed by Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (Republican Left of Catalonia) in 1933 in Castellón. The merger eventually took place in 1935 under the direction of personalities like Gaietà Huguet (ERPV ex-militant), Vicent Marco Miranda (ex- mayor of València), Josep Benedito, Miquel Duran de València and Manuel Sanchis-Guarner. Between 1935 and 1939, when the party was banned, eventually vanishing, it is difficult to distinguish between the history of ERPV and EV. After obtaining the election of Vicent Marco in 1936 in Valencia as part of the Frente Popular (Popular Front) list, ERC and EV formed a joint parliamentary group in the Spanish Congress under the name of Esquerra Catalana (Catalan Left). However, the Spanish Civil War halted various political projects in which EV had participated, the most important of which was a proposal for a Valencian statute of autonomy, under the official name of País Valencià \\"Valencian Community\\". During the Civil war, EV's membership peaked at around 10,000 members in 1937.Sanchis i Llàcer, Vicent (2012). Valencians, encara. Cinquanta anys després de Joan Fuster.

Police statistics released in the year 2016 suggested 33,608 criminal cases from a population of more than five and a half million, with most of them being cybercrimes. Between the years 2014 and 2015, there was an observed statistical decrease in violent or serious property offenses, housebreaking, theft, and unlicensed moneylending harassment. As suggested by foreign travel advisory from the United Kingdom, petty crime such as pickpocketing and street theft are extremely rare in Singapore. Violent crime is also deemed as extremely rare and almost non-existent. Threats of terrorism remain a major concern, as is the case with most developed countries. As a constant reminder from consulars to possible drug traffickers such as the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, penalties for drug offences such as trafficking in Singapore remain severe and include capital punishment for certain cases of possession. ==Sex trafficking== Sex trafficking in Singapore is a significant problem. Singaporean and foreign women and girls have been forced into prostitution in brothels and been physically and psychologically abused. ==Online fraud== E-commerce cheating cases increased by about 30 per cent between 2014 and 2015. Noted concerns as of 2016 may also include impersonation and employment scams. However, there was a noteworthy increase in awareness about online scams in 2015. From just 66 credit-for-sex scams in 2014, the number increased to 1,203 within 2015, with the reported victims being cheated a total of around S$2.9 million. The largest amount of money scammed include S$74,000 in a single case. A fraud syndicate was busted in China during December 2015 when a total of 43 were arrested from scams operated from WeChat call centres in China. As of 2016, the greatest domestic vice concern remains as commercial offences over the Internet, with a 47 percent increase between 2014 and 2015. ==Crime rate between Singaporeans and foreigners== In December 2013, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong stated, \\"their (foreign workers) crime rates are, in fact, lower than Singaporeans in general.\\" In January 2014 Mrs. Lina Chiam of Singapore People's Party asked in Parliament, the breakdown of crimes committed by Singaporeans, permanent residents and foreigners respectively between 2009 and 2013. Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean replied that during the period, more than 18,000 persons were arrested each year, of which 20% were foreigners with an arrest rate of 272 per 100,000 foreigners, while the arrest rate for residents was 385 per 100,000 residents. No breakdown between Singaporeans and permanent residents was given. ==Crime deterrence== The National Crime Prevention Council of Singapore maintains a web portal Scam Alert that offers scam prevention campaign posters and also encourages victims to come forward to share their stories.

Ljajić began his career with FK Jošanica, and later Partizan, with whom he made his debut in the Serbian SuperLiga and UEFA Champions League. In January 2010, he was set to join England's Manchester United, but the club withdrew its option to sign him in December 2009. Instead, he joined Fiorentina for a reported fee of around €8 million in January 2010. In August 2013, after three years in Florence, Ljajić joined Roma for an €11 million fee, signing a four-year contract. In July 2016, he was sold to Torino. Ljajić made his senior international debut for Serbia in 2010. From 2012 to 2014, he was frozen out of the team by manager Siniša Mihajlović for objecting to singing the Serbian national anthem. He was part of the Serbian squad at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. ==Club careerPartizan=== Born in Novi Pazar in the Serbian region of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Ljajić joined Partizan at age 14 in 2005, signing from Serbian lower tier club FK Jošanica. Ljajić was the first player to wear the number 22 for Partizan after Saša Ilić transferred to Galatasaray in 2005. Ljajić made an appearance for Partizan in the first leg of the second qualifying round of the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League on 29 July 2008 as a second-half substitute.UEFA Champions League – Fixtures & Results He made a second substitute appearance in the second leg and another substitute appearance in the second leg of the third qualifying round. He scored his first competitive goal for Partizan on 23 November 2008 in a league match against OFK Beograd. In October 2008, Manchester United had given Ljajić a trial, although no information was given about the length of the trial initially. On 2 January 2009, Manchester United announced the signings of both Ljajić and his Partizan teammate, Zoran Tošić. Tošić would join the club immediately while Ljajić would remain at Partizan for the remainder of 2009, joining United in January 2010. Despite being unable to officially join the club until January 2010, Ljajić made regular trips to Manchester throughout 2009 to train with the United first team, so the club's coaches could monitor his progress. However, United decided not to take up their option to sign Ljajić due to issues surrounding the club's application for a work permit. Following the transfer's collapse, Partizan manager Goran Stevanović claimed the situation had put Ljajić into \\"psychological shock\\" but that Ljajić was \\"handling the situation well\\". Partizan director of football Ivan Tomić said, \\"I think that they will regret this decision in future.\\" ===Fiorentina=== Ljajić playing for Fiorentina On 13 January 2010, Italian Serie A club Fiorentina announced the signing of Ljajić. After passing a medical, Ljajić signed a five-year contract, with Partizan receiving a reported fee of €8 million for the player. Ljajić made his debut in Fiorentina's 2–2 draw away to Cagliari on 31 January 2010, coming on as an 82nd-minute substitute for Manuel Pasqual. However, his first half-season at the club under head coach Cesare Prandelli was spent settling into the new surroundings. The arrival of Ljajić's compatriot Siniša Mihajlović as head coach saw increased first-team opportunities for Ljajić. He scored his first Viola goal from the penalty spot against Lazio on 18 September 2010, which Fiorentina lost 1–2. On 2 May 2012, Ljajić was substituted in a match against Novara. His reaction to this substitution was to sarcastically applaud the manager Delio Rossi, who grabbed and attempted to punch Ljajić. Fiorentina announced after the match that Rossi had been dismissed as manager and that they would take proportionate measures against Ljajić. Ljajić's teammate Valon Behrami, who was on the substitutes' bench at the time of the incident, said no one, including him, had heard Ljajić insult Rossi, which disproved Rossi's claims Ljajić insulted his family. Behrami added Rossi should be ashamed for his actions as well as for lying to the media.Behrami: Rosi je slagao šta mu je Ljajić rekao (eng. Rossi lied what Ljajic had said to him Ljajić scored a brace as La Viola beat Internazionale 4–1 on 17 February 2013. ===Roma=== Ljajić signed with Roma on 28 August 2013 for a fee of €11 million, potentially rising to €15 million depending on the club's success, with Ljajić signing a four-year contract. He chose the number 8 jersey, left vacant by Erik Lamela, which Ljajić also used with the Serbia national team. On 1 September 2013, Ljajić made his Roma debut in a match against Hellas Verona, replacing Alessandro Florenzi; Ljajić scored the final goal in 3–0 win. In his first season in Rome, Ljajić scored 6 goals in 32 appearances. On 30 August 2014, Ljajić made his 2014–15 season debut in a 2–0 win for the Giallorossi over Fiorentina. On 24 September, he scored his first goal of the season in a 2–1 Roma victory over Parma. On 6 December, he scored his first brace for Roma, which allowed Roma to come back and draw the home match against Sassuolo, which finished 2–2. On 26 February 2015, he scored his first goal in the UEFA Europa League for the club, the opener in a 2–1 win away to Feyenoord. He concluded the season with 41 appearances and 9 goals, making him the club's second-highest goalscorer of the season, after Francesco Totti. Loan to Internazionale On 31 August 2015, Ljajić signed for Internazionale on a season-long loan, with Inter paying Roma €1.75 million and including an option to make the transfer permanent at the end of the season for €11 million.OPERAZIONI DI MERCATO 31 August 2015 A.S. Roma On 1 December 2015, Ljajić scored his first Inter goal in a 2–1 away loss to Napoli. ===Torino=== After Inter opted not to exercise their purchase option, Ljajić was sold to Torino on 18 July 2016 for €8.5 million, plus €500,000 in potential bonuses.http://www.asroma.com/en/news/2016/7/adem-ljajic-joins- torino-on-permanent-deal ===Beşiktaş=== On 31 August 2018, Ljajić joined Turkish Süper Lig club Beşiktaş on a season-long loan. On 29 May 2019, Beşiktaş signed Ljajić on a permanent deal for a reported fee of €6.5 million. ==International career== Brazil's Gabriel Jesus at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Ljajić represented the Serbia under-17 and under-19 teams. On 7 September 2008, he made his international debut for the under-21 squad in a European Championship qualification match against Hungary. On 26 October 2010, it was announced by Serbia coach Vladimir Petrović that Ljajić would receive his first senior call-up against Bulgaria in a friendly match on 17 November 2010. Ljajić was removed from his country's squad by head coach Siniša Mihajlović after refusing to sing the Serbian national anthem in a 2–0 friendly loss against Spain on 28 May 2012 due to personal reasons. Ljajić previously signed a code of conduct established by Mihajlović that included, among other things, to sing the Serbian national anthem, \\"Bože pravde\\" (God of Justice). Ljajić confirmed Mihajlović's statement, also claiming he loves Serbia and that he has a will to play for its national team, but added he must respect himself, implying he was no longer going to play under Mihajlović. On 17 February 2014, the new head coach of Serbian national team, Ljubinko Drulović, said he would not require players to sing the national anthem but to give their all for their country on the field. Ljajić scored his first goal for the senior side on 7 June 2015 in a 4–1 friendly win against Azerbaijan. In June 2018, Ljajić was included in the 23-man Serbian squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, where he played in all three group matches as Serbia was eliminated during the group stage. ==Career statisticsClub=== {   - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"2\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Continental !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"3\\"Partizan 2008–09 2455140336 - 2009–10 1442082246 - !Total !38!!9!!7!!1!!12!!2!!57!!12 - rowspan=\\"6\\"Fiorentina 2009–10 901000100 - 2010–11 2632000283 - 2011–12 1513000181 - 2012–13 281131003112 - 2013–14 00001010 - !Total !78!!15!!9!!1!!1!!0!!88!!16 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Roma 2013–14 2864010336 - 2014–15 3282071419 - 2015–16 10000010 - !Total !61!!14!!6!!0!!8!!1!!75!!15 - Internazionale (loan) 2015–16 2633100294 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Torino 2016–17 331032003612 - 2017–18 2761000286 - 2018–19 10000010 - !Total !61!!16!!4!!2!!0!!0!!65!!18 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Beşiktaş 2018–19 2790050329 - 2019–20 2451042297 - 2020–21 40000040 - !Total !55!!14!!1!!0!!9!!2!!65!!16 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Career total !318!!69!!30!!5!!30!!5!!378!!79 } ===International=== {   - !colspan=3Serbia - !Year!!Apps!!Goals - 201010 - 201150 - 201210 - 201300 - 201420 - 201583 - 201630 - 201752 - 2018103 - 2019101 - 202020 - !Total479 } International goals :\\"Score\\" and \\"Result\\" columns list Serbia's goals first.Football PLAYER: Adem Ljajić {  - !

As one of the leading theorists of his time, Spence was the most cited psychologist in the 14 most influential psychology journals in the last six years of his life (1962 – 1967). A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Spence as the 62nd most cited psychologist of the 20th century. ==Personal history== Spence was born in Chicago on May 6, 1907. In 1911, Spence's father, an electrical engineer, moved the family to Montreal, Quebec, Canada when transferred by his employer, Western Electric. Spence spent his youth and adolescence there, attending West Hill High School in Notre Dame de Grace. While in high school, Spence was involved in basketball, tennis and track. Spence sustained a back injury during a track competition while attending McGill University. As part of his physical therapy, Spence moved to live with his grandmother in LaCrosse, Wisconsin. There, Spence attended LaCrosse Teacher's College and majored in Physical Education, and met his future wife Isabel Temte. He and Isabel had two children, Shirley Ann Spence Pumroy and William James Spence. Spence and Isabel later divorced, and Spence was remarried to Janet A. Taylor, his graduate student, in 1960. Spence eventually returned to McGill University and changed his major to psychology. He received his B.A. in 1929, and M.A. in 1930. After McGill, Spence attended Yale University as a research assistant to Robert M. Yerkes. Yerkes sponsored his dissertation, a study on the visual acuity of chimpanzees. Spence received his PhD from Yale in 1933. While at Yale, Spence collaborated with Walter Shipley to test Clark L. Hull's blind alley maze learning in rats, a contribution which led to further publications while pursuing his PhD. Spence applied to a postdoctoral fellowship to study mathematics after the completion of his graduate training, but his application was rejected by a biologist on the grounds that psychology would never reach a level of precision to require sophisticated mathematical knowledge. ==Professional contributionsDiscrimination learning=== After his PhD, Spence accepted a position as National Research Council at Yale Laboratories of Primate Biology in Orange Park, Florida from 1933 to 1937. There, Spence examined discrimination learning in chimpanzees. From this and further research, Spence developed the continuous learning account of two-choice discrimination learning in rats. As reported by Lashley (1929), rats in a two-choice discrimination task demonstrated an extended period of chance performance, followed by a sudden leap to a high percentage of accurate responding. Lashley explained this phenomenon by suggesting that the rat's essential learning emerged from testing and confirming the correct hypothesis \\"during the rapidly changing portion of the function, with the practice preceding and the errors following being irrelevant to the final solution.\\" In contrast, Spence proposed that essential learning was produced through increases in the excitatory tendencies of task-relevant characteristics of the display, and decreases in inhibitory tendencies of the non-relevant characteristics of the display – a continuous learning account not directly detected by the choice measure. ===Motivation=== Spence moved to the University of Iowa in 1938, and was appointed to the head of the psychology department in 1942. There, Spence established an eyelid- conditioning lab to study the influence of motivation on classical conditioning, and contributed to Clark Hull's seminal Principles of Behavior book. Like Hull, Spence believed learning was the result of the interaction between drive and incentive motivation. Unlike Hull, Spence's formulation summed drive (D) and incentive motivation (K) instead of multiplying them. This allowed Spence \\"to show that increasing motivational level will facilitate performance on tasks in which the correct, to-be-learned response is stronger than those of other response-tendencies elicited by a stimulus, but will deter performance on tasks in which the habit-strength of the correct response is initially weaker than those of competing response-tendencies. He showed also that the mathematical form of the curves obtained when probability of the conditioned response is plotted against successive presentations of the paired stimulus changes systematically with motivational level.\\" Spence believed that differences in motivation were attributable to internal emotional responses created by an intraorganic brain mechanism. Spence's contributions to Hull's Principles of Behavior are commemorated in the book's foreword, where Hull stated: \\"To Kenneth L. Spence I owe a debt of gratitude which cannot adequately be indicated in this place; from the time when the ideas here put forward were in the process of incubation in my graduate seminar and later when the present work was being planned, on through its many revisions, Dr. Spence has contributed generously and effectively with suggestions and criticisms, large numbers of which have been utilized without indication of their origin.\\" The variable for incentive motivation (K) was said to have been chosen in honor of Kenneth Spence. ===Teaching=== Spence directed a total of 75 PhD theses, producing faculty members in every major psychology department in the United States. Students of Spence at Iowa referred to their degrees as PhDs in \\"theoretical-experimental psychology\\" due to Spence's emphasis on methodological rigor. ==Influential publicationsDiscrimination learning=== *The Nature of Discrimination Learning in Animals, 1936. *The Differential Response in Animals to Stimuli Varying Within a Single Dimension, 1937. *Continuous Versus Non-continuous Interpretations of Discrimination Learning, 1940. ===Theoretical=== *The Nature of Theory Construction in Contemporary Psychology, 1944. *The Postulates and Methods of Behaviorism, 1948. *Theoretical Interpretations of Learning, 1951. *Mathematical Formulations of Learning Phenomena, 1952. *Behavior Theory and Conditioning, 1956. ===Eyelid conditioning=== *Anxiety and Strength of the UCS as Determiners of the Amount of Eyelid Conditioning, 1951. *Cognitive and Drive Factors in the Extinction of the Conditioned Eyeblink in Human Subjects, 1966. ==References * Category:1907 births Category:1967 deaths Category:American psychologists Category:McGill University alumni Category:Yale University alumni Category:University of Iowa faculty Category:20th-century psychologists ","title":"Kenneth Spence"},{"id":"19270644","text":"Clathrus archeri (synonyms Lysurus archeri, Anthurus archeri, Pseudocolus archeri), commonly known as octopus stinkhorn, squidward mushroom, or devil's fingers,Clathrus archeri (devil's fingers) is a fungus which has a global distribution.

It was created by Gerald Davis, a barrister under the auspices of Lord Justice Denning. Many of the lecturers appointed by Gerald Davis went on to become Judges in the UK. The standard of teaching was very high. However, the establishment of Faculties of Law in East African universities led to a need to change the training offered at the Kenya School of Law. The Kenya School of Law was re-established as in 1995 to provide the Advocates Training Program which focused on the preparation of young lawyers for entry into the legal profession. In 2005, a ministerial task force on the Development of a Policy and Legal Framework for Legal Education in Kenya expanded the mandate of the Kenya School of Law to include the following:Advocates Training, Continuing Professional Legal Development, Paralegal Training, The provision of Specialized Professional Legal Training in Public Service, Conducting of Projects and Consultancies and Research.

She was known in Argentina as la gran burguesa (\\"the great bourgeois lady\\"). ==Life and work== Silvina Bullrich was born to María Laura Meyrelles de Bullrich and to Rafael Bullrich (1877–1944), a distinguished Argentine cardiologist and Dean of the School of Medicine of the University of Buenos Aires. The second of three sisters, she was raised in a privileged background; despite the conservative Dr. Bullrich's disapproval, her mother occupied her free time introducing her daughters to classic literature and, unhappily married, frequently traveled with them to Paris, where Silvina's paternal grandfather had been a diplomat. She was unable to pursue a university diploma, but received a diploma in French language studies from the Buenos Aires Alliance Française. She married Arturo Palenque in 1936 and had one son. Devoting herself to writing, she contributed literary reviews to La Nación (then Argentina's most-widely circulated daily) and in 1939, had a collection of poems (Vibraciones) and Calles de Buenos Aires (\\"Streets of Buenos Aires\\") published in Atlántida magazine. Befriending renowned writers Adolfo Bioy Casares and Jorge Luis Borges, in 1945 she collaborated with the latter in a collection of prose titled El compadrito (\\"The Poseur\\"). These early years in Bullrich's career were accompanied by a difficult phase in her life. Her husband, a lawyer aligned with Argentina's influential conservative Catholics, was not a good provider and this, coupled with his disapproval of his wife's work, led to their divorce in 1946. Bullrich also lost her father, elder sister and paternal grandmother during this interim, the latter two of whom she was particularly close with. These experiences were likewise reflected in much of her work, which continued to set young ladies brought up in comfortable circumstances against prolonged, unhappy relationships and relative penury. This was first evident in Historia de un silencio (\\"History of a Silent Moment\\"); the 1949 novel, set in the popular weekend destination of Tigre and written from a man's perspective, secured her reputation in the Argentine literary scene. Her Bodas de cristal (\\"Crystal Jubilee,\\" 1951) and Telefono ocupado (\\"Busy Signal,\\" 1956) continued showing her preference for detailing private moments and for allowing her characters to criticize male chauvinism or a weak character in women privately and in thought. \\"Crystal Jubilee\\" was also her first commercial success and coincided with her marriage to Marcelo Dupont, a happy interlude in her life which ended with his losing his battle with a sudden cancer in 1956. Silvina Bullrich was awarded the Municipal Literary Prize for El hechicero (\\"The Sorcerer\\") and Un momento muy largo (\\"A Lasting Moment\\") in 1961. She taught French literature at the National University of La Plata, and in 1962 invited to adapt French author Guy des Cars' novel Les Filles de joie (\\"Daughters of Happiness\\") into an Argentine film version; \\"A Lasting Moment\\" was likewise adapted into film with Bullrich's script in 1964. That year, she ventured into her first work dealing with social problems in Argentina, Los burgueses (\\"The Bourgeoisie\\"), which sold about 60,000 copies in Argentina and was translated into several languages;El Broli Argentino Several of her other novels sold around 100,000 copies. Her Mañana digo basta (\\"Tomorrow I'll Say, Enough!\\") was likewise hailed as a compelling feminist argument following its 1968 publication; El mundo que yo vi (\\"The World I Saw,\\" 1969) was a well-received account of her extensive travels through Europe and Asia; and her Los pasajeros del jardín (\\"Wanderers in the Garden\\"), a sentimental account of her marriage with Marcelo Dupont, earned her a National Literary Prize in 1972. Her continued success led to a 1975 film adaptation of her novel \\"Crystal Jubilee,\\" for which she wrote the screenplay. Continuing to write as a means of exposing deep-seated national problems, she published an indictment of Argentina's cumbersome and often corrupt judicial system in Será justicia (\\"There Will Be Justice,\\" a protocol closing phrase found in all legal briefs in Argentina). Published in 1976, this work coincided with the advent of Argentina's brutal last dictatorship and was the last of Bullrich's acclaimed works. She thereafter limited herself to less controversial novels (without abandoning her feminist points of view) and her memoirs, published in 1980. Bullrich translated Les filles de joie for the screen, as well as Argentine editions of works by Simone de Beauvoir, Beatrix Beck, Graham Greene, Louis Jouvet, and George Sand (about whom she also wrote a biography in 1946). She contributed to an acclaimed 1984 documentary, Eva Perón: quien quiera oír que oiga (\\"Listen if You Want\\"); while not a Peronist, Bullrich's commentary highlighted the late first lady's significance to the role of women in Argentina.Cine Nacional Remaining close to her friend and former collaborator, Jorge Luis Borges, Bullrich visited him shortly before his death in Geneva in 1986, and published her last work, La bicicleta, that year. A commentary on the country's recent financial crisis, \\"the bicycle\\" is also a slang term in Argentina analogous to \\"robbing Peter to pay Paul.\\" A long-time smoker, she developed lung cancer and soon herself relocated to Geneva, seeking specialized medical care; Silvina Bullrich died there in 1990.El País She was buried in the Jardín de Paz cemetery in Pilar, Buenos Aires. ==Bibliography== *Cócaro, Nicolás.

Based on their personal interests and views; Purple was, and in a sense still is, made much in the same spirit of the fanzine. The magazine became associated with the \\"realism\\" of the new fashion photography of the 1990s, with names like Juergen Teller, Terry Richardson, Wolfgang Tillmans, and Mario Sorrenti.Zahm, Olivier; Purple Anthology 1992/2006; Purple Fashion, Fall Winter 2008/09; Purple Institute, Paris 2008; p.68-69 In the introduction of the Purple Anthology, Zahm writes: In 2004 it divided into Purple Fashion published by Purple Institute based in Paris and New York, and Purple Journal, published by Les Editions Purple, based in Paris. On February 16 the first installation of Purple Fashion's new web site was launched. The art director of Purple Prose and Purple Fashion was Christophe Brunnquell until 2006, when he was succeeded by M/M Paris. ===Offspring publications=== Fleiss and Zahm's collaboration has resulted in many side projects: *Purple Prose – published from October 1992 to winter 1998 (13 issues). *Purple Fiction – a literary magazine published between 1995 and 1998 (4 issues). *Purple Fashion – published between 1995 - 1998 (4 issues), and 2004 - (present). *Purple Sexe – a magazine devoted to sexuality, published between winter 1998 and 2001 (8 issues). The magazine was reborn as a one-off appendix for Purple Fashion Fall/Winter 2008/09, dedicated to Italian porn star Rocco Siffredi. *Purple – a fusion of Purple Prose, Fiction, Fashion, and Sexe; published between summer 1998 and 2003 (16 issues). *Purple Books – a publishing house (1998–2001) *Purple Gallery – a Parisian art gallery *Purple Journal – a cultural magazine published 2004 - (present) in a French and an English version. Since 2004, Purple is divided in two different publications; Purple Fashion magazine (edited by Zahm and published by Purple Institute) and Purple Journal (edited by Fleiss and Sébastien Jamain, published by Les Editions Purple). ===Purple Fashion's artist's books=== Since its second issue, each number of Purple Fashion comes with an artist's book: *No.2 – Terry Richardson: Terry *No.3 – Richard Prince: The Hippie drawings *No.4 – Hedi Slimane: Interzone *No.5 – Juergen Teller: Ed in Japan *No.6 – Rita Ackermann: Good morning New York *No.7 – Helmut Lang: Selective memory series *No.8 – Dash Snow: You can't drink it if it's frozen *No.9 – Christophe Brunnquell: Annees Erotiques *No.10 – Harmony Korine: Pigxtras *No.11 – Marlene Marino: Cuba 2009 *No.12 – Ari Marcopoulos: Debris *No.13 – Aurel Schmidt: Pussy *No.14 – Vincent Darre: Vincent *No.15 – Thurston Moore: Street Mouth *No.16 – Katja Rahlwes: Full Moon *No.17 – *No.18 – *No.19 – Ryan McGinley: The Journey is the Destination ==References *Official website of Purple magazine *An extract from the new book Purple Years (Onestar Press) by Jeff Rian *\\"Orion Giret, Defacement of Public Art as Art\\" - a defense of vandalising public art, in purpleDIARY.

At the time of the disaster (April 1986), Alexievich was a journalist living in Minsk, the capital of what was then the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Alexievich interviewed more than 500 eyewitnesses, including firefighters, liquidators (members of the cleanup team), politicians, physicians, physicists, and ordinary citizens over a period of 10 years. The book relates the psychological and personal tragedy of the Chernobyl accident, and explores the experiences of individuals and how the disaster affected their lives. Chernobyl Prayer was first published in Russian in 1997 as Чернобыльская молитва; a revised, updated edition was released in 2013. The American translation was awarded the 2005 National Book Critics Circle Award for general non-fiction. The HBO television miniseries Chernobyl often relies on the memories of Pripyat locals, as told by Svetlana Alexievich in her book. == Editions == * * ==See also== * List of books about nuclear issues * List of Chernobyl-related articles * The Truth About Chernobyl ==References== Category:2005 non-fiction books Category:Books about the Chernobyl disaster Category:National Book Critics Circle Award-winning works ","title":"Voices from Chernobyl"},{"id":"19270922","text":"Vallekilde Folk High School (2013) Vallekilde Folk High SchoolVallekilde Folk High School.

From 2014, the school changed its name to Covenant Christian School, which more clearly reflects its role as a provider of Primary and Secondary education. ==References *Covenant Christian School official website Category:Educational institutions established in 1991 Category:Private primary schools in the Australian Capital Territory Category:1991 establishments in Australia Category:Private secondary schools in the Australian Capital Territory Category:Nondenominational Christian schools in the Australian Capital Territory ","title":"Covenant Christian School (Canberra)"},{"id":"19270994","text":"F31 or F.31 may refer to : * F-31 Sport Cruiser a trimaran sailboat * Farman F.31, a French Farman aircraft * HMS Mohawk (F31), a 1937 British Royal Navy Tribal-class destroyer * INS Brahmaputra (F31), a 2000 Indian Navy guided missile frigate * Nissan Leopard F31, a 1986 second generation car model * PRR F31, an American PRR 2-6-0 steam locomotive * BMW 3 Series Touring (F31) and also : * Bipolar affective disorder ICD-10 code ","title":"F31"},{"id":"19271012","text":"Tarnaszentmária is a village at the foot of the Mátra Mountains in Heves County, Hungary. ==Sightseeing== In Tarnaszentmária, one of the oldest Hungarian churches can be found.

The film was a remake of Malayalam film Thenkasipattanam. ==Plot== Pralay (Prosenjit Chatterjee), an orphan, is given shelter by Kaka Babu (Rajatava Dutt), just like the latter had given to the brother- sister orphans, Mainak (Tota Ray Chowdhury) and Khushi (Barsa Priyadarshini). The three grew up like family members. When they grow up, Pranay falls in love with Chandni(Priyanka Trivedi), the daughter of Tridib Babu (Mrinal Mukherjee), the local don. Pralay and Mainak often clash with Tridib's men and always teach them a lesson. The entry of Sangeeta (Namrata Thapa) creates a misunderstanding between the two, as Mainak has a crush for her, but he comes to know that Sangeeta loves Pralay. Siddhartha is a college-mate of Khushi. He was not getting any scope of conveying his love for her. Ultimately he joins as manager in the Mainak-Pralay company. But due to some misunderstanding Sangeeta has an impression that Pralay would marry her and Mainak was under impression that Pralay had chosen Chandni as his match.

He played mostly on the left wing. He represented his country 11 times between (1946 and 1950) before retiring in 1957. He then became a manager. ==Playing career== Born in Burscough, he signed for Blackburn Rovers from youth team Burscough Victoria in 1937. He became the team's leading scorer in his second season with fourteen goals but his career was curtailed by the Second World War which he spent part of as an infantryman in India, although when stationed in Northern Ireland he did help Glentoran to win the Irish Cup in 1945. He won the first of eleven England caps in a 7–2 defeat of Ireland in 1946 and would go on to play for the national team until 1950 by which time he had changed clubs twice, first to Preston North End for £16,000 in 1948 and then on to Bolton Wanderers for a then club record of £20,000 in November 1949. At Bolton he provided many goals for Willie Moir and Nat Lofthouse, picking up a losers medal in the \\"Matthews Final\\", in which he made a goal for Moir. In dispute with Bolton in the run up to the final, it proved to be Langton's final game for the club. He returned to Blackburn Rovers in September 1953 and served them for a further three years before seeing out his professional career back in Northern Ireland with Ards. Langton then went into non-league football, with three seasons at Wisbech Town before moving to Kidderminster Harriers and finally seeing his career out with a one-month spell at Colwyn Bay. ==Management career== Scouting for Accrington Stanley followed, as well as coaching for King's Lynn and Wisbech before he finally returned home to Burscough to become manager of the local team where he won the Lancashire Combination Cup and the Lancashire Junior Cup. He finally left football in 1971. Bobby Langton died after a short illness in January 1996. Two years later the road that goes past Burscough's ground was renamed Bobby Langton Way after him. ==References *Biography on Burscough F.C. website Category:1918 births Category:1996 deaths Category:English footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:English Football League players Category:Bolton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Blackburn Rovers F.C. players Category:Preston North End F.C. managers Category:England international footballers Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:People from Burscough Category:Glentoran F.C. players Category:Ards F.C. players Category:Wisbech Town F.C. players Category:Kidderminster Harriers F.C. players Category:Colwyn Bay F.C. players Category:English Football League representative players Category:Preston North End F.C. players Category:English football managers ","title":"Bobby Langton"},{"id":"19271135","text":"F33 may refer to : * HMS Somali (F33), a 1937 British Royal Navy Tribal-class destroyer * Recurrent depressive disorder ICD-10 code * Hirth F-33, an aircraft engine ","title":"F33"},{"id":"19271142","text":"Serre de la Madone Serre de la Madone (6 hectares) is a garden in France notable for its design and rare plantings. It is located at 74, Route de Gorbio, Menton, Alpes-Maritimes, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, France. It is open to the public (every day except Monday) during the warm months of the year. In 2008, it was being restored to its former condition. The garden was created in 1924–1939 by Lawrence Johnston, who had earlier created in Britain the celebrated Hidcote Manor Garden (1907). It lies on a hillside in the Gorbio valley, with a farmhouse to which Johnston added two large wings. Johnston traveled the world collecting plants, and Serre de la Madone offered an excellent site for plants from subtropical regions. Over the years he created a series of terraces among old olive trees, planted and tended by twelve gardeners. After Johnston's death in 1958 owners maintained it with varying degrees of respect for the original plantings. In 1999 the property was purchased by the non-profit Conservatoire du littoral, who began restoring it to Johnson's design. Today the garden contains a collection of unusual subtropical plants centered on a double pool, and rising in terraces. As at Hidcote, Johnson used hedges and low walls to divide the garden into discrete areas. Notable plant specimens include a superb Mahonia siamensis and Arbutus unedo, umbrella pines, Buddleja officinalis, Rosa chinensis, and bamboo, as well as good collections of cycads and succulents from around the world. ==See also== * Gardens of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur * List of botanical gardens in France ==Further reading== * Louisa Jones, (Les Jardins de) Serre de la Madone Menton (2002.

André Bucher came into this race having dominated these same competitors throughout the Golden League season. Bucher started hard but Wilfred Bungei pushed the break to take the lead past the bell in 50.41. As they hit the backstretch, Bucher set Bungei up and passed him with 300 metres to go. From there he just continued to pull away from Bungei, opening up over 5 metres by the finish line. The rest of the field strung out behind William Yiampoy the last pursuer. Paweł Czapiewski was dead last, 2 metres behind the back of the pack with 200 metres to go, still at the home straightaway, he had only passed Nils Schumann. Sprinting down the outside of lane 2, Czapiewski ran past the field passing Yiampoy with 12 metres to go, but too much distance to get to Bungei, Czapiewski took home bronze. ==Medalists== {  style=\\" text-align:center;

She was a pioneer of the visual arts in Singapore, who contributed to the birth of the Nanyang art style in Singapore. Chen also joined the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in 1954 as a teacher and lecturer until her hospitalisation. She was also the first woman to teach Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA), and also the only one schooled in Paris, France. ==History== Chang was born the fourth of 12 children - 10 girls and 2 boys - in Zhejiang Province, China, in 1906. Her father Zhang Renjie (Chang Sen Chek), was an antique dealer with businesses in Paris, London, and New York City. He was also a supporter of Sun Yat-sen, and provided financial support to Sun's revolutionary cause. Though living in the West, the Chang couple was deeply rooted to their Chinese heritage. Mrs Chang only allowed her children to speak in Mandarin at home, while Mr Chang often brought his family along on his regular trips to China to support Sun's revolution, and to ensure that his children would never forget their own cultural identity. Born into a privileged life, Chang was exposed to art at a young age. For most of her life in Paris she would either be painting at home, visiting museums, or roaming around the city every day. Chang attended high school in America, and studied art at the Art Students League of New York for a year in 1926. She felt that Parisian life suited her better, and in 1927 she returned home to study at the Académie Colarossi and Académie Biloul in Paris. Though her parents provided financial support for her art education, they never fully accepted her decision to become a full-time artist, believing that artists would struggle to succeed financially in their careers. Chang met Eugene Chen, a Chinese diplomat and a friend of Sun Yat- sen. He was an arts and music lover who deeply appreciated Chen's aspiration to become a professional artist. In 1930 Chang married Eugene Chen and traveled to China with her husband. She became Chen's second wife after the death of his first wife, Agatha Alphosin Ganteaume. The same year, Chen submitted her artwork for selection to the Salon d'Automne exhibition in Paris for the first time, and her work was accepted. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the couple was imprisoned. Eugene Chen died in Shanghai in 1944, towards the end of World War II. Chen was awarded the Singapore Cultural Medallion in 1982. She died of complications from rheumatoid arthritis on March 15, 1993, at Mount Alvernia Hospital after an 11-year struggle with the ailment. Mr Lee Seng Gee, Chairman of the Lee Foundation was appointed as the executor of the Georgette Chen Estate. In April 1994, Chen's house on Siglap Plain was auctioned for S$2.8 million. The money raised from the auction was given to the Georgette Chen Arts Scholarship for art students managed by the National Arts Council. A collection of Chen's paintings were stowed away in two rooms of her home, and subsequently discovered by Lee. In June 1994, Lee donated the 53 newly discovered paintings to the Singapore Art Museum (SAM). This brought a total of 104 paintings by Chen to be found in the museum collection. Apart from donations from the sale proceeds of her house, sales from Chen's personal investments of stocks and shares were also used to fund a new building for the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations (SCWO), as well as for community welfare projects for the local Malay community, and to the Practice Theatre Ensemble (founded by Kuo Pao Kun) to support Chinese theatrical art in Singapore. ==In popular culture== In 2007, playwright Ng Yi- Sheng's musical Georgette was staged by Musical Theatre Ltd. In 2014, National Gallery Singapore published Eisner-nominated comic artist Sonny Liew's graphic novel, Warm Nights Deathless Days: The Life of Georgette Chen. Channel NewsAsia produced a three-part docudrama starring actress Rui En as Georgette Chen. The English-language series that was also adapted into Chinese, aired on Channel NewsAsia, MediaCorp Channel 5 and MediaCorp Channel 8 in April 2015. ==See also== * Chen Wen Hsi * Cheong Soo Pieng * Lim Hak Tai * Liu Kang * Nanyang Style ==References== *National Library, Singapore Resource Guide on Georgette Chen Category:1906 births Category:1993 deaths Category:20th-century Singaporean painters Category:Académie Colarossi alumni Category:Art Students League of New York alumni Category:Deaths by person in Singapore Category:Recipients of the Cultural Medallion for art Category:Singaporean artists Category:Singaporean people of Chinese descent Category:Singaporean women artists Category:Singaporean women painters ","title":"Georgette Chen"},{"id":"19271192","text":"Matthew Thomas Hickey (born 14 May 1975 ) is a barrister, singer, songwriter, producer and director. ==Education == Hickey was born in Ipswich, Australia.

He was the lead singer of the band Mystery from 1999 to 2013 but is best known as the lead vocalist in the English progressive rock band Yes from 2008 to 2012, replacing long-time vocalist and founding member Jon Anderson. David had to leave Yes in early 2012 due to ill health. Before joining Yes, David was also the lead vocalist of a Yes tribute band called Close to the Edge. ==Musical careerYes=== In early September 2008, David was announced as the lead singer of a line-up headed by Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White of Yes for a tour later that year. David came to the attention of Squire through YouTube videos of his work with Close to the Edge. David stood in for Jon Anderson, who was unable to tour because of ill health following acute respiratory failure earlier in the year.http://www.nme.com/news/nme/37105 NME news: \\"Yes cancel 40th anniversary tour\\" The tour was cut short when Squire became ill and David returned to work with Mystery and Close to the Edge. However, David also remained with Yes, touring with the band in 2009 and 2010. In October 2009, it was announced that David had formally joined Yes. Early in 2011, the band finished their next album, titled Fly from Here, with David on lead vocals. David continued for a time as a member of Close to the Edge after joining Yes, but the band went into hiatus after live dates in 2009 given David's commitments to Yes. David and guitarist Phil Charmettant have since left Close to the Edge and new replacements have been brought in. In an interview with Noise 11 magazine in January 2012, Chris Squire confirmed that David had officially left Yes, due to a respiratory illness. He had been suffering from respiratory failure and could not continue on for the Australia tour in April 2012. In a press release, David revealed he found out only from a band member's interview that he \\"had officially left Yes and that [his] departure was permanent\\", being replaced by new lead singer Jon Davison. In another interview, David explained the reaction when he explained he would be unable to commit to April 2012 dates because of health problems: \\"At first everybody was a bit surprised thinking there was enough time for me to get back in shape, but since the issue was unsure, I suggested somebody take over [...] They said, well fine if you can't do it and you're okay with it, we'll look around. It's not like they asked me to step aside at all.\\" He also says: \\"The guys [in Yes] aren't getting any younger. They've waited years at a time for their singers to get better or finish other projects, and I don't think they can spare that time any more. They're in great shape, and playing well, and it felt terrible to be the one to stop Yes from moving forward. Can you imagine if they waited for a year and [...] I still wasn't better? If I can't sing those songs then what's my relevance in that band? Not knowing how long it's going to take me to get better, I feel much better there's somebody doing the shows and taking the music to the fans.\\"Prog, March 2012 issue In concert with Yes in Columbus, OH, 2008. ===Mystery=== David joined Mystery, a band led by Michel St-Père, as the lead singer in 1999. He appears on 2007's Beneath the Veil of Winter's Face, 2010's One Among the Living and 2012's The World is a Game.

The first batch of cars had side-valve, straight four, Dorman engines of 1094 cc with the remainder using Belgian Peters 1207 cc engines. These were in-unit with a gearbox, either of two-speed epicyclic or three- speed conventional type and drove the single rear wheel by a shaft and bevel gears. The open two-seater body with dickey seat had a smart nickel-plated radiator and electric lighting and was attached on a chassis with the suspension using quarter elliptic leaf springs at the front and semi elliptic at the rear. Unusually for a cyclecar, artillery wheels were used rather than wire-spoked ones. The car was exhibited at the 1919 London Motor Show and a reputed 2,300 orders were taken. Not all these were confirmed and it is estimated that around 350 were made. Two are known to survive. A prototype of a four-wheel version was made but never went into production. The company closed in 1922, selling the works to a carpet maker. ==Successor== In August 2013 the Castle Three Motor Company Limited was incorporated in Alnwick, Northumberland with plans to develop, manufacture and sell new generation three-wheeled sports cars for the recreational and motor sport markets.Company website [http://www.castlethree.co.uk/ date=21 November 2018 }} While the original had 2+1 seating and a four-cylinder engine, the new three-wheeler will have two seats and use an externally sourced twin-pot — either in V or boxer form — to power the rear wheel via a largely proprietary drivetrain. ==See also== * List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom == References == Category:Cyclecars Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of England Category:Kidderminster Category:Companies based in Worcestershire ","title":"Castle Three"},{"id":"19271371","text":"CCAT can refer to: *Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology *Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology Boat Club, the rowing club of Anglia Ruskin University *Campus Center for Appropriate Technology *Cerro Chajnantor Atacama Telescope *CCAT (public school district), a public school district administering a charter school in Statesboro, Georgia, U.S. *Cadet Centre for Adventurous Training *Criteria Cognitive Aptitude Test ","title":"CCAT"},{"id":"19271383","text":"Mao's Last Dancer is a Memoir written by Chinese-Australian author Li Cunxin and first published in 2003.

After struggling hard, he finally decided not to go back to China, following his destiny of freedom instead. ;Li Cunxin :Also known as his inner self. His inner self guides him throughout the book ;Alfred Zhong :Also known as the \\"Bandit\\". At first, he practiced Kung Fu at the Beijing Martial Arts School, but was later transferred to Madame Mao's Dance Academy to learn ballet. He eventually became blood brothers with Li Cunxin. The Bandit, Chong Xiongjun, and Li Cunxin quickly become best friends and support each other emotionally at Madame Mao's Dance Academy. ;Elizabeth Mackey :Li Cunxin's ex-wife. She met Li Cunxin in the summer at the Houston Ballet and started a secret relationship with him and later she married him when he decided not to go back to China. Although they got divorced eventually, she gave Li the opportunity to stay in America. ;Niang (see niáng on Wiktionary) :Li Cunxin's mother. She was a rural Chinese woman, as well as a loving mother. In Li's life, she was his impetus, driving him forward while he was in adverse circumstances. She was what gave Li the courage and strength to continue ballet. She was a very important part of Li's life. ;Ben Stevenson :One of the leaders of Houston Ballet Association, as well as Li Cunxin's American dancing guide and host family. He was very nice, and gave much helpful advice to Li. ;Dia :Li Cunxin's father. He was a Chinese farmer who was characterized with honesty and tolerance. ;Teacher Xiao :One of Li Cunxin's teachers. He is inspirational to Li Cunxin and has help him face many of his challenges during his ballet career in Beijing. ==Story line== Li Cunxin is born into a poor family commune in a small rural village in Shandong Province, where he is destined to work in the fields as a labourer. At first overlooked but selected after a suggestion by his teacher during a school visit, Li seems bewildered by the gruff preliminary inspection screening at the provincial capital city of Qingdao. Selected to travel to Beijing to audition for a place in Madame Mao's Dance Academy, he is admitted to its ballet school after passing a series of physical tests. Seven years of arduous training follow. He struggles at the academy, failing to excel as he tries to cope with his homesickness. There is no freedom within the rigid schedule, where he must balance hours and hours of dance classes along with strenuous academic classes. He also campaigns to be part of the Communist youth party, surviving rigorous interviews; after he is let in, an additional portion of his time is given to meetings. But Cunxin doesn't mind; he has a calling now: serving glorious Communism. The arrival of a new teacher, this one less likely to shout, changes his grim outlook on dance. He puts more emphasis on having fun and on knowing strengths and weaknesses. Teacher Xiao keeps an eye on Cunxin, spotting something other teachers hadn't yet seen. The teacher also (dangerously) differs from others at the academy because of his devotion to classical ballet, considered too Western to be taught at the school (as opposed to the politically motivated, strident form favoured by Madame Mao). His determination and courage, paired with Teacher Xiao's advice and motivation allows him to be the top of the class, offered more and more roles. This leads to him being grudgingly permitted by the Academy to travel abroad to Ben Stevenson's Houston Ballet company as a visiting student for six weeks as the government has slightly slackened its censorship of Western culture due to upheavals in position. In the United States, he begins to question the Chinese Communist Party dictates upon which he has been raised. America is not filled with filthy-looking capitalists, and the sheer wealth and size of the buildings and the people clearly indicate that China is the poverty stricken country, not America. However, he knows this sentiment is too dangerous to be spoken, and upon return to China, even though he loved every bit of America, he tones it down and recites some Communist propaganda for the report to be filed so he can return in two months time. However, despite the lies, the government refuses to let him return to the U.S. Three months later, he manages to get his visa and goes—this time for a full year dancing in the Houston Ballet. He starts a secret romance with aspiring American dancer, Elizabeth Mackey, keeping it a secret so his government doesn't find out and send him back. He is quickly promoted to soloist position and allowed five more months. In the last month, Cunxin is reluctant to leave, so he and Elizabeth rush their marriage so that Cunxin can remain in the United States indefinitely, thus avoiding a defection which may have consequences for his family. Visiting the Chinese Consulate to announce his decision while trying to prevent the sure backlash on Stevenson, the resident Chinese diplomat forcibly detains Li in attempt to coerce his return to China; when he continues to refuse to go willingly, the Party agrees to release and allow him to stay, but revokes his citizenship and declares he can never return to the land of his birth. Full of concern for his family, Cunxin continues to dance, but his relationship with Elizabeth ends in divorce, and he cites his youth and cultural differences as the reason. Cunxin is quickly promoted to principal dancer status, making numerous premieres and winning awards, but severely injured his back, putting him out of commission for over two months. Despite the setback, he continues dancing, and soon after, the Chinese government allowed his parents to come to America to visit him after six years of being cut off from his family. They arrive to watch him in the Nutcracker, and sob as they reunite, and the audience gives a standing ovation. Li meets and marries Australian ballerina Mary McKendry, and they finally go back to his old village. Cunxin meets with his old Teacher Xiao, and performs for him and his parents, but feels an inexplicable amount of guilt for the huge difference in how he lives and how the rest of the village lives, but consoles himself in thinking that he has fulfilled all his mother ever wanted for him. They return to America and continue dancing. Sophie, Cunxin and Mary's first child, is born profoundly deaf, to their devastation. Mary gives up her career to take care of her, and Sophie has led a normal life because of it, also taking dance classes in following in her parents footsteps. They go on to have two more children, perfectly healthy, but decide to move to Mary's home country, Australia. Their farewell performance, Romeo and Juliet, is broadcast live throughout China to five hundred million viewers. In Australia, he keeps dancing, but also gets a job managing one of the largest stock brokerage firms in Australia. He continues to visit his mother and his village, never forgetting where he came from. ==References * Official site * Biography at BookBrowse * Interview at ballet.co.uk (2003) * Transcript of ABC interview (2004) Category:Australian memoirs Category:2003 non-fiction books Category:Show business memoirs ","title":"Mao's Last Dancer (book)"},{"id":"19271421","text":"Uthman ibn al-Huwayrith () was an Arab of the Quraysh who converted to Christianity. After revolting against idol worship in Mecca in favor of monotheism during the late 6th century, he sought assistance from the Byzantine Empire in 590 in a ploy to install himself as king of Mecca. While in Byzantium, he converted to Christianity. He is also known for having compiled poetic works. ==Biography== Uthman was born into the clan of Asad ibn Abd-al-Uzza who belonged to the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. He converted to monotheism while he was young – during a religious feast held by the Quraysh in celebration of their sacrifices made to the idol, Uthman and three of his relatives entered into a secret oath in which they agreed to renounce idol worship in favor of the Abrahamic religions. They based their decision on the belief that idol worship had no textual or spiritual basis. In 590, he sought intervention from the Byzantine Empire in an attempt to have himself installed as king of Mecca and to bring its inhabitants under the Abrahamic religions. After arriving in Byzantium, he met with a high-ranking government official known as Caesar. In his plea to Caesar, he attempted to convince him that, with Byzantine support, he would help suppress the advance of the Sasanian Empire, with whom the Byzantines were at war. Caesar accepted his request, and bestowed upon him the title of al-Bitriq, an Arabic designation which is reserved for those with military prowess. Uthman also converted to Christianity while in Casear's court. Uthman also addressed the people of Mecca, stating that under his kingship, the merchant class would flourish as they would be able to secure trade routes to areas under Byzantine control. Although his plan was initially met with success, the ascension came to a dramatic halt after the Meccans suddenly decided to reject his proposition. Muhammad ibn Habib, a 9th-century Muslim historian, lists Uthman as one of the only two practicing Christians in Mecca during the lifetime of Muhammad. Another 9th-century historian, Ya'qubi, compiled a list to the same effect several years later. Uthman's son was a polytheist who joined the Quraysh tribe in their campaign against the Muslims in the Battle of Badr in 624. ==References== Category:Quraysh Category:Pre-Islamic Arabian poets Category:6th-century poets Category:6th-century Arabs Category:Arab Christians Category:6th-century Christians ","title":"Uthman ibn al-Huwayrith"},{"id":"19271432","text":"F41, F.41 or F-41 may refer to: * Ennis Municipal Airport, a city-owned public airport in Ennis, Ellis County, Texas, United States, with an FAA location identifier of F41 * F-41 (Michigan county highway) * Farman F.41, a French Farman aircraft and also : * the ICD-10 code for other anxiety disorders ","title":"F41"},{"id":"19271448","text":"In graph theory the road coloring theorem, known until recently as the road coloring conjecture, deals with synchronized instructions. The issue involves whether by using such instructions, one can reach or locate an object or destination from any other point within a network (which might be a representation of city streets or a maze). In the real world, this phenomenon would be as if you called a friend to ask for directions to his house, and he gave you a set of directions that worked no matter where you started from. This theorem also has implications in symbolic dynamics. The theorem was first conjectured by . It was proved by . ==Example and intuition== A directed graph with a synchronizing coloring The image to the right shows a directed graph on eight vertices in which each vertex has out-degree 2\\\\. (Each vertex in this case also has in-degree 2, but that is not necessary for a synchronizing coloring to exist.) The edges of this graph have been colored red and blue to create a synchronizing coloring. For example, consider the vertex marked in yellow. No matter where in the graph you start, if you traverse all nine edges in the walk \\"blue-red-red—blue-red-red—blue-red-red\\", you will end up at the yellow vertex. Similarly, if you traverse all nine edges in the walk \\"blue- blue-red—blue-blue-red—blue-blue-red\\", you will always end up at the vertex marked in green, no matter where you started. The road coloring theorem states that for a certain category of directed graphs, it is always possible to create such a coloring. ===Mathematical description=== Let G be a finite, strongly connected, directed graph where all the vertices have the same out- degree k. Let A be the alphabet containing the letters 1, ..., k. A synchronizing coloring (also known as a collapsible coloring) in G is a labeling of the edges in G with letters from A such that (1) each vertex has exactly one outgoing edge with a given label and (2) for every vertex v in the graph, there exists a word w over A such that all paths in G corresponding to w terminate at v. The terminology synchronizing coloring is due to the relation between this notion and that of a synchronizing word in finite automata theory. For such a coloring to exist at all, it is necessary that G be aperiodic.. The road coloring theorem states that aperiodicity is also sufficient for such a coloring to exist. Therefore, the road coloring problem can be stated briefly as: :Every finite strongly connected directed aperiodic graph of uniform out-degree has a synchronizing coloring. ==Previous partial results== Previous partial or special-case results include the following: *If G is a finite strongly connected aperiodic directed graph with no multiple edges, and G contains a simple cycle of prime length which is a proper subset of G, then G has a synchronizing coloring. (O'Brien 1981) *If G is a finite strongly connected aperiodic directed graph (multiple edges allowed) and every vertex has the same in-degree and out-degree k, then G has a synchronizing coloring.

The main research undertaken during this period was the Cambridge Growth Project, a project to develop computer software to construct a computational model of the British Economy. The project, initially directed by Richard Stone, whom Barker succeeded as director in 1983, coordinated a research team including economists such as Mervyn King, Angus Stewart Deaton and Jeremy Bray.Cambridge Growth Project In 1985 Barker co-founded Cambridge Econometrics. Barker has overseen a continuation of the research into the application of computing to econometric modelling, in particular the theory and application of large-scale economy-energy-environment (E3) models. Using such E3 models, he has been able to apply empirical analysis to international trade theory and to policies for the mitigation of greenhouse gases. He has also held various positions, including Coordinating Lead Author (CLA), under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an organisation that won (jointly with Al Gore) the Nobel Peace Prize for 2007.Nobel Peace Prize In 2009 he presented a speech to COP 15 – the UNFCCC Conference of Parties event in Copenhagen.Tyndall news ==Views== Barker has stated that the climate change problem requires urgent action aimed at decarbonising the world economy and his written extensively on these issues. He has been supportive of Barack Obama's Green New Deal, stating that \\"If all G-20 countries adopted a 'green New Deal' similar to the one proposed by President Obama, the world economy would be greatly strengthened, especially the sectors producing low-carbon technologies ... Where many current calculations get it wrong is in the assumption that more stringent [climate mitigation] measures will necessarily raise the overall cost, especially when there is substantial unemployment and underuse of capacity as there is today.\\" He has expressed the view that tougher restrictions for greenhouse gas emissions may, if done properly, actually have a positive macroeconomic effect: \\"There is some evidence that harder greenhouse-gas targets and regulation may actually increase benefits through improved innovation and distribution of low-carbon technologies, and increased revenues from taxes or permits. These revenues can be spent to further support new technology and to lower other indirect taxes, ensuring the fiscal neutrality of these measures.\\" ==Selected recent articles == *Barker, T. and Scrieciu S.

Over the course of her career, Dale has worked in the Canadian film and television industry as a director, producer, writer, and editor. Although she has completed solo projects, the majority of Dale's work has been in collaboration with her former classmate, Janis Cole. The Thin Line (1977), P4W: Prison for Women (1981), and Hookers on Davie (1984) are some of their most recognized projects. Dale's work has been featured in festivals around the world including North America, Europe, and Australia. She has also received award nominations and wins, including a Gemini Award in 1982 for the Best Theatrical Documentary for P4W: Prison for Women. == Early life and education == Dale was raised in a low-income household in Toronto, Ontario. However, she decided to leave home as a teenager due to ongoing family conflict. During this time, she worked in non-therapeutic massage parlors in downtown Toronto. In the mid-1970s, Dale was accepted into the film studies program at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ontario. Here, she met Janis Cole, who she would continue to work with for the next 20 years. ==Career Early career === Often working with a low budget, Dale began her film career as an independent documentary maker. Sharing the responsibilities of writing, directing, producing, and editing with Cole, the two women focused on showcasing social inequalities and hardships experienced by marginalized groups. Their choice to question and challenge class-based oppression and gender norms in their work prompted their reputation as feminist filmmakers. === Short and feature films === As students, Dale and Cole completed their first short film, Cream Soda, in 1976. This documentary revealed the demands on women employed in Toronto-based body-rub parlors. Meanwhile, their next film, Minimum Charge No Cover (1976), explored the lived experience of homosexuals, drag queens, sex workers, and substance users. Their following short, The Thin Line (1977), documented the day to day lives of people who were deemed criminally insane and institutionalized in a maximum-security prison. While shooting this film, Dale and Cole admit they sought to emphasize the prisoners' humanity to provoke a sense of commonality with the audience, as opposed to solely focusing on their misconduct. The content from this film motivated Dale and Cole's first feature documentary, P4W: Prison for Women (1981). After four years of communicating with officials, Dale and Cole were granted permission to film inside an all-woman prison outside of Kingston, Ontario, Canada. This marked the beginning of the documentary P4W: Prison for Women (1981). As co-directors and co-producers, Dale and Cole focused on the relationships between inmates as well as the prisoners' willingness to live despite ongoing challenges. This film was well received by critics and the public alike, winning several awards at film festivals and a Genie Award in 1982. === Later career === Later in their careers, Dale and Cole decided to develop and operate the Toronto-based independent production company called Spectrum Films.

He was born in February 1106 at Balabista (today Sidirokastro) in Macedonia, was made co- emperor with his father at 16 or 17 years of age and died on 2 August 1142 Choniates p.22 at Attalia, Pamphylia. He was an elder brother of the emperor Manuel I Komnenos, and had a twin sister, Maria Komnene (plus other siblings). ==Life== Alexios was made co-emperor by his father in 1122, but died in 1142. This was the year before his father's death as the result of a hunting accident. The reign of John II is less well chronicled than those of his father, Alexios I, or successor, Manuel I, and coverage of the life of his son Alexios is very sparse. A panegyrical poem by Theodore Prodromos was addressed to John and his son on the occasion of the coronation of Alexios. It hailed both rulers as \\"kings born of kings and emperors, reformers of old customs and privileges, with whom the august throne and sceptre-bearing are a paternal acquisition, a matter of inheritance.\\"Magdalino p. 422. His final illness is described: \\"...of the severest kind and of short duration, took the form of a rushing fever attacking the head as though it were an acropolis.\\" The location of Alexios' death, at Attalia, suggests that he was on campaign with his father, who had established this city as a base from which to pacify the inland areas around Lake Pousgousē (probably the modern Beyşehir Gölü).Choniates pp. 21-22 Alexios' younger brother Andronikos was charged with escorting the body back to Constantinople, however, while discharging this duty, he too was taken ill and died.Choniates p.374 ==Family== John II and his eldest son Alexios (right), crowned by Christ The identity of his wife is uncertain. It is possible he was married twice, the first wife being Dobrodjeja Mstislavna of Kiev, a daughter of Mstislav I of Kiev, and the second being Kata of Georgia, a daughter of David IV of Georgia. While both women are known to have married members of the Komnenoi family, several theories have been suggested as to the identities of their husband or husbands. His daughter Maria Komnene married the pansebastos Alexios Axuch. He was the son of John Axuch, the megas domestikos (commander-in-chief of the Byzantine army), who was a close friend of John II.Choniates p.59 Alexios Axuch served as Duke of Cilicia and protostrator. However he eventually fell out of favor with Manuel I Komnenos in 1167. John Kinnamos and Niketas Choniates report that the accusations against him included practice of witchcraft. He and an unnamed \\"Latin wizard\\" were accused of causing the pregnancy of Maria of Antioch, the Empress consort, to result in a miscarriage. They supposedly managed to do so by providing drugs to Maria.Lynda Garland and Andrew Stone, \\"Mary of Antioch\\" Alexios ended his life as a monk. Maria Komnene, \\"wife of Alexios the protostrator\\" was mentioned in a seal. According to the Dictionnaire historique et Généalogique des grandes familles de Grèce, d'Albanie et de Constantinople (1983) by Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza, this Maria was suffering from insanity by the end of her life.Mihail- Dimitri Sturdza, Dictionnaire historique et Généalogique des grandes familles de Grèce, d'Albanie et de Constantinople (1983), p. 276. They were the parents of John Komnenos \\"the Fat\\", a short-lived rival emperor to Alexios III Angelos. Theodora Axuchina, wife of Alexios I of Trebizond, is considered a possible daughter of John the Fat. ==FootnotesReferences== * * * Category:1106 births Category:1142 deaths Alexios Category:12th-century Byzantine emperors Category:Twin people from the Byzantine Empire Category:Byzantine junior emperors Category:Heirs apparent who never acceded ","title":"Alexios Komnenos (co-emperor)"},{"id":"19271618","text":"Tsukuba International School (つくばインターナショナルスクール, TIS) is a private, non-profit school for English-speaking children in Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.

Albanians first migrated into Greece during the late Middle Ages (late 13th century). The descendants of populations of Albanian origin who settled in Greece during the Middle Ages are the Arvanites, who have been fully assimilated into the Greek nation and self- identify as Greeks. Today, they still maintain their distinct subdialect of Tosk Albanian, known as Arvanitika. The Cham Albanians are a group that also migrated to Greece during the same period and formerly inhabited coastal parts of Epirus, in northwestern Greece. They were expelled from Epirus during World War II after large parts of their population collaborated with the Axis occupation forces.Hermann Frank Meyer. Blutiges Edelweiß: Die 1. Gebirgs- division im zweiten Weltkrieg Bloodstained Edelweiss. The 1st Mountain- Division in WWII Ch. Links Verlag, 2008. , p. 702 Greek Orthodox Albanian- or Arvanitika-speaking communities have been assimilated into the Greek nation. Alongside these two groups, a large wave of economic migrants from Albania entered Greece after the fall of Communism (1991) and forms the largest expatriate community in the country. They form the largest migrant group in Greece. A portion of these immigrants avoid declaring as Albanian in order to avoid prejudices and exclusion. These Albanian newcomers result to self- assimilation tactics such as changing their Albanian name to Greek ones and, if they are Muslim their religion from Islam to Orthodoxy: Some Albanians with Muslim background often change their names in order to avoid problems in predominately Orthodox Christian Greece. Through this, they hope to attain easier access to visas and naturalisation. After migration to Greece, most are baptized and integrated. While Greece does not record ethnicity on censuses, Albanians form the largest ethnic minority and top immigrant population in the country.Lazaridis, Gabriella, and Iordanis Psimmenos. \\"Migrant flows from Albania to Greece: economic, social and spatial exclusion.\\" In Eldorado or Fortress? Migration in Southern Europe, pp. 170-185. Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2000. ==Cham Albanians== Groups of Albanians first settled in Epirus during the late Middle Ages. Some of their descendants form the Cham Albanians, which formerly inhabited the coastal regions of Epirus, largely corresponding to Thesprotia. The Chams are primarily distinguished from other Albanian groups by their distinct dialect of Tosk Albanian, the Cham dialect, which is among the most conservative of the Albanian dialects. During the rule of the Ottoman Empire in Epirus, many Chams converted to Islam, while a minority remained Greek Orthodox. === Expulsion === When Epirus joined Greece in 1913, following the Balkan Wars, Muslim Chams lost the privileged status they enjoyed during Ottoman rule and were subject to discrimination from time to time. During World War II, large parts of the Muslim Chams collaborated with the Axis occupation forces, committing atrocities against the local population. In 1944, when the Axis withdrew, many Muslim Chams fled to Albania or were forcibly expelled by the EDES resistance group. ==Linguistic and cultural communities== In addition to the formerly sizeable communities in Epirus, there exist in Greece communities of Albanian origin who no longer identify as such. Although they retain a distinct Arvanitic ethnical identity,Trudgill/Tzavaras 1977 nationally they identify as Greeks. These are communities created by Albanian settlers during the Middle Ages (Arvanites) and during the first half of 20th century (Albanian-speakers of Northeastern Greece). ===Arvanites=== The main part of these groups is composed of the Southern Albanian dialectological group of Arvanitika speakers, known as Arvanites. They are a population group in Greece who traditionally speak Arvanitika, a form of Tosk Albanian. They settled in Greece during the late Middle Ages and were the dominant population element of some regions in the south of Greece until the 19th century.Trudgill (2000: 255). Arvanites today self-identify as Greeks and have largely assimilated into mainstream Greek culture, they retain their dialect Arvanitika and cultural similarities with Albanians, but refuse any national connection with them and do not consider themselves an ethnic minority.Botsi (2003: 90); Lawrence (2007: 22; 156)Greek Helsinki Monitor - The Arvanites Arvanitika is endangered due to language shift towards Greek and large-scale internal migration to the cities in recent decades. Arvanite communities in Epirus and Western Macedonia The small Arvanite-speaking communities in Epirus and the Florina regional unit, too are considered part of the Greek nation:Laurie Kain Hart. Culture, Civilization, and Demarcation at the Northwest Borders of Greece. American Ethnologist, Vol. 26, No. 1 (Feb., 1999), pp. 196-220. (article consists of 25 pages). Published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of the American Anthropological Association \\"There are also long standing... unquestioned identification with the Greek nation.\\" Villages of Florina with speakers of Arvanitika in yellow A small community is located in the Ioannina regional unit, where they form a majority in two villages of the Konitsa district. This community includes the village of Plikati. Although they are sometimes called Arvanites, their dialects are part of Tosk Albanian rather than Arvanitika. This population speaks the Lab branch of the Albanian language. The city of Ioannina in the past had a substantial minority of Albanian-speakers, where a dialect intermediate between Cham and Lab was spoken. During Ottoman era the Albanian minority in the kaza of Ioannina did not consist of native families but was limited to a number of Ottoman public servants. Notable Albanian writer Faik Konica, and his brother, Mehmet Konica, former Albanian Foreign Minister were both born in Konitsa. Another small group of Albanian-speakers, speakers of a Northern Tosk Albanian dialect is to be found in the villages Drosopigi, Flampouro, Lechovo in Florina regional unit.Gordon, Raymond G.; Gordon, Jr., Raymond G.; Grimes, Barbara F. (2005) (in English), Ethnologue: Languages of the World (15 ed.), Dallas, Texas, United States of America: Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) International, p. 789, , http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=als, retrieved on 2009-03-31 ===Albanian-speakers of Western Thrace=== Another small group is to be found in northeastern Greece, in Greek Macedonia and Western Thrace along the border with Turkey, as a result of migration during the early 20th century. They speak the Northern Tosk subbranch of Tosk Albanian and are descendants of the Orthodox Albanian population of Eastern Thrace who were forced to migrate during the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey in the 1920s.Greek Helsinki Monitor (1995): \\"Report: The Arvanites\\".Euromosaic (1996): \\"L'arvanite / albanais en Grèce\\". Report published by the Institut de Sociolingüística Catalana. They are known in Greece as Arvanites, a name applied to all groups of Albanian origin in Greece, but which primarily refers to the southern dialectological group of Arbëreshë. The Albanian-speakers of Western Thrace and Macedonia use the common Albanian self-appellation, Shqiptar. ==Immigrants== After the fall of the communist government in Albania in late 1990 and early 1991, a large number of economic immigrants from Albania arrived in Greece, mostly illegally, and seeking employment. Recent economic migrants from Albania are estimated to account for 60-65% of the total number of immigrants in the country. According to the 2001 census, there are 443,550 holders of Albanian citizenship in Greece.Mediterranean Migration Observatory - Tables Some other estimates put their number to 600,000 including also temporary migrants, seasonal workers and undocumented individuals. In this total, 189,000 Greeks of Albania, who hold Albanian nationality and are 'co-ethnics' or Vorioipirotes (from Northern Epirus) have also immigrated to Greece. Likewise, it is important to note that since the Greek economic crisis started in 2011, the total number of Albanians in Greece has fluctuated. ==Notable peopleSee also== *Albanians *Minorities in Greece *Albanians in North Macedonia *Albanians in Kosovo *Albanians in Serbia *Albanians in Montenegro ==References Bibliography == * Category:Greek people of Albanian descent Category:Albanian emigrants to Greece ","title":"Albanian communities in Greece"},{"id":"19271636","text":"Chris Hill (born 25 December 1946) is a photographer from Belfast, Northern Ireland. == Early life == Born on 25 December 1946 he was the second child to parents Verner and Margaret Hill.

It is an autonomous organization under Ministry of Culture, Government of India, and is governed by a Board with the Governor of Bihar as its ex officio Chairman, and is known for its rare collection of Persian and Arabic manuscripts. It also hosts paintings made during the Rajput and Mughal eras of India. It is also a designated 'Manuscript Conservation Centre' (MCC) under the National Mission for Manuscripts.Manuscript Conservation Centres National Mission for Manuscripts. ==History== Maulvi Khuda Bakhsh ===The person=== In 1895, he was appointed Chief Justice of the High Court of Nizam's Kingdom. After staying there for almost 3 years, he returned to Patna again and started practicing. But soon he was suffering from paralysis and he limited his activity to the library only. Due to his illness, he could not complete his activities. Rs.8000 to pay debt and library secretary and Rs. 200 were sanctioned as pension. He could not recover from paralysis and died on August 3, 1908. ===Library=== The library finds its origin in private collection of a bibliophile Mohammad Bakhsh and expanded by his son Khuda Bakhsh, who inherited 1,400 manuscripts and continued to add to the collection and eventually converted it into a private library by 1880. The library was opened to public upon its inauguration by Sir Charles Alfred Elliott, Governor of Bengal on 5 October 1891. After partition in 1947, Dr. S.V. Sohoni played a key role in ensuring that the collections were retained in India. In 1969 through a Federal Legislation, an Act of Parliament, namely 'Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library Act' (1969), the Government of India declared Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library a centre of national importance and government took over the funding, maintenance and development of the library. Today it continues to attract scholars from all over the world.

Although the company Automobiles Charron Limited was established (with a large injection of British finance) only in 1906 (and registered in 1907), its origins date from a business founded in 1901 called Automobiles Charron, Girardot et Voigt (C.G.V.). ==Fernand Charron== Fernand Charron was born in 1866.

In 1905 the company had capital of 2 franc million. ==All change== Fernand Charron at the 1914 French Grand Prix standing next to the Alda built by Automobiles Charron Girardot resigned in 1906 and Charron left the company in the same year; but with the help of a major cash contribution from investors in England he was able to found Automobiles Charron Limited, the factory and administrative offices at the same location in Puteaux as before. The suffix at the end of the manufacturer's new name nevertheless reflected its legal status as a London-based company with a head office at 32 Old Jewry, in London.Confusingly, in 1920 the London headquartered Charron company purchased a controlling interest in a railway equipment manufacturer called W.S. Laycock and based in Sheffield, England. In 1920 this company launched an automobile called the Charron-Laycock. The Sheffield built Channon-Laycock was an expensive well regarded automobile, but the two factories remained operationally separate: the Sheffield built car's design and style were British, and apart from being produced by a company owned by Charron, it had nothing in common with the French Charron cars produced in Puteaux (and some of which were imported into Britain). Laycock-Charron has yet to receive its own Wikipedia entry (January 2014) but there is more information in Nick Georgano's compilation: Georgano, Nick (1968). The Complete Encyclopaedia of Motorcars 1885-1968. London: George Rainbird Ltd for Ebury Press Limited. p. 122 Charron's commitment to the cars that bore his name was less than whole-hearted at this time. In 1908 Charron himself joined Clément-Bayard, where he both married and divorced the boss's youngest daughter, Jeanne Clément-Bayard, and worked as manager of the factory at Levallois-Perret.Hydro Retro, Clement-Bayard, pdf (French) Clément-Bayard, sans peur et sans reproche par Gérard Hartmann Shortly before the outbreak of the war, he seriously contemplated selling the Puteaux factory, but instead he used it to build cars for Alda, another automobile company, which he had set up in 1912. Thanks to purchases by the army, the Charron company made it through the war. ==After the war== After peace broke out Charron, not without difficulty, divested himself of the Alda business, selling it in 1920 to the Compagnie Générale d'Électricité (CGE) who would continue with the brand, selling cars produced at the Farman automobile factory, for almost another year. Fernand Charron now concentrated on the cars that carried his own name. By 1919 the company was offering seven models, though it is not clear if these were all production ready, and a year later the range was down to a more sustainable three models. Through the 1920s Charron was one of the many automakers operating in the Paris area. A certain restlessness seems to have been an enduring feature of Fernand Charron's business strategy, and by the time of the 19th Paris Motor Show, at which the manufacturer displayed a somewhat lacklustre trio of cars, Charron's own energies were focused on a Citroën dealership which he had recently acquired. It was also reported that he had recently acquired a significant chunk of the share capital in this rapidly expanding \\"quai de Javel\\" auto-maker, whose pioneering role in introducing mass production to France was now placing increasing pressure on the country's smaller auto-makers. Towards the end of the decade, however, the economics of auto-production were changing, and by the late 1920s production was running down as the larger French auto-makers were able to out compete the many second tier manufacturers: 1930 was the final year of production. ==The carsPre-war=== In 1908 Charron introduced their own types but some of the Charron, Girardot et Voigt models were still listed up to 1912. The largest now was a 6782 cc 30 hp and the smallest an 8 hp 1205 cc twin cylinder. All the cars were available with shaft drive and the small 8 hp had a dashboard radiator of the type made familiar by Renault. This was to feature across the range in 1909. A six-cylinder 3617 cc 30 hp joined the range in 1910 and a new small 845 cc Charronette appeared in 1914. ===1919 Motor show=== Regardless of the number of different models listed, at the 15th Paris Motor Show in October 1919 Charron exhibited on their stand just two cars: :*The 6 HP \\"Charron Type TC\\" represented a return for the prewar \\"Charronette\\". The 4-cylinder engine had grown to 1057 cc and the radiator was moved in front of the engine. The car sat on a wheelbase. :*The 15 HP \\"Charron Type PGM\\" also used a 4-cylinder engine, but this one was of 3392 cc, and its wheelbase was a formidable . Not on display at the show, but nevertheless announced for 1920, was a new \\"Charron Type A\\" with a 4-cylinder 2,995 cc engine and a wheelbase. ===1924 Motor Show=== Five years later the manufacturer was still taking a stand at the motor show, but by now only smaller \\"light cars\\" were on offer. Still present was the 1057 cc (6/8 HP) \\"Charronette\\". (still essentially of pre-war design). It was joined by the 1502 cc (10 HP) \\"Charron Type CV2\\" and the 1843 cc (12/14 HP) \\"Charron Type CV1\\". Most of the prices were listed as available \\"on application\\" but the little \\"Type TD / Charonnette\\" was listed at 16,000 francs for a \\"Torpedo\\" bodied car and 18,000 francs for a \\"Conduite interieure\\" (two-box sedan/saloon/berline) version. The prices were not particularly high, but the cars were not particularly modern or inspiring. ===Later years=== Four wheel brakes were added in 1925. In 1930, the final year of production the range consisted of the 12/14CV from 1925, an enlarged Charronette and a six-cylinder 1806 cc model. == Gallery == File:Charron Limited.jpgCharron ==See also== *Fernand Charron *Charron, Girardot et Voigt ==References== Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of France ","title":"Charron (automobile)"},{"id":"19271712","text":"is a common feminine Japanese given name which is occasionally used by males.

The concept car can reach about and travel up to about on an electric charge. ==More information== Nissan's vision for the future of urban transportation is encapsulated in Nuvu, literally a 'new view' of the type of car we will be driving in the middle of the next decade. Compact – it's just 3 metres long – Nuvu is a concept vehicle with unique 2+1 seating. It is aimed at urban dwellers who don't want to compromise on their personal freedom or their comfort, yet who appreciate that there is a need for a dramatic change in the way we move around our cities. Nuvu is an electric vehicle, is agile, easy to drive and even easier to park. It represents Nissan's commitment to electric vehicle technology, considering that Nissan has already announced that it will present a production-ready EV at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show, with sales due to start in Japan and North America in 2010. Whilst Nuvu is not that car, it does share some of the technology that will feature in the planned production vehicle. The vehicle shown at Paris Motor Show incorporates a witty representation of its green credentials: across its all-glass roof are a dozen or so small solar panels. Shaped like leaves on a branch, the power they generate is fed to the battery using a 'tree trunk' within the car as a conduit. Nuvu also uses natural, organic and recycled materials within the cabin. Nuvu is compact on the outside yet roomy on the inside. Built on a unique platform, it's just 3 metres long and sits on a wheelbase of 1980 mm but is 1700 mm tall and 1550 mm wide to create a large and airy cabin. These dimensions provide all the interior room needed for the vast majority of city journeys. Nuvu has two regular seats and a third occasional chair that can be folded down when required. But, unlike some two-seater city cars currently on the market, it is a thoroughly practical proposition with an integral luggage area providing sufficient space for a typical supermarket or shopping expedition. \\"Nuvu is a concept car, for sure, but it is an entirely credible vehicle,\\" says Francois Bancon, General Manager, Exploratory and Advanced Planning Department, Product Strategy and Product Planning Division, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. \\"It is light, clean and easy to drive. It is practical and a sensible size, yet it also embodies an element of fun: the future doesn't look so bad, after all.\\" ==See also == *Nissan Motors == References External links == *http://www.nissan.co.jp/EN/LINEUP/lineup_24.html Category:Electric city cars Category:Nissan concept vehicles ","title":"Nissan Nuvu"},{"id":"19271793","text":"Ferid Berberi (born December 6, 1946 in Tirana, Albania) is an Albanian sportsman.

Born into a middle class Protestant family in Dublin, Ireland, Taylor arrived in Southern Africa in 1886 and became a mercenary for the British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes. He played a major role in the conquest of modern-day Zimbabwe by the company. During two subsequent uprisings by the Northern Ndebele people against colonial rule, Taylor became notorious for atrocities against the Ndebele population and the theft of their livestock. Taylor is most notorious, however, for his actions during the Second Boer War. While serving as a captain in the War Office's Intelligence Department, Taylor was handpicked by Lord Kitchener as liaison to the Bushveldt Carbineers (BVC) at Fort Edward in the Northern Transvaal.

Schulenburg has described \\"The Irishman Taylor\\" as \\"a notorious sadist\\", who was \\"ruthless\\" toward white and black South Africans alike.Leach (2012), p. 15. In October 1901, a letter accusing Taylor and other officers of crimes against the laws and customs of war was signed by 15 enlisted members of the Bushveldt Carbineers and mailed to the Officer Commanding at Pietersburg. In response, Taylor was arrested by Royal Military Police and put on trial at Pietersburg. In one of the first war crimes prosecutions in British military history, Taylor stood accused of ordering the massacre of six unarmed Boer men and boys at Valdezia on 2 July 1901 and the theft of their money and livestock. He was also charged with the murder of an unarmed native. Australian Army Major J.F. Thomas, Taylor's defence attorney, managed to secure an acquittal on both charges. Taylor left the armed forces, returned to Rhodesia, and died at Bulawayo on 24 October 1941. In the award-winning Australian New Wave film Breaker Morant, Taylor is portrayed onscreen by John Waters. ==Early life== Alfred Taylor was born into a middle class Anglican family in Dublin on 14 November 1861. His father, William Taylor, was a lawyer. His mother, Charlotte Bennett, was the daughter of an Anglo-Irish auctioneer and land agent. His father died in Texas in 1877 and his mother in 1879 and, at the age of 17, Taylor had to make his own way in the world. According to his unpublished memoirs, he became a merchant seaman and eventually became a ship's engineer. In 1886, Taylor was employed on a voyage between British India and Europe, when he jumped ship in Cape Town, and disappeared. After drifting to the Protectorate of Bechuanaland, he worked assembling machinery for the goldmines in Tati. ==Creating Rhodesia== Taylor then became a mercenary for the British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes. In so doing, he played a major role in the Company's invasion and conquest of Matabeleland and in creating the new British colony of Rhodesia. Taylor preceded the Pioneer Column to Bulawayo, where he befriended King Lobengula of Matabeleland. In 1889, he witnessed the Rudd Concession signed between the King and the British South Africa Company. During the First Matabele War of 1893, Taylor acted as a guide to Cecil Rhodes. According to Taylor's unpublished memoirs and the \\"Plumtree Papers\\" by Mrs. Clarke, he had an argument with Rhodes whilst escorting him secretly to Bulawayo, threatening to abandon him. According to South African historian Arthur Davey, Taylor was so feared among the Native population of Rhodesia that he received two nicknames in the Ndebele language: \\"Bulala\\" (\\"He Who Kills\\") and \\"Bamba\\" (\\"He Who Takes\\").Arthur Davey (1987), Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers, Second Series No. 18. Van Riebeeck Society, Cape Town. p. lvvii. According to Australian Army Captain Frederick de Bertodano, \\"Bulala Taylor was an Irishman who had spent years among the natives and was known as a sadist. He frequently stirred up trouble in native Kraals and then shot some native 'in self defence', as he always stated. He was notorious and was distrusted by most white men he came into contact with.\\"Arthur Davey (1987), Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers, p. 55. Taylor later wrote that his Rhodesian estate, the Avoca Farm near Plumtree, was granted to him by Queen Victoria in return for services rendered. ==Second Matabele War== During the Second Matabele War, Lt. Taylor commanded a unit of Mounted Scouts with Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert Plumer's Matabeleland Relief Force.Frank Sykes (1897), With Plumer in Matabeleland: An Account of the Operations of the Matabeleland Relief Force during the Rebellion of 1896, Archibald Constable & Co., Westminster. pp. 93–95. During the Battle of Thabas Amamba, Lt. Taylor \\"fired the first shot of the day\\" at a fleeing Ndebele whom he failed to wound or kill. His Mounted Scouts lost two killed and two wounded in the ensuing action.Sykes (1897), pp. 156–161. During the same battle, Lt. Taylor \\"caught sight of\\" an enemy combatant who \\"was dressed in a suit of khaki and was not a Matabele\\". Although Taylor \\"gave it as his opinion that\\" he had seen \\"a Basuto, fighting with the rebels\\", the incident \\"gave rise to the rumour that the rebels were led by white men.\\"Sykes (1897), p. 159. In a handwritten account of his military service, Taylor claimed to have had \\"command of Plumer's Scouts\\" between 1896 and 1897. He further claimed to have been \\"shot through the leg in the Matopos in 1896\\".Leach (2012), p. 162. ==Boer War== Lieutenant Taylor was recalled to active duty during the Second Boer War and rose to the rank of Captain in the Intelligence Department of the British Army. According to historian Arthur Keppel-Jones, there was concern, upon the outbreak of hostilities in 1899, of an attack by the Boer Commandos against the Rhodesian railway lines. For this reason, four squadrons of Gen. Herbert Plumer's Rhodesian Regiment were deployed between Rhodes Drift and the Shashi Junction.Arthur Keppel-Jones (1983), Rhodes and Rhodesia: The White Conquest of Zimbabwe, 1884–1902, McGill-Queen's University Press, Kingston and Montreal. p. 591. Keppel-Jones elaborates, \\"The Boers, fearing an invasion from the north, placed the Waterberg and Soutpansberg Commandos, under Assistant Commandant-General F.A. Grobler, on that front. His task was to forestall invasion by raiding right up to Bulawayo. Grobler and his subordinate, Assistant-General H.C. van Rensburg, being timid and unenterprising officers, the task was not carried out. Plumer, on the other hand, was under orders to act on the defensive, protect the border, and not invade the Transvaal without a specific order.\\"Keppel-Jones (1983), p. 591. Captain Taylor described in a 1905 letter how, in 1900, he was \\"sent to the Transvaal to get information on Boer movements\\", which he \\"did to Genl. Plumer's satisfaction\\". On his return, Taylor was briefly \\"left in charge of the Detachment of A Squadron\\" until being ordered \\"to join Genl. Plumer at Crocodile Pools on the road to the Relief of Mafeking. I remained with him till I got Dysentery so bad I was sent back to Bulawayo Hospital.\\"Leach (2012), p. 163. Upon his recovery, Taylor received \\"a wire from HQ Pretoria\\" ordering him \\"to report to Col Wood in Bulawayo. There I met a man named Keith who informed me that Lord Kitchener wanted me to find a way to Fort Botha, which was situated in the Makato Mountains.\\"Leach (2012), p. 163. ===Arrival in Northern Transvaal=== Leading a party of six soldiers of the British Army Intelligence Department, Captain Taylor followed the Crocodile River until reaching the Soutpansberg Range. While interviewing Chief Madumetsa of the Mamadi People, Captain Taylor \\"began to suspect\\" the Chief of \\"collaboration or support for the Boers\\" and had him shot dead. Chief Madumetsa \\"was later buried by his tribesmen in the foothills of the nearby Zoutpansberg to the west of the Sand River.\\"Leach (2012), p. 10. Upon reaching Fort Botha, Taylor found it occupied \\"by only two men named Lottering and Erasmus and from them I found out that the Boer Commando was at the foot of the hills and that they had a telephone attachment to Louis Trichardt, I broke up the machine and cut off all communication by wire to Pietersburg and the surrounding district.\\"Leach (2012), p. 163. ===The Attack on Zwagershoek Farm=== On 4 May 1901, Capt. Taylor was part of a patrol which arrived at the Zwagershoek Farm, near the peak of the Soutpansberg Range, to transport the wife and children of Zoutpansberg Commando member C.J. van den Berg to the British concentration camp at Pietersburg. Unbeknownst to Taylor, C.J. van den Berg had caught a \\"fever, probably malaria\\", and had been sent home to recover. Before the British patrol had arrived, the Burgher had retreated to some nearby rocks and instructed his wife to wave her bonnet if she felt threatened.Leach (2012), p. 7. When the British soldiers began looting the farm, Mrs. van den Berg waved her bonnet and her husband opened fire. In a brief exchange of fire, a shot from C.J. van den Berg's rifle severely wounded one of the patrol, whom British Army records identify as R.H. Summers.Leach (2012), p. 8. In a 1905 letter, Taylor recalled being certain that, \\"owing to the firing, the Boers heard we were there.\\" Therefore, before clearing \\"into the mountains\\",Leach (2012), p. 163. a ceasefire was called. The van den Berg family was promised that no harm would come to them if they cared for Summers until a patrol returned for him. However, Summers later died and was buried on a nearby farm.Leach (2012), p. 8. Taylor and his men remained \\"in the mountains for 14 days\\" until being \\"relieved by Cols Grenfell and Colenbrander when they took Louis Trichardt.\\"Leach (2012), p. 163. ===The Sack of Louis Trichardt=== On 9 May 1901, Cols. Johan William Colenbrander and H.L. Grenfell rode into Louis Trichardt ahead of a mixed force of about 600 men. In addition to Kitchener's Fighting Scouts, the force included elements of the Pietersburg Light Horse, the Wiltshire Regiment, the Bushveldt Carbineers (BVC), a large force of Native South African and Indigenous Australian \\"Irregulars\\" and six members of the British Army Intelligence Department commanded by Taylor.Leach (2012), pp. 2–4. Even though Trichardt was \\"reeling from the annual effects of malaria\\", British and Commonwealth servicemen sacked the town and arrested an estimated 90 male residents suspected of links to the Zoutpansberg Commando.Leach (2012), p. 3. ===The Murder of C.J. van den Berg=== On 10 May 1901, Captain Taylor returned to the Zwagershoek Farm to \\"even the score\\" with C.J. van den Berg. Although the latter was \\"bed-ridden and barely able to walk\\", Mrs. van den Berg and their daughter were ordered to bring him to the door. Once they did so, C.J. van den Berg told his family in Afrikaans that the soldiers were going to kill him and kissed them goodbye. After walking only a few paces from the house, Burgher van den Berg was summarily shot by an ad hoc firing squad and buried in a shallow grave. His wife and children were given \\"five minutes to get your things\\". The farmhouse was then burned down and the van den Berg family was transported to the British concentration camp at Pietersburg.Leach (2012), pp. 7–9. According to the deposition of Australian Bushveldt Carbineers Trooper Robert Mitchell Cochrane, the cattle herds from Zwagershoek Farm were stolen by Captain Taylor. They were secretly driven across the Rhodesian border, and sold in Bulawayo,Leach (2012), pp. 165–167. where Boer Commando attacks against the southern railway lines had more than doubled the price of food.Keppel-Jones (1983), p. 597. ===The Burning of Louis Trichardt=== On 11 May 1901, the remaining residents of Louis Trichardt, including both the Afrikaner and \\"Cape Coloured\\" populations, were ordered to evacuate the town. According to local resident E.R. Smith, British and Commonwealth servicemen helped themselves to whatever \\"curios\\" they wanted and allowed the civilian population only a short time to gather their things. The town of Louis Trichardt was then burned down by Native South African \\"Irregulars\\" under the supervision of Captain Taylor. The civilian population was force marched between 11 and 18 May to the British concentration camp at Pietersburg.Leach (2012), pp. 3–5. According to South African historian Charles Leach, Captain Taylor \\"emphatically told\\" the local Venda and Sotho communities \\"to help themselves to the land and whatever else they wanted as the Boers would not be returning after the war.\\"Leach (2012), p. 7. ==Whistleblower== In May 1901, Captain Frederick de Bertodano, an Australian intelligence officer attached to Lord Kitchener's Staff, arrived at Pietersburg intending to speak with Major Robert Lenehan, the Field Commander of the Bushveldt Carbineers. Finding Lenehan away, de Bertodano was shocked to find Captain Taylor there as Lenehan's second in command. Captain de Bertodano, who remembered Taylor from the Matabeleland Rebellion in 1896, later recalled, \\"Neither his face nor his eyes prepossessed me and his reputation stank to Heaven.\\"Davey (1987), p. 55. Upon his return to Pretoria, Bertodano reported to the Director of Military Intelligence, Colonel Henderson and informed him of Taylor's reputation. Captain de Bertodano later recalled, \\"I urged him to see if it were possible to cancel Taylor's appointment, as trouble was bound to ensue! The D.M.I. reported to Lord Kitchener and the matter was discussed, but it was found to be very difficult. There were other matters of importance demanding attention. \\"Major George Milne and I discussed the matter at length as I was seriously perturbed; however, I was told to 'keep an eye' on Bulala Taylor, for which I felt no gratitude to H.Q.s!!\\"Davey (1987), p. 55. ==Officer CommandingSweetwaters Hotel=== On 7 June 1901, Lord Kitchener dispatched A Squadron of the Bushveldt Carbineers, under the command of Captain James Huntley Robertson, from Pietersburg \\"to establish a forward base camp\\" at Sweetwaters Farm and Hotel, near Valdezia. With Captain Robertson was Taylor, who had been appointed as Acting Native Commissioner, and a detachment of men from the Intelligence Department.Leach (2012), p. 14. Captain Taylor's staff included several \\"joiners\\", as defectors from the local Boer Commandos were called at the time.Leach (2012), p. 17. At the time, the new commander of the Soutpansberg and Waterberg Commandos, Assistant- Commandant General Christian Frederick Beyers, was encamped at Sweetwaters Farm. He did not wish, however, to cause trouble for Charlie and Olivia Bristow, who owned the Sweetwaters Farm and Hotel, and ordered his men to break camp and withdraw from the premises.Leach (2012), p. 14. Upon their arrival, Captain Taylor \\"established his headquarters in one section of the Sweetwaters Hotel\\", while \\"Captain Robertson and his men set up their tent and horse lines a short distance\\" to the southwest.Leach (2012), p. 14. Captain Robertson, who \\"wore lace cuffs and stood on a plank to keep his immaculately polished riding boots out of the mud\\", was regarded as \\"a bit of a dandy\\" by his men, who \\"had no respect for him.\\"Leach (2012), p. 17. Accordingly, he \\"deferred excessively\\" to Captain Taylor, who became the de facto commanding officer of Fort Edward the surrounding district.William Woolmore (2002), p. 72.Carnegie and Shields (1979), pp. 51–52. ===Ethnic Cleansing and War Rape=== Although Kitchener denied it later, Taylor armed and commandeered Native South Africans \\"on a large scale to help fight the Boers\\".Leach (2012), p. 15. According to British anti-Boer War activist Emily Hobhouse, local Chiefs were urged by Taylor \\"to burn and destroy all the Boers had and to give no quarter, take no prisoners.\\" Chiefs who obeyed were allegedly promised money and urged to subject Afrikaner women and girls to what is now called forced marriage and war rape. Hobhouse elaborated, \\"These armed men with assegais and rifles swept the farms in this district and now enjoy considerable flocks and herds they looted. To the lonely women they were such a menace that numbers of husbands surrendered after the occupation of Pietersburg, leaving their sons in the field. When at last the families were concentrated, entire Black Commandos (equipped and supported by the British) brought them in.\\"Leach (2012), p. 16. Meanwhile, Taylor waged a war of extermination against the local Tsonga people. So indiscriminate was Taylor's use of violence that the Tsonga still refer to him as Bulala zonke Matshangana, (\\"The Killer of all the Tsonga).Leach (2012), p. 15. Bushveldt Carbineers Lt. George Witton later wrote of Captain Taylor, \\"As far as the natives were concerned, he had a free hand and the power of life and death; he was known and feared by them from the Zambezi to the Spelonken, and was called by them Bulala which means to kill, to slay. He had the power to order out a patrol when he required it, and it was generally understood that he was the officer commanding at Spelonken. At the trials of the officers later, he admitted in evidence that he held this position.\\"George Witton (1937), Scapegoats of the Empire: The Story of the Bushveldt Carbineers, D.W. Paterson Co., Melbourne. p. 45. According to Captain de Bertodano, \\"The natives loathed and feared Bulala Taylor at his first appearance owing to his reputation in Matabeleland which had quickly followed him. His domination of Major Lenehan and other officers was evident even to the 'boys' at Fort Edward.\\"Davey (1987), pp. 57–58. ==Valdezia massacrePrelude=== On 2 July 1901, Captain Taylor received word that a group of six Boers were coming into the fort, accompanied by two covered wagons and a large herd of cattle. In response, the Captain sent a runner to summon troops from the Bushveldt Carbineers. Upon their arrival, Capt. Taylor told them that Fort Edward was about to be attacked. Therefore, he ordered a party under BVC Sergeant Major K.C.B. Morrison to intercept the six Boers. He instructed him to \\"make it look like a fight\\", ignore a white flag if one were flown, and take no prisoners. After listening, Sgt.-Maj. Morrison turned to BVC Capt. James H. Robertson and asked whether he should obey Taylor's orders. Robertson replied, \\"Certainly, he is commanding officer at Spelonken.\\"Charles Leach (2012), The Legend of Breaker Morant is Dead and Buried: A South African Version of the Bushveldt Carbineers in the Zoutpansberg, May 1901 – April 1902, Leach Printers & Signs, Louis Trinchardt, South Africa. p. 17-18 In response to Capt. Taylor's orders, Sgt.-Maj. Morrison dispatched a patrol under the command of BVC Sergeant D.C. Oldham to intercept the six Boers. In addition to Sgt. Oldham, the patrol consisted of BVC Corporal V.C. Primrose and Troopers Eden, Arnold, Brown, Heath, and Dale.Leach (2012), pp. 17–22, 99. ===Massacre=== In reality, while four of the Boer group were members of the Zoutpansberg Commando, they were off-duty, suffering from malaria, and were on the way to seek medical treatment at the Valdezia clinic.Leach (2012), p. 17. Their known names were Jan F. Vercuil, F.J.G. Potgieter, Jan J. Geyser, P.J. Geyser, J.C. Greyling, and M. van Heerden.Leach (2012), p. 21. After the end of the war, the daughter of Jan Geyser recalled that day in a letter to former military prosecutor Maj. Wilfred Bolton. Her father, who was then aged 65, was bed-ridden and had recruited 18-year-old F. Potgieter to help manage the oxen and wagons. Potgieter in turn asked 12-year-old P.J. Geyser to assist him.Leach (2012), p. 17. Miss Geyser also recalled that her father had been a very wealthy man and had several fine teams of draught oxen and a large herd of valuable cattle with him. She added that he had an estimated £800 in gold bars and a large sum in £5 notes inside a wooden cash box in the wagon.Leach (2012), p. 18. Upon reaching the clinic at Valdezia, the party were told that only the Swiss-run Elim Hospital, 10-km away, was equipped to treat malaria.Leach (2012), p. 18. Meanwhile, Sgt. Oldham's patrol had been dispatched from Sweetwaters Hotel on a course to intercept. Upon reaching the Fairview Farm of Alexander Pittendrigh, Troopers J.T. Heath, Arnold, and A. Heath were sent ahead to scout. On sighting the wagon train, Trooper Heath hid in the grass while Trooper Arnold returned to Fairview Farm to summon the rest of the patrol. When all seven Troopers were in place, Sgt. Oldham ordered them to open fire on the wagons. After a white flag was raised, Oldham ordered his men to cease fire, believing that women and children might be present. Sgt. Oldham then ordered Corporal Primrose to ride back to Sweetwaters and deliver a report.Leach (2012), p. 18. As they advanced on the wagons and disarmed the six men and boys, Sgt. Oldham reminded his men of Capt. Taylor's orders and assigned a victim to each Trooper. According to historian Charles Leach, \\"A .303 calibre volley reverberated down the Levubu River valley and four men and a young boy fell dead on the dirt road.\\" Trooper A. Heath later recalled that Jan Geyser was lying sick in his wagon and that BVC Trooper Eden \\"climbed into the wagon and shot him where he lay on his bed.\\"Leach (2012), pp. 18–19. ===Burial and looting=== After a ride lasting an estimated one and a half hours, Corporal Primrose arrived at Sweetwaters and reported that all six Afrikaners had surrendered and been subsequently shot. The main body of A Squadron began riding toward the scene and arrived a few hours later. In a subsequent deposition, BVC Shoeing-Smith Allen Staton recalled, \\"Then we rode on until we came across five Boers lying on the road dead and one lying dead in the wagon under his blankets never having got out of bed. The latter was shot in the head. The five lying in the road were shot in the head save one who was shot in the neck. They had no arms and from the position in which the bodies were lying it was evident they had not died fighting. It looked to me just like an execution. I saw both Captain Taylor and Captain Robertson ride on the scene while the bodies were lying there unburied.\\"Leach (2012), p. 19-20. After the scene was inspected by Captains Robertson and Taylor, the bodies of all six victims were buried in a mass grave by Quarter-Master Sergeant H.J. Venables.Leach (2012), pp. 19. The cash box, gold bars, oxen and cattle were never returned to the Geyser family. In a subsequent deposition, BVC Trooper Solomon King recalled seeing Lt. Peter Handcock, \\"walk past carrying the cash box which had been taken from the wagon. He held it up and said, 'There is over £100 in here in paper money.' I said, 'I thought it was over £1000. Can't you divide it among us?' He said, 'No, I can't do nothing like that.'\\"Leach (2012), p. 20. Davey (1987), page 94. According to the deposition of BVC Trooper Robert Mitchell Cochrane, the oxen and cattle were stolen by Captain Taylor, secretly driven to Rhodesia, and sold at Bulawayo.Leach (2012), pp. 165–167. ===Murder of Trooper B.J. van Buuren=== When the patrol returned to Fort Edward on 2 July 1901, BVC Trooper B.J. van Buuren, an Afrikaner, was seen pointing out Sgt. Maj. Morrison's men to a group of Afrikaner women and children who were being held for transport to the British concentration camp at Pietersburg. Knowing that the prisoners included the families of the victims and certain that Trooper van Buuren had told them about the massacre in Afrikaans, Capts. Robertson and Taylor ordered Lt. Handcock to \\"attend to the matter\\".Leach (2012), p. 22. On 4 July 1901, Lt. Handcock led a handpicked patrol of four men, including Trooper van Buuren, from Fort Edward to \\"investigate Boer activity close by\\". In a subsequent deposition, Trooper M.A. Churton described having seen Lt. Handcock ride up behind Trooper van Buuren and shoot him three times in the back. Lt. Handcock then allegedly rode up to Trooper Churton and said, \\"Keep a sharp lookout. We just lost a man back there.\\"Leach (2012), pp. 22–23. At Captain Robertson's orders, Trooper van Buuren's body was returned to Fort Edward for burial. Although Lt. Handcock wrote a report on the incident, it was edited by Capt. Robertson, \\"who deemed it unsuitable and thus edited it to read that Van Buuren had been shot in contact with some Boers. This 'official version' of Van Buuren's death was then sent to Pietersburg\\", where Major Robert Lenehan, the Field Commander of the BVC, \\"accepted it in good faith\\".Leach (2012), pp. 22–23. ==Captain Percy Hunt== In his report to BVC Major Lenehan about the massacre at Valdezia, Captain Robertson described the six victims as \\"train- wreckers and murderers\\"Leach (2012), p. 18. and allegedly recommended himself for the Distinguished Service Order.Leach (2012), p. 23. Meanwhile, reports had reached the Officer Commanding at Pietersburg \\"of poor discipline, unconfirmed murders, drunkenness, and general lawlessness in the Spelonken.\\"Leach (2012), p. 26. It was further rumored that a local woman had accused a British Army officer of sexual assault. When further investigation revealed that the alleged rapist was Captain James Robertson, the latter was recalled to HQ and given a choice between court martial and resigning his commission. Robertson submitted his resignation and left the British Armed Forces.Leach (2012), p. 23. In response, Captain Percy Frederic Hunt, \\"an Englishman, a former Lieutenant in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts, and a fine horseman\\" was ordered to the Northern Transvaal and given command of the Bushveldt Carbineers \\"B Squadron\\". Before departing Pietersburg on the night of 11 July 1901, Captain Hunt successfully \\"requested the transfer of certain officers and friends of his\\" to his new field of command. These men included Lts. Harry Morant, Charles Hannam, and Harry Picton.Leach (2012), pp. 27-28. ==The Letter== On 4 October 1901, a letter signed by 15 members of the Bushveldt Carbineers (BVC) garrison at Fort Edward was secretly dispatched to Col. F.H. Hall, the British Army Officer Commanding at Pietersburg. The author of the letter and the driving force behind it was BVC Trooper Robert Mitchell Cochrane, a former mining engineer and Justice of the Peace from Kalgoorlie, Western Australia.Leach (2012), pp. 98–101.Arthur Davey (1987), Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers, Second Series No. 18. Van Riebeeck Society, Cape Town. pp. 78–82. Trooper Cochrane's letter accused his fellow members of the Fort Edward garrison of six \\"disgraceful incidents\\": 1\\\\. The shooting of six surrendered Afrikaner men and boys and the theft of their money and livestock at Valdezia on 2 July 1901.Leach (2012), pp. 17–22, 99. 2\\\\. The shooting of BVC Trooper B.J. van Buuren by BVC Lt. Peter Handcock on 4 July 1901.Leach (2012), pp. 22–23, 99. 3\\\\. The revenge killing of Floris Visser, a wounded prisoner of war, near the Koedoes River on 11 August 1901. Visser had been captured by a BVC patrol let by Lieut. Harry Morant two days before his death. After Visser had been exhaustively interrogated and conveyed for 15 miles by the patrol, Lt. Morant had ordered his men to form a firing squad and shoot him. The squad consisted of BVC Troopers A.J. Petrie, J.J. Gill, Wild, and T.J. Botha. A coup de grace was delivered by BVC Lt. Harry Picton. The slaying of Floris Visser was in retaliation for the combat death of Morant's close friend, BVC Captain Percy Frederik Hunt, at Duivelskloof on 6 August 1901.Leach (2012), pp. 35–60, 100. 4\\\\. The shooting, ordered by Capt. Taylor and Lt. Morant, of four surrendered Afrikaners and four Dutch schoolteachers, who had been captured at the Elim Hospital, on the morning of 23 August 1901. The firing squad consisted of BVC Lt. George Witton, Sgt. D.C. Oldham, and Troopers J.T. Arnold, Edward Brown, T. Dale, and A. Heath. Although Trooper Cochrane's letter made no mention of the fact, three Black South African witnesses were also shot dead.Leach (2012), pp. 61–72, 100. The ambush and fatal shooting of the Reverend Carl August Daniel Heese of the Berlin Missionary Society near Bandolierkop on the afternoon of 23 August 1901. Rev. Heese had spiritually counseled the Dutch and Afrikaner victims that morning and had angrily protested to Lt. Morant at Fort Edward upon learning of their deaths. Trooper Cochrane alleged that the killer of Rev. Heese was BVC Lt. Peter Handcock. Although Cochrane made no mention of the fact, Rev. Heese's driver, a member of the Southern Ndebele people, was also killed.Leach (2012), pp. 62–68, 73–82, 100. 5\\\\. The orders, given by BVC Lt. Charles Hannam, to open fire on a wagon train containing Afrikaner women and children who were coming in to surrender at Fort Edward, on 5 September 1901. The ensuing gunfire led to the deaths of two boys, aged 5- and 13-years, and the wounding of a 9-year-old girl.Leach (2012), pp. 83–86, 100. 6\\\\. The shooting of Roelf van Staden and his sons Roelf and Christiaan, near Fort Edward on 7 September 1901. All were coming in to surrender in the hope of gaining medical treatment for teenaged Christiaan, who was suffering from recurring bouts of fever. Instead, they were met at the Sweetwaters Farm near Fort Edward by a party consisting of Lts. Morant and Handcock, joined by BVC Sgt. Maj. Hammet, Corp. MacMahon, and Troopers Hodds, Botha, and Thompson. Roelf van Staden and both his sons were then shot, allegedly after being forced to dig their own graves.Leach (2012), pp. 87–90, 100–101. Trooper Cochrane then cited evidence that the Australian-born Field Commander of the BVC, Major Robert Lenehan, was \\"privy the these misdeamenours. It is for this reason that we have taken the liberty of addressing this communication direct to you.\\"Leach (2012), pp. 100–101. After listing numerous civilian witnesses who could confirm his accusations, Trooper Cochrane concluded, \\"Sir, many of us are Australians who have fought throughout nearly the whole war while others are Africaners who have fought from Colenso till now. We cannot return home with the stigma of these crimes attached to our names. Therefore we humbly pray that a full and exhaustive inquiry be made by Imperial officers in order that the truth be elicited and justice done. Also we beg that all witnesses may be kept in camp at Pietersburg till the inquiry is finished. So deeply do we deplore the opprobrium which must be inseparably attached to these crimes that scarcely a man once his time is up can be prevailed to re-enlist in this corps. Trusting for the credit of thinking you will grant the inquiry we seek.\\"Leach (2012), p. 101. ==Arrest and indictmentArrest=== In response, Capt. Taylor was arrested by Royal Military Police at Pietersburg, where he had been recalled three weeks earlier. Hoping to evade prosecution, he resigned his commission, but was still held awaiting trial. On October 11, 1901, Australian BVC Trooper R.M. Cochrane wrote to Major Wilfred Bolton and recalled the fallout from Floris Visser's murder, \\"After the shooting of the wounded Boer F. Visser, the faithful Kaffirs refused to reveal the whereabouts of their Boer masters. Presumably, they tended them themselves in the bush. One Kaffir (sic), when commanded by Capt. Taylor to reveal the whereabouts of a wounded Boer curtly replied, 'Kona', which was a direct refusal. Capt. Taylor shot him dead with his revolver.\\" Arthur Davey (1987), Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers, page 103. According to South African historian Dr. C.A.R. Schulenburg, all prisoners, including Taylor, \\"were kept in solitary confinement. Nobody, not even the prison chaplain, was permitted to visit them; they were not allowed to obtain advice for their defence until the evening before the start of the court martial, and they were not allowed to communicate with each other. They were not informed of the charges against them. They all assumed that they had simply done their duty according to orders from higher authority.\\"Leach (2012), p. 105. ===Indictment=== A Court of Inquiry, the British armed forces' equivalent to a grand jury, was convened at Pietersburg. It consisted of Colonel H.M. Carter, his secretary Captain E. Evans, and Major Wilfred N. Bolton. The first sitting took place on 21 November 1901. Sessions continued for four weeks followed by a further two weeks of deliberations. The main indictments were filed against Lieuts. Morant, Handcock, Witton, and Picton.Leach (2012), p. 105. Alfred Taylor was charged only with the murders of the six Afrikaners slain during the Valdezia Massacre.Leach (2012), p. 107. After observing the proceedings, Col. J. St. Claire wrote a confidential report to the War Office, \\"I agree generally with the views expressed by the Court of Inquiry in the opinions of the several cases. The idea that no prisoners were to be taken in the Spelonken area appears to have been started by the late Captain Hunt & after his death continued by orders given personally by Captain Taylor. \\"The statement that Captain Hunt's body had been maltreated is in no way corroborated & the reprisals undertaken by Lt Morant on this idea were utterly unjustifiable. \\"Lieut Morant seems to have been the primary mover in carrying out these orders, & Lieut Handcock willingly lent himself out as the principal executioner of them. \\"Lieut Morant acquiesced in the illegal execution of the wounded Boer Visser & took a personal part in the massacre of the 8 surrendered Boers on 23 August. \\"The two N.C.O.s acted under orders but were not justified in obeying illegal commands. After the murder of Van Buuren the officers seem to have exercised a reign of terror in the District, which hindered their men from reporting their illegal acts & even prevented their objecting to assist in the crime.\\"Leach (2012), p. 125. ==Trial== According to Dr. C.A.R. Schulenberg, the first court-martial opened on 16 January 1902, with Lt.-Col. H.C. Denny presiding with six additional judges. Maj. James Francis Thomas of the New South Wales Mounted Rifles had already agreed to defend BVC Major Robert Lenehan. Maj. Thomas agreed, however, the night before the first trial, to defend all six defendants. The court sat in secret, contrary to regulations that all courts-martial were to be open to civilians, the military, and the press.Leach (2012), p. 105. The trial of Alfred Taylor was saved for last. South African historian Andries Pretorius believes that Crown Prosecutors were trying to force Lieuts. Morant, Handcock, Witton, and Picton to turn king's evidence against Taylor. If so, they were unsuccessful.Leach (2012), p. 189. In what was dubbed, The Six Boers Incident, Taylor was put on trial for ordering the Valdezia Massacre. Former Bushveldt Carbineers Captain James Robertson and other perpetrators testified against him.Leach (2012), p. 107. As Taylor had resigned his commission upon his arrest three months earlier, he was tried by a military court under martial law, rather than by a court martial under the Army Act.Leach (2012), pp. 107, 126. Following his acquittal, Taylor returned to his farm near Plumtree, in Southern Rhodesia. Meanwhile, Lieuts. Harry Morant and Peter Handcock were convicted of murder and executed by firing squad on the early morning of 27 February 1902. Lieut. George Witton was convicted of the same charge, but his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Lieut. Harry Picton was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to be cashiered.Leach (2012), pp. 115–126. According to Dr. C.A.R. Schulenberg, all those involved in the massacre, \\"from Taylor right down to the Troopers who did the actual killing, were exonerated while Australians who were involved in similar episodes were court-martialed and executed. This was the first in a series of episodes which upset the Australian Government and its people; it led to a deep dissatisfaction and distrust, to say the least, of Kitchener and the British Army, which has not been fully erased to this day. There is in fact proof of numerous other incidents where unarmed Boers were shot by the British, about which nothing was said or done.\\"Leach (2012), p. 23. ==Later life== An urban legend later circulated in South Africa, to the effect that, after Taylor's acquittal and return to Rhodesia, he was fatally shot in a saloon, by the brother of Trooper B. J. van Buuren, whose murder Taylor had ordered. In reality, there was no truth to this.Leach (2012), p. 107. Taylor was recalled to active service during the First World War and served in France between 1917 and 1918. He later wrote that he had a \\"knee cap knocked out\\" on the Western Front (France/Belgium).\\"Leach (2012), p. 162. ==Death== Alfred Taylor died of cholecystitis and pneumoniaLeach (2012), p. 107. at Bulawayo Memorial Hospital on 24 October 1941.Leach (2012), p. 167. On October 31, 1941, a brief obituary in the Rhodesian Herald described him as one of Rhodesia's \\"pioneers.\\" Davey (1987), page xlix. According to South African historian Arthur Davey, \\"If Taylor enriched himself through the acquisition of Boer cattle, his lasting prosperity was not ensured by it. The National Archives, Harare, has correspondence that points to his having sought financial assistance from the Government later in his life. When he died in 1941 the estate that he left was not that of a wealthy farmer.\\" Davey (1987), Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers, pages xlix-l. Captain Alfred Taylor was buried at Bulawayo General Cemetery. ==Personal life== Captain Taylor married Mrs. Phoebe Clark Wolfenden, the widow of a British trader,Leach (2012), p. 162. in an Anglican ceremony at Shoshong, Protectorate of Bechuanaland, on 12 September 1887.Leach (2012), p. 167. In a memoir written for the book First Steps in Civilizing Rhodesia, Mrs. Taylor described herself as being of mixed British and Bechuana descent. She further claimed to be the great-grandniece of King Sekgoma II.Leach (2012), p. 162. Despite Phoebe Taylor's descent from royalty, Captain de Bertodano, dismissively referred to her as, \\"a native or half-caste woman,\\" alleged that Captain Taylor's interracial marriage contributed to his bad reputation among the White population of Rhodesia. Davey (1987), page 55. Captain and Mrs. Taylor had eight children; Mrs. Maude Lindebloom, Mrs. Nora Davies, Adie Taylor, Alfred Taylor Jr., Freddy Taylor, Claud Taylor, Albert Taylor, and Charles Taylor.Leach (2012), p. 167. Accounts by Captain Taylor's family describe him as a \\"loving, caring husband and father\\".Leach (2012), p. 161. ==Decorations== In a handwritten account of his military service, Captain Taylor claimed to have been awarded \\"the Matabele Medal\\" in 1893, the Queen's and King's South Africa Medals with 5 Bars for serving in the Second Boer War, and the Victory Medal for his service in World War I.Leach (2012), p. 162. ==Legacy== In the region of South Africa where his crimes took place, Capt. Taylor's wartime activities still haunt the descendants of his victims more than a century later and his acquittal is locally reviled as a miscarriage of justice. According to South African historian Charles Leach, \\"In the opinion of many South Africans, particularly descendants of victims as well as other involved persons in the far Northern Transvaal, justice was only partially achieved by the trial and the resultant sentences. The feeling still prevails that not all the guilty parties were dealt with – the notorious Captain Taylor being the most obvious one of all.\\"Leach (2012), page 139. Taylor is also detested in Australia, where his co-defendants, BVC Lieuts. Harry Morant and Peter Handcock, are widely seen as national icons and martyrs. Among Australians seeking to reopen the case, Taylor is often blamed for the atrocities that sent Lieuts. Morant and Handcock before a firing squad. Despite the seriousness of the evidence and charges against them, some modern Australians regard Morant and Handcock as scapegoats or even as the victims of judicial murder. They continue to attempt, with some public support, to obtain a posthumous pardon or even a new trial. ==In popular culture== In the 1980 Australian film Breaker Morant, Cap. Taylor is played by actor John Waters. In a 2013 review of the film, Graham Daeseler wrote \\"The actual Taylor was a ruthless murderer, using the war as an excuse to plunder Boer property and line his own pockets. In the film, he is the defendants' only ostensible ally besides their attorney. Take one look at Waters, though, with that pencil-thin scar on his cheek and that haughty, dead-eyed stare, and you’ll see a glimpse of the monster lurking beneath the gentleman’s façade.\\"\\"Kangaroo Court: On Bruce Beresford's 'Breaker Morant'\\" Bright Lights Film Journal30 April 2013.

Arditti and Ghani note that E. secundum has the distinction of bearing the longest seeds known in the Orchidaceae, 6.0 mm long. By comparison, the seeds of E. ibaguense (another crucifix orchid) are only 2.9 mm long. Like the other members of E. subg. Amphiglottium, E. secundum is a sympodial plant which has thin stems covered from the base with imbricating sheaths which are leaf bearing above, a terminal inflorescence covered at its base with thin imbricating sheaths, and flowers with the lip adnate to the column to its apex. The flowers are non-resupinate (unlike E. ibaguense and E. radicans), can come in shades of lilac, red, orange, or yellow, and feature a notable callus on the fringed trilobate lip. The plant is rather cool-growing and can tolerate a light frost. == Diversity within the complex == Epidendrum secundum, also called \\"Wiñay Wayna orchid\\", in front of the Wiñay Wayna ruins In 1861, H. R. Reichenbach presented a treatment of the genus Epidendrum, including his view of the sub-section Tuberculata. Correlating his list of (in Reichenbach's view) separate species with the Kew Monocot Checklist (July 16, 2009) yielded the following list of taxa \\"which appear to deserve species rank\\" that Kew checklist reviewers consider to be synonyms for E. secundum (the page numbers refer to Reichenbach 1861): * E. ansiferum Rchb.f. & Warsz., Bonplandia (Hannover) 2: 111 (1854).

Despite the generic epithet (literally \\"upon a tree\\"), E. secundum frequently grows terrestrially. Due to this literal inappropriateness of the name and the origin of this plant in a country where English is not the common language, any \\"common names\\" constructed by literally translating the Linnaean binomial into English are completely inappropriate: not only are such names not common, they are completely misleading. Such names include \\"lop sided star orchid,\\" and \\"flowers all in one plane Epidendrum,\\" among others. Nevertheless, the insistence of some database constructors that each taxon must have a common name causes such phrases to proliferate. == Occurrence == Epidendrum secundum occurs in the montane forest of the Neotropics (up to 2 miles high), including Cusco, southeastern Peru and Brazil. It has also been found in disturbed roadside habitats in Picingauba, Brazil, near sea level, together with E. fulgens and natural hybrids between the two. == References == * Arditti, J. and Abdul karim Abdul Ghani, \\"Tansley Review No. 100.

It provides care and support for people with a disability, children and families, young people, young homeless people, people with epilepsy and carers. In February 2008 Quarriers was the largest non-church social care charity in Scotland. The charity was founded in the late 19th century by William Quarrier, a shoe retailer from Glasgow. In the 1890s he built the Orphan Homes of Scotland in Bridge of Weir, which were home to up to 1500 children at a time. Changes in UK childcare practice and legislation in the 1970s and 80s led to a modernisation process, through which the organisation developed the services it delivers today and became known as Quarriers. Quarriers’ work covers the whole of Scotland and the organisation is also involved in several international projects. ==History== The charity was founded in the late 19th century by William Quarrier, a shoe retailer from Glasgow. Quarrier began looking after homeless children in the 1870s, opening a night refuge for homeless children in Renfrew Street, Glasgow in 1871. Quarriers, \\"Orphan Homes of Scotland\\", retrieved 10 September 2008 He then expanded his operations, using charitable donations to buy a piece of land near Bridge of Weir, on which the Orphan Homes of Scotland were built. By the 1890s this included 34 cottages, a school, a church and a fire station – a complete working village that became known, and is still known, as Quarrier's Village. More than 800 children at a time lived at Quarrier's Village during the 1890s and as the charity expanded, up to 1500 children were accommodated at a time.

Ireland travelled to South Africa in June 2004, having won their first Triple Crown since 1985, and beaten the champions of the 2003 Rugby World Cup, England in their first home game since the final. As a result, the Irish manager, Eddie O'Sullivan, was confident that Ireland would achieve their first win over South Africa in 39 years, their only previous victory having come in Dublin in 1965. By contrast, South Africa had just changed their coach to Jake White and he had radically changed the team for his first test since taking charge of the Springboks. The first of the two game test series was played at altitude in Bloemfontein and South Africa eventually won the match 31–17, despite the scores being level at 11-all at half time. The second match was played in the Newlands Stadium in Cape Town, and was a closer affair. However, South Africa maintained their unbeaten record against Ireland on home soil by winning 26–17. ==Matches== South Africa: 15.Gaffie du Toit, 14.Breyton Paulse, 13.Marius Joubert, 12.Wayne Julies, 11.Henno Mentz, 10.Jaco van der Westhuyzen, 9.Fourie du Preez, 8.Jacques Cronje, 7.Pedrie Wannenburg, 6.Schalk Burger , 5.Victor Matfield, 4.Bakkies Botha, 3.Eddie Andrews, 2.John Smit (capt.), 1.Os du Randt, – replacements: 17.CJ van der Linde, 18.Quinton Davids, 19.Gerrie Britz – No entry : 16.Hanyani Shimange, 19.Gerrie Britz, 20.Bolla Conradie, 21.Jaque Fourie, 22.Brent Russell Ireland: 15.Girvan Dempsey, 14.Shane Horgan, 13.Brian O'Driscoll (capt.), 12.Gordon D'Arcy, 11.Geordan Murphy, 10.Ronan O'Gara, 9.Peter Stringer, 8.Anthony Foley, 7.David Wallace, 6.Simon Easterby, 5.Paul O'Connell, 4.Malcolm O'Kelly, 3.John Hayes, 2.Shane Byrne, 1.Reggie Corrigan, – replacements: 16.Frankie Sheahan, 17.Marcus Horan, 19.Alan Quinlan, 22.Kevin Maggs – No entry: 18.Donncha O'Callaghan, 20.Guy Easterby, 21.David Humphreys South Africa: 15.Percy Montgomery, 14.Breyton Paulse, 13.Marius Joubert, 12.Wayne Julies , 11.Jaque Fourie, 10.Jaco van der Westhuyzen, 9.Fourie du Preez, 8.Jacques Cronje, 7.Pedrie Wannenburg, 6.Schalk Burger, 5.Victor Matfield, 4.Quinton Davids, 3.Eddie Andrews, 2.John Smit (capt.), 1.Os du Randt, – replacements: 17.CJ van der Linde, 18.Geo Cronje, 19.Gerrie Britz, 22.Brent Russell – No entry : 16.Hanyani Shimange, 20.Bolla Conradie, 21.Gaffie du Toit Ireland: 15.Girvan Dempsey, 14.Shane Horgan, 13.Brian O'Driscoll (capt.), 12.Kevin Maggs, 11.Tyrone Howe, 10.Ronan O'Gara, 9.Peter Stringer, 8.Anthony Foley, 7.David Wallace, 6.Simon Easterby, 5.Paul O'Connell, 4.Malcolm O'Kelly, 3.John Hayes, 2.Shane Byrne, 1.Reggie Corrigan , – replacements: 16.Frankie Sheahan, 17.Marcus Horan, 18.Alan Quinlan, 19.Donncha O'Callaghan, 20.Guy Easterby, 21.David Humphreys, 22.Gavin Duffy ==Touring party== *Manager: Eddie O'Sullivan *Captain: Brian O'Driscoll ===Backs=== { - style=\\"vertical- align:top\\"  * Gordon D'Arcy (Lansdowne FC/Leinster) * Girvan Dempsey (Terenure College RFC/Leinster) * Gavin Duffy (NEC Harlequins) * Guy Easterby (Rotherham) * Shane Horgan (Lansdowne FC/Leinster) * Tyrone Howe (Dungannon RFC/Ulster)  * David Humphreys (Dungannon RFC/Ulster) * Kevin Maggs (Bath Rugby) * Geordan Murphy (Leicester Tigers) * Brian O'Driscoll (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster) * Ronan O'Gara (Cork Constitution/Munster) * Peter Stringer (Shannon RFC/Munster) } ===Forwards=== { - style=\\"vertical- align:top\\"  * Simon Best (Belfast Harlequins/Ulster) * Shane Byrne (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster) * Reggie Corrigan (Greystones RFC/Leinster) * Simon Easterby (Llanelli RFC) * Anthony Foley (Shannon RFC/Munster) * John Hayes (Shannon RFC/Munster) * Marcus Horan (Shannon RFC/Munster)  * Eric Miller (Terenure College RFC/Leinster) * Donncha O'Callaghan (Cork Constitution/Munster) * Paul O'Connell (Young Munster/Munster) * Malcolm O'Kelly (St. Mary's College RFC/Leinster) * Alan Quinlan (Shannon RFC/Munster) * Frankie Sheahan (Cork Constitution/Munster) * David Wallace (Garryowen/Munster) } ==See also== * Ireland vs South Africa at rugby union ==References== Category:Ireland national rugby union team tours Category:Rugby union tours of South Africa Ireland tour Ire tour ","title":"2004 Ireland rugby union tour of South Africa"},{"id":"19271953","text":"Boloria chariclea, the Arctic fritillary or purplish fritillary, is a butterfly of the family Nymphalidae.

In Europe it is found in northern Lapland and Russia. In North America it is found in Alaska and much of Canada, the north Cascades, the Rocky Mountains southwards to Utah and northern New Mexico, northern Minnesota, northern Maine and the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Its typical habitat is tundra, taiga, alpine meadows, stream verges and acid bogs. ==Life cycle== The males patrol along the edges of bogs and in valleys and wait for the arrival of females. The eggs are laid singly underneath the leaves of the host plant. In North America the larvae feed on viola species, dwarf willows (Salix) and possibly blueberries (Vaccinium) while in Europe it is believed to feed on yellow wood violet (Viola biflora) and Arctic white heather (Cassiope tetragona).

Stapledon's friend Naomi Mitchison also contributed a volume to the series, as did J. D. Beresford, whose 1911 novel The Hampdenshire Wonder was an inspiration for Stapledon's own novel, Odd John. ==Overview== Stapledon's book pursues themes familiar to readers of his science fiction – the universe and humanity's place in it, both personally and as a species.

Gaia is the ancestral mother of all life. She is the mother of Uranus (the sky), from whose sexual union she bore the Titans (themselves parents of many of the Olympian gods), the Cyclopes, and the Giants; of Pontus (the sea), from whose union she bore the primordial sea gods. Her equivalent in the Roman pantheon was Terra.Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia, The Book People, Haydock, 1995, p. 215. ==Etymology== The Greek name Γαῖα (Gaĩa)Entry \\"γαῖα\\", in: Liddell–Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, in the Perseus Digital Library. is a mostly epic, collateral form of Attic Γῆ (Gê),Entry \\"γῆ\\", in: Liddell–Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, in the Perseus Digital Library. and Doric Γᾶ (Gã, perhaps identical to Δᾶ Dã),Entry \\"δᾶ\\", in: Liddell–Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, in the Perseus Digital Library. both meaning \\"Earth\\".

Beekes, Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Brill, 2009, pp. 269–270 (s.v. \\"γῆ\\"). In Mycenean Greek Ma-ka (transliterated as Ma- ga, \\"Mother Gaia\\") also contains the root ga-. ==MythologyHesiod=== Hesiod's Theogony tells how, after Chaos, \\"wide-bosomed\\" Gaia (Earth) arose to be the everlasting seat of the immortals who possess Olympus above.Hesiod, Theogony 116–118. And after Gaia came \\"dim Tartarus in the depth of the wide- pathed Earth\\", and next Eros the god of love.Hesiod, Theogony 119-120. Hesiod goes on to say that Gaia brought forth her equal Uranus (Heaven, Sky) to \\"cover her on every side\\".Hesiod, Theogony 126–128. Gaia also bore the Ourea (Mountains), and Pontus (Sea), \\"without sweet union of love\\" (i.e., with no father).Gantz, p. 10; Hesiod, Theogony 129–132. Afterwards with Uranus, her son, she gave birth to the Titans, as Hesiod tells it: According to Hesiod, Gaia conceived further offspring with her son, Uranus, first the giant one- eyed Cyclopes: Brontes (\\"Thunder\\"), Steropes (\\"Lightning\\"), and Arges (\\"Bright\\");Hesiod, Theogony 139–146; cf. Apollodorus, 1.1.2. then the Hecatonchires: Cottus, Briareos, and Gyges, each with a hundred arms and fifty heads.Hesiod, Theogony 147–153; cf. Apollodorus, 1.1.1. As each of the Cyclopes and Hecatonchires were born, Uranus hid them in a secret place within Gaia, causing her great pain. So Gaia devised a plan. She created a grey flint (or adamantine) sickle. And Cronus used the sickle to castrate his father Uranus as he approached his mother, Gaia, to have sex with her. From Uranus' spilled blood, Gaia produced the Erinyes, the Giants, and the Meliae (ash-tree nymphs). From the testicles of Uranus in the sea came forth Aphrodite.Hesiod. Theogony, 154–200 By her son, Pontus, Gaia bore the sea-deities Nereus, Thaumas, Phorcys, Ceto, and Eurybia.Hesiod. Theogony, 233–239 Because Cronus had learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be overthrown by one of his children, he swallowed each of the children born to him by his Titan older sister, Rhea. But when Rhea was pregnant with her youngest child, Zeus, she sought help from Gaia and Uranus. When Zeus was born, Rhea gave Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling-clothes in his place, which Cronus swallowed, and Gaia took the child into her care.Hesiod. Theogony, 453–491 With the help of Gaia's advice,Hesiod. Theogony, 626. Zeus defeated the Titans. But afterwards, Gaia, in union with Tartarus, bore the youngest of her sons Typhon, who would be the last challenge to the authority of Zeus.Hesiod. Theogony, 820–880 Gaia hands her newborn, Erichthonius, to Athena as Hephaestus watches – an Attic red-figure stamnos, 470–460 BC ===Other sources=== According to Hyginus, Earth (Gaia), along with Heaven and Sea, were the children of Aether and Day (Hemera).Hyginus. Fabulae, Preface According to the mythographer Apollodorus, Gaia and Tartarus were the parents of Echidna.Apollodorus, 2.1.2. Zeus hid Elara, one of his lovers, from Hera by stowing her under the earth. His son by Elara, the giant Tityos, is therefore sometimes said to be a son of Gaia, the earth goddess. Gaia also made Aristaeus immortal. ==Depiction== In classical art Gaia was represented in one of two ways. In Athenian vase painting she was shown as a matronly woman only half risen from the earth, often in the act of handing the baby Erichthonius, a future king of Athens, to Athena to foster). In mosaic representations, she appears as a woman reclining upon the earth surrounded by a host of Carpi, infant gods of the fruits of the earth. ==Cult== Gaia was worshiped under the epithet \\"Anesidora\\", which means \\"giver of gifts\\".Pausanias. Description of Greece, 1.31.4Hesychius of Alexandria s.v.Scholiast, On Theocritus ii. 12. Other epithets were Calligeneia,(Aristoph. Thesm. 300, with the Schol.; Hesych. s. v.; Phot. Lex. s. v.) Eurusternos,Pausanias. Description of Greece, 7.25.13 and Pandôros.Homeros. Epigr. 7. 1; Stob. Eclog. i. p. 165, ed. Heeren. In ancient times, Gaia was mainly worshiped alongside Demeter and as a part of the cult of Demeter and does not seem to have had a separate cult. Being a chthonic deity, black animals were sacrificed to her: ===Temples=== Gaia is believed by some sourcesJoseph Fontenrose 1959 to be the original deity behind the Oracle at Delphi. It was thus said: \\"That word spoken from tree-clad mother Gaia's (Earth's) navel-stone [Delphoi].\\"Pindar. Pythian Odes, 4. line 76 Depending on the source, Gaia passed her powers on to Poseidon, Apollo, or Themis. Pausanias wrote: Apollo is the best-known as the oracle power behind Delphi, long established by the time of Homer, having killed Gaia's child Python there and usurped the chthonic power. Hera punished Apollo for this by sending him to King Admetus as a shepherd for nine years. Gaia or Ge had at least three sanctuaries in Greece which were mentioned by Pausanias. There was a temple of Ge Eurusternos on the Crathis near Aegae in Achaia with \\"a very ancient statue\\":Pausanias. Description of Greece, 7.25.13 ff Pausanias also mention the sanctuary of Ge Gasepton in Sparta,Pausanias. Description of Greece, 3.12.8 ff and a sanctuary of Ge Kourotrophe (Nurse of the Young) at Athens.Pausanias. Description of Greece, 1.22.3 ff Aside from her temples, Gaia had altars as well as sacred spaces in the sanctuaries of other gods. Close to the sanctuary of Eileithyia in Tegea was an altar of Ge;Pausanias. Description of Greece, 8.48.8 ff Phlya and Myrrhinos had an altar to Ge under the name Thea Megale (Great goddess);,Pausanias. Description of Greece, 1.31.4 as well as Olympia which additionally, similar to Delphi, also said to have had an oracle to Gaia: Her statues were naturally to be found in the temples of Demeter, such as the Temple of Demeter in Achaia: \\"They [the Patraians of Akhaia (Achaea)] have also a grove by the sea, affording in summer weather very agreeable walks and a pleasant means generally of passing the time. In this grove are also two temples of divinities, one of Apollon, the other of Aphrodite . . . Next to the grove is a sanctuary of Demeter; she and her daughter [Persephone] are standing, but the image of Ge (Earth) is seated.\\"Pausanias. Description of Greece, 7.21.11 The Temple of Zeus Olympios in Athens reportedly had an enclosure of Ge Olympia: In Athens, there was a statue of Gaia on the Acropolis depicting her beseeching Zeus for rainPausanias. Description of Greece, 1.24.3 ff. as well as an image of her close to the court of the Areopagos in Athens, alongside the statues of Plouton and Hermes, \\"by which sacrifice those who have received an acquittal on the Areopagos\\".Pausanias. Description of Greece, 1.28.6 ff. ==Interpretations== Some modern sources, such as James Mellaart, Marija Gimbutas, and Barbara Walker, claim that Gaia as Mother Earth is a later form of a pre-Indo-European Great Mother, venerated in Neolithic times. Her existence is a speculation and controversial in the academic community. Some modern mythographers, including Karl Kerenyi, Carl A. P. Ruck, and Danny Staples, interpret the goddesses Demeter the \\"mother,\\" Persephone the \\"daughter\\", and Hecate the \\"crone,\\" as aspects of a former great goddess identified by some as Rhea or as Gaia herself. In Crete, a goddess was worshiped as Potnia Theron (the \\"Mistress of the Animals\\") or simply Potnia (\\"Mistress\\"), speculated as Rhea or Gaia; the title was later applied in Greek texts to Artemis. The mother goddess Cybele from Anatolia (modern Turkey) was partly identified by the Greeks with Gaia, but more so with Rhea.Aion and Tellus Mater with Carpi, infant deities of the fruit of the seasons, in a mosaic from a Roman villa in Sentinum, first half of the third century BC, (Munich Glyptothek, Inv. W504) == Neopaganism == Many neopagans worship Gaia. Beliefs regarding Gaia vary, ranging from the belief that Gaia is the Earth to the belief that she is the spiritual embodiment of the earth or the goddess of the Earth. Compare: ==Modern ecological theory== The mythological name was revived in 1979 by James Lovelock, in Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth; his Gaia hypothesis was supported by Lynn Margulis. The hypothesis proposes that living organisms and inorganic material are part of a dynamical system that shapes the Earth's biosphere, and maintains the Earth as a fit environment for life. In some Gaia theory approaches, the Earth itself is viewed as an organism with self-regulatory functions. Further books by Lovelock and others popularized the Gaia Hypothesis, which was embraced to some extent by New Age environmentalists as part of the heightened awareness of environmental concerns of the 1990s. == Family  Olympian descendants =Children=== Gaia is the personification of the Earth, and these are her offspring as related in various myths. Some are related consistently, some are mentioned only in minor variants of myths, and others are related in variants that are considered to reflect a confusion of the subject or association. * No father ** Uranus ** Pontus ** Ourea ** Nesoi ** The Autochthons: Cecrops, Palaechthon, Pelasgus, Alalcomeneus, Dysaules, Cabeirus, Phlyus, and Leitus.Euripides, Iphigenia in Aulis 259 * with her son, Uranus ** The Titans: Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Iapetus, Hyperion, Theia, Themis, Tethys, Phoebe, Mnemosyne, Rhea, and Cronus. ** The Cyclopes: Arges, Brontes, and Steropes. ** The Hecatonchires: Briareus, Cottus, and Gyes. ** The Meliae 1 ** The Curetes 1&2 ** The Erinyes 1: Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone. ** The Gigantes 1: Porphyrion, Alcyoneus, Ephialtes, Eurytus, Clytius, Mimas, Pallas, Polybotes, Enceladus, Hippolytus, Gration, Agrius, and Thoas. ** The Elder Muses: Mneme, Melete, and Aoide. ** The Telchines: Actaeus, Megalesius, Ormenus, and Lycus. ** AetnaAlcimus, ap.

Uranus is associated with the Roman god Caelus.Grimal, s.v. \\"Caelus\\" p. 38.Varro, De lingua Latina 5.58.Marion Lawrence, \\"The Velletri Sarcophagus\\", American Journal of Archaeology 69.3 (1965), p. 220. In Ancient Greek literature, Uranus or Father Sky was the son and husband of Gaia, the primordial Mother Earth. According to Hesiod's Theogony, Uranus was conceived by Gaia alone, but other sources cite Aether as his father.Alcman, Frag 61, Callimachus, Frag 498, Cicero, De Natura Deorum 3.17. Uranus and Gaia were the parents of the first generation of Titans, and the ancestors of most of the Greek gods, but no cult addressed directly to Uranus survived into Classical times,\\"We did not regard them as being in any way worthy of worship,\\" Karl Kerenyi, speaking for the ancient Greeks, said of the Titans (Kerenyi, p. 20); \\"with the single exception, perhaps, of Cronos; and with the exception, also, of Helios.\\" and Uranus does not appear among the usual themes of Greek painted pottery. Elemental Earth, Sky, and Styx might be joined, however, in a solemn invocation in Homeric epic.As at Homer, Iliad 15.36 ff., Odyssey 5.184 ff. ==Etymology== Most linguists trace the etymology the name to a Proto-Greek form *Worsanós (),Originally reconstructed in: Johann Baptist Hofmann, Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Griechischen (Munich: R. Oldenbourg, 1950). enlarged from *ṷorsó- (also found in Greek () 'to urinate', Sanskrit varṣá 'rain', Hittite ṷarša- 'fog, mist').Robert S. P. Beekes, Etymological Dictionary of Greek, vol. 2 (Leiden: Brill, 2009), 1128–1129. The basic Indo- European root is *ṷérs- 'to rain, moisten' (also found in Greek eérsē 'dew', Sanskrit várṣati 'to rain', or Avestan aiβi.varəšta 'it rained on'), making Ouranos the \\"rain-maker\\", or the \\"lord of rains\\". A less likely etymology is a derivative meaning 'the one standing on high' from PIE *ṷérso- (cf. Sanskrit várṣman 'height, top', Lithuanian viršùs 'upper, highest seat', Russian verx 'height, top'). Of some importance in the comparative study of Indo-European mythology is the identification by Georges Dumézil (1934)Georges Dumézil, Ouranos-Varuna – Essai de mythologie comparée indo-européenne (Paris: G.-P. Maisonneuve, 1934). of Uranus with the Vedic deity Váruṇa (Mitanni Aruna), god of the sky and waters, but the etymological equation is now considered untenable.Manfred Mayrhofer, Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen, vol. 2, s.v. “Váruṇa” (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1996), 515–6. Edgar C. Polomé, “Binder-god”, in Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture (London–Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997), 65. ==Family Genealogy === In Hesiod's Theogony, Uranus is the offspring of Gaia, the earth goddess.Hesiod, Theogony 126 ff.. Alcman and Callimachus elaborate that Uranus was fathered by Aether, the god of heavenly light and the upper air. While the mythographer Apollodorus, without giving any ancestors, says simply that Uranus was \\"the first who ruled the whole world.\\"Apollodorus, 1.1.1. Under the influence of the philosophers, Cicero, in De Natura Deorum (\\"Concerning the Nature of the Gods\\"), claims that he was the offspring of the ancient gods Aether and Hemera, Air and Day. According to the Orphic Hymns, Uranus was the son of Nyx, the personification of night. Uranus was the brother of Pontus, the God of the sea.Donna Jo Napoli, \\"Treasury of Greek Mythology: Classic Stories of Gods, Goddesses, Heroes & Monsters\\" ===Descendants=== According to Hesiod's Theogony, Uranus mated with Gaia, and she gave birth to the twelve Titans: Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Tethys and Cronus; the Cyclopes: Brontes, Steropes and Arges; and the Hecatoncheires (\\"Hundred-Handed Ones\\"): Cottus, Briareus, and Gyges.Hesiod, Theogony 132-153\\\\. Compare with Apollodorus, 1.1.1-3, which first mentions the Hecatoncheires, whom he names as Briareus, \\"Gyes\\" and Cottus, then the Cyclopes and the Titans. Further, according to the Theogony, when Cronus castrated Uranus, from Uranus' blood, which splattered onto the earth, came the Erinyes (Furies), the Giants, and the Meliae. Also, according to the Theogony, Cronus threw the severed genitals into the sea (Thalassa), around which \\"a white foam spread\\" and \\"grew\\" into the goddess Aphrodite,Hesiod, Theogony 173-206. although according to Homer, Aphrodite was the daughter of Zeus and Dione.Homer, Iliad 3.374, 5.370-71, 20.105, Odyssey 8.308, 320; see Gantz, pp. 99-100. === List of the children of Uranus and Gaea === {  ! colspan=\\"2\\" Titans !Cyclopes !Erinyes 1 ! colspan=\\"2\\" Gigantes 1 !Telchines !Others - • Oceanus • Themis • Arges • Alecto • Porphyrion • Pallas • Actaeus • Meliae1 - • Coeus • Tethys • Brontes • Megaera • Alcyoneus • Polybotes • Megalesius • Curetes 1&2 - • Crius • Phoebe • Steropes • Tisiphone • Ephialtes • Enceladus • Ormenus • AetnaAlcimus, ap.

Uranus came every night to cover the earth and mate with Gaia, but he hated the children she bore him. Hesiod named their first six sons and six daughters the Titans, the three one-hundred-handed giants the Hekatonkheires, and the one-eyed giants the Cyclopes. Uranus imprisoned Gaia's youngest children in Tartarus, deep within Earth, where they caused pain to Gaia. She shaped a great flint-bladed sickle and asked her sons to castrate Uranus. Only Cronus, youngest and most ambitious of the Titans, was willing: he ambushed his father and castrated him, casting the severed testicles into the sea. For this fearful deed, Uranus called his sons Titanes Theoi, or \\"Straining Gods.\\"Modern etymology suggests that the linguistic origin of Τιτάνες lies on the pre-Greek level. From the blood that spilled from Uranus onto the Earth came forth the Giants, the Erinyes (the avenging Furies), the Meliae (the ash- tree nymphs), and, according to some, the Telchines. From the genitals in the sea came forth Aphrodite. The learned Alexandrian poet CallimachusCallimachus, Aitia (\\"On Origins\\"), from book II, fragment 43, discussed by Lane Fox, pp. 270 ff.; Lane Fox notes that Zancle was founded in the 8th century BC. reported that the bloodied sickle had been buried in the earth at Zancle in Sicily, but the Romanized Greek traveller Pausanias was informed that the sickle had been thrown into the sea from the cape near Bolina, not far from Argyra on the coast of Achaea, whereas the historian Timaeus located the sickle at Corcyra;Reported by the scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica, 4.984, (Lane Fox, p. 274 n. 36). Corcyrans claimed to be descendants of the wholly legendary Phaeacia visited by Odysseus, and by circa 500 BCE one Greek mythographer, Acusilaus, was claiming that the Phaeacians had sprung from the very blood of Uranus' castration.Acusilaus, in FrGH vol. 2, fragment 4, noted by Lane Fox, p. 274 n. 37 After Uranus was deposed, Cronus re-imprisoned the Hekatonkheires and Cyclopes in Tartarus. Uranus and Gaia then prophesied that Cronus in turn was destined to be overthrown by his own son, and so the Titan attempted to avoid this fate by devouring his young. Zeus, through deception by his mother Rhea, avoided this fate. These ancient myths of distant origins were not expressed in cults among the Hellenes.Kerényi, p. 20. The function of Uranus was as the vanquished god of an elder time, before real time began. After his castration, the Sky came no more to cover the Earth at night, but held to its place, and \\"the original begetting came to an end\\" (Kerényi). Uranus was scarcely regarded as anthropomorphic, aside from the genitalia in the castration myth. He was simply the sky, which was conceived by the ancients as an overarching dome or roof of bronze, held in place (or turned on an axis) by the Titan Atlas. In formulaic expressions in the Homeric poems ouranos is sometimes an alternative to Olympus as the collective home of the gods; an obvious occurrence would be the moment in Iliad 1.495, when Thetis rises from the sea to plead with Zeus: \\"and early in the morning she rose up to greet Ouranos-and-Olympus and she found the son of Kronos ...\\" William Sale remarks that \\"... 'Olympus' is almost always used of [the home of the Olympian gods], but ouranos often refers to the natural sky above us without any suggestion that the gods, collectively live there\\". Sale concluded that the earlier seat of the gods was the actual Mount Olympus, from which the epic tradition by the time of Homer had transported them to the sky, ouranos. By the sixth century, when a \\"heavenly Aphrodite\\" (Aphrodite Urania) was to be distinguished from the \\"common Aphrodite of the people\\", ouranos signifies purely the celestial sphere itself. ===Hurrian mythology=== The Greek creation myth is similar to the Hurrian creation myth. In Hurrian religion Anu is the sky god. His son Kumarbis bit off his genitals and spat out three deities, one of whom, Teshub, later deposed Kumarbis.Guterbock, Hans Gustav. \\"Hittite Religion\\" in Forgotten Religions including some Primitive Religions\\" ed. Vergilius Firm. NY Philadelphia Library 1950: 88f,103f. In Sumerian mythology and later for Assyrians and Babylonians, Anu is the sky god and represented law and order. It is possible that Uranus was originally an Indo-European god, to be identified with the Vedic , the supreme keeper of order who later became the god of oceans and rivers, as suggested by Georges Dumézil, following hints in Émile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of Religious Life (1912).The Durkheim connection was noted by Arnoldo Momigliano, \\"Georges Dumezil and the Trifunctional Approach to Roman Civilization\\", History and Theory, 1984; a link between Uranus and Varuna was suggested as early as 1824 by Albrecht Weber, Modern investigations on ancient India: A lecture delivered in Berlin March 4, 1824, 1857. Another of Dumézil's theories is that the Iranian supreme God Ahura Mazda is a development of the Indo-Iranian *vouruna-*mitra.Georges Dumézil, Mitra Varuna: Essai sur deux représentations indo-européenes de la souveraineté (Paris: Gallimard, 1948). English translation: Mitra-Varuna: an Essay on Two Indo-European Representations of Sovereignty, trans. Derek Coltman (New York: Zone Books, 1988). Therefore, this divinity has also the qualities of Mitra, which is the god of the falling rain.According to Dumézil, Varuna is the god of \\"masses of water\\", while falling rain is rather related to Mitra. ===Uranus and Váruṇa=== Uranus is connected with the night sky, and Váruṇa is the god of the sky and the celestial ocean, which is connected with the Milky Way. Georges Dumézil made a cautious case for the identity of Uranus and Vedic at the earliest Indo-European cultural level. Dumézil's identification of mythic elements shared by the two figures, relying to a great extent on linguistic interpretation, but not positing a common origin, was taken up by Robert Graves and others. The identification of the name Ouranos with the Hindu Váruṇa, based in part on a posited PIE root *-ŭer with a sense of \\"binding\\"—ancient king god Váruṇa binds the wicked, ancient king god Uranus binds the Cyclops, who had tormented him. The most probable etymology is from Proto-Greek *(W)orsanόj (worsanos) from a PIE root *ers \\"to moisten, to drip\\" (referring to the rain). ==Cultural context of flint== The detail of the sickle's being flint rather than bronze or even iron was retained by Greek mythographers (though neglected by Roman ones). Knapped flints as cutting edges were set in wooden or bone sickles in the late Neolithic, before the onset of the Bronze Age. Such sickles may have survived latest in ritual contexts where metal was taboo, but the detail, which was retained by classical Greeks, suggests the antiquity of the mytheme. ==Planet Uranus== The ancient Greeks and Romans knew of only five \\"wandering stars\\" ( ): Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Following the discovery of a sixth planet in 1781 using a telescope, there was long-term disagreement regarding its name. Its discoverer William Herschel named it Georgium Sidus (The Georgian Star) after his monarch George III. This was the name preferred by English astronomers, but others such as the French preferred \\"Herschel\\". Finally, the name Uranus became accepted in the mid-19th century, as suggested by astronomer Johann Bode as the logical addition to the existing planets' names, since Mars (Ares in Greek), Venus, and Mercury were the children of Jupiter, Jupiter (Zeus in Greek) the son of Saturn, and Saturn (Cronus in Greek) the son of Uranus. What is anomalous is that, while the others take Roman names, Uranus is a name derived from Greek in contrast to the Roman Caelus. ==NotesReferences== * Apollodorus, Apollodorus, The Library, with an English Translation by Sir James George Frazer, F.B.A., F.R.S. in 2 Volumes.

He grew up in south Texas, in and around Goliad County. == Life == He is most well known as a member of the Bill Whitley gang (though it is today sometimes referred to as the Brack Cornett gang). The gang was formed in February 1887 to rob trains, but their first outing in early May 1887 was a bust. However, on 18 May, they robbed the Missouri-Pacific train while it was stopped at McNeill Junction, thirteen miles outside of San Antonio, getting away with about $4,000. The next month they robbed the east bound train from San Antonio near Flatonia, in Fayette County, getting away with over $7,000. In 1888, Whitley, Cornett, and the gang robbed the bank in Cisco, Texas, escaping with $25,000. Several days later they stopped an I&GN; train and stole $20,000. On June 18, 1888, Cornett, using the alias \\"Captain Dick\\" led the band that robbed the Southern Pacific near Schulenburg, Texas. It was \\"the most daring train robbery that ever occurred in Texas\\", according to The New York Times. Later that same year Cornett and the gang planned to rob a Southern Pacific train out of Harwood, Texas, on September 22. U.S. Marshal John Rankin somehow received advance notice of the robbers' plans and hid himself, Deputy Duval West, and a number of Texas Rangers on board the train. Just three miles outside of town, the gang stopped the train and attempted to rob it but were driven off by the lawmen. However, the gang then went on to successful rob another train near Flatonia, Texas. On September 25, 1888, in Floresville, Wilson County, Texas, the gang was run to ground by a contingent of U.S. Marshals. There was a massive shootout in which Bill Whitley was killed and one other gang member taken prisoner. Cornett himself fled alone on horseback. There are two stories about how Cornett met his death at the hands of Texas lawmanAlle at the time was at best a county deputy sheriff, and may have lacked jurisdiction as a lawman. Alfred Allee near the town of Frio, Texas. In one version, Cornett was tracked down and shot dead in a gun battle; in the other, Cornett, on the lam, sought out his childhood friend Allee on his La Salle County ranch just south of Frio; Allee welcomed him with a six-shooter instead of breakfast. Regardless, Allee collected various express company rewards of $3,800 for bringing down Cornett. == Aliases == * Harrington * Jones * George Lacy * James W.

Land usage is 87.5% natural, 4.6% agricultural, and 7.9% other. Eutrophication issues have been a serious issue of the lake that was first observed in 1967. The main issue was microcystis algae bloom and reached its highest cell count of 2,500,000 cells/mL in July–October 1979 (data from 1985). Most vegetation grown around the lake are grassland and weeds while most crops grown are rice and vegetables. Fertilizer application for crops near the lake is moderate. ==Recreational uses== Because of the lake's creation in 1947, it displaced the careers of many local fishermen in the area.Green Gables information on Lake Sagami . Accessed September 9, 2008. In return for their livelihood being taken away, many of these families were offered rental boats in the new lake. No private boats are allowed on the lake as a result. To compensate for the loss of the smelt, black bass from the United States was imported to the lake as was Prussian carp. Because of the bass, the lake is a popular recreational fishing area. The lake is also used for couples dating for boat rides and families.

Initially, they worked mainly for the music industry, designing record sleeves, but soon they started working in the worlds of fashion and art. Their first fashion assignment was to design the worldwide launch of Yohji Yamamoto’s Y’s range in 1993. Next, they designed campaigns for Jil Sander and graphics for Martine Sitbon.

They created works for Yohji Yamamoto, Balenciaga, Givenchy, Calvin Klein, Björk’s sleeves and the video for Hidden Place, and more art-oriented works such as The Alphabet (2001), and The Alphamen (2003), two projects based on creating typography out of portraits of models, which were published in V magazine. Many of the posters M/M designed with van Lamsweerde & Matadin are manipulated or drawn-upon photographs (see e.g. their poster series Punctuation from 2010, or the poster Balenciaga (Delfine)). The purpose of this method is to accentuate hidden aspects of the photograph.Spex #329: Mode-Interview: M/M (Paris), p. 64ff. In 2001 they were appointed as art directors and creative consultants to the French edition of Vogue by Carine Roitfeld, until their position was taken over by Fabien Baron in 2003. Between 1997 and 2001 M/M worked as visiting professors at the École cantonale d'art de Lausanne (ECAL) in Lausanne, Switzerland, holding several student workshops, including the exploration of fashion and identity in Milneufcentseptantesix - Ready made characters for our generation with van Lamsweerde & Matadin, which was exhibited at Espace Lausannois d'Art Contemporain in 2001. In 2000 M/M collaborated with artists Pierre Huyghe and Philippe Parreno on the \\"No Ghost Just A Shell\\" project, and worked again together in 2002 designing the interior of Café Etienne Marcel in Paris. In 2004 they designed the sets for Éric Vigner staging of the baroque opera Antigona by Tommaso Traetta, out of which they directed the short movie \\"Antigone Under Hypnosis. For his \\"highly experimental iconography\\" contribution to the Traetta's Antigone, M/M was awarded in 2017 with the Traetta Prize. Since 2006, and the \\"re-birth\\" of Purple Fashion, they have acted as creative consultants for the magazine and redesigned its visual structure. Between 2007 and 2009, they worked as creative directors of Arena Homme +, \\"the world's leading men's fashion magazine\\". In January 2008, the Centre Pompidou hosted their first museum retrospective in a show called Vision Tenace, arranged around the presentation of their \\"Art Posters\\" series of on-going collaborations with contemporary artists and institutions. In January 2009, they were appointed as creative directors of Interview Magazine, succeeding Fabien Baron, who unexpectedly left soon after relaunching the magazine. Five months later, in June 2009, they stopped working after Brant Publications, Interview Magazine parent company allegedly in turmoil, failed to pay their fees and expenses for over 3 months.

It was established in 1891 as the City Parochial Foundation and changed its name to Trust for London in 2010. It achieves its aims by funding charitable work. It makes grants totalling around £7 million per annum. As an independent funder it is particularly interested in work which is viewed as challenging. One of its long standing principles is to support activities which government will not or is unlikely to fund. ==History== On 10 August 1878 a Royal Commission was established to investigate the parochial charities. It reported on 12 March 1880, which led to the City of London Parochial Charities Act 1883. This provided that the five largest parishes should continue to administer their own charitable endowments, but that the charities of the remaining 107 parishes (consisting of about 1,400 separate charitable gifts and bequests stretching back over 400 years) should be administered by a new corporate body officially called the Trustees of the London Parochial Charities. For most of its history it was known as City Parochial Foundation but since 2010 has been known as Trust for London. A Central Governing Body (CGB) was established for the Trustees, consisting of 21 members, nominated by the Crown, the Corporation of the City of London, the London County Council, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, the Senate of the University of London, the Councils of University College, London and King's College, London, the Council of the City and Guilds of London Institute, and the Governing Bodies of the Bishopsgate Foundation and the Cripplegate Foundation. There are now 17 members, mostly now nominated by the Trust itself, although some members are still nominated by London Councils, the Greater London Authority, the Church Commissioners, and the Corporation of the City of London. The Trust assumed trusteeship of the City Church Fund, which held the ecclesiastical endowments. In 1899, it also assumed trusteeship of the Chelsea Physic Garden, which it held until 1983. In 1933, it also took over the People's Palace and Four Boroughs' Fund, in 1957 the new Sion Hospital (London) Charity, in 1966 the Whitley House Charity, and in 1982 the Ratcliff Fund. ==References== *City Parochial Foundation Report on Current Policy relating to Grants and Loans 1982-86, July 1982 ==External links== *Trust for London website Category:Organisations based in the City of London Category:Religion in the City of London Category:1891 establishments in England Category:Charities based in London Category:Organizations established in 1891 Category:Christianity in London ","title":"Trust for London"},{"id":"19272239","text":"Ion Gonța (born 22 October 1978, in Chișinău) is a Moldovan light middleweight boxer based in Chişinău.

The males search for females in wet areas. The butterfly has the subspecies triclaris (from Newfoundland to Alberta), nichollae (Alberta), and denali (Alaska and northern Yukon). The butterfly flies close to the ground. The species is listed as vulnerable. They eat nectar from flowers including Labrador tea and goldenrod. The species flies from the end of May till the beginning of August. The butterfly can be distinguished from similar species by looking on the hindwing underside; this species is the only one with a row of silvery submarginal spots.

The species is not mentioned in the Red Data Book of Serbian butterflies because it was not known to be in the country at the time of it being published. The species is commonly found in open acid bogs in areas that are moist. It can also be found in moist tundra and willow seeps. ==Caterpillars== The eggs are laid in groups of 2 to 4 under the host plant leaves. The eggs hatch in 7 to 8 days and after hatching, they feed on the underside of the leaves on the host plant. Caterpillars in Colorado and Wyoming are reddish brown with red spines, with third or fourth instars hibernating. The caterpillars feed on Viola species and willows. The caterpillars can be found from April to June. The caterpillars are silver gray with white dots. ==BehaviorMating system and migration=== Proclossiana eunomia exhibits a polygynous mating system which is quite common in butterflies with short breeding periods. With breeding periods of 5 and 7 days, respectively for males and females, there is little time to maximize matings. The butterfly Proclossiana eunomia wants to pass on as many genes as it can in its short lifespan and thus males do not discriminate, trying to court all females they encounter. On the other hand, females are a bit more selective and have been observed to refuse incoming males either by displaying a mate-refusal posture or by simply fleeing away. This pattern of mating affects the migratory behavior of Proclossiana eunomia. This physical moving of individual of a species is dependent on the density of the population. At high male densities females are harassed by willing males, resulting in female-biased emigration where females leave the imminent area. At low male densities, females are not bothered and are safe to stay in their local environment. In addition, at low female densities males might begin to emigrate out of the area in search for new unmated females whereas at high female density males already enjoy a wide selection of females without a need to migrate. The polygynous mating system of the bog fritillary whereby males freely pursue females induces a change in migratory behavior. ==References *Butterflies of Europe Category:Boloria Category:Butterflies of Europe ","title":"Boloria eunomia"},{"id":"19272261","text":"Chacarita may refer to: * Chacarita, Buenos Aires * Chacarita Juniors, soccer club in Argentina * Chacarita, Costa Rica * Chacarita Airport, ICAO MRCH (List of airports in Costa Rica) * Chacarita, slang word for 'shantytown' in Paraguay ","title":"Chacarita"},{"id":"19272271","text":"Weapon of Choice is a band from Los Angeles fronted by bass player Lonnie Marshall.

He grew up and attended school in South Central Los Angeles, graduating from Mid City Alternative Magnet School. While in school, Marshall was exposed to P-Funk through a classmate whose father worked for Parliament / Funkadelic. That connection allowed Marshall and his brother Arik to experience the original P-Funk up close and proved to be a highly influential event in his life, inspiring him to pursue a career in music and to create his own brand of funk music which he calls Nutmeg.Perfect Sound Forever Weapon of Choice: Nutmeg Rising He briefly attended Los Angeles City College after high school, majoring in Music, and worked for a short time as a walking messenger for downtown Los Angeles law firms.

Polish gentry until 1830 were considered available soldiers for conscription or draft. ===1768 - The Bar Confederation and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth=== Polish students in Russian exile Many Poles were exiled to Siberia, starting with the 18th-century opponents of the Russian Empire's increasing influence in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (most notably the members of the Bar Confederation).Norman Davies, Europe: A History, Oxford University Press, 1996, , Google Print, p.664 === Tsarist Russia until 1917=== Christmas Eve in Siberia by Jacek Malczewski (1892) Speakers of Polish in the Russian Empire by region according to the 1897 Imperial Russian Census After the change in Russian penal law in 1847, exile and penal labor (katorga) became common penalties to the participants of national uprisings within the Russian Empire. This led to increasing number of Poles being sent to Siberia for katorga, they were known as Sybiraks. Some of them remained there, forming a Polish minority in Siberia. Most of them came from the participants and supporters of the 19th century November Uprising and January Uprising, Jerzy Jan Lerski, Piotr Wróbel, Richard J. Kozicki, Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966-1945, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, , Google Print, 538 the participants of the 1905-1907 unrest to the hundreds of thousands of people deported in the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939. Originally, 148 Polish exiles were stationed in the Orenburg province, but by the beginning of June 1864, 278 people had been sent to the Orenburg governate to take up residence under the supervision of the police, and by mid-1865, 506 people. In addition, 831 people were identified for establishment on the state lands of the Orenburg and Chelyabinsk districts, of which 754 people were allocated to Ufa. There were about 20,000 Poles living in Siberia around the 1860s. An unsuccessful uprising of Polish political exiles in Siberia broke out in 1866. In the late 19th century there was also a limited number of Polish voluntary settlers, attracted by the economic development of the region. Polish migrants and exiles, many of whom were forbidden to move away from the region even after finishing serving their sentence, formed a vibrant Polish minority there. Hundreds of Poles took part in the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway. Notable Polish scholars studied in Siberia, among them Aleksander Czekanowski, Jan Czerski, Benedykt Dybowski, Wiktor Godlewski, Sergiusz Jastrzebski, Edward Piekarski, Bronisław Piłsudski, Wacław Sieroszewski, Mikołaj Witkowski and others. ===In the Soviet Union=== Polish church in Steindamm was demolished by the Soviet administration in Kaliningrad in 1950. Millions of Poles lived within the Russian Empire as the Russian Revolution of 1917 started followed by the Russian Civil War. While some Poles associated with the communist movement, the majority of the Polish population saw cooperation with Bolshevik forces as betrayal and treachery of Polish national interests.J. M. Kupczak \\"Stosunek władz bolszewickich do polskiej ludności na Ukrainie (1921–1939)Wrocławskie Studia Wschodnie 1 (1997) Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Wrocławskiego , 1997 page 47–62\\" IPN Bulletin 11(34) 2003 Marian Lutosławski and his brother Józef, the father of the Polish composer Witold Lutosławski, were murdered in Moscow in 1918 as \\"counter-revolutionaries\\". Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz lived through the Russian Revolution in St. Petersburg, which had a profound effect on his works, many of which displayed themes of the horrors of social revolution. Famous revolutionaries with Polish origins include Konstantin Rokossovsky, Julian Marchlewski, Karol Świerczewski and Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Cheka secret police which would later turn into the NKVD. However, according to their ideology they did not identify as Poles or with Poland, and members of the communist party viewed themselves as Soviet citizens without any national sentiments. The Soviet Union also organized Polish units in the Red Army and a Polish Communist government-in-exile. ===In modern Russia=== There were 73,000 Polish nationals living in Russia according to the 2002 Russian Census. This includes autochthonous Poles as well as those forcibly deported during and after World War II; the total number of Poles in what was the former Soviet Union is estimated at up to 3 million. The number of Polish speaking people in Russia was 47,125 in 2010. ==Gallery== Image:Russia-Sebezh-Church of Holy Trinity-1.jpgHoly Trinity Church, Sebezh (1648) Image:Преображенский костел.

Zalul seeks to put a stop to the spillage of sewage and other toxic wastes into Israel's rivers through legal and legislative reforms.http://www.zalul.org.il Zalul home-page Beach-cleaning campaign ==Projects and campaigns== Zalul has worked to save the coral reef in the Gulf of Eilat and rescue the Naaman River near Acre, Israel. The coral reef campaign led to the creation of a safety phosphate mechanism in the port of Eilat and improvements to the city's sewage system. Fish cages in the Gulf of Eilat that were deemed harmful to the life of the reef will be removed from the sea. Large-scale demonstrations have been held protesting the pollution of the Kishon. Zalul's report has prompted the Ministry of the Environment to investigate the problem and introduce clean-up measures. The Naaman river near Acre in northern Israel has been polluted by factory waste. Zalul's campaign resulted in the construction of Acco's first sewage treatment facility. Zalul drew public attention to frequent sewage spills into the sea in Herzliya, near some of the country's most popular beaches. Shafdan, Israel's major waste- treatment facility and one of the largest in the world, was spilling sludge into the Mediterranean. Zalul's protest campaign culminated in legal action against Shafdan. “Don’t Say Kaddish for the Lachish” is Zalul’s slogan for a campaign to save the Lachish River, which runs between the cities of Ashkelon and Ashdod. Zalul's petition against the operation of the ALA Pipeline, which was spilling sewage into the Gulf of Acco was signed by over 10,000 Acco residents. ==Education and outreach== Keeping with Zalul's goal of providing concrete solutions for better environmental policy, the Environmental Economics Outreach Center serves as an environmental economic advocacy and advisory body. Recognizing the need for educational programs to promote beach and marine ecosystem protection, Zalul is developing curriculum and lesson plans for schools and youth groups.

Former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, Sheila Copps, Gerard Kennedy, and Michael Ignatieff were among notable Liberals at this rally. The 2008 Canadian federal election (more formally, the 40th Canadian General Election) was held on Tuesday, October 14, 2008 to elect members to the House of Commons of Canada of the 40th Canadian Parliament after the previous parliament had been dissolved by the Governor General on September 7, 2008. The election yielded a minority government under the Conservative Party of Canada, led by the incumbent Prime Minister, Stephen Harper. The election call resulted in the cancellation of four federal by-elections that had been scheduled to occur in September. ==Timeline== *February 6, 2006: Harper Cabinet is sworn in. Liberal David Emerson crosses the floor to join the new government thus changing the standings in the Canadian House of Commons to Conservatives 125, Liberals 102, BQ 51, NDP 29, Independent 1.

The digitized images of seeds offer an important new aid for teaching seed identification—a fundamental skill in plant propagation, hybridization, and distribution—and serve as a resource for nurserymen, horticulturists, botanical curators, taxonomists, ecologists, and the general public. SHIP also provides an online resource for botanical institutions and nurseries to verify their collections and inventories. SHIP is made possible through the generous support of the Stanley Smith Horticultural Trust, Cabot Family Charitable Trust, and the J. Frank Schmidt Family Charitable Foundation. ==FacilitiesThe Arnold Arboretum=== The Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, founded in 1872, is an arboretum located in the Jamaica Plain, and Roslindale sections of Boston, Massachusetts. It was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and is the second largest \\"link\\" in the Emerald Necklace. ===Dana Greenhouse=== Construction of the Charles Stratton Dana Greenhouses began in May 1961 and the facility was operational by March 1962. The project was made possible by a generous donation by Martha Dana, who divided the income of her estate equally between the Arnold Arboretum, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. The donation to the Arboretum honored her father and his lasting interest in the institution. The four-and-a-half-acre plot contains a main building with four attached glasshouses measuring 17x51 feet each, a cold storage house, a bonsai house containing the Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection, a permanent shade house, and four nurseries. The main building contains work space with potting benches, vulcathane-surfaced tables, stainless steel sinks and computer stations with a thermal transfer printer for label-making, a cold storage room for seed stratification and propagule storage, a laboratory for cytological and morphological research, a conference room, office space, a small library, and a lunch room with complete locker facilities for staff. ===The Seed Herbarium=== Beginning in the 1960s, Arnold Arboretum propagator Al Fordham created a seed herbarium in the Dana Greenhouse. Collecting the seed of several hundred rare and unusual taxa, Fordham envisioned a unique resource for the identification and propagation of woody plants from around the world. Carrying forward Fordham’s vision, Arboretum greenhouse staff continued to collect seed, and today maintain a seed herbarium of more than 2,000 samples, almost a third of which are from accessioned plants in the living collection. The SHIP team installed an on-location archival image library, which holds digital seed herbarium images. Each folder is alphabetically maintained including prints of the actual color photographs of the digital electronic files. SHIP has taken care to produce photographs on archival paper, filed them into acid-free, gov-spec folders to withstand consistent observation, and developed a nondestructive way to observe and diagnose seed identity. \\"On occasion, seed of rare and endangered species need immediate propagation, limiting our opportunities for studying physical characteristics. With digital imaging now an important protocol at the greenhouse, selected seed will go directly to the SHIP lab for documentation, preserving the integrity of the propagule in digital format. As such, even seed that requires immediate propagation will leave behind a visual record for future study\\"—Julie McIntosh Shapiro. ==Mission== The Seed Herbarium Image Project (SHIP) began in 2003 and has completed photography for the Arboretum’s six national collections within the North American Plant Collections Consortium (NAPCC): Acer (Maples), Carya (Hickory), Fagus (Beech), Stewartia, Syringa (Lilacs), and Tsuga (Hemlock). Acer, Stewartia, and Syringa were a focus in 2007. Using new protocols and equipment developed for micro- photography, SHIP is documenting species within the Ericaceae (Heath Family). The Arnold Arboretums’ introductions of Ericaceae include Rhododendron schlippenbachii, R. vaseyi, and R. mucronulatum, all plants of importance to ornamental horticulture. The Arnold collection also includes rare and endangered plants such as Leiophyllum buxifolium and Elliottia racemosa. Even early introductions of agricultural crops, such as Vaccinium angustifolium and V. corymbosum are well represented. SHIP is also working to document seed from our collection of Center for Plant Conservation (CPC) plants. All records for the image initiative are catalogued in the arboretum's collections management database, BG-BASE. Search functionality is hosted by the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. The Arnold Arboretum's Seed Herbarium collections can be viewed in the online herbarium database and can be searched by entering the scientific name, family name, or Arboretum accession number. To date, seeds of the following genera are available through this resource: Abies, Acacia, Acer, Actinidia, Albizia, Alnus, Amorpha, Andromeda, Aralia, Arctostaphylos, Aronia, Berberis, Betula, Broussonetia, Buddleia, Callicarpa, Calycanthus, Carpinus, Carya, Cedrus, Celastrus, Celtis, Cephalanthus, Cercidiphyllum, Ceonothus, Elliottia, Enkianthus, Erica, Fagus, Ilex, Rhododendron, Stewartia, Syringa, Tsuga, Zabelia. The SHIP team has also compiled a gallery of closely allied species. The digital format and online availability allows for specimens to be used for study and comparison in new ways by online users all around the world. ==External links== * Center for Plant Conservation (CPC) * International Plant Propagators Society * North American Plant Collections Consortium * The Arnold Arboretum * The Arnold Arboretum Online Herbaria * Israel Gene Bank ==References== * Arnoldia 22:5-6 May 11, 1962 * * Harvard University Gazette Online April 10, 2008 * Silva - The Newsmagazine of the Arnold Arboretum Fall/Winter 2006–2007 * The Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University Category:Arnold Arboretum ","title":"Seed Herbarium Image Project"},{"id":"19272672","text":"Douthat may refer to: * Anita Douthat (born 1950), photographer * Douthat, Oklahoma, a ghost town * Douthat State Park, Virginia * Ross Douthat (born 1979), American conservative author and journalist ","title":"Douthat"},{"id":"19272679","text":"Koosick Bluff is a volcanic bluff in Cassiar Land District (Stikine Country) in northern British Columbia, Canada.

It is owned by the St. Mary's Airport Authority. == Facilities and aircraft == St. Marys Airport covers an area of at an elevation of 23 feet (7 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 4/22 is 5,021 by 100 feet (1,530 x 30 m) and 13/31 is 4,000 by 75 feet (1,219 x 23 m). For the 12-month period ending June 20, 2011, the airport had 4,000 aircraft operations, an average of 10 per day: 99% general aviation and 1% military. At that time there were 29 aircraft based at this airport: 62% single-engine, 3% multi-engine and 35% ultralight. == Restricted airspace and relocation controversy == The airport and the local government has faced controversy in recent years regarding the possible relocation of the airport in response to national security concerns. The airport was closed for three months following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, as a result of its position approximately one mile south of Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay. The Federal Aviation Administration created a Temporary Flight Restriction below and a radius of five miles (8 km) from the base, effectively eliminating all traffic. Aircraft based at that field were eventually allowed to leave under special permission of air traffic control, but the existing Fixed-Base Operator suffered substantial financial difficulties during this time. The airport was reopened on December 3, 2001, with the creation of a smaller temporary flight restriction located approximately one half mile from the departure end of runway 4. That restriction became permanent on February 16, 2006, with the creation of Prohibited Airspace P-50, an airspace encompassing all airspace below within a three-mile (5 km) radius of the submarine base's waterfront operations. Almost immediately after the September 2001 temporary flight restriction was created, the Navy pressed for a permanent closure of the airport for national security reasons. As a result, in April 2004 the city received a grant of $236,538 from the Department of Transportation for an airport relocation study. Nine possible sites were studied by Reynolds, Smith and Hills, a contracted consultant, with a final site approved on February 17, 2005. The new airport location will be south of Woodbine, Georgia, on of donated land. The anticipated cost is $29 million, with 90% of the construction costs paid by the Department of Transportation. The approval for the airport was not without controversy. In February 2007, the St. Marys city council and the St. Marys Airport Authority entered disputes over both airport ownership and whether the airport should even be moved. This eventually led to litigation. On October 2, 2008, the court ruled that the city and not the airport authority had legal control over the property, allowing the move to proceed. The current estimated costs are now $40 million+ and the controversy continues due to the environmental impacts to over of fragile wetland, the effects upon the Rose Basin and the Satilla River, threatened species and the 100 Year Floodplain.City of St. Marys website Local and state environmental organizations protest what has been referred to as \\"a potential environmental disaster\\". Meanwhile, the Sea Island Company (the firm \\"donating\\" the land known as \\"Site 1\\") struggles with on- going financial issues. There had been no written document from the Navy (or any other official governmental body) that requested either the closure or relocation of St. Marys Airport until September 2012. This was due to concerns involving skydivers accidentally landing on Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay. The skydiving company ceased operations at St. Marys Airport. The fate of the airport is still unknown. As of February 16, 2017, the airport is scheduled to close permanently on July 14, 2017 with all airplanes to vacate the airport by July 1.http://goldenisles.news/news/local_news/closure-date-set-for-st-marys- airport/article_3b5af781-b602-5917-9e4e-70d795c46d2f.html Accessed Feb 17, 2017 As of 2020, aerial photos show the airport with the \\"X\\" symbol on the runways showing the airport is closed.

The plantation house was built by David Stone, a member of the coastal Carolina planter class, later Governor of North Carolina and a United States Senator.Alan D. Watson, Bertie County, A Brief History, Raleigh, North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, 1982, pp. 67-73, William S. Powell, Encyclopedia of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina Press, 2006, p. 787. One of the finest examples of Palladian design built in timber, the manor house is slightly modified by neo-classical elements. The facade has five bays and a pedimented double portico with the original Chinese Chippendale balustrade. Crowning the house is a widow's walk with matching railing. The interior of the house displays a height and grandeur rare in the region, and is furnished with a unique collection of period furniture, art and artifacts.Bivins, John Jr. 'Furniture of the North Carolina Roanoke River Basin in the Collection of Historic Hope Foundation': Journal of Early Southern Decorative Arts. Summer 1996. By the 1960s, the building had survived almost a century of neglect and the citizens of Bertie County, aided by other North Carolinians and a far-flung net of support, formed the Historic Hope Foundation, Inc. (a registered non-profit organization) to purchase and rescue the house.The Miracle of Hope by Wayland Jenkins, Jr. and Eric Hause, Windsor, NC: Historic Hope Foundation, 2002 == Site history == The site on which the Hope Mansion is constructed was originally occupied by linguistic relatives of the Algonkian, the Sioux and the Iroquois. North of the site were the Meherrin, and in the immediate area the Tuscarora. Although neither group seems to have had a permanent settlement, hunting artifacts abound. A Charter to the Carolinas was granted by Charles II of England to eight Lords Proprietor in 1663 in gratitude for their support in helping him recover his throne after the execution of his father. They immediately began recruiting settlers both from England and from the English settlers in Virginia. In the 1720s the Lords Proprietor granted of land at the western end of the Albemarle Sound, near the Cashie River, to the Hobson family. Francis Hobson and his wife Elizabeth (of Hope Parrish in Derbyshire, England) migrated to the new world to occupy the land. In 1765, after Francis's death, Elizabeth inherited the property. When she married Zedekiah Stone, an emigrant from New England, the land became his and he named it \\"Hope\\" to honor her heritage. The elder Stones built a house and began raising a family. The remnants of their house and the probable location of the quarters of their enslaved servants and workers have been explored by expert archeologists. David Stone, Elizabeth and Zedekiah's son, was born in 1770. Despite his strong English heritage, he was raised as an American patriot, his father participating in early Provincial Congresses to support the revolutionary movement.Taylor, Melanie Johnson. David Stone: A Political Biography, Greenville, NC: East Carolina University, 1968. In 1793, David married Hannah Turner, and shortly before the marriage he was given the Hope tract by his father. David had graduated first in his class at Princeton, was widely read, and a correspondent of many of the new American intelligentsia (later with Thomas Jefferson).Iobst, Richard W., Personal Life of David Stone. (microfilm). Windsor, NC Historic Society When he built, he built a grand mansion of European design. The house replicates almost exactly a plan in Abraham Swann's The British Architect, a book known to have been in Stone's library. == Design  Exterior === The Palladian style was admired by Whigs See Wikipedia Holkham Hall entry, for instance. and by American patriots, particularly in the South, who thought of themselves as inheritors of Roman ideas and ideals. The absolute balance of the symmetrical structure reflects the sense of order inherent in the style. The house is built on high brick piers, allowing a full \\"basement\\" storey above ground. Imposing entry stairs lead to the pedimented double portico on the facade. This is lightened by the intricacy of the Chinese Chippendale balustrade on both stories of the portico and the roof walk. Four stepped chimneys and eight windows on the two sides, reinforce the front to back symmetry. The rear of the house, from which the structure is now approached, has a single height portico, with the Chippendale motif repeated. Near the house, the kitchen has been reconstructed on the original foundation footprint. The elegant dairy has been restored. === Interior === The interior of Hope reflects its uniqueness in rural eastern North Carolina. The rooms chiefly used by David Stone and for entertaining are on the upper floor. The bedrooms, the family sitting room and the dining room on the entry level. The central hallway, which stretches the double front doors to the back is an imposing double hall, with an archway diving the two ends. The staircase is partially enclosed. Upstairs, there is a large, imposing landing which may have been used as an upper parlour to catch breezes. This leads into the drawing room, which resembles a ball room. Also off the landing is David Stone's library, which once held some 1400 volumes, a truly impressive collection for its time. Also on this floor are smaller rooms which may have housed guests and are now interpreted as bedrooms. Best materials were used throughout, and although the timber was mainly local first-growth pine, a letter from a New York supplier, Joseph Sands, to David Stone in 1803, discusses marble and red stone for use in the fireplaces. David Stone, a lawyer by training, died intestate. Thus, a complete inventory of his property was made by his administrator. Using this, the interior of the house was furnished by the Foundation with a degree of accuracy and appropriateness which has caught the attention of scholars.Blivens, see above. ==Also on the site== The 1763 King-Bazemore House represents a fine example of vernacular architecture. It is one of the few remaining examples in North Carolina of mid-eighteenth century \\"hall and parlor\\" design. The home has been restored and furnished based on the 1778 inventory of owner, William King.National Register #71000570 Outbuildings include a restored kitchen and the manor house's original dairy, a smoke house and store buildings, an herb garden and a kitchen garden. There are also extensive grounds (45 acres). The original grounds extended well beyond these and amounted to nearly of privately owned land, worked by over 200 slaves. The circa 1800 barn and the archeological sites make the basis for a walk which is often used as a fitness trail. == Restoration == The house was sold by David Stone's son in 1836, and then passed through many hands. It endured decades of neglect. When rehabilitation of the structure was first considered in the 1960s and the state approached for aid by local citizens the Executive Director of the North Carolina Department of Archives and History said, \\"Hope is hopeless.\\"Miracle, p. 8 However, the Hope enthusiasts were not to be deterred and on February 2, 1965 the Historic Hope Foundation, Incorporated was chartered. The house was bought by the Foundation and a largely grass-roots restoration effort was launched. By the late summer of the 1972, the restoration was complete. == Current uses == The Historic Hope Foundation, Incorporated through its Board of Directors manages the Hope Mansion and subsidizes the opening of the buildings to the public. An Administrator and Public Tourism Officer is appointed by the State of North Carolina. The Foundation promotes several educational programs, and linkages with schools and universities. It also sponsors social functions, primarily the Governor Stone Ball, as fund-raising events. == Sources == * \\"National Register Information System\\". National Register of Historic Places.

It is currently under evaluation in clinical trials. Fermagate is an iron magnesium hydroxy carbonate with the general formula, [Mg4Fe2(OH)12].CO3 .4H2O. The structure comprises metal containing layers stacked with intercalating charge-balancing carbonate species and water molecules and belongs to a wider family of compounds also referred to as layered double hydroxides or hydrotalcites. The anions are held in this relatively insoluble structure in the spaces between the layers of metal ions and enables exchange of carbonate ions for free (inorganic) phosphate ions. The compound is taken with a meal and the inorganic phosphate released through digestion can be readily bound to the Fermagate structure reducing the amount of bioavailable phosphate and thus helping to avoid high blood concentrations of inorganic phosphate. Studies indicate that materials with the Fermagate type of structure show relatively good selectivity for the negative phosphate ions in typical food matrices. ==References== * Category:Phosphate binders ","title":"Fermagate"},{"id":"19272815","text":"The first competition weekend of the 2008–09 ISU Speed Skating World Cup was held in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in Berlin, Germany, from Friday, 7 November, until Sunday, 9 November 2008. ==Schedule of events== Timeschedule of the event:Berlin World Cup announcement {  border=\\"1\\" - !

She was fitted with a 2-cylinder horizontal compound expansion steam engine driving a single screw, produced by Hawthorn Leslie. She was rigged with three masts, with square rig on the fore- and main-masts, making her a barque-rigged vessel. Her keel was laid at Devonport Royal Dockyard on 8 January 1883 and she was launched on 23 June 1884. Her entire class were re- classified in November 1884 as sloops before they entered service. ==Career== Mariner was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 19 March 1885. She became a boom defence vessel in 1903 and was lent to the Liverpool Salvage Association as a salvage vessel in 1917, with her sister-ship Reindeer. She was laid up from 1922 to 1929 and sold to Hughes Bolckow of Blyth on 19 March 1929. ==References== * Category:Mariner-class gunvessels Category:Ships built in Plymouth, Devon Category:1884 ships Category:Victorian-era gunboats of the United Kingdom Category:World War I sloops of the United Kingdom ","title":"HMS Mariner (1884)"},{"id":"19272851","text":"Daryl D. Metcalfe (born November 9, 1962) is an American politician currently serving in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Metcalfe is a member of the Republican Party and has represented the 12th legislative district since 1999. He currently serves as the majority chairman of the House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee. == Background == Metcalfe is a graduate of Charles W. Baker High School in Baldwinsville, New York, and he attended Kansas State University while serving in the United States Army at Fort Riley in Kansas. He later was stationed in Germany. His experience in the army included duty as an air defense radar and I.F.F. (identification friend or foe) systems repair specialist. Prior to his election, Metcalfe was employed with Dade Behring (formerly DuPont Diagnostics) for 13 years as a field engineer. He was responsible for managing a biomedical service territory in western Pennsylvania. == Political career == Metcalfe was elected in 1998 to replace retiring representative Pat Carone. He has won re-election nine times. Since 2011 he has been the majority chairman of the House State Government Committee. Metcalfe ran as a candidate for lieutenant governor in 2010. He came in third place in the Republican primary, losing to Jim Cawley. ==Political positions== Daryl Metcalfe has been recognized by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette as the Pennsylvania General Assembly's \\"No. 1 Conservative.\\" \\"I was a Tea Partier before it was cool.\\" Metcalfe said in an interview. ===LGBT rights=== Metcalfe opposed Philadelphia's program to market the city to gay tourists. He tried to cut state funding to universities that offer domestic partner benefits. He sued a gay New Hope couple for attempting to get a marriage license. In September 2009, Metcalfe held up a Pennsylvania State Assembly resolution declaring October \\"Domestic Violence Awareness Month\\". Metcalfe claimed that the bill \\"had language in it that brought men into the situation\\", citing this as evidence of a “homosexual agenda”. This met with criticism from Rep. Babette Josephs who said, \\"The gentleman from Butler has made this problem even worse and more men may be abused, even killed in their homes,\\" on the House floor in 2009. In 2011, House Bill 1434 was introduced by Daryl Metcalfe along with 36 cosponsors on May 3, 2011. It was referred to the Committee of State Government. The bill would amend the state constitution stating to ban same-sex marriage and any substantial equivalent. On March 13, 2012, a committee vote on the bill was stopped. In 2013, Daryl Metcalfe reintroduced the bill with 27 cosponsors on May 7, 2013, which is the lowest number of cosponsors the bill had been introduced with. In June 2013, after the Defense of Marriage Act had been ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court, openly gay state representative Brian Sims tried to make a speech in the Pennsylvania House supporting the decision. Metcalfe, who was one of several representatives who blocked Sims from speaking, said, \\"I did not believe that as a member of that body that I should allow someone to make comments such as he was preparing to make that ultimately were just open rebellion against what the word of God has said, what God has said, and just open rebellion against God's law.\\" In April 2018, Metcalfe caused a heavy backlash following a tirade on Twitter against Democrats in Pennsylvania's state legislature, which was called homophobic, writing \\"I block all substantive Democrat legislation sent to my committee and advance good Republican legislation!\\" and \\"Liberals continue their lying attacks in an attempt to stop my work in defense of taxpayers and our liberty!\\" Metcalfe also targeted some Democrats by name, including former Representative Leslie Acosta, and sitting Representatives Sims and Matthew Bradford, labeling Acosta as a \\"convict\\" (as she had been under investigation for money laundering), insulting Sims as a \\"lying homosexual\\" and calling Bradford \\"touchy-feely\\" following a widely publicized incident involving Bradford and Metcalfe in 2017. Sims responded by denouncing Metcalfe on Twitter as \\"a gaslighter who threatens people and then backs down and claims victimhood when you're called out\\", accusing Metcalfe of starting the conflict without justification. The head of the Pennsylvania branch of the Democratic Party responded similarly by strongly condemning Metcalfe, heavily censuring him as \\"a partisan hack who abuses his power at the expense of making government better for Pennsylvanians\\" and \\"a disgusting human being.\\" ===Immigration=== Metcalfe is the founder of State Legislators for Legal Immigration (SLLI), an organization opposed to birthright citizenship. The State Lawmakers for Legal Immigration works closely with the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), an anti-illegal alien organization. On March 1, 2011, Metcalfe reintroduced HB 738, a bill which would direct police officers \\"to attempt to verify the immigration status of suspected illegal aliens.\\" It would also create a new third-degree misdemeanor \\"for illegal aliens who violate federal law by either willfully failing to register as an alien or failing to possess proper proof of such registration when stopped for another primary offense, such as a traffic violation,\\" crack down on employers who hire illegal aliens without first checking to see if they had registration papers and are in the state legally, create a new third-class felony \\"for intentionally smuggling illegal aliens (into the state) for profit,\\" and would allow police officers \\"impound any vehicle driven by an illegal alien or used to transport illegal aliens.\\" The proposed law is based on Arizona's Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act (SB 1070), which was passed in April 2010 and largely struck down as unconstitutional. ===Environment=== In October 2009, Metcalfe criticized Operation FREE, a coalition of veterans and national security organizations that advocates on environmental issues, by saying: \\"As a veteran, I believe that any veteran lending their name, to promote the leftist propaganda of global warming and climate change, in an effort to control more of the wealth created in our economy, through cap and tax type policies, all in the name of national security, is a traitor to the oath he or she took to defend the Constitution of our great nation!\\" On February 19, 2019 at House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee informational meeting on Department of Environmental Protection, Daryl Metcalfe suggested that efforts to reduce CO2 emissions could deprive vegetables of the CO2 they need to grow: \\"I enjoy my vegetables, and plants need CO2. ... So I think we are going to have an interesting debate for those that want to reduce something that’s actually needed by our environment.\\" As chair of the Environment and Energy committee, Metcalf hosted an informational hearing in March 2019 to feature \\"climate contrarian\\" Gregory Wrightstone. Wrightstone, author of the book \\"Inconvenient Facts\\", testified to the committee \\"We don’t have too much CO2, we don’t have enough\\" and further \\"[W]arming trends such as our current one have always correlated to times of great prosperity and plenty.\\" Wrightstone's testimony was at odds with prevailing views of climate scientists. ===Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Shooting=== Upon seeing student protests in the aftermath of the February 14, 2018 mass shooting in which 17 students and teachers were killed, Metcalfe posted the following to his official Facebook account: ==Personal== Metcalfe lives in Cranberry Township with his wife, Elke, and daughter, Lisa. ==Controversy== In September 2015, Metcalfe invited ProEnglish's Robert Vandervoora—a man with white nationalist ties and former head of Chicagoland Friends of American Renaissance—to testify before Pennsylvania's state government committee. After facing criticism for his decision by the Southern Poverty Law Center, who called Vandervoora a \\"white supremacist\\", Metcalfe countered by arguing that white \\"nationalism\\" is not white \\"supremacy.\\" Metcalfe's response drew praise from The Daily Stormer, a white supremacist, neo-Nazi website. A GOP staffer reported that members of his own party were upset with his comments. \\"I believe white supremacists and white nationalists are synonymous and Daryl should repudiate both and their recent actions because I certainly do,\\" Philadelphia Republican Representative John Taylor said after the controversy. As Chairman of the House State Government Committee, Metcalfe has also drawn criticism for failing to hold a vote on a Republican-backed bill for a gift ban for state legislators. On December 5, 2017, Metcalfe strongly took issue with colleague Matthew Bradford touching his arm while speaking to him, saying, \\"I'm a heterosexual. I have a wife. I love my wife. I don't like men as you might so stop touching me all the time. Keep your hands to yourself. If you want to touch somebody, you have people on your side of the aisle that might like it. I don't.\\" Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf then urged house leaders to demote Metcalfe from his committee position, saying \\"I urge House leadership to re-examine whether it is appropriate for him (Rep Metcalfe) to continue controlling a committee that oversees civil rights legislation.\\" ==References *Official web site *PA House profile *Pittsburgh Post-Gazette *Township, Borough and City Districts Category:1962 births Category:Kansas State University alumni Category:Living people Category:Members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Category:Pennsylvania Republicans Category:Politicians from Syracuse, New York Category:People from Butler County, Pennsylvania Category:United States Army soldiers Category:21st- century American politicians Category:Military personnel from Syracuse, New York ","title":"Daryl Metcalfe"},{"id":"19272863","text":"The second competition weekend of the 2008–09 ISU Speed Skating World Cup was held in Thialf in Heerenveen, Netherlands, from Friday, 14 November, until Sunday, 16 November 2008. ==Schedule of events== Timeschedule of the event: {  border=\\"1\\" - !

Founded in 1840, they have handled a few historical masterpieces. For example, they re-polished the Koh i Noor, which is mounted in the Crown of Queen Mary, and the Dresden Green Diamond, held in the New Green Vault at Dresden Castle. ==History== *1840: Moses Elias Coster, diamond cutter in Amsterdam, founds Coster Diamonds in a factory building at the Waterlooplein in Amsterdam. *1848: Son Meijer Moses Coster (Martin) succeeds his father. He leaves for Paris for new business. *1910: Felix Theodoor Manus purchases Coster Diamonds from one of Coster’s inheritors. It becomes a company and remains so until the German occupation in 1940. *1945: After World War II, Wim Biallosterski, owner of a diamond sawing company, purchases the company Coster Diamonds. *1962: Ben Meier purchases the Coster premises together with partner Max Meents, Joop Schoos and Simon Cohen. *1970: The old diamond factory has to make way for the construction of the town hall (Stopera). Coster Diamonds moves to its current location at the Paulus Potterstraat at the famous Museum Square. *1995: The well-known diamond factory Van Moppes Diamonds was purchased by Coster Diamonds. *2005: Coster Diamonds was obliged to close the Van Moppes Diamonds factory. Due to events in the world like terrorism and Sars in the Far East, there were hardly any visitors left. *2007: Opening of the Diamond Museum Amsterdam to display some of the most beautiful diamond artifacts. *2007: Introduction of a new patented round diamond cut with 201 facets. This brilliant cut with 144 extra facets, is called \\"The Royal 201\\". It's considered to be the most sparkling diamond cut in the world. *2016: King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands grants Coster Diamonds the Honorary title Royal (Dutch: Koninklijk). Hereby, Coster Diamonds became Royal Coster Diamonds. To become Royal, an organization has to be leading in its field of expertise, be of national importance and has to be in existence for at least 100 years. ==Famous diamond polishers== The watch of Queen Juliana In 1852, Mr J.A. Feder and Mr L.B. Voorzanger, both diamond polishers at Royal Coster Diamonds, went to London to re-polish the famous Koh-i Noor. Mr J.A. Fedder died in 1864. Louis Benjamin Voorzanger won the silver medal for his achievements at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1855. He also polished the “famous diamond Star of the South”. He died in 1886. The family of the deceased diamond polisher still owns the silver plates with the inscription of this price for the diamond polishers, who polished the Koh-i Noor. In 1959, Ben Meier polished the many diamonds which were set in a white gold watch, which was presented to Queen Juliana by the Dutch people. Between 1991 and 1994 Pauline Willemse, a diamond polisher at Royal Coster Diamonds, polished the smallest diamond in the world. This is a brilliant cut stone with 57 facets, weighing . 0.16–0.17 mm in diameter and with a height of 0.11 mm. This event was published in the Guinness Book of Records. This and other famous diamonds are on display at Royal Coster Diamonds and can be seen during a diamond tour through the polishing factory. ==References * Category:Amsterdam-Zuid Category:Buildings and structures in Amsterdam Category:Companies established in 1840 Category:Diamond cutting Category:History of Amsterdam Category:Manufacturing companies based in Amsterdam Category:Tourist attractions in Amsterdam ","title":"Coster Diamonds"},{"id":"19272910","text":"Many antennas is a smart antenna technique which overcomes the performance limitation of single user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques. In cellular communication, the maximum number of considered antennas for downlink is 2 and 4 to support 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) and IMT Advanced requirements, respectively. Since the available spectrum band will probably be limited while the data rate requirement will continuously increase beyond IMT-A to support the mobile multimedia services, it is highly probable that the number of transmit antennas at the base station must be increased to 8–64 or more. The installation of many antennas at single base stations introduced many challenges and required development of several high technologies: a new SDMA engine, a new beamforming algorithm and a new antenna array. * New space- division multiple access (SDMA) engine: multi-user MIMO, network MIMO, coordinate multi-point transmission (COMP) (Cooperative diversity), remote radio equipments (RRE). * New beam-forming: linear beam-forming such as MF, ZF and MMSE and non-linear beam-forming (precoding) such as Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP), vector perturbation (VP), and Dirty paper coding (DPC). * New antenna array: direct, remote and wireless antenna array. ** Direct antenna array: linear and 3D phased array, new structure array, and dynamic antenna array. ** Remote and wireless antenna array: distributed antenna array and cooperative beam-forming. * Multiple air interfaces: single chip antenna array for an energy efficient short-range transmission. == History of multiple antennas in cellular communications == The table summarizes the recent history of multiple antenna techniques in cellular communications.

He also set up the Irish lighthouse service's administration and management procedures, regularised employment of lighthouse keepers, and continued to oversee the development of Dublin's port.

With a total area of , it is the largest Norwegian island not located directly adjacent to the ocean, and the second largest such island in Northern Europe. Osterøy is covered by two municipalities: the majority () by Osterøy municipality, and the rest () by Vaksdal municipality. The vast majority of the island's population lives in Osterøy municipality (7,305 inhabitants as of 2008). The island is surrounded by fjords with mainland Norway on all sides of those fjords. The Osterfjorden-Romarheimsfjorden flows along the north side, the Sørfjorden flows along the southern and western sides, and the Veafjorden flows along the eastern side. The highest mountain on Osterøy is the tall Høgafjellet. There are two road bridges that connect the island to the rest of the road network in Norway. The first is the Osterøy Bridge, built in 1997 on the southwestern tip of the island. That bridge is the only road connection to the mainland for most residents of Osterøy. The other is the Kallestadsundet Bridge which connects the northeastern tip of the island to the mainland. The northeastern part of Osterøy only has one road, and it is not connected to the rest of the roads on the island, so to get from the northeastern part of the island to the rest of the island, one would have to cross the Kallestadsundet Bridge to leave the island, drive along the mainland to the opposite side of the island, then cross the Osterøy Bridge to get back onto the island. This is why the northeastern part of the island is part of Vaksdal municipality and the rest of the island is part of Osterøy municipality. ==Media gallery== File:Osteröysbrua IMG 3730.JPGSouthwestern tip of the island with the Osterøy Bridge File:Osteröy Sörfjorden Trengereid IMG 3726.JPGWestern part of the island, surrounded by the Sørfjorden File:Haus1.JPGView of Hausvik, on the western coast File:Veafjorden.JPGView of the Veafjorden with Osterøy to the left File:Havratunet.jpgHavrå, a cluster farm on the southern coast of the island ==References== Category:Osterøy Category:Vaksdal Category:Islands of Vestland ","title":"Osterøy (island)"},{"id":"19273039","text":"Bernard Shaw (born 14 March 1945 in Sheffield) is an English former footballer who played as a full back.

Multiculturalism and Christianity have a long historical association. Christianity originated as a sect of Judaism in the Middle East, as Jesus, the founder and central figure of Christianity, lived and held his ministry in the Middle East. Paul the Apostle, an ethnic JewPaul describes himself as \\"an Israelite of the tribe of Benjamin, circumcised on the eighth day\\" who was born and lived in the Middle East, holds such importance to Christianity that some call him the religion's \\"Second Founder\\". The greatest influence on Christianity after Paul, Augustine of Hippo, a Church Father, a Doctor of the Church, and an eminent theologian, was North African. Under the influence of Paul, Christianity soon spread widely among non-Jews (Gentiles) of the Roman Empire. ==Roman Empire== The Roman Emperor Galerius issued an edict permitting the practice of the Christian religion under his rule in April 311.Lactantius, De Mortibus Persecutorum (\\"On the Deaths of the Persecutors\\") ch. 35–34 In 313 Constantine I and Licinius announced toleration of Christianity in the Edict of Milan. Constantine would become the first Christian emperor. By 391, under the reign of Theodosius I, Christianity had become the state religion. Constantine I, the first emperor to embrace Christianity, was also the first emperor to openly promote the newly legalized religion. As the political boundaries of the Western Roman Empire diminished and then collapsed, Christianity spread beyond the old borders of the Empire and into lands that never had been Romanized. ==Age of Discovery== During the Age of Discovery, the Roman Catholic Church established a number of Christian mission in the Americas and other colonies in order to spread Christianity in the New World and to convert the indigenous peoples. At the same time, missionaries such as Francis Xavier as well as other Jesuits, Augustinians, Franciscans and Dominicans were moving into Asia and the Far East. The Portuguese sent missions into Africa. While some of these missions were associated with imperialism and oppression, others (notably Matteo Ricci's Jesuit mission to China) were relatively peaceful and focused on integration rather than cultural imperialism. The most famous colonization by Protestants in the New World was that of English Puritans in North America. Unlike the Spanish or French, the English colonists made surprisingly little effort to evangelize the native peoples.MacCulloch, Diarmaid, The Reformation: A History (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 540 The Puritans, or Pilgrims, left England so that they could live in an area with Puritanism established as the exclusive civic religion. ==World Christianity in the Modern Era== Christianity by country Christianity is a religion open to all humanity that counts one out of every three people on earth among its members. The Christian world encompasses a greater area of land than that of any other religious territory. In terms of both population and geography, Christianity is the world's largest religion. As such, Christianity contains a great diversity, and has followers from a wide range of ethnicities, nationalities, and cultures. Both Europeans and non-Hispanic Whites are shrinking minorities in the Church. ===Europe=== In his book Enlarging the Story: Perspectives on Writing World Christian History, Richard Fox Young views the connection between Christianity and Eurocentrism as tenuous, and points to the postcolonial and non-European nature of the emerging Church and its impact on the development of World Christianity. In the postcolonial world, Christianity has lost its association with the West. ===Outside Europe and North America=== At the turn of the millennium, 60% of the world's two billion Christians lived in Africa, Latin America, or Asia, and by 2025, those demographics will shift to an estimated 67% of the world's three billion Christians. The rise of Christianity in the southern hemisphere, especially northern Africa and Latin America, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries is a \\"grassroots movement\\" that has generated new forms of Christian theology and worship, and shifted the cultural and geographic focal point of the Church away from the West. The prominence of the southern hemisphere's Christianity has brought with it a cultural and intellectual diversity to World Christianity, and contributed such ideas as Liberation theology. ==See also== * Christian culture * Christianity and colonialism * Christianity#Demographics * Inculturation * Major religious groups * Missiology * Multiculturalism * Race and appearance of Jesus ==References== Category:Multiculturalism Category:Christianity and society ","title":"Multiculturalism and Christianity"},{"id":"19273051","text":" HMS Racer was a Royal Navy Mariner-class composite screw gunvessel of 8 guns. ==Construction== Designed by Nathaniel Barnaby, the Royal Navy Director of Naval Construction, her hull was of composite construction; that is, iron keel, frames, stem and stern posts with wooden planking.

One is a coal-fired power station, which was commissioned in 1967, and the second is a combined cycle gas turbine power station, commissioned in 2013. Both stations are owned and operated by EDF Energy. The station has been accredited as an Investor in People since 1995 and ISO accredited (ISO 14001) for its environmental management system since 1996. The power station won a RoSPA President's Award in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The site is the furthest north of what was a series of power stations in the Trent valley, being downstream of the now-closed Cottam power stations. The power station is one of three coal-fired generators left in England. ==History== It is built on the site of the deserted medieval village of West Burton. The station was commissioned between 1967 and 1968. West Burton number one unit was the first of 47 500MW single shaft machines to be ordered and go into full commercial operation. It was originally operated by the CEGB and then run by National Power after privatisation, until April 1996 when it was bought by the Eastern Group which became TXU Europe. In November 2001 when the price of electricity was low and TXU Europe had severe financial problems, it was bought by the London Power Company for £366 million. The station is now run by EDF Energy. In 1977 a British Rail Class 56 locomotive was officially named in front of the coal plant control block as 'West Burton Power Station' number 56009 later re-numbered to 56201. Prior to privatisation West Burton was the last CEGB power station to be awarded the Christopher Hinton trophy in recognition of good housekeeping. The station had a Discovery Centre to educate local school children and also has the oldest mound of FGD gypsum in the UK, part of an experiment set up by CEGB scientists in 1988. In the summer of 1998 Station Manager Derrek Wells was awarded the OBE for his services to the power industry.Hinton Cup ==Architecture== The principal architects for the buildings were Rex Savidge and John Gelsthorpe of Architects' Design Group (ADG) from Baker Street, Nottingham. Heliodon modelling was used to determine the visual and psychological impact of the structures to be used on site due to their scale. This created a Zone of Visual Influence (ZVI) a system pioneered by the CEGB for the creation of future 2000 MW power stations in the 1960s. The tower layouts exploit line and lozenge formations. The opposite pairs of the lozenge group were coloured light and dark to avoid tendency of shapes to coalesce when viewed at a moderate distance. The offset tower of the line group has a light yellow colour with intense hue which acts as a nodal point. However, 10 years after construction the towers were indistinguishable from one another, the yellow tint was much faded. The main building colours are limited to black, white and yellow. The ancillary buildings are grouped around two courts through which the approach road passes. The Executive partner for (ADG) was Rex Savidge and Architect in charge was John Gelsthorpe assisted by Norman Simpson. West Burton was granted an award by the Civic Trust for its ‘outstanding contribution to the surrounding scene.’ The Civic Trust, announcing the 82 awards it made in 1968 from more than 1,400 entries from 94 counties in the United Kingdom described West Burton as ‘an immense engineering work of great style which, far from detracting from the visual scene, acts as a magnet to the eye from many parts of the Trent Valley.’ ==Construction== Work began on site in 1961 by the Northern Project Group a department within the CEGB the construction was overseen by resident engineer Douglas Derbyshire who had recently completed the build of the nearby High Marnham Power Station. In a bid to combine efforts at the design and construction stages the Boiler and Turbo-generator plant were replicated at Fiddlers Ferry power station located in Cuerdley, Cheshire, in North West England. The Shah of Iran visits West Burton Power Station in a Westland Whirlwhind of The Queen's Flight escorted by the Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire in 1965The consulting engineers for the project were Merz & McLellan and the main contractor on site was Alfred McAlpine with steelwork designed by the Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company. The station was the first 2000 MW to be constructed in the United Kingdom and was visited by the then chairman of the CEGB Christopher Hinton on 27 November 1964 the instigator of the new 500MW units. It subsequently attracted visitors from around the world including Mohammad Reza Pahlavi the Shah of Iran who was escorted around the site by Robert Laycock the Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire on 6 March 1965. The station was officially opened in 1969 by the Minister of Power Roy Mason, Sir Stanley Brown the then Chairman of the CEGB, Arthur Hawkins Director of the Midlands Region and Douglas Pask director of the Northern Project Group. It was a lavish ceremony with a large marquee and band present. ==Description== The power station provides electricity for around two million people, and is situated on a site. Coal for the power station, like Cottam, came from the Welbeck colliery at Meden Vale until it closed in May 2010. The station's other main supplier of coal, Thoresby Colliery, closed in 2015. The station connects to the National Grid, like most similar sized coal power stations, via a transformer and substation at 400 kV. The chimneys of West Burton Power Station are tall. ===Boiler=== The four boilers have single divided furnaces and assisted circulation. Each has a maximum continuous rating of 1565 t/h (3,450,000 lb/h) and a design efficiency of 90.75%. Built by International Combustion, the design is similar in many respects to that of the now redundant 550 MW ICL boiler at Thorpe Marsh which had two furnaces with centre division walls. There are six stages of superheat and three stages of reheat in each boiler, with superheat and reheat stages mixed in position. As a result of operating experience on boilers of this size at Thorpe Marsh it was found that higher superheat temperatures and larger pressure drops than the design figures occurred in the boiler. New materials had to be employed for the superheat sections and the tube paths redesigned as a result. The boilers are 53.65 m (176 ft) high and the main suspension girders span 27.43 m (90 ft). The total downward thermal expansion is about 228 to 305 mm (9 to 12 in). The superheater output is at 569 °C 2,400 psi (165.5 bar). The reheater has inlet and outlet temperatures of 364 and 569 °C with an inlet pressure of 592 psi (40.82 bar) and steam flow of 1243 t/h (2,740,000 lb/h). The single steam drum weighs 162.6 tonne (160 tons). The furnace is tangentially fired with eight burner boxes, each with six burners, together with oil burners in each box for lighting up. Steam temperature control is by electrically operated tilting burners and by electro- hydraulically operated spray desuperheaters, giving a control range of 70 to 100% of the maximum continuous rating. There are four desuperheaters for each of the superheater and reheater circuits. The economisers have a heating surface of 44,970 m2 (484,000 sq ft). There are two forced and two induced draught Davidson fans per boiler. The f.d. fans are driven by constant speed 1,300 hp motors at 596 rpm and are rated at 11,380 m3/min (402,000 (cu ft)/min). A saving in the overall size of the boiler house building, which measures 259.69 m (852 ft) long, 44.2 m (145 ft) wide and 60.05 m (197 ft) high, was achieved by arranging the pulverised fuel mills in two rows between adjacent boilers instead of in a line along the length of the boiler house as usual. This meant that coal conveyors at right angles to the trunk conveyor had to be installed for each line of mills, but the cost of these was more than offset by the saving in capital on the building. There are six roller type mills per boiler, each powered by a direct coupled 635 hp motor at 985 rpm. The coal is fed to the mills by Lopulco chain feeders with induction regulator speed controllers. Separated over-fire air (SOFA) burners were installed on all four of the station's units in 2007 to meet European Union nitrogen oxide emission legislation. The burners were installed by GE Energy. ===Turbine=== The 500 MW single shaft machines manufactured by English Electric, are arranged lengthwise along the turbine hall, which is 259.08 m (850 ft) long by 39.624 m (130 ft) wide by 26.060 m (85.5 ft) high. The overall length of each machine is 49.53 m (162.5 ft). The generators are rated at 500 MW, 22 kV at 0.85 power factor. Steam conditions at the H.P. turbine stop valve are 2,300 psig (158.6 bar) at 566 °C with a single reheat stage to the I.P. cylinder of 565 psia (38.96 bar) at 566 °C. The turbine has a design steam consumption of , including reheating, feed heating, and boiler feed pump drive and an overall heat input of , an efficiency of about 45.5%. A novel mounting arrangement was adopted for the turbo-generators. The L.P. cylinders are supported on two steel beams about long, which bridge between the concrete blocks at the H.P. steam and generator ends of the sets. The fabricated condenser structure was welded directly to the underside of the L.P. frame using a pre-heated welding technique. This provides a compact arrangement of the condenser and the main set and is a major factor in the reduction of size related to the output of the machines, which is a striking feature of the turbine hall. The L.P. frame is supported at its corners, each of the supports taking about 203.2 tonnes (200 tons) in weight. The overall weight of the frame and condenser structure is some 2,235 tonnes (2,200 tons) of which 1,422 tonnes (1,400 tons) is supported on the bottom of the condenser by the mounting springs. The condensers were fabricated on site by English Electric from sub assemblies and welded to the bridge beams supporting the L.P. cylinder. There are over 40,000 9.144 m (30 ft) long, 25.4 mm (1 in) diameter aluminium/brass tubes in each condenser, giving an effective surface area of 27,870 m2 (300,000 sq ft) the equivalent of 3.9 football pitches. Operation is at 1.3 inHg with 1,023 m3/min (225,000 gal of cooling water at 15.5 °C. Steam is passed to the condenser at over 963.9 t/h (2,125,000 lb/h). Since contamination of the condensate by the cooling water must be avoided, a double tube plate construction has been adopted in which the condenser tubes are expanded into an extra tubeplate in addition to the one forming the side of the water box. The narrow space between the plates is filled with demineralised water, supplied from a header tank from 48.768 m (160 ft). This provides a pressure considerably higher than the 20 psig developed in the cooling water system, so that any leaks on the tube end plates will be supplied from the header tank. The bridge condenser Is a single surface type unit, receiving and condensing the steam discharged from the six exhausts of the three double flow LP cylinders, combined with an upper frame supporting and containing the cylinders themselves. The integrated structure, weighing about 2,280 tons in its working condition, spans the two concrete foundation blocks supporting the HP and IP cylinder and the generator, hence the name bridge condenser. About two-thirds of the weight is transferred to the basement floor through a mattress of springs. The circulating water used as a cooling medium passes through 40,740 tubes arranged in six groups, each of two tube bundles, with each group lying directly below a turbine exhaust. The single shaft five cylinder impulse-reaction turbine has a double flow arrangement for the I.P. cylinders as well as for the L.P. cylinders. There are double casings on H.P., I.P., and L.P. cylinders, and the last stages of the L.P. are fitted with 914.4 mm (36 in) blades. Stop valves and governor valves are situated at the inlet to the H.P. strainers and I.P. turbine. There are four 228.6 mm (9 in) bore main steam pipes, and four 431.8 mm (17 in) bore pipes on both the hot and cold reheat circuits to the turbine. In view of the size and increased volume of pipework compared to earlier designs, special attention was paid to mounting the valve chests as close to the machine as possible to reduce the stored energy effect of overspeed. For the H.P. valves this is done without actually mounting the valves on the cylinder, thus avoiding complication of the H.P. casing. Because the coupled shafts 'hang' in a curve, which may be 12.7 mm (1/2in) lower at the centre than at the ends, the complete generator must be adjusted with its outer end slightly higher than the end adjacent to the turbine, so that the turbine and generator coupling faces are parallel, and peripherally true before they are bolted together. This adjustment is achieved to an accuracy at the coupling face of 0.0127 mm (0.0005 in). ===Generator=== EDF branding in 2009 Each of the four generators is designed for an output of 500 MW at 0.85 power factor with a terminal voltage of 22 kV. Hydrogen at a pressure of 60 psig, is employed for cooling the stator core and rotor conductors, the gas being in direct contact with the rotor conductors, and water is used for cooling the stator conductors. Hydrogen coolers are arranged longitudinally in the upper part of the stator frame and the hydrogen is circulated by an axial flow blower mounted on the turbine end of the rotor shaft. The stator is of two-part construction, the core and windings being assembled in a skeleton inner frame threaded into the outer stator frame at site. The weight of the heaviest part, the inner stator, is 194 tons. The generator stator winding is water cooled at 2.155 m3/min (474 gal/min) and the stator core and rotor winding are cooled by hydrogen at 60 psig circulated by a blower on the shaft. To reduce the transport weight, each stator consists of an outer gas tight enclosure, which carries the hydrogen coolers and the end brackets which support the rotor bearings, and an inner stator comprising the magnetic core and windings. The stator core is built with laminations of cold rolled grain-oriented sheet steel 0.013 in (0.033 cm) thick, insulated from each other with insuline. The number of segments per circle is arranged so that the maximum practical percentage of core flux is in the direction of the oriented grain. The rings of lamination's are built into a skeleton frame which is flexibly supported inside the main stator frame to prevent double-frequency vibrations being transmitted to the foundations. Axial gas passages are provided within the core by holes punched in the lamination's, which line up throughout its length. The ends of the core are divided axially by spacers into a number of radial ducts. These ducts form the gas inlet and outlet passages for the axial gas passages. Separate radial ducts feed the extreme ends of the core with cold gas to cater for the increased heating experienced at the core ends during leading power factor operation. Each coil side of the stator winding consists of rectangular copper tubes, each tube being insulated with resin- impregnated glass braid, and the tubes are transposed within the coil length by the Roebel method to minimise stray copper losses. Inlet and outlet manifolds are arranged at opposite ends of the windings and all coil sides are fed in parallel from these. The water connections between the manifolds and coil sides are made with flexible hoses of insulating material. The electrical connections between coil sides consist of flexible copper straps, bolted and sweated to contact blocks which are brazed to the conductor tubes near to the end of each coil side. The rings used to connect up the phase groups to the terminals are also water cooled, the flow through these being in parallel with the flow through the coil sides. Direct hydrogen cooling is employed in the stator terminals. The rotor forging is of nickel chromium molybdenum vanadium steel having a minimum yield point of 33.2 ton/in.2. The shaft end which connects to the turbine is deferentially tempered to give additional strength to withstand the severe forces which could be applied under fault conditions on the generator. The first three critical speeds are arranged to be below the running speed. The hydrogen-cooled rotor conductors are formed from silver- bearing hard drawn copper tube. Two tubes in parallel form one conductor and there are six conductors per slot except for the slots adjacent to the pole centres, which contain five. The generator is ventilated by cold gas fed to a number of radial ducts at the slipring end of the core, which communicate with the axial vent holes in the core and stator teeth. After passing through the axial holes the gas is discharged into the ‘air’ gap through further radial ducts at the turbine end of the core. The gas discharged from the core passes along the ‘air’ gap, together with the hot gas discharged from the outlet holes in the rotor body, to the region between the end windings and a baffle at the slipring end, and thence through one half of each axial cooler to the blower intake. After leaving the blower, the gas is passed through the other halves of the coolers and is delivered to the various inlet regions of the stator core and rotor. Gas is fed to the turbine end of the rotor through axial holes machined in the hub of the blower rotor from an annulus formed between the end bracket and the blower outlet diffuser. Large diameter tubes passing longitudinally through the stator frame connect this annulus to the extreme end section at the slipring end, from which the slipring end of the rotor is fed. The three-stage axial blower mounted on the generator shaft comprises a shaft-mounted sleeve upon which is mounted the bladed rotor disc, a bladed stator casing, a diffuser and an inlet fairing. The stator casing and diffuser are rigidly supported from the turbine end bearing bracket. Low conductivity demineralised water is circulated through the stator windings by a pump and passes through coolers and a filter before entering the inlet manifold of the winding. After passing through the winding the water returns to the pump through a degassing tank. This is basically a sudden enlargement in the pipe, which causes the water velocity to decrease and so enables any bubbles of gas to be collected in a small chamber fitted with a float-operated alarm switch. A header tank, which contains enough water for a complete refill of the system, is connected into the inlet pipe to the winding. A small demineralising plant is provided to treat the water, should the conductivity of the make-up water supply be too high. The main exciter is a 3,000 rpm 3-phase machine directly coupled to the main generator shaft. Cooling is effected by a closed air ventilation circuit with pannier mounted coolers supplied with cooling water from the condensate system. The exciter output is rectified by a 3-phase bridge-connected group of silicon diodes which are natural air cooled and accommodated in a bank of nine cubicles located on a platform cantilevered from the side of the foundation block. Mounted adjacent to the rectifiers is the main field suppression circuit-breaker which incorporates a discharge resistance and auxiliary switch to close the discharge circuit. A permanent magnet high frequency generator, directly coupled to the exciter shaft, acts as a pilot exciter and supplies the exciter field via a power stage magnetic amplifier which may be regulated either by manual control or by the automatic voltage regulator. The AVR is a continuously acting regulator including such features as VAR limiting, automatic follow-up of manual control, and protection against over fluxing or over exciting of the main generator. ===Feed system=== There are three stages of H.P. feed heating with six heater shells arranged in parallel pairs, a de- aerator and three low pressure heaters. Steam is bled from the main turbine H.P. exhaust to drive the main boiler feed pump turbine, which exhausts to the feed heating system to improve the overall cycle efficiency. The main feed pump turbine is a 15,150 hp single-cylinder impulse machine with steam conditions, at the h.p. exhaust, of 610 psia (42.06 bar) at 366 °C. The rotor has eleven stages and the steam is exhausted to the de-aerator at 52 psia. (3.585 bar) at 144 °C. The pump is a six-stage centrifugal unit with a capacity of 1588 t/h (3,500,000 lb/h). Two 50 per cent duty start-up and standby feed pumps, electrically driven, are also provided. ===Cooling water system=== The cooling towers in 2009 The eight cooling towers, built by Davenport Engineering Ltd. of Bradford, have a capacity of 30,690,000 L/h (6,750,000 gal/h ) and a normal cooling range of 8.5 °C (47.3 °F). The towers are 106.7 m (350 ft) high with internal diameters at sill level of 86.56 m (284 ft) and at the top 49.99 m (164 ft) and 46.33 m (152 ft) at the throat. Cooling tower C1 was fitted with reinforced concrete tension rings in 2000 to provide additional stability to the structural shell. Cooling water is circulated by Allen Gwynnes horizontal centrifugal bottom suction cooling water pumps, with four in each of the two pump houses. Each pump has a capacity of 545,500 L/min (120,000 gal/min ) with a net generated head of 23.16 m (76 ft). Make-up water from the river Trent is pumped by four 45,460 L/m (10,000 gal/min ) vertical centrifugal pumps). ===Coal store=== Coal is supplied via north- and south-facing junctions off the adjacent Manchester and Cleethorpes railway line. Coal arriving at the station is discharged from the permanently coupled 29.03-tonne-capacity (32 tons) hopper wagons, the bottoms of which are opened by automatic lineside gear while the train moves through at 0.8 km/h (0.5 mph). The four W & T Avery Ltd. weighbridges, two on each of the two rail tracks using electronic weighing heads, record the weight of the coal wagons loaded and empty and summate the total quantity of coal delivered. The coal store on the site has a maximum capacity of 1,814,000 tonnes (2 million tons) at 9.14 m (30 ft) deep, it is used to deposit all surplus coal and to build up stocks. There are also two fly ash siding (E & F) and two oil sidings (K & L). West Burton Power Station was used as a testing ground for the merry-go-round train system in 1965 which would be introduced at all 500 MW and above power stations.Railway Magazine. July 1965. p. 388 During the stations' early life in the 1970s and under the merry-go-round train agreement with British Rail and the National Coal Board, no deliveries were made at the weekends. The coal store has capacity for over three months' operation of the station. When discharged from the railway wagons, the coal drops into the hoppers immediately under the track, where it is scooped out evenly along the length of the hoppers by remotely operated paddle feeder machines. These deposit the coal on two twin deep-trough belt conveyors 1371.6 mm (54 in) wide, each with a capacity of 1,361 t/h (1,500 tons per hour) at 137.16 m/min (450 ft/min). The belt conveyors feed coal via the screening and crushing plant, where it is also passed through magnetic separators, to the transfer tower. From this tower the coal can be passed to stock via a boom stacker or direct to the boiler house. There are seven belt weighers installed in the conveyor system, to enable checks to be made on the coal quantities passed to stock, re-claimed from stock and finally passed to the boiler house bunkers. The four 2,722-tonne-capacity (3,000-ton) boiler bunkers will hold enough coal for overnight operation without drawing from the coal store. The normal maximum consumption of each boiler is approximately 181.4 t/h (200 tons per hour). ===Gas turbine=== Four 17.5 MW gas turbine driven alternators were installed at the station. They supply power to the auxiliaries in the event of the grid system frequency varying outside suitable limits for the plant. A low frequency relay, which can be pre-set between 49 and 50 cycles per second, initiates the starting operation on the gas turbines; normally the setting is 49.5 cycles per second. The load is automatically taken over by the gas turbines and the auxiliary plant is isolated from the grid supply, provided the system frequency has by then fallen to approximately 48 cycles per second. The gas turbine generators can also be used for augmenting the station output at peak load via the unit transformers. If the station becomes completely isolated from the grid system, the gas turbines are used to restart any main units that are shut down. This process is known as a black start and is tested annually. Each gas turbine unit consists of an English Electric type EA 3,000 r.p.m. expansion turbine employing two Rolls-Royce Avon type RA29 Stage 6A (1533–51) engines as gas generators, and is directly coupled to the alternator. The alternators, made by English Electric are rated at 11 Kv, 21.9 MVA, 0.8 lagging power factor and have a frequency range of 40 to 51 cycles per second. Two of the four gas turbines were later decommissioned during the 1990s. ===400 kV Supergrid Substation=== The 400 kV substation interconnects four generator circuits, six feeders, two inter-bus transformers and includes two bus coupler switches and one main busbar section. The circuits are back to back and are arranged with the generator and interbus transformer connections on the power station side and the line entries on the opposite side of the substation. The current line entries are Bicker Fen-Walpole, Bicker Fen- Spalding North, Keadby 2, High Marnham, Cottam, and Keadby 1. Civil works The design of the prototype indoor 400 kV switch house was arrived at by close liaison between electrical and civil engineers before full details of plant and equipment were known. The structural frames are at 21.3 m (70 ft) centres, each frame consisting of five continuous portals, each 23.3 m (76 ft 6 in) wide with a 7.9 m (26 ft) cantilever at each end. The inner portals take the busbars and the two outer portals the breakers. The cantilever gives space for the through bushings and isolators. There are nine 21.3 m (70 ft) structural bays in the length of the Switch House, making the building 195 m (640 ft) x 132.5 m (435 ft). The site area is approximately 5.26 hectares (13 acres), of which the switch house takes up 2.42 hectare (6 acres). The total weight of the steelwork is about 2,540 tonnes (2,500 tons). Roof load The main and longitudinal girders have been designed as welded lattice steel members of sufficient depth to incorporate the access walkways. In addition to transferring the roof load to the columns these girders also have the 'V' strain insulators attached to them. The side framing of the building as well as carrying the wall cladding also supports the wall bushings and provides anchorage for the strainer connections between the turbine house and the switch house. The switch house was designed so as to fit in the architectural treatment of the Power Station as a whole. The plastic-coated aluminium cladding is therefore coloured black on the north and south faces of the building and gold on the east and west. The roof line of the switch house is designed to blend with the 'saw tooth' effect on the turbine house roof. Construction work began in the severely cold winter of 1962/63. The cold weather was turned to advantage as the clay subsoil which is generally unmanageable when wet was frozen solid. Excavation went on uninterrupted on drainage branches during this period. The wet mix base was next introduced over all the site. The object of the wet mix was to apply a firm layer for the construction to be carried on even when subsoil clay was wet. Construction traffic also tended to compact the wet mix therefore improving it as a base for the final topcoat of bitumen macadam. Steel erection began in June 1963. Erection was carried out by means of two derricks which ran along tracks extending over the length of the switch house. As soon as the steelwork contractor had moved out of the first bays, the civil contractor began work on erecting precast concrete structures, forming trenches and tidying up the surfacing. Access within the switch house was made easier by a decision to lay 228-millimetre-diameter (9 in) ducts to take many of the cables beneath the surface, thus eliminating numerous trenches. The precast concrete structures proved to be comparatively easy to erect to very close tolerances. On the isolator structures the various concrete members are bolted together using high tensile steel bolts to a pre-determined torque. All in situ concrete is eliminated from these structures. The circuit breaker structures were cast in situ. The contract was started on 21 January 1963 and was substantially completed by 30 November 1964. Access was given to the electrical contractors in April 1964. ===132 kV Substation=== In addition to interconnecting the supergrid system, the West Burton 400 kV substation also feeds into the local 132 kV network. This connection is made via two 240 MVA, 400/132 kV auto- transformers manufactured by Associated Electrical Industries. The windings consists of a tertiary winding, a common, a tapping and a series winding. They are arranged so that the helical single layer tertiary winding is nearest the core, the continuous disc common winding next, followed by the interleaved full-length helical type tapping winding and the multi-layer type series winding and line shield. A continuously transposed conductor was used to minimise eddy current losses and reduce the space requirement of the windings. High speed resistor tap changers are provided on the 132 kV side of each transformer, giving a tapping range of plus 15% to minus 5%. The tapping winding has 7 taps which in conjunction with a buck/boost switch provide fourteen steps. The fixed contacts of each of the two rotary tap selector units associated with each phase are connected to one half of the tappings from the windings while the moving contacts are connected to the diverter switches. The diverter switch assembly, together with the transition resistors and operating mechanism is mounted on top of the 132 kV bushing which forms an integral part of the tap changer. Erection of the transformer was carried out inside a translucent plastic dome, inflated by a small blower. This allowed the work to continue regardless of the weather and thus reduced the time normally taken for erecting large transformers in the open. By working day and night within the plastic dome the time for erection on site was reduced from an estimated 8 weeks to 3 weeks. Completely assembled, each transformer is 14.94 m (49 ft) long, 10.06 m (33 ft) wide, and weighs 325.1 tonnes (320 tons) made up of 154.4 tonnes (152 tons) of steel, 30.48 tonnes (30 tons) of copper, and 19.3 tonnes (19 tons) of insulation and 98,420 litres (26,000 gallons) of oil. The current line entries for the 132 kV switch house are North Greetwell – Lincoln 1, Retford – Worksop – Checkerhouse 2, North Greetwell – Lincoln 2 and Retford – Worksop – Checkerhouse 1 ===Control system=== In 1996 the first unit was equipped with the Advanced Plant Management System (APMS), a system developed by RWE npower and Thales, and implemented by Capula. All the remainder units followed in later years. The APMS database contains some 16,000 points. Operations staff interact with the system through four main workstation screens, supplemented by a further six overview screens. ===Flue gas desulphurisation=== In June 2000, work began on the fitting of flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) equipment at the station. FLS Miljo installed the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries wet limestone systems, while Arup Energy and Mowlem took up a design–build partnership to undertake the civil works and construction of infrastructure. The work was completed in October 2003, and had a total cost of £100 million. As part of the new FGD retrofit two new chimneys 200 m (656 ft) high were constructed 194 m (636 ft) to the north of the existing chimneys, numbers 1 and 2. In January 2003 when the new chimney 2 was erected alongside the old chimney 2 the wind direction changed and began blowing from the north hitting the new chimney 2 first, at a speed of 11.83 m/s (26.47 mph). This created a vortex and caused the old chimney 2 to start oscillating to a magnitude of 931 mm (36 in) at its height of 182.8 m (600 ft) and an angle of 600 seconds (0.166 degrees). The old chimneys were later demolished and used as built up ground to form the security gatehouse and parking area at the power station entrance. ==Environment== West Burton is currently opted in to the UK Transitional National Plan, placing limits on its sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides and particulates emissions to a period up to the end of 2020. part of the Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EU which superseded the Large Combustion Plant Directive 2001/80/EC. Under the EU regulations West Burton is classed as two power plants due to the fact of having two chimneys. ==Unbuilt West Burton 'B' (Coal)== In 1988 the then chairman of the CEGB Walter Marshall, Baron Marshall of Goring announced a 2 x 900 MW coal-fired power station fitted with flue-gas desulfurisation (FGD) to be known as 'West Burton B' would be built on the site. The plan was abandoned just before privatisation. ==Combined cycle gas turbine power station== A £600 million 1,270 MWe CCGT power station, which runs on natural gas, was built next to the coal-fired station. Construction by the Kier Group started in January 2008. It was built on land originally allocated for a proposed 1,800 MW West Burton 'B' coal power station that was to have been built in the 1980s. Privatisation of the electricity industry in 1990 cancelled this scheme. The power station commissioned in 2013, and supplies electricity to around 1.5 million homes. A new gas pipeline was built to link to the National Gas Transmission System at Grayingham in Lincolnshire. Around 1,000 people were involved in the construction. The plant consists of three 430 MW gas turbines each with a heat recovery steam generator. Activists from the No Dash For Gas group protesting against the building of the gas plant pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated trespass in February 2013. EDF discontinued a civil lawsuit against them in March 2013. ==References * Celebrating 40 years of electricity production at West Burton, EDF, 2009 * SOFA system on burners in 2004 * FGD retrofit * New CCGT power station * Aerial photograph * No Dash For Gas ends the UK's longest power station occupation * EDF Energy opens West Burton gas-fired power station Category:Buildings and structures in Nottinghamshire Category:Power stations in the East Midlands Category:Coal-fired power stations in England Category:Natural gas-fired power stations in England Category:1967 establishments in England Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1967 Category:Recipients of Civic Trust Awards ","title":"West Burton power stations"},{"id":"19273106","text":"William or Willie Waddell may refer to: *Willie Waddell, Scottish footballer and manager for Rangers F.C. *Willie Waddell (footballer, born 1919), less well known Scottish footballer, played for Aberdeen and Kettering Town *William B.

His only prior elected office had been serving two terms as Vice President of Big Beaver Borough Council in Beaver County. In 2006, Marshall ran for the House of Representatives against House Minority Whip, Rep. Mike Veon. At the time, Veon was under a great deal of criticism for his role in the 2005 legislative pay raise. Veon not only supported the pay increase, but was the only legislator to vote against its repeal. Despite heavy Democratic registration in the district, Marshall prevailed in the general election with 53.9% of the vote. Marshall serves on four House committees: Commerce, Gaming Oversight, Veterans Affairs and Emergency Preparedness, and Policy. He serves as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Security and Emergency Response of the Veterans Affairs and Emergency Preparedness Committee.

It was available as a van, called the Homy, a double cab, or regular cab truck. The first model was known as the T64, and was sold as the Prince Homer or PMC T64. The T640 was introduced in 1966 and was sold as a Nissan (without any modifications aside from badging) due to Prince merging with Nissan. It was shared with the Nissan Cabstar which was sold at Nissan Bluebird Store Japanese dealerships. Production of the T640 ended in 1968. The Homer was exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealerships called Nissan Prince Store, when Prince was merged with Nissan in 1966. The Homer name was discontinued in 1982, while the Cabstar name remained when Nissan refocused Nissan Prince Store vehicles as private purchase products. The T641 Homer was introduced in 1968 and the slotted grille was replaced with a new 'cat-whiskers' grille. It was rebadged as the Nissan Homer for the Japanese domestic market, and was marketed in Europe and Australia as the Datsun Homer. There was also a Van version, codenamed V641. While the T641 was in production, a 1.25 ton version was built, called the T642. Unlike the T641, the T642 was not available in a van version. The Homer was sold in Taiwan by Yue Loong, originally as the Yue Loong YLN-251. Nissan Homer V641 (Thailand) ==Changes== The T20 Homer was introduced in 1972, replacing the T641. The T20 used the same grille as the previous model, but the front signal indicators were taller. T20 production ended in 1976.

In September 1979 the F21 was introduced, the new model could pass the 1979 emissions standards and had also received a light facelift. The F20 version was also sold as the Nissan Cabstar in Japan (Datsun Cabstar abroad). Production ended in February 1982, when the Homer line was subsumed into Nissan's own new light truck, the F22 Nissan Atlas.

It is located in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, though it was originally located in Zomba, Malawi. In addition to subsidiary departments that are funded for the future studies or for the exploration of the future, INADEP has funded a Centre for the exploration of the past, named Diop's Center for Egyptology.Unesco, Ali Al'Amin Mazrui, Christophe Wondji (eds.) Africa since 1935. International Scientific Committee for the Drafting of a General History of Africa, University of California Press, (1999) p. 648. INADEP is a member of the National Research Council of Congo and one of the National Government Organizations devoted exclusively to scientific research and to the training of new researchers. ==Origin== In 1976 the United Nations, through its Economic Commission for Africa (EGA) launched the idea of founding an African Institute for Studies of the Future. In 1977, the IXth Conference for ECA ministers defined the objectives of the Institute. In 1980m Professor Mahdi Elmandjra conducted a feasibility study entitled Report on the Desirability and Feasibility of Establishing an African Institute for Advanced public Policy Analysis and Future Studies. In 1981, the OAU summit held in Nairobi approved the idea of founding an Institute for decolonising the future. In 1982, the Conference for EGA Ministers approved the idea of establishing the Institute. In 1987 the book Reconquering the Future was published at the request of UNDP. ==Foundation== In 1985, the International Symposium on Africa and its Future thinks it is appropriate to start an African Centre for Studies of the Future. President Mobutu Sese Seko agrees to the idea and offers to provide initial infrastructural facilities in Kinshasa. Ordinance 89–287 of 9 November 1989 prescribed the foundation of a public institution called Institut Africain d'Etudes Prospectives (INADEP), and in 1990 the Center for Egyptology was added. The chairman of the Centre for Egyptology is Mubabinge Bilolo. ==Objectives== The Institute is an Africa-oriented study centre and, as such, pursues the following main objectives: *Provide institutional facilities for long term research on international, political, cultural, economic, sociological, and technical modifications to the African or world situation in the present or in the future *assess strategies, indicate the various options available, and offer a just and balanced picture of the future as well as propose directives for a planified realisation of the objectives proposed Article 3 of the ordinance ==Support== The INADEP receives support and encouragement from international institutions such as UNDP, OAU, EGA, UNESCO, UNICEF, ABDA, ABD, EEC, and the World Bank. It also receives support from specialised centres in France, Great Britain, Germany, the United States, Scandinavian Countries, Japan, and the Soviet Union. ==ProgrammeImmediate actions=== The programme includes a campaign for the cohesion of African countries and for obtaining of assistance expected from international organisations. ===Departments of the institute=== *Documentation and basic equipment department *Centre for computerised data *Research units ==Activities== *General concepts and methods of future studies *Analysis and definition of Main Directions of development *Bibliologie or graphic communication *Training by means of conferences, retraining and in-service sessions, short courses, and other means *Organisation of colloquia and symposia *Studies for the prevention of social deviance *Publication of Editions Universitaires Africaines /EDUAF ==References * INADEP * Membership * Association International Association of Egyptologists * CCER List of Egyptologists * Revue de l'INADEP Category:Education in Kinshasa ","title":"African Institute for Future Studies"},{"id":"19273430","text":"The men's C-2 1000 metres event was an open-style, pairs canoeing event conducted as part of the Canoeing at the 1960 Summer Olympics program on Lake Albano. ==Medalists== { class= align=center bgcolor=gold Gold Gold align=center bgcolor=silver Silver Silver align=center bgcolor=cc9966 Bronze Bronze -    } ==ResultsHeats=== Eleven teams first raced in two heats on August 26.

The site includes the war memorial, with a firespotting cabin, mature monterey cypress trees and other planted species, and a sandstone caretaker's cottage. The park is situated on the summit of Garden Hill, from which panoramic views are obtainable. The park is situated on two acres. Towards the end of World War One, in August 1918, Eltham Shire Council discussed and 'generally expressed themselves as favourable to the proposal' to obtain a \\"piece of land on the summit of Garden Hill, Kangaroo Ground, and the formation of a memorial park in which a monument could be erected to represent the whole of the Shire. Local resident Walter Wippell donated £50 and with it Council purchased the one acre site. In 1919 Joseph Mess agreed to take £50 per acre for two acres of his Garden Hill property. By 1920 subscriptions lists were opened for the purposes of raising funds to \\"carry out the proposed scheme of beautification, and also to erect, at a later date, a fitting monument to perpetuate the memory of those who fell in the Great War'. Working bees took place on the site and rocks were collected for a memorial cairn which was built in a slight depression which signified the highest point in the park. The compilation of \\"a complete record of the names of all persons who enlised for service from the Shire and of those who made the supreme sacrifice whilst doing their duty\\" began in 1920. The park was officially opened by Mr. W. H. Everard, M.L.A. on 3 September 1921. In 1927 a stone hut, known as the caretaker's cottage was built from left over stone quarried for the tower. On Remembrance Day, 2005 a seedling, a descendant of the Gallipoli lone pine tree was planted. Brick toilets constructed in 1965 were also removed and replaced in 2005 including a universal access space. In 2006, a plaque was put in place from the Vietnam Veterans community in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. Nillumbik Shire Council received funding under the 2008-09 Restoring Community War Memorials Grants program to restore plaques on the Tower, and replace bollards to enhance security around the memorial. In December 2014, Nillumbik Shire Council received Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program funding to create new interpretative signage. In 2015 Shire of Nillumbik added the Tower of Remembrance and War Memorial Park and Moor-ul Viewing Platform to its draft register of memorials. In 2020 Shire of Nillumbik commenced preparing a master plan to create a long-term vision and plan for the park. == Geology == Garden Hill and the surrounding 2000 acres consistng of black soil are probably the remains of an extensive sheet of lava that once flowed down a shallow river valley. Possibly there were two flows. Early settlers considered the area an extinct volcano. == Shire of Eltham War Memorial == The Shire memorial was built based on a sketch by artist Harold Herbert who was inspired by the view, which reminded him of northern England and a conversation with friend Basil Hay mentioning stone keeps built to detect cattle duffing raids centuries ago on the border counties of Scotland and England. It was designed by architects Stephenson and Meldrum. It is built from local stone donated by the local community including Professor William Osborne, and reinforced concrete with sandstone rubble facing and concrete quoins and dressings. The foundations are solid rock with the base of the tower in 16 x 16 external and 11 x 11 internal, the wall being 2 feet 6 inches thick at the base, tapering to 16 inches at the top. The building contractor was George Rousell.The original internal staircase was made from jarrah, with galvanised iron pipe handrailings leading to a look- out. There are 53 stairs. The memorial is 40 feet high or 237 metres. The view extends to the Kinglake National Park escarpment, the mountains beyond Healesville, the Dandenongs, Port Phillip Bay, the You Yangs and Mt. Macedon. It was opened on Armistice Day, 11 November 1926 by the Governor-General, Lord John Baird Stonehaven, when he also unveiled a temporary honour board. In 1930 a tablet bearing the names of men who served and fell in the First World War was erected on the memorial. On 16 November 1951, the Governor of Victoria, Sir Dallas Brooks re-dedicated the memorial with an additional plaque to honour those who had died between 1939 and 1945 and the caretaker's cottage as memorials to the dead of the two world wars. In November 2001, on the memorial's 75th anniversary, Victorian Governor John Landy unveiled plaques to honour servicemen and women who served in post World War 2 conflicts in Korea, Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam. The memorial is considered architecturally, socially, aesthetically and historically significant to the Shire of Nillumbik and is considered one of Victoria's most unusual war memorials. === Fire Spotting === Following the Black Friday Bushfires in 1939, which impacted the area, a telephone was installed for the use of volunteers using the tower as an observation post for fires. Forests Commission Victoria included the tower as part of its fire-watching network and it was the command post when significant bushfires took place locally in 1962. An enclosed cabin cover was erected on the top of the tower in 1974. The advice of Mr Meldrum, the architect of the memorial was sought and he agreed that the proposed shelter could be added without aesthetic damage. On Black Saturday, 7 February 2009, fire spotters observed new fires starting and with the help of maps, binoculars and other towers in the region, they were able to determine the location of fires starting up, which were then reported to the Kilmore incident control centre. This cabin was replaced with a new tower in December 2009. Improvements included a new larger and airconditioned cabin two metres higher than the original cabin. It is fitted with new communication and mapping equuipment and is built on a tilt to eliminate reflection. It is a manned incident control centre in the summer, part of the Country Fire Authority's District 13 operations. == Viewing Platform and Grasslands == The Moor-rul viewing platform was opened on 17 April 2008 in the presence of Jenny Macklin, MP. The function of the platform is to provide shelter adjacent to the war memorial whilst allowing people to enjoy the view. It can be accessed by wheelchair. The name Moor-rul is indigenous describing the fertile soils of the Kangaroo Ground area. Eight double-sided interpretative panels on the platform describe the Aboriginal and European history, geology and flora and fauna of the area. A small section of land next to the platform is maintained with plants indigenous to the area. ==References * Kangaroo Ground Tower of Remembrance Category:Australian military memorials Category:Buildings and structures in Melbourne ","title":"Kangaroo Ground War Memorial Park"},{"id":"19273469","text":"Neil Taylor may refer to: *Neil Taylor (cricketer, born 1959), English cricketer *Neil Taylor (cricketer, born 1964), English cricketer *Neil Taylor (footballer) (born 1989), Welsh footballer *Neil Taylor (journalist) (born 1959), English music journalist *Neil Taylor (guitarist) (born 1961), English guitarist *Neil Taylor (Neighbours), fictional character from the soap opera Neighbours *Piffles Taylor (1893/4–1946), Canadian World War I pilot, Canadian football player, coach, and executive ","title":"Neil Taylor"},{"id":"19273484","text":"KHBL-LP (96.9 FM) is a Low Power radio station licensed to serve Hannibal, Missouri.

Dick received a Bachelor of Science in astrophysics from Indiana University in 1971. In 1977, he earned a Master of Arts and a Ph.D. in the history and philosophy of science. For 24 years, Dick worked as an astronomer and historian of science for United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., including three years at the Naval Observatory's Southern Hemisphere station in New Zealand. There he was part of a team using transit telescopes and astrographs to chart the northern and southern skies.

They argue that since the ancient Greeks, extraterrestrial life has been a theme tied to scientific cosmologies, including the ancient atomist, Copernican, Cartesian, and Newtonian worldviews. Dick argues that from an epistemological point of view the methods of astrobiology in the twentieth century are as empirical as in any historical science such as astronomy or geology. Dick has also surveyed the field of astrobiology in \\"Critical Issues in the History, Philosophy, and Sociology of Astrobiology\\" (Astrobiology, Vol. 12, No. 10, 2012). On December 4, 2013, while holding the NASA/Library of Congress Chair in Astrobiology, Dick testified on astrobiology before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, arguing that SETI funding should be restored and integrated with the NASA astrobiology program.U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, \\"Full Committee Hearing on Astrobiology\\" ===Intelligence Principle=== The intelligence principle is a hypothetical idea of Dick's in the field of cultural evolution.

The character was created by series' co-creator J. J. Abrams, and is portrayed by actress Jasika Nicole. Astrid is one of the series' protagonists, and was introduced as a Junior FBI Agent, doing research work for Olivia Dunham on her cases and became involved in a multi-agency task force of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security called the Fringe Division, dealing with supernatural events that are linked to experimental occurrences. She works alongside Walter Bishop for the entirety of the series. Astrid's role gradually increases throughout the series. In the first three seasons, she acts as Walter's lab assistant but also takes personal care of him. A common gag in the series is Walter erroneously calling Astrid a series of different names similar to her real name. In the fourth season, due to the alternate timeline, Astrid is now a field agent, and also takes on a larger role, particularly the episode \\"Making Angels.\\" Following a plot line in the second season, viewers are introduced to Astrid's doppelgänger from the parallel universe who is an autistic computer and statistics specialist within the Fringe division. Nicole's performance as both versions of the character were praised. ==Arc== Astrid graduated from Haverford College with a B.A. in Music and Linguistics and a minor in Computer Science, having taken computers apart since she was six years old. She speaks five languages. In the pilot episode, she is first introduced as Olivia's assistant whom she brings in to help work with Walter in the lab, although her main function as a character acted as being someone to whom Walter Bishop explains things. In \\"The Same Old Story,\\" Astrid contributes to the investigation by recognizing the Sargent Bridge that was the last thing one of Christopher Penrose's victims saw before she died. In \\"The Ghost Network,\\" Astrid translates the Latin that the adversaries are using to communicate with each other into English for the rest of the investigative team. At the end of the episode, she takes Roy McComb away to have him sign some release forms. In \\"The Arrival,\\" she is sedated against her will by Dr. Bishop so that he can abscond with the Beacon and protect it from being stolen. He later attempts to sincerely apologize to her for his actions, although it takes some time for her to forgive him. In the fourth season's alternate timeline, Astrid acts as a field agent, based on the effects of Peter ceasing to exist as an adult from the events of \\"The Day We Died\\" in order to ensure both universes work together. In \\"Making Angels,\\" she is visited by her counterpart, and screams when seeing her, as she had never met her. Her counterpart speaks in a stilted and nearly hysterical manner, which makes it difficult for Astrid to understand her. Alternate Astrid reveals her father died and explains to Astrid that her autism prevented her from properly expressing her grief to anyone but herself, so she crossed over to speak with Astrid. Astrid attempts to counsel her double and befriends her while they work on a case. Her alternate eventually questions her about the relationship she shares with her own father, revealing the alternate's father- daughter relationship was strained because she wasn't normal. Astrid attempts to ease her grief by telling her that her own father is distant and also has a hard time expressing his feelings, but that she knows he loves her in his own way. Her counterpart leaves seemingly reassured, and Astrid returns home to a loving and doting father, revealing that she lied to her double to make her feel better. In \\"Brave New World,\\" Astrid demonstrates adept combat skills by defending Walter and taking out several of William Bell's henchmen as they try to locate him, before she is shot in the stomach. Upon recovering in the hospital, she bonds with Walter. In the fifth season, Astrid, along with Olivia, Peter and Walter are freed from amber after 21 years due to the Observer takeover and are now part of a resistance to remove them from the current timeline. After they recover Walter's old video tapes on the instructions of defeating them, they discover from the Observer named September, a distant ally of theirs, that they must take Michael, an Observer- like child who is part of the plan, to the future by convincing a scientist from Norway that removing human emotions for intelligence is unnecessary, as the child, Michael, would be an example of this. Ultimately, the plan is made to remove the Observers from existence. In \\"An Enemy of Fate,\\" Astrid and Walter bond as he decides he must make the sacrifice to account for his mistakes. Walter tells Astrid she has a beautiful name, and she tries to comfort him by saying they will be back in the lab when the timeline is reset as usual. In the final scene, Astrid watches in tears as she sees Walter for the last time as he crosses through the wormhole with the child anomaly, Michael, thus creating a time paradox and ceasing to exist in the final timeline. ==Development== Nicole's performance of the alternate Astrid Farnsworth, who is autistic, is based on her real-life sister. ==Reception== Jasika Nicole's increased role in the fourth season was praised. In particular, the episode \\"Making Angels\\" was considered a long overdue highlight which explored her character, her parallel universe's character struggling over the death of her father among other things. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club gave Nicole particular praise for her portrayal as the alternate Astrid, dubbed \\"Austrid\\"'s mannerisms and how realistic the character was portrayed. However, he was \\"mildly dismayed\\" that the storyline concluded with the alternate Astrid wondering if her father loved her, as experiencing love was a common trope in stories with autistic characters. He wondered how some of the events mentioned fit into the larger story arc, but found that the episode \\"offers its own refutation for those who get frustrated trying to figure out what's what.\\" SFX reviewer Richard Edwards was positive toward the character-driven developments of Astrid and Walter. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Andrew Hanson felt Astrid's story was \\"enthralling.\\" Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly enjoyed the impact that the other Astrid made on the prime universe characters. Den of Geek highlighting the use of Astrid and Jasika Nicole’s performance as \\"note-perfect.\\" ==References== Category:Television characters introduced in 2008 Category:Fictional characters on the autism spectrum Category:Fictional Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel Category:Fringe (TV series) characters Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Astrid Farnsworth"},{"id":"19273658","text":"Gene D.

It is often used in the spherical coordinates analysis of solenoidal vector fields, for example, magnetic fields and incompressible fluids. ==Definition== For a three-dimensional vector field F with zero divergence : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} = 0, this F can be expressed as the sum of a toroidal field T and poloidal vector field P :\\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\mathbf{T} + \\\\mathbf{P} where r is a radial vector in spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ). The toroidal field is obtained from a scalar field, Ψ(r, θ, φ), as the following curl, : \\\\mathbf{T} = abla \\\\times (\\\\mathbf{r} \\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r})) and the poloidal field is derived from another scalar field Φ(r, θ, φ), as a twice- iterated curl, : \\\\mathbf{P} = abla \\\\times ( abla \\\\times (\\\\mathbf{r} \\\\Phi (\\\\mathbf{r})))\\\\,. This decomposition is symmetric in that the curl of a toroidal field is poloidal, and the curl of a poloidal field is toroidal, known as Chandrasekhar–Kendall function. ==Geometry== A toroidal vector field is tangential to spheres around the origin, : \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{T} = 0 while the curl of a poloidal field is tangential to those spheres : \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\cdot ( abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{P}) = 0. The poloidal–toroidal decomposition is unique if it is required that the average of the scalar fields Ψ and Φ vanishes on every sphere of radius r. == Cartesian decomposition == A poloidal–toroidal decomposition also exists in Cartesian coordinates, but a mean-field flow has to be included in this case. For example, every solenoidal vector field can be written as : \\\\mathbf{F}(x,y,z) = abla \\\\times g(x,y,z) \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}} + abla \\\\times ( abla \\\\times h(x,y,z) \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}}) + b_x(z) \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}} + b_y(z)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{y}}, where \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}, \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{y}}, \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}} denote the unit vectors in the coordinate directions. ==See also== * Toroidal and poloidal * Chandrasekhar–Kendall function == Notes  References == * Hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability, Chandrasekhar, Subrahmanyan; International Series of Monographs on Physics, Oxford: Clarendon, 1961, p. 622\\\\. * Decomposition of solenoidal fields into poloidal fields, toroidal fields and the mean flow.

The headquarters of the GES is in Stuttgart. == Formation == The society was founded on 8 December 1965 by a group of tramway fans within the so-called Verkehrsfreunde Stuttgart society, that had signed up for the preservation and care of the last remaining railcar, no. 126, from the former Filderbahn as well as other historically valuable trams. After the Stuttgart Tram Company (Stuttgarter Straßenbahnen or SSB) had shown no interest in building up a museum collection and the Filderbahn railcar 126 could only be preserved by keeping it at Ludwigsburg, the GES turned at the end of the 1960s to the more promising theme of opening a railway. The engagement of the GES for the preservation and subsequent restoration of the Filderbahn wagon laid the foundation stone for the present-day collection of the Stuttgarter Historische Straßenbahnen. == Timetable == The GES runs regular museum railway operations using the historical train consists Feuriger Elias ('Fiery Elias') and Sofazügle (literally: 'Little Sofa Train'). Due to the ban on steam locomotives issued by the Deutsche Bundesbahn between 1977 and 1985 the operations were restricted to private railway lines on the Strohgäubahn from Korntal-Münchingen to Weissach or the Tälesbahn between Nürtingen and Neuffen. The trains continue to have this as their there today. To begin with, special trips were also run on the WEG routes from Enz Nord to Enzweihingen and, up to 1982, on the Filderbahn between Stuttgart-Möhringen, Stuttgart-Vaihingen, Leinfelden and Neuhausen auf den Fildern. From 1985 specials were also offered on other routes in the Stuttgart area. == Hohenzollern train == Locomotive 11 of the GES in Marbach (June 2004) Locomotive GES no. 16, formerly KOE no. 11 The GES has a cultural monument to the state of Baden-Württemberg: the Hohenzollern train.

It is based on the 1960 novel The Night of Wenceslas by Lionel Davidson. The film was cut by twenty minutes and retitled Agent for the US release by the American distributor Central Distributing. Part of a trend of spy films in the wake of the success of the James Bond series, its art director was Syd Cain, who had the same job on the first two Bond films. Koscina herself had been considered for the role of Tatiana Romanova in From Russia with Love. ==Plot== Roger Allsop (John Le Mesurier) turns over some belongings to a clerk, who stows them in a drawer marked 007 before turning the identifying card over to read \\"deceased\\". Allsop and his superior, Colonel Cunliffe (Robert Morley), then discuss the necessity to send someone to pick up something behind the Iron Curtain. Unemployed British writer Nicholas Whistler (Dirk Bogarde) is sent by the employment exchange to be interviewed by Cunliffe, supposedly for a job as a trainee executive for a glass company. Cunliffe discovers Whistler speaks Czech, and offers him an exorbitant salary, plus expenses. Whistler is given puzzling instructions to meet someone who will respond to his remark, \\"Hot enough for June\\", by stating he should have been there in September, before being sent that very day to Prague on a \\"business\\" trip. On his arrival, he is assigned a beautiful driver and guide, Vlasta (Sylva Koscina). She drives him to inspect a glass factory, where he finally discovers the washroom attendant is his man. However, he has to come back another day to make contact without arousing suspicion. That night, he takes Vlasta to dinner. Unbeknownst to him, she is an agent of the secret police. The communists know (though he himself does not yet realise it) that he is actually working for British intelligence, and keep him under surveillance. He and Vlasta spend the next day together as well. They are attracted to each other, and she invites him to stay the night at her surprisingly luxurious home. When Whistler revisits the factory, the attendant gives him a piece of paper and informs him that he is a spy. Vlasta arranges to meet him secretly that night; she warns him to return to England immediately. However, when he returns to the hotel, Simenova (Leo McKern), the head of the secret police, is waiting. He presents Whistler with a stark choice: sign a confession or suffer a fatal accidental fall. Whistler manages to escape. Evading a manhunt, he turns to the only person who might be willing to help him: Vlasta. When he reaches her house in the morning, however, he is shocked to find her seeing her father, Simenova, off to work. After Simenova leaves, Whistler confronts Vlasta. She offers to help him reach the British embassy, despite a cordon of communist agents. To demonstrate his good faith, he burns the slip of paper so that neither side can have it. Her plan almost succeeds, but by sheer bad luck, Simenova is leaving the embassy as Whistler approaches and recognises him, forcing him to flee once more. Finally, he reaches the embassy by knocking out a milkman and taking his place. Cunliffe informs him that he is being exchanged for a spy the British have caught. At the airport, he is pleasantly surprised to find that Vlasta has been assigned to the trade mission in London and is departing on the same airliner. ==Cast== * Dirk Bogarde as Nicholas Whistler * Sylva Koscina as Vlasta Simenova * Robert Morley as Colonel Cunliffe * Leo McKern as Simenova * Roger Delgado as Josef * Derek Fowlds as Sun Bathing Man * Amanda Grinling as Cunliffe's secretary * Noel Harrison as Johnnie * Philo Hauser as Vlcek * John Junkin as Clerk in opening scene * Gertan Klauber as Technician in the Czech glass factory * John Le Mesurier as Roger Allsop * Jill Melford as Lorna * Derek Nimmo as Fred * Richard Pasco as Plakov * Eric Pohlmann as Galushka * Alan Tilvern as Simenova's assistant * Richard Vernon as Roddinghead * Brook Williams as Leon * Norman Bird as Employment exchange clerk (uncredited) * Frank Finlay as British Embassy porter (uncredited) * William Mervyn as Passenger on the plane (uncredited) * Tiberio Mitri as the Milkman (uncredited) * George Pravda as Pravelko (uncredited) * John Standing as Men's Room attendant/British agent (uncredited) ==Production== Film rights to Lionel Davidson's novel were originally bought by American producer Hal Wallis, who wanted to make the film with Laurence Harvey. However, Wallis and Harvey had a falling out and the rights went instead to Rank and producer Betty E. Box.Box p 227 Dirk Bogarde was cast in the lead. However he then decided he did not want to, as he had just made The Servant (1963). Box and director Ralph Thomas were not unduly concerned as they did not feel Bogarde was ideal casting anyway, and approached Tom Courtenay instead. Courtney agreed, but then Bogarde changed his mind again after his manager told him he needed the money.Bogarde p 229-230 Shooting took place in Padua, representing Prague.Box, Betty Evelyn Lifting the Lid: The Autobiography of Film Producer, Betty Box, OBE Book Guild 2000 p 227-237 Ralph Thomas later said he made the film \\"because I thought the script was quite funny and I loved working with Dirk.

The township is located on the China–Pakistan border. The southern part of the township is located in the Trans-Karakoram Tract claimed by India. ==Name== 'Dafdar' means 'door' or 'gateway' (\\"\\") in the Sarikoli language (also known as 'Tajik' (), the language of Tajiks of Xinjiang). ==History== AMS, 1966) The area has been used for grazing by various pastoral people in the region for centuries. During the Qing dynasty, the Chinese claimed suzerainty over the area but permitted the Mir of Hunza to administer the region in return for a tribute. According to British colonial sources, this arrangement started during early Ayosh dynasty of Mir of Hunza, as the Mir conquered the Kirghiz nomads of Taghdumbash Pamir. The Mir erected a cairn in the village to evidence his control. The tribute system continued up until 1937. In the 1875, British explorers recorded that Dafdar did not have a permanent settlement, but that it was used a caravan camp on the route between Tashkurgan and Hunza Valley. In the early 1900s, a group of Wakhi settled here with the consent of the Chinese authority. In March 1950, Dafdar Township was established. In 1959, Dafdar Township became a commune. In 1966, Dafdar Commune was renamed Xianfeng Commune ('pioneer commune', ). In 1975 in the closing days of the Cultural Revolution, the original name was restored. In February 1985, Dafdar Commune was made a township. Emerald deposit was discovered at Dafdar in 2003. These emeralds show similar chemical fingerprints to Afghan emeralds from Panjshir Valley. ==Geography== K2, the second highest mountain on Earth, is located in the Trans-Karakoram Tract on the China-Pakistan border in Dafdar. Dafdar village lies at an altitude of 3,400 m above sea level, just to the east of the Karakoram Highway. ==Administrative divisions== , the township included five villages (Mandarin Chinese pinyin-derived names): * Dabuda'er (), Atejiayili (), Resikamu ( / ), Bositeduokete (), Hongqilafu () ==Demographics== In 1997, 89.6% of the population of the township was Mountain Tajik (China) and 10.3% of the population was Kyrgyz. It is inhabited by Wakhis. As of the 2000's, there was one mosque in the township and twelve religious professionals. ==Transportation== * China National Highway 314 ==See also== * Shaksgam River * Chalachigu Valley == References == Category:China–Pakistan border Category:Populated places in Xinjiang Category:Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County Category:Township-level divisions of Xinjiang ","title":"Dafdar"},{"id":"19273712","text":"Géry-Jacques-Charles Leuliet (12 January 1910 – 1 January 2015) was a French prelate of the Roman Catholic Church and at the time of his death, was the oldest bishop of the Catholic Church, at 104 years of age.

Davies is a multi-instrumentalist whose primary instruments are the violin, guitar and percussion. ==Career== Saul Davies was hired as a member of James in 1989, after the band's guitarist Larry Gott saw him playing violin at the Band On The Wall in Manchester. Impressed by his abilities, Gott invited Davies to join the band at their rehearsal room the following day for an audition. Davies immediately impressed the band members, who offered him a role in the band as violinist. Davies accepted, initially as a stop-gap measure, and went on to assist with guitar and percussion on the band's 1990 album Gold Mother, which was also to become the band's commercial breakthrough. Davies ended up remaining with the band throughout the 1990s, and his creative input became more prominent towards the end of the decade, particularly on the 1999 album Millionaires, most of the songs of which were developed from base tracks sketched out by Davies. His contribution was recognized in the sleeve notes for the album with bassist Jim Glennie's comment- \\"Jim Glennie would like to personally thank Saul for his work on this album over and above the call of duty.\\" Davies also participated in the dance-based side-project Money, together with fellow band members David Baynton-Power and Mark Hunter. Following the departure in 2001 of the band's lead singer Tim Booth, the band became inactive and Davies confirmed his own departure in two separate articles throughout 2002. With the band's reformation in 2007, Davies was confirmed as part of the reformed line-up and joined the band on their reunion tour in April of that year, then played on their comeback album Hey Ma released in April 2008, then released by two mini- albums, The Night Before and The Morning After in 2010, then by 2014's thirteenth album La Petite Mort and recently, the 2016's current album Girl at the End of the World.

In 1906 he joined the Bolton Artillery, a unit of the Volunteer Force. He continued his connection with the successors to the Volunteers, the Territorial Force, serving in Egypt, Gallipoli and France in First World War. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1918.Obituary: Sir Joseph Nall, The Times, 5 May 1958 At the general election of 1918 he was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for the Hulme constituency of Manchester. He became the parliamentary private secretary to the Home Secretary, W C Bridgeman, and was knighted in 1924 as part of Stanley Baldwin's resignation honours.Resignation Honours, 9 February 1924, p.10 He lost his parliamentary seat to the Labour Party at the 1929 election, but regained it two years later at the 1931 poll. In May 1935, Nall and four other Conservative MPs asked that the National Government whip be withdrawn from them in protest against proposals to introduce Home Rule to India.Government Whip Declined, Five Conservative Members, The Times, 24 May 1935, p.18 In February 1935 Nall became one of the first people to predict that Sir Winston Churchill would become Prime Minister (even though at the time Churchill was in the political wilderness). Nall observed that ‘If there were a big political crisis … Churchill by virtue of his brains and personality would take the foremost place, and would in that event be accepted by the Tory Party.’A.J.P. Taylor (ed.), Off the Record: Political Interviews 1933-1943 (1973), p. 32. Also in 1935 Nall became chairman of Joseph Nall and Company, and he subsequently held a number of directorships in companies in Northern England. He remained MP for Hulme until the next election in 1945, which was delayed by the Second World War. Nall retired from parliament at this point. He was the last chairman of the Lancashire Electric Light and Power Company until its nationalisation in 1947. The family firm was also taken over by the state in the following year, when it passed to the British Transport Commission. Nall continued to be the member of a number of other company boards including Lancashire United Transport and Wilson and Walker Breweries.

During this period Adrian recorded some demos and videos and played in several bars and clubs locally. The highlight came with performances and the first Gibraltar National Day Concert and supporting Shaggy in June 1996. Seeing that forming part of a band would not take his song writing the direction he wanted, he decided to start working as a solo artist. He immediately started working on his song writing and records a few songs. Among these he entered the song \\"Libertad\\" in the John Lennon Songwriting Contest. To his delight he won first prize in the Latin category being the only European Grand Prize winner in twelve different categories. The prize includes a publishing contract with EMI for the winning song. Shortly after, 1999, Adrian finished his first album Cuidado Con El a six track EP. This has a good response with the critics and general public, several public appearances in the local media follow. In 2000 Adrian jumped into the international stage supporting two Spanish Chart toppers, Gibraltarian band Melon Diesel and the Argentinian King Africa. In 2001 he joins local band Reach as session rhythm guitarist and tours Spain supporting the biggest Spanish band at that moment, Estopa. Reach played in ten different Spanish cities to sell out crowds. The highlight of the year came as Adrian released his second studio album Adelante, this more mature album allows Adrian to further express himself as an artist and cements him as a main contributor to the music scene in Gibraltar. During the last few years Adrian has been a regular in the local music scene continuing to play in many venues with Eric Rowbottom.

They were first held in their current format in 2010, when elite level cyclists competed for the first time following an overhaul of European track cycling. The UEC agreed with the governing bodies of six other major European sports from 2018 to integrate its four Olympic-class events, including track cycling, into the new European Championships event on a quadrennial basis. Beginning with 2018, every fourth edition of the competition will form part of the multi-sport event. While track cycling will also form part of the 2019 European Games in Minsk, these events will not be European Championships, and the UEC event will also be held later in the same year. In line with cycling tradition, winners of an event at the championships are presented with, in addition to the gold medal, a special, identifiable jersey. This UEC European Champion jersey is a blue jersey with gold European stars. ==Pre-History== The first European Track Championships were held in Berlin in 1886 and featured only 5 km and 10 km men's scratch races. ===Age group championships=== Prior to 2010, championship events were run under the same name, but solely for junior and under-23 cyclists, and the 2010 event is recognised as the first elite level senior championships. Since 2010, separate annual European championships for under-23 and junior riders have continued, described explicitly as such. European Track Cycling Championships have been held for junior and under-23 athletes for a long time, though records in earlier editions are incomplete. They provided useful experience for young riders with winners automatically qualifying to compete at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships in which no age limit applied, and the world's best track cyclists competed. A European Masters Track Championships also exists for riders over 35 years old. ===Derny, Madison and Omnium championships=== Men's European Track Championships for the \\"motor-paced\\" or \\"derny\\" track cycling discipline have been held since 1896. A separate European Madison championship event was also run for men. Separate elite European Omnium Championships have been held since 1959, which were later incorporated into the senior European Track Championships on their introduction in 2010. ==Founding of the modern Elite Championships== In 2010 the UEC instigated a significant overhaul of how cyclists qualify for the Olympic Games. As a result, the European Championships was also introduced for elite level European cyclists. The first elite championships thereafter took place at the beginning of November 2010. It followed the same ten event schedule for the 2012 Olympics but also included the Madison \\"due to popular demand\\". The Under 23 and Junior championships thereafter were run as an annual separate event. ==CompetitionsElite=== {  ! Number !!Year !! Date !! Country !! City !! Velodrome !!

It is located in the Chamba district, around from Ishriari village in the Paddar valley of Jammu and Kashmir. Dharwas is the largest and most populated hamlet in the Pangi Valley on the Dalhousie-Kishtwar trek route. The village is located at an elevation of above sea level. Trekking base camps are available. Dharwas is famous for the natural mineral-water spring known as Tilmili. It is believed that water from this spring was sent regularly to the Raja of Chamba. The trek trail leading to Sural Valley of Pangi starts from Dharwas and spans to Zanskar. The Pangi Valley is the most remote valley of the Chamba district, and was described by Dr. J Hutchison (in 1904) as follows: :\\"Pangi is unique in its grandeur and beauty: in this respect far surpassing any other portion of Chamba District. The scenery is sublime and imposing, and nature appears in her wildest and grandest moods. Everything is on a stupendous scale. The great river rolls along in a deep and narrow gorge, lashing itself into fury against the adamantine cliffs that confine it. Precipices spring from the brink, in places almost perpendicular, to a height of one or two thousand feet. On the lower ranges are grassy slopes of rich pasture with dense forests of pine and cedar, while high over all, the stern and majestic mountains, piled on one another, attain in altitude of rising far beyond the line of eternal snow. But all is not sublimity and grandeur. Every few miles the traveller reaches fairly open nooks of surpassing beauties, which may have been small lakes in some bygone age, while the river was cutting its way through a rocky barrier in front. There the villages are chiefly to be found. These are few in number, and of small size, for the region is sparsely inhabited.\\"Quoted in: Appendix III (pages 83-6) is Extract from the Punjab States Gazetteer, Vol XXII A, Chamba State, 1904 (pps. 261–266) by Dr. Hutchinson Appendix IV (pages 87-8) is Extract taken from Guide to Dalhousie, The Chamba state and the neighbouring Hills compiled by Captain J. B. Hutchinson. Revised by B. A. Rose, C.S., Assistant Commissioner, Dalhousie, 1890, and J. Hutchinson, L.R.C.P. & S.E., Chamba Mission ==Transport== The nearest railhead is at Pathankot in the state of Punjab, the nearest airport is the Gaggal airport, and the nearest town is Killar. To reach Dharwas, one needs to turn north-west from Killar, and cross the Sural Nala (also called Luj Nala). A level walking trek of leads to Dharwas. There are buses and taxis available from Killar. The road connectivity in Pangi Valley is the road link from Chamba to Killar via Saach Pass. This is known as Always-Killar road and it is part of Ahju Khara Mukh - Chamba - Tissa- Always- Killar road. Traveling to Kilar from Chamba, via Tissa Bairagarh and Saturn, is traversable by motor vehicle, but only suitable for a jeep or rugged vehicle. One can also take the route via the famous Leh–Manali Highway up to Tandi. From Tandi, Udaipur is away, with Pangi a further away - although the road's condition is poor, and occasionally closed to traffic. The Killar is the head office of the valley, and from there, government buses run on every route in the valley. (One route via Jammu, Patni Top, Doda & Kishtwar District (J&K;) State) ==Other attractions== * Killar: Killar is the headquarters of Pangi valley. It’s located in the deep and narrow gorge of the Chenab River. Mahlu Nallah is said to be the gateway to this village. Killar is also a base for a trekking expedition to Kishtwar, through Umasi la into the Zanskar Valley, and to Keylong and Manali. Dharwad is located from Killar, and northeast of Chamba. Other villages in Killar are Thamoh, Karhoti, Parmas, Kuffa, Kufa, Mahaliyat, Karel, Kawas, Bhat was, Karyas, Punto, Changili, Parghwal. Killar is known for its dances and natural environment. [citation needed] * Luj: Luj is located at an elevation of above sea level. Luj primarily consists of four villages, Udaini, Bishthow, Banwas, and Mangalwas. Udaini houses the Sheetla Devi temple. Luj is the last village and boundary of the Chamba district and Himachal state. == References == Category:Cities and towns in Chamba district ","title":"Dharwas"},{"id":"19274090","text":" USS Sussex (AK-213) was an that was constructed for the US Navy during the closing period of World War II. She was retained by the Navy for post-war service, including that in the Korean War theatre where she earned three battle stars and then returned home for deactivation. ==Construction== The second ship to be so named by the Navy. Sussex was laid down under US Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 2167, on 3 October 1944, by the Leathem D. Smith Shipbuilding Company, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin; launched on 3 February 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Carl O. Rydhelm; and acquired by the Navy in July 1945. ==Service historyOperation by the Coast Guard=== She was operated by the United States Coast Guard until the spring 1946, and on 23 May 1946, was placed in the reserve fleet. She was reacquired by the Navy on 27 February 1947; and commissioned on 27 May 1947, Lieutenant Commander John L. Hunter, USN, in command. ===Post-World War II service=== Assigned to the Alaskan Sea Frontier, Sussex sailed to Seattle, Washington, in late June, loaded cargo, and made her maiden voyage to Alaskan ports for the United States Navy. After making calls at Adak and Kodiak, she returned to Seattle on 25 August 1947. From that date until December 1950, the ship made 16 voyages from Seattle to various Alaskan ports carrying supplies to bases and installations there. ===Korean War service=== From January to July 1951, Sussex provided logistic support for the mid-Pacific Trust Territories. From August 1951 to January 1952, she operated in the Korean war zone, moving supplies and munitions to United Nations ships and bases. The ship was busy transporting cargo from Japanese ports to such places as Pusan, Suyong, and Inchon. On 5 February 1952, Sussex stood out of Yokosuka en route to Bremerton, Washington, for a general overhaul. She departed Bremerton on 12 May 1952 and proceeded via Pearl Harbor and Midway Island to Japan. The cargo ship arrived at Sasebo, Japan, on 30 June and resumed her runs to Korea; but this time, she also included Okinawa, Taiwan, and the Pescadores Islands among her supply points. Sussex returned to Pearl Harbor on 15 December 1952 and, until March 1954, supplied bases at Midway Island, Kwajalein, Saipan, and Guam. She arrived at Yokosuka on 14 March and operated from that port until 19 October 1954 when she returned to Pearl Harbor to resume supplying mid-Pacific Ocean bases. She continued this duty, operating from Pearl Harbor, until 7 May 1958 when she moved her base of operations to Iwakuni, Japan. ===Decommissioning=== Sussex steamed into Yokosuka on 21 November 1959 and was decommissioned on 5 December 1959. She was struck from the Navy List on 1 January 1960 and sold to the Hugo Neu Steel Products Corp., New York, on 27 July 1960 for scrap. == Awards and honors == Sussex received three battle stars for service during the Korean War: :* UN Summer-Fall Offensive ::*Battle of the Punchbowl :* Second Korean Winter :* Korean Defense Summer-Fall 1952 ::*Operation Showdown Qualified Sussex personnel were eligible for the following: :* American Campaign Medal :* World War II Victory Medal :* National Defense Service Medal :* Korean Service Medal (3) :* United Nations Service Medal :* Republic of Korea War Service Medal == Notes == ;Citations == Bibliography == Online resources * * * ==External links== * Category:Alamosa-class cargo ships Category:Ships built in Wisconsin Category:1945 ships Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Ammunition ships of the United States Navy Category:Korean War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:United States Navy Delaware-related ships Category:United States Navy New Jersey- related ships Category:United States Navy Virginia-related ships ","title":"USS Sussex (AK-213)"},{"id":"19274106","text":"Federal & Foundation Assistance Monitor is a news service (or newsletter) produced in Silver Spring, MD by CD Publications. FAM reports on public and private sources of funding for community programs, including education, youth services and health care. It also covers activities of Congress and federal agencies. ==History== CD Publications began publishing housing-related newsletters in 1961, starting with Housing Affairs Letter. The company branched out into senior affairs with Aging News Alert in 1984, and into grant-seeking with Federal Assistance Monitor in 1986. In January 2001, the company acquired Federal Research Report from Silver Spring-based Business Publishers, Inc., and folded it into Federal Assistance Monitor. In mid-2006, the newsletter's title was changed to Federal & Foundation Assistance Monitor, reportedly to indicate that coverage had been expanded to include private funding. The pub's masthead was clumsily altered with a carrot (^) pointing to the phrase \\"& Foundation\\" being squeezed into the title. This was replaced with a new masthead in late December '06. ===Current Coverage=== FAM posts federal funding announcements, private grants, legislative actions toward community programs, policy news and proposal-writing tips. It also covers fundraising workshops sponsored by the Foundation Center, the Support Center and other agencies. ===Expansion=== In 2007, FAM was changed to a web-based format and, along with CD Publications' other funding news services, was moved onto the web portal GrantsandFunding.net. ==See also== *Children & Youth Funding Report *Community Health Funding Report *Native American Report *Private Grants Alert *Substance Abuse & Disability Services Report ==References== *\\"Federal Research Report.\\" (2001-01-31).

It included the original edition of the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. Its product designation was TSR 2002. ==Contents== The original Dungeons & Dragons boxed set was the first role-playing game, a fantasy system with a medieval European flavor. This set introduced concepts which would become standard, including abilities (such as strength, intelligence, and dexterity); character classes (fighting-man, magic-user, cleric) and levels; races (human, dwarf, elf, halfling); armor class; monsters and treasure; subterranean dungeons of halls, rooms, and doors replete with tricks and traps; and magic items, such as intelligent swords. The set also includes rules for wilderness travel by land and sea, hiring specialists and men-at-arms, building fortifications and setting up baronies. Movement rates and areas are given in inches, like that of the miniatures rules from which the system descended. The set also included brief guidelines on using monsters as player characters. This set features only a handful of the elements for which the game is known today: just three character classes (fighting-man, magic-user, and cleric); four races (human, dwarf, elf, hobbit); and only three alignments (lawful, neutral, and chaotic). The rules assume that players have owned and have played the miniatures wargame Chainmail and that they have used its measurement and combat systems. An optional combat system is included within the rules that later developed into the sole combat system of later versions of the game. In addition, the rules presumed ownership of Outdoor Survival, an Avalon Hill board game for outdoor exploration and adventure. The Men & Magic booklet recommends using miniatures only \\"if the players have them available and so desire\\", although they were not required and cardboard counters were given as an alternative. The Monsters & Treasure booklet contains some of the first depictions of the game's most iconic monsters, many of which were adapted from mythology and various literary works. The set initially referred to some of the creatures in the game as \\"hobbits\\" and \\"ents\\" after J. R. R. Tolkien-universe creatures, although after legal difficulties they were changed to \\"halflings\\" and \\"treants\\", respectively. ==Publication history== The original Dungeons & Dragons set, subtitled Rules for Fantastic Medieval Wargames Campaigns Playable with Paper and Pencil and Miniature Figures, was written by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, and was published by TSR in 1974 as a digest-sized boxed set in a brown wood-grain box. The set included three digest-sized books: the 36-page \\"Volume 1: Men & Magic\\", the 40-page \\"Volume 2: Monsters & Treasure\\", and the 36-page \\"Volume 3: The Underworld & Wilderness Adventures\\". The set also included six reference sheets of tables and charts. With a production budget of only $2000 to produce a thousand copies, the result was decidedly amateurish. Only $100 was budgeted for artwork, and Gygax pressed into service just about anyone who could hold a pencil, including local artist Cookie Corey; Greg Bell, a member of Jeff Perren's gaming group; D&D; co- creator Dave Arneson; Gygax's wife's half-sister Keenan Powell; and fellow TSR co-founder Don Kaye. Each artist was paid $2 for a small piece or $3 for a larger piece, with an identical amount paid as a royalty every time another thousand copies were printed. Several of Greg Bell's illustrations were based on comic book art, often from Strange Tales. The illustration of a sorcerer before a blazing cauldron in the second book is based on a panel from a Dr. Strange story in Strange Tales No. 167. The cover art showing a sword-wielding Viking warrior on a rearing horse was also copied from Strange Tales #167. This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions, including Greyhawk and Blackmoor in 1975, and Eldritch Wizardry, Gods, Demi-Gods & Heroes, and Swords & Spells in 1976. Later printings, beginning in 1976, came in an all-white box, and added the label \\"Original Collector's Edition\\". The initial printing of the \\"Men & Magic\\" booklet had a drawing of a mounted warrior on the cover, while the 1976 printing featured a fighter with a sword. The original Dungeons & Dragons was re-released in 2013, as part of a deluxe, premium collectors set which includes reprints of the original boxed set booklets and the four supplement booklets in a wooden box. Each booklet features new cover art but is otherwise a faithful reproduction of the original, including original interior art. ==Reception== Tim Waddell reviewed the original Dungeons & Dragons in The Space Gamer #2. Waddell commented that \\"The most stimulating part of the game is the fact that anything can happen. Nothing is impossible.\\" Andy Pudewa also reviewed the original Dungeons & Dragons in The Space Gamer #2. Pudewa said that \\"As a game, D&D; is a fantastical outlet for the imagination. It has the quality of being infinitely flexible, and with it comes the reality of impossibility. [...] There are drawbacks to the game however; as there are in any game. D&D; cannot even begin to get interesting in less than 20 hours playing time. Hundreds of hours of work must be done ahead of time by the referee, and it takes a fairly long time to prepare on the part of the players.\\" Gary Gygax won the Strategists Club's \\"Outstanding Designer & Writer\\" for the creation of Dungeons & Dragons. The set is also an H.G. Wells award-winner. On December 9, 2016, a first printing of the boxed set was sold on an eBay auction for over $20,000. ===Awards=== *Origins Awards (All-Time Best Role-Playing Rules, 1977) *Origins Awards (Greatest Contribution to the Hobby 1967–77, 1977) *Origins Awards (Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame, 1977) *Strategists' Club Award (Best New Game, 1974) *Pen & Paper (RPG Hall of Fame, 2002) *Scrye Player's Choice (All-Time Favorite Role-Playing Game, 2006) *Games Magazine (Hall of Fame, 1984). ==References * RPG.net reviews: **Vol.1 **Vol.1 **Vol.2&3 Category:1974 books Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks ","title":"Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1974)"},{"id":"19274169","text":"The Taifa of Molina was a medieval taifa kingdom that existed from around the 1080s to 1100. ==List of EmirsGalbunid dynasty=== *(To Valencia: 1075–?) *'Azzun: ?–1100 ==See also== * List of Sunni Muslim dynasties * Castle of Molina de Aragón Category:1100 disestablishments in Europe Molina Category:States and territories established in the 1080s Category:1080s establishments in Europe ","title":"Taifa of Molina"},{"id":"19274200","text":"Alex O'Brien Feldman is an American born theatrical clown. ==Biography== Feldman performs under the stage name \\"Alex the Jester\\" in the style of a medieval court jester, a tradition which combines music, juggling, prop comedy and stage magic.

Although mammalian vision is not so excellent as bird vision, it is at least dichromatic for most of mammalian species, with certain families (such as Hominidae) possessing a trichromatic color perception. The dimensions of the eyeball vary only 1–2 mm among humans. The vertical axis is 24 mm; the transverse being larger. At birth it is generally 16–17 mm, enlarging to 22.5–23 mm by three years of age. Between then and age 13 the eye attains its mature size. It weighs 7.5 grams and its volume is roughly 6.5 ml. Along a line through the nodal (central) point of the eye is the optic axis, which is slightly five degrees toward the nose from the visual axis (i.e., that going towards the focused point to the fovea. ==Three layers== The structure of the mammalian eye has a laminar organization that can be divided into three main layers or tunics whose names reflect their basic functions: the fibrous tunic, the vascular tunic, and the nervous tunic.\\"The Eye.\\" Accessed October 23, 2006.\\"General Anatomy of the Eye.\\" Accessed October 23, 2006.\\"Eye Anatomy and Function.\\" Accessed October 23, 2006. * The fibrous tunic, also known as the tunica fibrosa oculi, is the outer layer of the eyeball consisting of the cornea and sclera.Cline D; Hofstetter HW; Griffin JR.

It consists of dense connective tissue filled with the protein collagen to both protect the inner components of the eye and maintain its shape.X.

The choroid contains blood vessels that supply the retinal cells with necessary oxygen and remove the waste products of respiration. The choroid gives the inner eye a dark color, which prevents disruptive reflections within the eye. The iris is seen rather than the cornea when looking straight in one's eye due to the latter's transparency, the pupil (central aperture of iris) is black because there is no light reflected out of the interior eye. If an ophthalmoscope is used, one can see the fundus, as well as vessels (which supply additional blood flow to the retina) especially those crossing the optic disk—the point where the optic nerve fibers depart from the eyeball—among others\\"eye, human.\\"Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD 5 Apr. 2008 * The nervous tunic, also known as the tunica nervosa oculi, is the inner sensory layer which includes the retina. ** Contributing to vision, the retina contains the photosensitive rod and cone cells and associated neurons. To maximise vision and light absorption, the retina is a relatively smooth (but curved) layer. It has two points at which it is different; the fovea and optic disc. The fovea is a dip in the retina directly opposite the lens, which is densely packed with cone cells. It is largely responsible for color vision in humans, and enables high acuity, such as is necessary in reading. The optic disc, sometimes referred to as the anatomical blind spot, is a point on the retina where the optic nerve pierces the retina to connect to the nerve cells on its inside. No photosensitive cells exist at this point, it is thus \\"blind\\". Continuous with the retina are the ciliary epithelium and the posterior epithelium of the iris. ** In addition to the rods and cones, a small proportion (about 1-2% in humans) of the ganglion cells in the retina are themselves photosensitive through the pigment melanopsin. They are generally most excitable by blue light, about 470–485 nm. Their information is sent to the SCN (suprachiasmatic nuclei), not to the visual center, through the retinohypothalamic tract which is formed as melanopsin-sensitive axons exit the optic nerve. It is primarily these light signals which regulate circadian rhythms in mammals and several other animals. Many, but not all, totally blind individuals have their circadian rhythms adjusted daily in this way. The ipRGCs have other functions as well, such as signaling the need for changing the diameter of the pupil in changing light conditions. ==Anterior and posterior segments== Diagram of a human eye; note that not all eyes have the same anatomy as a human eye. The mammalian eye can also be divided into two main segments: the anterior segment and the posterior segment.Ocular Anatomy – Anterior Segment The human eye is not a plain sphere but is like two spheres combined, a smaller, more sharply curved one and a larger lesser curved sphere. The former, the anterior segment is the front sixth of the eye that includes the structures in front of the vitreous humour: the cornea, iris, ciliary body, and lens.\\"Departments. Anterior segment.\\" Cantabrian Institute of Ophthalmology. Within the anterior segment are two fluid-filled spaces: * the anterior chamber between the posterior surface of the cornea (i.e. the corneal endothelium) and the iris. * the posterior chamber between the iris and the front face of the vitreous. Aqueous humor fills these spaces within the anterior segment and provides nutrients to the surrounding structures. Some ophthalmologists specialize in the treatment and management of anterior segment disorders and diseases. The posterior segment is the back five-sixths of the eye that includes the anterior hyaloid membrane and all of the optical structures behind it: the vitreous humor, retina, choroid, and optic nerve. The radii of the anterior and posterior sections are 8 mm and 12 mm, respectively. The point of junction is called the limbus. On the other side of the lens is the second humour, the aqueous humour, which is bounded on all sides by the lens, the ciliary body, suspensory ligaments and by the retina. It lets light through without refraction, helps maintain the shape of the eye and suspends the delicate lens. In some animals, the retina contains a reflective layer (the tapetum lucidum) which increases the amount of light each photosensitive cell perceives, allowing the animal to see better under low light conditions. The tapetum lucidum, in animals that have it, can produce eyeshine, for example as seen in cat eyes at night. Red-eye effect, a reflection of red blood vessels, appears in the eyes of humans and other animals that have no tapetum lucidum, hence no eyeshine, and rarely in animals that have a tapetum lucidum. The red-eye effect is a photographic effect, not seen in nature. Some ophthalmologists specialise in this segment.Vitreoretinal Disease & Surgery – New England Eye Center ==Extraocular anatomy== Lying over the sclera and the interior of the eyelids is a transparent membrane called the conjunctiva. It helps lubricate the eye by producing mucus and tears. It also contributes to immune surveillance and helps to prevent the entrance of microbes into the eye. In many animals, including humans, eyelids wipe the eye and prevent dehydration. They spread tears on the eyes, which contains substances which help fight bacterial infection as part of the immune system. Some species have a nictitating membrane for further protection. Some aquatic animals have a second eyelid in each eye which refracts the light and helps them see clearly both above and below water. Most creatures will automatically react to a threat to its eyes (such as an object moving straight at the eye, or a bright light) by covering the eyes, and/or by turning the eyes away from the threat. Blinking the eyes is, of course, also a reflex. In many animals, including humans, eyelashes prevent fine particles from entering the eye. Fine particles can be bacteria, but also simple dust which can cause irritation of the eye, and lead to tears and subsequent blurred vision. In many species, the eyes are inset in the portion of the skull known as the orbits or eyesockets. This placement of the eyes helps to protect them from injury. For some, the focal fields of the two eyes overlap, providing them with binocular vision. Although most animals have some degree of binocular vision the amount of overlap largely depends on behavioural requirements. In humans, the eyebrows redirect flowing substances (such as rainwater or sweat) away from the eye. ==Function of the mammalian eye== The structure of the mammalian eye owes itself completely to the task of focusing light onto the retina. This light causes chemical changes in the photosensitive cells of the retina, the products of which trigger nerve impulses which travel to the brain. In the human eye, light enters the pupil and is focused on the retina by the lens. Light-sensitive nerve cells called rods (for brightness), cones (for color) and non-imaging ipRGC (intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells) react to the light. They interact with each other and send messages to the brain. The rods and cones enable vision. The ipRGCs enable entrainment to the Earth's 24-hour cycle, resizing of the pupil and acute suppression of the pineal hormone melatonin. ===Retina=== The retina contains three forms of photosensitive cells, two of them important to vision, rods and cones, in addition to the subset of ganglion cells involved in adjusting circadian rhythms and pupil size but probably not involved in vision. Though structurally and metabolically similar, the functions of rods and cones are quite different. Rod cells are highly sensitive to light, allowing them to respond in dim light and dark conditions; however, they cannot detect color differences. These are the cells that allow humans and other animals to see by moonlight, or with very little available light (as in a dark room). Cone cells, conversely, need high light intensities to respond and have high visual acuity. Different cone cells respond to different wavelengths of light, which allows an organism to see color. The shift from cone vision to rod vision is why the darker conditions become, the less color objects seem to have. The differences between rods and cones are useful; apart from enabling sight in both dim and light conditions, they have further advantages. The fovea, directly behind the lens, consists of mostly densely packed cone cells. The fovea gives humans a highly detailed central vision, allowing reading, bird watching, or any other task which primarily requires staring at things. Its requirement for high intensity light does cause problems for astronomers, as they cannot see dim stars, or other celestial objects, using central vision because the light from these is not enough to stimulate cone cells. Because cone cells are all that exist directly in the fovea, astronomers have to look at stars through the \\"corner of their eyes\\" (averted vision) where rods also exist, and where the light is sufficient to stimulate cells, allowing an individual to observe faint objects. Rods and cones are both photosensitive, but respond in different ways to different frequencies of light. They contain different pigmented photoreceptor proteins. Rod cells contain the protein rhodopsin and cone cells contain different proteins for each color-range. The process through which these proteins go is quite similar — upon being subjected to electromagnetic radiation of a particular wavelength and intensity, the protein breaks down into two constituent products. Rhodopsin, of rods, breaks down into opsin and retinal; iodopsin of cones breaks down into photopsin and retinal. The breakdown results in the activation of Transducin and this activates cyclic GMP Phosphodiesterase, which lowers the number of open Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels on the cell membrane, which leads to hyperpolarization; this hyperpolarization of the cell leads to decreased release of transmitter molecules at the synapse. Differences between the rhodopsin and the iodopsins is the reason why cones and rods enable organisms to see in dark and light conditions — each of the photoreceptor proteins requires a different light intensity to break down into the constituent products. Further, synaptic convergence means that several rod cells are connected to a single bipolar cell, which then connects to a single ganglion cell by which information is relayed to the visual cortex. This convergence is in direct contrast to the situation with cones, where each cone cell is connected to a single bipolar cell. This divergence results in the high visual acuity, or the high ability to distinguish detail, of cone cells compared to rods. If a ray of light were to reach just one rod cell, the cell's response may not be enough to hyperpolarize the connected bipolar cell. But because several \\"converge\\" onto a bipolar cell, enough transmitter molecules reach the synapses of the bipolar cell to hyperpolarize it. Furthermore, color is distinguishable due to the different iodopsins of cone cells; there are three different kinds, in normal human vision, which is why we need three different primary colors to make a color space. A small percentage of the ganglion cells in the retina contain melanopsin and, thus, are themselves photosensitive. The light information from these cells is not involved in vision and it reaches the brain not directly via the optic nerve but via the retinohypothalamic tract, the RHT. By way of this light information, the body clock's inherent approximate 24-hour cycling is adjusted daily to nature's light/dark cycle. Signals from these photosensitive ganglion cells have at least two other roles in addition. They exercise control over the size of the pupil, and they lead to acute suppression of melatonin secretion by the pineal gland. ===Accommodation=== Light from a single point of a distant object and light from a single point of a near object being brought to a focus on the retina The purpose of the optics of the mammalian eye is to bring a clear image of the visual world onto the retina. Because of limited depth of field of the mammalian eye, an object at one distance from the eye might project a clear image, while an object either closer to or further from the eye will not. To make images clear for objects at different distances from the eye, its optical power needs to be changed. This is accomplished mainly by changing the curvature of the lens. For distant objects, the lens needs to be made flatter; for near objects the lens needs to be made thicker and more rounded. Water in the eye can alter the optical properties of the eye and blur vision. It can also wash away the tear fluid—along with it the protective lipid layer—and can alter corneal physiology, due to osmotic differences between tear fluid and freshwater. Osmotic effects are made apparent when swimming in freshwater pools, because the osmotic gradient draws water from the pool into the corneal tissue (the pool water is hypotonic), causing edema, and subsequently leaving the swimmer with \\"cloudy\\" or \\"misty\\" vision for a short period thereafter. The edema can be reversed by irrigating the eye with hypertonic saline which osmotically draws the excess water out of the eye. ==References== Category:Vision by taxon eye ","title":"Mammalian eye"},{"id":"19274240","text":"The Kessler Foundation was established in 1985 and is one of the largest public charities in the United States supporting people with disabilities.

Egan-South has a residential, agricultural, and commercial character, the latter mainly concentrated along Highway 105. To protect the water quality of Evens Lake and highlight the beauty of it, the city council plans to build an illuminated water fountain in its centre. In addition to being visible from Highway 105, the fountain would increase oxygenation of the lake. In the winter, Evens Lake is home to the largest ice rink built by the MRC, having a circular route of about long. ==History== Settlement in this area by Europeans began in the mid- nineteenth century. By 1863, there was a population of 140 people, most of Irish origin and almost all Catholics. In 1864, the Egan Township was proclaimed, named in memory of John Egan (1811-1857), an Irish immigrant, owner of large logging concessions in the Outaouais, and holder of several political offices. In 1881, the Municipality Township of Egan was formed. In 1920, Egan Township was split up into the municipalities of Egan-Sud, Bois- Franc, and Montcerf (now Montcerf-Lytton). ==Demographics== Population trend: * Population in 2011: 542 * Population in 2006: 508 * Population in 2001: 539 (R) * Population in 1996: 578 * Population in 1991: 520 (R) = Revised count.Statistics Canada - Population and dwelling count amendments to the 2001 Census The language statistics are as follows (as of the 2006 Census): 89% of Egan-Sud speak French as their first language, 4% speak English as their first language, 3% speak both French and English as a first language and 4% have a different first language. ==References== Category:Incorporated places in Outaouais Category:Municipalities in Quebec ","title":"Egan-Sud, Quebec"},{"id":"19274358","text":"The Taifa of Saltés and Huelva () was a medieval ArabKennedy, Hugh (2014).

Woolly Mammoth is led by Artistic Director Maria Manuela Goyanes, a celebrated American theatre producer, and Managing Director Emika Abe. ==History== Second City's \\"Spoiler Alert, Everybody Dies\\" Woolly Mammoth Theatre Lobby A Woolly Mammoth PWYC Line Woolly Mammoth was founded by Howard Shalwitz, Roger Brady, and Linda Reinisch in 1980. \\"While working odd jobs to make money, we held our first auditions outdoors in Glover Park and started improvisatory workshops in the auditorium of the HHS building.\\" It opened its first season in The Church of the Epiphany parish hall near Metro Center. Outgrowing this initial home, the company rented a warehouse in the 14th Street corridor, where it performed for 13 years. When that space ceased to be available, Woolly Mammoth became a nomad company, performing in various venues in the DC area. During this period the company worked with the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation to acquire space for and to outfit a new theatre.Woolly Mammoth website \\"Woolly's goal is to challenge our artists and our audiences in ways that are fun and exciting and theatrically adventurous. People can enjoy Woolly who are Democrats or Republicans, liberals or conservatives, because we're trying to come at audiences from unexpected points of view. We would rather be politically challenging and uncomfortable and prickly and put images in front of people that make them think and surprise them, rather than just congratulating our audience for being the people they are.\\" Opened in 2005, its permanent home is a $9 million, 265-seat courtyard-style theater.

A laicized Catholic priest and a long-time observer of the Catholic Church, the work of Eugene Cullen Kennedy spans many genres. He has published over 50 books that include 2 biographies, 3 novels, a play, as well as books on psychology, on the Roman Catholic Church and the relationship between psychology and religion.Eugene C. Kennedy Papers (KNN), University of Notre Dame Archives (UNDA), Notre Dame, IN 46556 In the early 1970s, inspired by Vatican II, he emerged as a powerful voice for reform and modernization of the Roman Catholic Church. == Early life and education == Eugene Cullen Kennedy was born in Syracuse, New York, on August 28, 1928, to second generation Irish parents, James Donald Kennedy and Gertrude Veronica Cullen. His father was an executive with the King Kullen Grocery Company, the family- owned supermarket chain founded by Kennedy's uncle, Michael J. Cullen, and his mother was a homemaker. During the 1980s, Kennedy became a consultant to King Kullen and a member of the Board of Directors, positions he held until his death. Raised in Long Island, Kennedy graduated from Chaminade High School in Mineola, NY in 1946 after which he entered the Maryknoll Seminary in Maryknoll, NY. From that institution, Kennedy received a B.A. (1950), S.T.B (1953) and M.R.E. (1954). Following his ordination to the priesthood on June 11, 1955, he was instructor in psychology at the Maryknoll Seminary in Clarks Summit, PA before beginning graduate studies in psychology at The Catholic University of America where he obtained an MA (1958) and PhD (1962). == Career == Kennedy was a licensed psychologist in Illinois and professor of psychology and counselor at Maryknoll College, Glen Ellyn, Illinois from 1960 until 1971. He was Professor of Psychology at Loyola University of Chicago from 1969 until his retirement as Professor Emeritus in 1995. Kennedy was a Fellow of the American Psychological Association and served as President of Division 36 (1975-1976) where he led a resurgence of the phenomenologically based research into religion. Kennedy first gained attention among Catholic audiences in 1965 with the publication of his first book, The Genius of the Apostolate, which he co-authored with Paul D'Arcy M.M. In 1967, Kennedy published Fashion Me a People, which won the Catholic Book Award, an award he again won in 1968 for his third book, Comfort My People. During the 1970s, Kennedy published twenty- five books. His diversified interests and talents are evident in the titles of some of the works of that decade: In the Spirit, In the Flesh (1971), The Return to Man (1973), and Believing (1974) represent his ongoing concern with the Church; Living With Loneliness (1974), On Becoming a Counselor (1977), and Sexual Counseling (1977) reveal his interest in psychology; and St. Patrick's Day with Mayor Daley (1976) and Himself (1978), his biography of Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago, that won both the Thomas More Medal for \\"the most distinguished contribution to Catholic Literature in 1978\\" as well as the Carl Sandburg Award (1978) for the best non-fiction by a Chicago author, represent his interest in Chicago. His On Becoming a Counselor is described as \\"an unusually helpful, well-conceived guide\\" for non-professional counselors – those persons such as teachers, lawyers, ministers, nurses, priests and others – who may have to do counseling as part of their professional work. During the 1980s, Kennedy co-authored Defendant with his wife, Sara Charles. He also published 3 novels: Father's Day (1981), that was awarded the Carl Sandburg Award for the best fiction by a Chicago author in 1980-1981; Queen Bee (1984); and Fixes (1989). He also authored the PBS special one man play, I Would Be Called John, based on the life of Pope John XXII featuring Charles Durning in the title role. During the 1990s and into the new century, Kennedy, continued to publish including a biography of Joseph Cardinal Bernardin,This Man Bernardin (1996),and reflections on his relationship with the Cardinal, My Brother Joseph (1997). Kennedy also published Authority (with Sara Charles)(1997), The Unhealed Wound (2001), and his last, Believing (2013), that won a Catholic Book Award First Prize from the Catholic Press Association. At the time of his death, Kennedy was working with co-author Sara Charles on the 4th edition of On Becoming a Counselor slated for publication in June 2017. == Landmark study == His Catholic Priest in the United States: Psychological Investigations (1972), co-authored with Victor J. Heckler, is considered a landmark study that was prescient of the sex abuse crisis that broke into the public's awareness in 2002. In the late 1960s, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) of the United States commissioned an extensive study of the life and ministry of the American Priest. As Kennedy had earlier published The Genius of the Apostolate (1965) that focused on the emotional health of Roman Catholic seminarians, he was named chief investigator of the psychological component. In 1972, he published, with Victor J. Heckler as co-author, The Catholic Priest in the United States: Psychological Investigations. The study concluded that two- thirds of the 271 priests in the study were found to be emotionally undeveloped, had not achieved the kind of growth that psychological theory would expect from men of their chronological age and vocational responsibility, and, as such, had not been able to achieve healthy, trusting and non-sexual relationships. These men lacked the emotional maturity and life experiences that made mandatory celibacy difficult for many of them. As early as 1967, he advocated a change in the culture of the priesthood and proposed making seminaries co-educational. Although a passionate defender of celibacy, he came to believe that it should be a matter of choice, not a rule. The sex abuse scandal in the Catholic Church broke into the public's awareness with the well-known work of the Boston Globe reporters in 2002. Kennedy, who felt a deep love for the church, outlined two pathways for the church leadership to address the issue: 1) to develop a healthy sense of sexuality within the clergy and 2) to replace the current hierarchical structure that was unhealthy, unaccountable, and authoritarian with a healthy, accountable, authority structure. He felt that until the church was able to get sexuality right, it could not get humanity right and if humanity isn't right, it could not get right the sacramental life of the Church which is its window into the mystery of God. == Other work == In addition to publishing a number of books, Kennedy also wrote articles and opinion pieces in numerous publications and newsletters, as well as columns for the Chicago Tribune, Religious News Service and the National Catholic Reporter's \\"Bulletins from the Human Side. He was awarded the Wilber Award in 1987 by the Religious Public Relations Council for his New York Times Magazine article, \\"A Dissenting Voice.\\" Throughout his career, Kennedy was a frequent TV commentator on politics and religion and lectured widely. His final lecture was given on Maryknoll Alumni Day, celebrating the 100th anniversary of Maryknoll, on September 16, 2011. == Personal == Kennedy left the priesthood in 1977 and married Sara Charles M.D. They had homes in Chicago and Michigan. Kennedy died at Lakeland Hospital, St. Joseph, Michigan of heart failure. His funeral Mass was celebrated in Old St. Patrick's Church in Chicago and he is buried in Resurrection Cemetery in St. Joseph, Michigan. ==Works General non-fiction === * The Genius of the Apostolate. with Paul F.

He was replaced as party leader in 2014 by Johann Gärtner. ==Early life and non-political career== Schlierer studied at the Eberhard- Ludwigs-Gymnasium in Stuttgart, before studying medicine in Gießen and obtaining his licence to practice in 1979. He then entered the military as a medical officer, serving with the Airborne forces.Rolf Schlierer's website Following his military service Schlierer took up study in philosophy and jurisprudence at the University of Tübingen between 1981 and 1988. Passing his first legal exams in 1988, he established his legal practice in Stuttgart in 1991. ==Politics== Schlierer first came to prominence as chairman of the university political committee of the Deutsche Burschenschaft between 1975 and 1976 and he remained associated with this organisation until 1985. Schlierer became associated with REP sometime after this, although he left the party in 1988 due to the increasing radicalisation under leader Franz Schönhuber.Cas Mudde, The Ideology of the Extreme Right, Manchester University Press, 2002, p. 34 He then rejoined REP in 1989 and soon became deputy chairman of the party in Baden-Württemberg as well as party leader in Stuttgart. Schlierer succeeded Schönhuber as party chairman on 17 December 1994. As a leader Schlierer has been described as \\"nondescript\\",The Fortunes of Europe's Far Right although he lacks the links to Nazism that Schönhuber, a member of the Nazi Party and Waffen SS, had. This was especially important as Schlierer sought to make REP more moderate in order to attract the support of the middle classes.Mary N. Hampton & Christian Soe, Between Bonn and Berlin, 1999, p. 157 The early stages of his leadership were rocky as internal struggles between his own moderate and the radical wing under Schönhuber threatened to destabilise the party.Mudde, op cit, p. 36 However, in spite of these problems, his vision was endorsed initially by the electorate as REP won 9.1% of the vote and 14 seats in Baden-Württemberg in 1996 to, at least temporarily, put the internal struggles on hold. Following this election Schlierer was re-elected as chairman at the party's conference by 77% of the delegates in attendance.Mudde, op cit, p. 37 Eschewing the possibility of any alliances with more right wing groups such as the German People's Union and the National Democratic Party of Germany, Schlierer took instead as his model Jörg Haider, although he lacked the oratorial talent and charisma of his Austrian counterpart. As part of his admiration for Haider Schlierer even organised a \\"Solidarity with Austria\\" campaign during Haider's time in government and told his supporters to holiday in Haider's home state of Carinthia.Haider's German Echo Although the Baden-Württemberg result had secured his position, Schlierer would soon find himself facing renewed criticism from the extremists within the party as subsequent election results proved disappointing. As a consequence he faced a leadership challenge in 1998 from Christian Käs. Ultimately Käs withdrew his candidacy at the last minute and so Schlierer continued as leader, although the contest further exposed the divisions between the party's two wings. Käs remained as one of the party's vice-chairmen, and continued to be a critical voice against the leadership, whilst Schlierer was forced into a climbdown when he met representatives of the German People's Union, whom he had previously dismissed as a \\"paper party\\" that had little existence beyond leader Gerhard Frey, and agreed that the two parties should call a series of local electoral truces in their main areas of activities. More recently, as part of his drive for moderation in REP, he has also sought to forge links with the Christian Democratic Union over the issue of maintaining rigidity in German nationality law.Germany Searches Soul With Debate On Citizenship After a series of disappointing election results Schlierer stood down as party leader in 2014.

It existed from the fracturing of the long-eminent Muslim Caliphate of Córdoba in 1035 until the Christian conquest in 1085. ==History== Toledo had been the capital of the Visigothic Kingdom shattered by the Islamic conquest of Iberia in the 8th century. Despite the capital of Al Andalus being moved to Córdoba, in succeeding centuries Toledo kept a strategic importance as capital of the \\"Middle March\\", maintaining a relative autonomy under the Umayyad caliphate of Córdoba in spite of repeated rebellion. When the caliphate failed, the ensuing civil wars of the early 11th century allowed Toledo increasing autonomy. Power remained in the hands of local leaders, including Abu Bala Ya'is ibn Mubammad, Ibn Masarra, Abd al-Rahman and Abd al- Malik ibn Matiyo. These Toledans offered the city to the lord of Santaver (Santabariyya), Abd al-Rahman ibn Dil-Nun, who, around 1035, sent his son Ismail al-Zahir to Toledo to take control. The Banu Dil-Nun (from Banu Zenun) were a family of the Berber tribe Hawwara, that had arrived in the peninsula during the Islamic conquest. They settled in the area of Santaver in the 8th to the 10th centuries. Throughout that time Banu Dil-Nun kept on rising up against the Emirate. They regained their autonomy with the decline of the Caliphate during the first decade of the eleventh century: then, possibly, Abd al-Rahman ibn Dil-Nun was made the lord of Santaver, Huete, Uclés and Cuenca obtained by Caliph Sulayman al-Hakam (1009–10 and 1013–16), carrying the title of \\"Nasir al-Dawla\\". Abd al-Rahman entrusted his son Ismail with government of Uclés in 1018. The territory of the taifa of Toledo eventually became the more durable Kingdom of Toledo; at its largest extent the taifa controlled land now apportioned between the Spanish provinces of Toledo, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, the northern part of Albacete, Cáceres, Guadalajara (to the frontier with the taifa of Zaragoza in Medinaceli) and Madrid (to the Sierra de Guadarrama). The disintegration of the taifa of Toledo occurred piecemeal over a number of years. Ismail al-Zahir held the throne until 1043, fighting for his independence against Córdoba. He was succeeded by Al-Mamun, who asked Ferdinand I of León and Castile for assistance against Al-Mustain I of the taifa of Zaragoza; twenty years later Toledo was attacked by Ferdinand himself, and was forced to pay tribute to escape the menace. When in 1061 Abd al-Malik ben Abd al-Aziz al-Mansur, ruler of the taifa of Valencia, was attacked by Ferdinand, he sued for support from Al-Mamun, but the latter took advantage of the situation to annex Valencia (1064) with the approval of the Christian king. The taifa of Toledo and the taifa of Seville both aimed to annex the former capital of Córdoba to their lands; this ended with the city being captured by Seville in 1070. The new King of León, Alfonso VI, pursued a policy of playing the Muslim rulers against each other for his benefit. With the help of al-Mu'tamid of Seville he defeated Abdallah ibn Buluggin of Granada, but at the same time helped Al-Mamun of Toledo in conquering the taifa of Córdoba in 1075. At this point Al-Mamun was the most powerful lord of southern Iberia, his lands including Toledo, Córdoba and Valencia, but he was poisoned the same year, being succeeded by his grandchild Al-Qadir of Toledo. Al-Qadir expelled the exponents of the pro-Castilian party from Toledo causing a revolt in Valencia, which proclaimed its independence. The Cordoban lands were lost in 1077, as well as the southernmost provinces of the kingdom, and Al-Qadir also found himself attacked by Al-Mutawakkil of the taifa of Badajoz. He was therefore forced to ask again for help from Castile, in this way losing the support of many of his subjects. Al-Mutawakkil occupied Toledo in 1080, while Al-Qadir took refuge in Cuenca. He was able to regain the throne the following year, the agreement including the acquisition of Toledo by the Castilian kingdom, while al-Qadir would keep ruling Valencia. Much of the population, tired by the endless series of wars, accepted Alfonso's entrance into Toledo (though with a simulated siege in order to escape a loss of prestige in the Muslim world), but a faction solicited an alliance between Al- Muqtadir of Zaragoza, Al-Mu'tamid of Seville and Al-Mutawakkil of Badajoz against Alfonso. The latter responded by attacking his enemies and, after four years of \\"siege\\", Toledo officially and peacefully fell into Christian hands on 6 May 1085. ==List of Emirs/KingsYa'isid dynasty=== *Muhammad ibn Ya'is - c. 1010–? ===Masarrid dynasty=== *Ibn Masarra ===Banu Qantir dynasty=== *Sa'id ibn Qantir *Abu 'Umar Ahmad ibn Sa'id ===Matiyid dynasty=== *'Abd ar-Rahman - c. 1020–1028 *'Abd al-Malik - c. 1028- 1031 ===Ya'isid dynasty=== *Abu Bakr Ya'is ibn Muhammad - ?–1031 ===Dhunnunid dynasty=== *Isma'il al-Zahir - c. 1032–1043/4 *Yahya I al-Ma'mun - 1043/4–1075 *Yahya II al-Qadir (in Valencia 1086–1092) - 1075–1080, d. 1092 **To Badajoz - 1080–1081 *Yahya II al-Qadir (restored) - 1081–1085, d. 1092 ==See also== * List of Sunni Muslim dynasties * Ibrahim ibn Said al-Sahli ==References== Category:1085 disestablishments Category:States and territories established in 1010 Toledo Category:Toledo, Spain Category:Berber dynasties ","title":"Taifa of Toledo"},{"id":"19274649","text":"David Oliver is an American born magician.

She was sold again in 1926 to the Liverpool & Glasgow Salvage Association, renamed Restorer, and finally broken up in 1937, 54 years after her keel was laid. ==Construction== Launch of MelitaThe last of six 8-gun Mariner-class gunvessels designed by Nathaniel Barnaby, the Royal Navy Director of Naval Construction, her hull was of composite construction; that is, iron keel, frames, stem and stern posts with wooden planking. She was fitted with a 2-cylinder horizontal compound expansion steam engine driving a single screw, which was also built in the Malta Dockyard. She was rigged with three masts, with square rig on the fore- and main-masts, making her a barque-rigged vessel. Her keel was laid at a special slipway built for her on the Senglea side of French Creek, which was still known as the \\"Melita Slip\\" into modern times. Although laid down on 18 July 1883, work progressed slowly; the entire enterprise had been designed to employ the local workforce when the Mediterranean Fleet was absent, and the fleet's frequent presence caused work on the new vessel to be halted all too often. She was launched as Melita, the Latin name for the Malta, on 20 March 1888 by Princess Victoria Melita, the twelve-year-old daughter of the Duke of Edinburgh who was Commander-in-Chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet. The Army and Navy Gazette reported that By the time she was launched, her entire class had been re-classified from gunvessels to sloops ==Naval career== Melita was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 27 October 1892, nearly ten years after she was laid down. During the 1890s she served in the Mediterranean, recommissioning in October 1895, and again in October 1898.Melita Historica New Series. 12(1998)3(323-330) While serving in Melita during this period Lieutenant (later Rear Admiral) Edward Inglefield invented the Inglefield clip for quickly attaching flags to each other - they are still in use in the Royal Navy today. In 1896 she served off the Sudanese coast, as part of the preparations for the reconquest of the Sudan. While under Commander Ian M. Fraser she was as special service vessel at Constantinople when in November 1901 she was ordered to Devonport, where she arrived in late December to be paid off 17 January 1902. Although it was stated by the Secretary to the Admiralty in Parliament that she would be sold,Hansard, Commons Sitting, 13 March 1905 vol 142 cc1199-200 instead she became a boom defence vessel at Southampton in May 1905. She was converted to a salvage vessel in December 1915, and swapped names with the Redbreast-class gunboat , thereby becoming the sixth Ringdove to serve in the Royal Navy. HMS Melita ==Civilian salvage vessel== Ringdove (ex-Melita) was sold to the Falmouth Docks Company on 9 July 1920, passing to Falmouth Docks & Engineering Company Ltd as Ringdove’s Aid the following year. In 1923 she was fitted with a new engine made by Samuel White & Co. of East Cowes, Isle of Wight. This was a 2-cylinder compound steam engine of 1200 IHP, driving a new \\"washless\\" propeller.

It is set to words of the poet Gabriele von Baumberg (1768–1839), an acquaintance of Mozart and Jacquin. In fact, Mozart wrote this piece for Jacquin's use, who had it copied —with Mozart's knowledge— into a songbook of six songs under his own attribution; the four other songs were by Jacquin. Mozart's other contribution for this songbook was his K. 530 \\"Das Traumbild\\", which Mozart posted to Jacquin later that year from Prague where he prepared Don Giovanni. Emil Gottfried Edler von Jacquin was a son of Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin and younger brother of Joseph Franz von Jacquin. Nikolaus and Mozart often gave house concerts together where Nikolaus played the flute. Gottfried also had a younger sister, Franziska (9 October 1769 – 12 August 1850) who received piano lesson from Mozart. In a letter to Gottfried from 15 January 1787 he praises her studiousness and diligence. Mozart dedicated a considerable number of his works to the Jacquin family, notably the Kegelstatt Trio. This was first played at the Jacquins' house in August 1786 with Mozart playing the viola, Anton Stadler the clarinet, and Franziska the piano. Gottfried von Jacquin added different dedications to each of the six songs, and had his booklet published in Vienna by Laurenz Lausch in 1791; he died the following year, 25 years old. His family had it published again as part of his estate in about 1803 by Johann Cappi. Jacquin's dedication for this work (K. 520) was '. Sybille Dahms believes this to be the contralto singer Katharina von Altomonte who sang – alongside Mozart's sister-in-law and former love interest Maria Aloysia Lange, the \\"incomparable\\" (Joseph II) tenor Valentin Adamberger, and the bass Ignaz Saal – in the March 1789 performance of Handel's Messiah in Mozart's orchestration. Katharina von Altomonte was presumably related to the painter Bartolomeo Altomonte (1694–1783) who was famous for his painted ceilings in many Austrian churches. On 27 March 1799 Constanze Mozart wrote to the publishers Breitkopf & Härtel: > In considering the above songs I must state for your and the public's > benefit that the two: \\"Erzeugt von heisser Phantasie\\" [K520] and \\"Wo bist > du, bild etc\\" [K530] did pass here, and thus most likely also in other > places, for the work of the here deceased Emil Gotfried Edlen v. Jacquin, a > close friend of my husband. However, the original score shows that it is > from my husband himself; on one of them [K520] it is even written in his own > hand that it was made in Jacquin's home at the Landstrasse (a suburb here).\\" > Subsequently, K. 520 was first published under Mozart's name in the 1799 > Breitkopf & Härtel Œuvres, where it was titled by the publishers \\"\\" > (\\"Unhappy Love\\"). After Constanze sold the autograph as part of a large collection to the Kapellmeister Johann Anton André, it passed on to his son Johann August André. It came then to the Austrian ambassador in Berlin, Count György Esterházy (1809–1856) and was later purchased by Louisa Emily Charlotte, Lady Revelstoke, wife of Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke; at her death in 1892 it fell to her second daughter, Margaret, wife of Charles Spencer, 6th Earl Spencer. It remained in the Spencer family until it was put up for sale on 16 October 1985 as lot 146 at Christie's, London, when a Janez Mercun in Geneva acquired it. It came up for auction again at Christie's on 3 December 2003 where it was sold for £251,650 (then US$435,355). ==The poem== Though famous in her time as \\"the German Sappho\\" and praised by Goethe, not much of Gabriele von Baumberg's work is notable today, but Franz Schubert set six of her poemsSchubert's six songs to poems by Baumberg are: \\"Lebenstraum\\" (D. 39) (a rather unsuccessful attempt by Schubert); \\"Lob des Tokayers\\" (D. 248); \\"Cora an die Sonne\\" (D. 263); \\"Der Morgenkuss\\" (D. 264); \\"Abendständchen – An Lina\\" (D. 265); \\"An die Sonne\\" (D. 270). All these have been described by Fischer- Dieskau in Schubert's Songs (1977) as \\"mere miniatures of little importance\\". (Harry Peter Clive: Schubert and His World, OUP 1997, p. 9, ) to music. Von Baumberg was born on 25 March 1768 in Linz; she was married to the Hungarian radical liberation poet János Batsányi; she died on 24 July 1839 in Linz. She wrote this poem probably in 1786 when she was 18 years old, presumably in the wake of a personal experience. Mozart found the poem in the ' (Vienna Almanc of the Muses for the Year 1786). Erzeugt von heißer Phantasie, In einer schwärmerischen Stunde Zur Welt gebrachte, geht zu Grunde, Ihr Kinder der Melancholie! Ihr danket Flammen euer Sein, Ich geb' euch nun den Flammen wieder, Und all' die schwärmerischen Lieder, Denn ach! er sang nicht mir allein. Ihr brennet nun, und bald, ihr Lieben, Ist keine Spur von euch mehr hier. Doch ach! der Mann, der euch geschrieben, Brennt lange noch vielleicht in mir. You borne of such hot phantasy, In revelry and so much gushing Brought to the world, o perish You offspring from melancholy! The flames which made you into being, I give you now back to the flames, And all those songs of revelry, Alas! he sang not just for me. You cherish'd letters, there you burn, And soon there is no trace of you. Alas! the man who once has penn'd you, Will possibly burn long in me. ==The music== The song is written in the time signature of common time and in the key signature of C minor; it is 20 bars long. As was usual in that period, Mozart wrote the piece using the soprano clef.The soprano clef fell soon after out of use in favour of the treble clef, in which it is shown here. The song contains almost no melismata,The song's lyrics consist of 84 syllables; 10 are melismatic, 9 of those over 2 notes, 1 over 3. and several passages provide a considerable element of operatic drama. The arpeggiating rolls in the left hand in bars 6 to 9 illustrate both the burning flames and the singer's fury about the unfaithful lover. This is followed by pauses and chromatic figures to express hesitation and despair. The rising thirty-second notes to \\"Ihr brennet nun, und bald, ihr Lieben, ist keine Spur von euch mehr hier\\" (bars 12 to 14) return to the image of licking, rising flames and sparks, before again chromatically falling into doubt about the act just committed and the singer's lingering feelings towards the unfaithful lover. The musical language in bars 12 to 14 often occurs in Mozart's operas to heighten emotional effect; we find a recitativo-like voice rising over the progression minor dominant→major dominant→3rd inversion of the seventh chord→diminished seventh→major dominant in La finta giardiniera (no. 12 \\"\\", bars 295–299), Idomeneo (no. 6 \\"\\", bars 52–58), Figaro (no. 18 \\"\\", bars 40–44), and in the Entführung (no. 4 \\"\\", bars 34–39); in all these, as well as here, the effect is enforced with sforzando or crescendo dynamics. { align=\\"right\\" Mozart's first attempt for bar 5 The second attempt, slightly changed syllable distribution - colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\"Final version } Mozart took three attempts at one particular phrase: \\"\\". See his first attempt on the right. He then crossed out the words and re-arranged them slightly for his second version.

Finally, he crossed out the whole section and wrote a new version (see right) in some free space at the bottom of the sheet. This now gets the stresses right, and by abandoning the earlier syncopation, it also renders more mournfully. A further change was the ending, which was originally a simple tonic chord on the last syllable of the vocal line; Mozart crossed out the closing double bar-line emphatically with eight marks and added the little piano postlude which rounds the piece off by echoing the opening figure.

He reached the rank of enseigne de vaisseau 2nd class in August 1876, and joined the battleship Richelieu. He reached the rank of enseigne de vaisseau first class the following year and was promoted in October 1879 to Lieutenant de vaisseau. He served as Maneuvering Officer on Orne from 1881, and he participated in the campaign of Tunisia. Three years later, when in command of the ship's machine guns at Tonkin, he distinguished himself during operations in the River Claire (Sông Lô River, also called the Lo River). Injured in February 1885, he was promoted to Lieutenant de vaisseau in March of that same year. He then headed the Secrétariat Général majority in Toulon in 1886, and later attended the School of Submarine Defence on the Algésiras. Commissioned as a destroyer commander, he was finally ordered in 1890 to Destroyer Squadron 127 in the Mediterranean and, in 1891, took command of torpedo boat Éclair. In 1897, he took part in the operations of the International Squadron sent to Crete during the Christian uprising against rule by the Ottoman Empire there in 1897–1898. He was promoted to Frigate captain in 1898, served as aide to the Ministry, and eventually rose to personal secretary of the Minister of War. He became chief of the first section of the General Staff in Toulon, and he was conspicuous in 1899 during the explosion of the powder magazine at La Goubran near Toulon. Senès became a Captain in 1905 and took command of the battleship Charles Martel, in the Mediterranean Squadron. He was promoted to Rear-Admiral in 1911, and took command of the 2nd Division of the 1st Light Wing, on the armoured cruiser Léon Gambetta. At the beginning of the First World War, he took part in cruiser operations in the Mediterranean and Adriatic. On 27 April 1915, the Léon Gambetta was torpedoed by the Austrian-Hungarian submarine off Cape Santa Maria di Leuca.

De Grandmaison argued for rapid maneuver by large formations employing a high tempo attack and the school of thought he subscribed to dominated French army thinking by 1914, but in a degenerated form that melded into the contemporaneous philosophy of Élan vital. and proved no match for modern weapons. He was a member of Nichan Iftikhar (Order of Glory), a Tunisian honorary order. ==Career and political background== Commissioned in 1883, de Grandmaison served in light, mountain, and Foreign Legion infantry units before--benefiting from meritocratic promotion--he he was admitted on a course to qualify as a staff officer. He was a favourite pupil of Ferdinand Foch, who characterised war as a battle of the will. Assigned to the General Staff in 1906, he began building on Foch's ideas with intensified emphasis on operational mobility and seizing the initiative.Historical Perspectives of the Operational Art. Michael D. Krause, R. Cody Phillips, Center of Military History U S Army (2005) The French army rifle was the Lebel Model 1886 rifle with a 20 ½ inch bayonet. German heavy guns had been unveiled in 1900, but under the influence of Hippolyte Langlois France had concentrated on mobile shrapnel firing Canon de 75 modèle 1897 with a flat trajectory that left crews exposed instead of the high explosive lobbing howitzers. In 1911 French army chief Victor-Constant Michels proposed returning to the established pattern of French army plans for defensive strategy in a war with Germany. He proposed deploying a million-strong French army on a line Verdun-Namur-Antwerp to counter the anticipated German offensive. In order to field an army of this size French reserve units would need to be integrated with the active army immediately on mobilisation.. Michels had presciently identified where the German attack was to come three later, but he ran afoul of the regular army contempt for reserve officers, and politicians who wanted to recover France's lost provinces.Historical Perspectives of the Operational Art. Michael D. Krause, R.

Another defence of de Grandmaison is his General Staff lectures were taken as applying to the company level which they could hardly have been to such senior officers, he was not of sufficient rank to implement those views, and him being dead made him a ideal scapegoat.Marshal Joffre: The Triumphs, Failures and Controversies, André Bourachot (2014) In Jan 1915 de Grandmaison's post 1911 meteoric ascent continued when he received promotion to Major General, being given command of Fifth Army Reserve group.

Armenian architecture and miniature painting have dominated Armenian art and have shown consistent development over the centuries. Other forms of Armenian art include sculpture, fresco, mosaic, ceramic, metalwork, engraving, and textiles, especially Armenian carpets. Prehistoric Armenia was home to the Urartu culture in the Iron Age, notable for its early metal sculptures, often of animals. The region was, as later, often contested by the large empires holding the nearby regions of Persia, Mesopotamia and Anatolia, and these all had considerable influence of Armenian art. The Armenians adopted Christianity very early, and developed their own version of Eastern Christian art, with much use of icons, Armenian miniatures in books, and the very original architecture of their churches and monasteries. A distinctive Armenian feature, which may have influenced the Medieval art of Europe, was the popularity from early on of figurative relief carvings on the outside of churches, unknown in Byzantium. Armenians specialized in arts and crafts such as carpet-weaving. == Study of Armenian art history == The study of Armenian art began in the early 20th century. Notable scholars of Armenian art were Catholicos Garegin Hovsepian and professor Sirarpie Der Nerséssian. More recently, Jean-Michel Thierry and Professor Dickran Kouymjian are prominent scholars of Armenian art. == Architecture == The first Armenian churches were built during the lifetime of St. Gregory the Illuminator, were often built on the sites of destroyed pagan temples, and imitated some aspects of Armenian pre-Christian architecture.Sacred Geometry and Armenian Architecture  Armenia Travel, History, Archeology & Ecology  TourArmenia  Travel Guide to Armenia Classical and Medieval Armenian architecture is divided into four separate periods. The first period, from the 4th to the 7th centuries, began with Armenia's conversion to Christianity, and ended after the Arab invasions of Armenia. The early churches were mostly simple basilicas, some with side apses. By the 5th century the typical cupola cone in the center had become widely used. By the 7th century, centrally-planned churches had been built and the more complicated niched buttress and radiating Hrip'simé style had formed. By the time of the Arab invasions, most of what we now know as classical Armenian architecture had formed. The second period lasted from the 9th to the 11th centuries. Armenian architecture underwent a revival under the patronage of the Bagratid dynasty with many buildings erected in the regions of Ani and Lake Van: these included both traditional styles and new innovations. Ornately carved Armenian khachkars were developed during this time.Armenia, Past and Present; Elisabeth Bauer, Jacob Schmidheiny, Frederick Leist , 1981 Many new cities and churches were built during this time, including a new capital at Lake Van and a Cathedral on Akdamar Island to match. The Cathedral of Ani was also completed during this dynasty. It was during this time that the first major monasteries, such as Haghpat and Haritchavank were founded. This period was ended by the Seljuk invasion. == Miniatures == The Last Supper, from the illuminated manuscript, end of the 14th century, Artsakh Illuminated manuscripts were produced in Armenia mainly between the 5th and the 17th centuries. The highest point of this art is associated with the 13th century and the name of Toros Roslin, considered to be the most prominent medieval Armenian manuscript illuminator. The majority of the manuscripts were lost, and scholarly approach to studies of Armenian illuminated manuscripts was only developed in the second half of the 20th century. == Sculptures == Late- medieval Armenian 150px Each culture possesses a certain original element which becomes a symbol of the entire national culture. In Armenia such symbol is “khachkar, the so-called cross-stones, the monuments of Armenia which are not found anywhere in the world. The word “khachkar” is formed by two Armenian roots: “khach” (cross) and \\"kar\\" (stone). Armenia has been called “a country of rocks” and has a rich heritage when it comes to sculptures. Some of the sculptures in the country date way back even before the formation of Armenia as a nation. Such sculptures were created by empires that existed in the region before the modern period. A good example of these is the “Khachkar” which were ancient religious sculptures. Besides these ancient sculptures, Armenia also has plenty of post-war sculptures which show the influence of modern times and also foreign traditions that have been adopted. == Frescoes, Mosaics, and Ceramics == An Armenian fresco of Christ at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Ceramics, mosaics, and frescoes constitute a different category of Armenian artwork. The creation of the outlined artifacts dates back to the days of the Urartian Empire that existed long before the establishment of Armenia as a nation. Therefore some of the ancient art is shared among several countries in the region that were part of the Urartian Empire. While the evidence of these forms of art was realized through excavations in the country, their remains have been reconstructed thus providing physical evidence of what they looked like. == Metalwork and Engravings == Biblical scenes carved into the external wall of the 10th- century Cathedral of the Holy Cross on Akhtamar Island on Lake Van Armenia has a history of making engravings and metalwork which are also considered as part of the art. Artifacts in this category can be subdivided into coins, silver and gold, and bronze and tinned copper. The coins refer to the pieces of metals that were designed during the ancient times for trading purposes between Armenia and its neighbors such as Greece. On the other hand, gold and silver were luxury items during ancient Armenia which were fashioned in various ways such as drinking vessels, medallions, and statues just to mention a few. Besides, tinned copper and bronze were also used. Excavations in the country have revealed that these were used to make household items, weapons, and even statues. == Textiles == Textiles are another part of Armenian art and also a significant part of their economy both in the ancient and present times. One of the most extensive collections of Armenian textiles can be found in the Armenian Museum of America. In the current world, textile products from Armenia are a major trade commodity between Armenia, Europe, and America. === Armenian carpets = Music and dance == Dance and Music are also an essential aspect of the Armenian Heritage. Initially, Armenian music consisted of Armenian Church music and folk songs that were based on an indigenous tonal system (Tetrachords) as opposed to the European tonal system. However, in the present time, other genres of music have influenced Armenian music thus resulting in the production of modern styles in the country such as Hip Hop, Pop, Rock, among many others. Accompanying original Armenian songs was Armenian dance. Native Armenian dance is one of the oldest practices of the inhabitants of the region. Armenian dance is even depicted in some of the ancient paintings on rocks. ==Modernist Art== Famous Armenian modernist artists include painters like Arshile Gorky and Paul Guiragossian. == Contemporary Art == In 2015, Armenia won the Leone d'Oro for Best Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. Besides the above-discussed art categories, Armenia also has well developed contemporary art which is overseen by the Biennale Foundation. The Foundation is responsible for organizing exhibitions in the country which are termed as Art Biennale. The name is used so as to distinguish its exhibitions from other shows conducted by different organizations. The institution has been doing its activities that date back from 1948 to date. ==See also== * Culture of Armenia * List of Armenian artists === Art galleries in Armenia === * Cafesjian Museum of Art * National Gallery of Armenia ==References Bibliography == * == External links == * THE ARTS OF ARMENIA An online Armenian art history book by Dickran Kouymjian, California State University, Fresno.

He has been referred to as \\"perhaps the finest winter mountaineer of his day\\".Kevin Fedarko, The Mountain of Mountains, p.3, Outside Magazine November 2003 ==Career== Piotrowski began his career in the 1960s in Poland's Tatra Mountains, around the time when he was a student at the Szczecin University of Technology. He would go on to become one of the leading Polish mountaineers, known worldwide as a winter climbing specialist. He was one of the earliest mountaineers to specialize in winter climbing. His best known climbs, usually first along the given path, and most of them in winter, include: Trollryggen, Norway in winter 1972, Noshaq, Afghanistan in winter 1973, Trollryggen, Norway in winter 1974, Trollryggen, Norway in winter 1977, Tirich Mir, Pakistan in 1978, Rakaposhi, Pakistan in 1979, Distaghil Sar, Pakistan in 1980, Api, Nepal in winter 1983 and K2 in China/Pakistan in summer 1986. In 1974, his climbing companion, Stanisław Latałło, died on Lhotse; whether Piotrowski could have helped him caused some controversy among Polish mountaineers. Ryszard Szafirski, Andrzej Skupiński, Andrzej Zawada Był Wspaniały i Dumny, Zwoje 5 (25) / 2000 In 1983, Piotrowski directed the winter ascent on Api (7132 meters above sea level), and reached its peak on Christmas Eve. He was accompanied by Andrzej Bieluń, who climbed at the head, and was lost, assumed dead near the top of the mountain. Piotrowski died on 10 July 1986. Two days previously he and Jerzy Kukuczka had finished the first ascent of the South Face of K2 (also called the \\"Polish Line\\") - a very difficult and dangerous route which was threatened by seracs and had been called \\"suicidal\\" by Reinhold Messner.R.

Built in 1922, its original function was to provide changing facilities for swimming in Lake Ontario, however lake conditions were often too cold and an adjoining public swimming pool was built in 1925. The Pavilion was renovated in 1980 to provide updated changing facilities and a café along the beach and a garden. ==History== 1922 1940s By the 1920s, swimming at the foot of Roncesvalles Avenue had been popular for over thirty years, as there was a swimming area near a pumping station. This changed in 1913 when the pumping station was demolished to make way for the bridge connecting Lakeshore Road and the King/Queen/Roncesvalles intersection. A staircase was built for pedestrians to walk down to the shoreline. A slide was installed for bathers to slide down into the water. By 1920, this area was filled in and the beach was moved farther to the south. For the year 1921, the beach was recorded as having over 302,525 visitors. On June 28, 1922, Toronto Mayor Charles A. Maguire opened the Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion to help bathers change for the swim in the lake. The building, constructed of concrete, cost $300,000. Each wing held an outdoor changing area, lockers and showers, the women's side on the east, and men's side on the west. It offered over 7,700 lockers for patrons, a roof garden for 400. Admission fees were 25¢ for adults and 15¢ for children, and bathing suits and towels could be rented.Filey, pg. 53. In the center was a staircase leading to an upper terrace which overlooked the change areas leading to a rear terrace which ran the full length of the building and overlooked the beach. The building was designed by Alfred Chapman who had designed the Princes' Gates and the Ontario Government Building at Exhibition Place for the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE). The bathing pavilion design was based on the bathing pavilion at Lynn Beach in Massachusetts.Filey, pg. 48. The Pavilion was the site of the first 'Miss Toronto' beauty pageant in 1926. ===The 'Tank'=== On July 29, 1925, due to coldness of the lake during the preceding two summers, the Sunnyside Pool, nicknamed the 'Tank', was opened beside the Bathing Pavilion to the east. It measured by and could accommodate 2,000 swimmers. At the time of construction, the pool was considered the largest outdoor swimming pool in the world.Filey, pg. 78. Admission fees were 35¢ for adults, 10¢ for children. The 'Tank' was especially popular with children as special streetcar runs were made to take children to the Pool directly from around the City. When built, the pool had a diving tower and bleachers on the east end. The tower was replaced with a simple diving board before 1980, and the diving board itself was eventually removed. The bleachers have been replaced by an equipment building. ==Renovated facility== The Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion was renovated in 1980. The outdoor lockers and changing areas were demolished and new changing rooms were built. The pool was rededicated as the 'Gus Ryder Pool', named after Marilyn Bell's coach, the founder and coach of the Lakeshore Swim Club of New Toronto. ===East wing=== The east wing of the pavilion, which formerly held the outdoor women's changing area became a new enclosed changing facility with new men's and women's changing areas. The former entrance from the archway area was closed and a new entrance was cut in the north wall to enter the changing area. ===West wing=== West wing tea garden The west wing, which formerly held the men's changing area, now houses a cafe with patio on the boardwalk and a tea garden. An opening was made in the western wall opening onto the adjacent parklands. ===Central section and upstairs=== The central section and upstairs terrace is used as a public space for functions, such as wedding receptions, catered by the cafe below. ===Pool=== The pool was closed for renovations for most of the summer of 2010. Intended to reopen in July, the pool reopened for a short period at the end of August, using a temporary water heater. A June storm destroyed some pool equipment, including custom pool heaters for the pool. ===Boardwalk frontage=== The south side of the facility is home to the cafe, and fronts onto the boardwalk and the beach. The cafe is open from spring to fall. ==Activities== Sunnyside Pool is open for swimming during the summer, starting in June and ending in September. In 2012, the pool is open from 10 AM until 8 PM, with a break from 3:45 PM until 5 PM. During heat alerts, the pool stays open until 11:45 PM. The pool has regular swimming instruction leading to \\"Bronze Medallion\\" certification. Swimming at the pool is free, however there is a charge for instruction programs. To the east of the pool is an outdoor wading pool and a children's playground. South of the pavilion, the beach is available for beach volleyball. The lake is fit for swimming most of the summer, except for days after rainstorms when bacteria counts are high. On Canada Day, the pavilion and park is often the site of picnics or music festivals. In 2011, a small music festival, the \\"Canada Day Picnic\\" played live and recorded \\"house\\" music from 1 PM until 11 PM on July 1. In other years, the music has been country and other forms. In September, the upper terrace is used for the annual Sunnyside Beach Juried Art Show & Sale. The show takes place over a weekend and includes live music. Admission is free. ==See also== * Sunnyside Amusement Park * Sunnyside, Toronto ==References== * Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in Canada Category:Chapman and Oxley buildings Category:Municipal buildings in Toronto Category:1922 establishments in Ontario ","title":"Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion"},{"id":"19275003","text":"Storm Cone is a cinder cone in northern British Columbia, Canada.

Welch Stadium serves as home to the Hornets football team. The stadium, who is named for long-time Emporia State coach and athletic director Fran Welch, opened in 1947 and since then has gone under a few renovations. Improvements done in 1994 include installation of a new scoreboard and fence as well as remodelling of entrance areas, concessions, and washrooms. In 1997, the Hutchinson Family Pavilion was added. It hosts multiple levels of enclosed sky-boxes, theatre-style seating, and a media area. The current seating capacity of the stadium is 10,000. Zola Witten Track is also in the facility, used by the track teams. Since 1940, home basketball games have been played at William L. White Auditorium, a 5,000-seat arena which is named after William Lindsay White, son of William Allen White. In addition to serving as home to the men's and women's basketball teams, the auditorium has been used by the Hornets volleyball team since the program started in 1973. In 2008, a new scoreboard and video screen were installed, and the arena floor was refinished and a refreshed logo added. Interior painting in a new color scheme was completed throughout the building. Trusler Sports Complex is home to the baseball and softball teams. The baseball team competes on Glennen Field, named after Dr. Robert E. Glennen, thirteenth president of Emporia State University. In 2009, artificial turf was installed in the formerly dirt infield. The Lady Hornets compete on Turnbull Field, which is named in honor of J. Michael Turnbull, president and trustee of the Trusler Foundation. The Hornet tennis teams compete on the George Milton Tennis Courts. George Milton was the longtime tennis coach for Emporia State, having served from 1966 to 1999. {  style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\\" - -  Trusler Sports Complex  Baseball, softball  500/450  1992 -  William L.

The apartments were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. They were demolished in November 2005.The Year In Review: 2005 from BuildingsOfDetroit.com ==Significance== The two structures were well- designed examples of turn-of-the-century apartment houses in Detroit. They were designed by the prolific Almon Clother Varney, a notable architect of apartment buildings in early 20th century Detroit. These two buildings were once owned by one of Michigan's first suffragists, Sarah A. Sampson, who lived in the Lancaster with her husband from 1906 to 1919. ==History== The subdivision where these buildings stood was platted in 1878 by Joseph B.H. Bratshaw. in 1882, Bratshaw transferred the property to his daughter Sarah A. Sampson and Susan M. Swales. The land was re-platted in 1888, and in 1903 Swales transferred her interest in the property to Sampson. Sarah A. Sampson was prominent suffragist, and active in politics in Detroit. She was married to George L. Sampson, a merchant and businessman who owned a wholesale grocery house founded by Bratshaw. In 1901, Sampson hired Almon Clother Varney to design an apartment building; Varney took out a building permit for the lot where the Waumbek eventually stood. It is likely that both the Lancaster and Waumbek were constructed according to Varney's plans, but probably a few years later in 1904. The apartments were named for Lancaster, New Hampshire, where George L. Sampson was born, and the Indian name for the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Early residents of the Lancaster and Waumbek Apartments included families with some social status, including the Sampsons themselves, who lived in the Lancaster from 1906 until 1919. In 1919, Mrs. Sampson sold the Lancaster and Waumbek Apartments to Robert B. Weaver. The Weaver family owned the apartments until 1961. The two buildings were abandoned as of the mid-1990s, and were demolished in November 2005. ==Description== The Lancaster and Waumbek Apartments were two small three-story red brick Tudor Revival apartment buildings of similar design located side-by-side on East Palmer.Lancaster and Waumbek Apartments from the state of Michigan Each building was constructed of brick trimmed with stone, and designed in a Tudor Revival style, although with slightly different detailing on the exterior. The façades featured projecting bays with a small light well in the middle. Both buildings measured approximately thirty-six feet wide by seventy feet deep. The buildings were symmetrical, with a three-story monumental portico in the center of each, supported by brick piers rising two stories, and smaller brick piers on the third story level. The arched entrance was at the first floor of the portico, reached by a short flight of stairs. Detailing around the entrance archways differed between the two buildings, with the Lancaster entrance surrounded by cut-stone quoins, while the Waumbek had a label molding beneath the nameplate. Flanking the central entrance were three story, three- sided bays trimmed with limestone, containing three double-hung sash windows per floor. At the top, the bays culminated in a parapet wall, with the two buildings having slightly different detailing on the parapet. On the interior, each of the two buildings were similar, with oak stair halls lined with wood paneled wainscoting. Each floor was divided into two apartments of similar layout, one on each side of the hall. The apartments had similar layouts: a front parlor with a bay window and a fireplace at the front of each unit, a long hall with two bedrooms off to the side, and the dining and kitchen in the rear. == See also == * William C.

Her first marriage was to Reginald de Mohun (1185–1213)Pole, p.272 feudal baron of Dunster, of Dunster Castle in Somerset, and her second to William Paynel (died 1228), feudal baron of Bampton, Devon. * Margaret (or Margery), married three times: firstly to William de la Ferté (died 1216), secondly to Eudo de Dammartin (died 1225), and thirdly to Geoffrey de Saye (died 1230) feudal baron of West Greenwich, Kent. Her moiety of the inheritance from her brother was subsequently annexed to the Duchy of Lancaster. ==Landholdings== Brewer was adept at acquiring lands, and obtained a substantial feudal barony from relatively humble beginnings. By 1219 he was assessed for scutage on over sixty knight's fees scattered over several shires.Turner, Men Raised From the Dust, p. 80 According to Risdon, the lands of William Brewer in Devon formed a feudal barony,Risdon, p.361 but this does not appear on the list of baronies given by Pole (died 1635),Pole, pp.1–31 nor is it recognised by Sanders (1960).Sanders Risdon stated that Brewer held close to thirty knight's fees (usually synonymous with manors) in Devon, and that his barony (\\"honour\\") was \\"incorporated to the crown\\" together with the Dukedom of Lancaster, by King Henry IV. His Devonshire landholdings included: *Buckland Brewer *Tor Brewer, later called Tor Mohun,Risdon, p.146 the inheritance of his daughter Alice, wife of Reginald de Mohun (1185–1213), and their descendants. *Holsworthy,Pole, p.359 which descended to his daughter Margaret, wife of William de la Ferté (died 1216), and their descendants.Risdon, p.233 \\"William de Feritate\\" (Latinized form *UgboroughPole, p.315 the inheritance of his daughter Alice, wife of Reginald de Mohun (1185–1213), and their descendants.Risdon, p.178 *BradworthyPole, p.365; Risdon, p.247 He gave part of this manor to his foundation of Torre Abbey. The remainder was the inheritance of his daughter Alice.Risdon, p.247 *Wolborough, which he gave to his foundation of Torre Abbey.Pole, p.269 ==In popular culture== William Brewer was portrayed as one of King John's enforcers in the television series Robin of Sherwood (Episode: The Time Of The Wolf, written by Richard Carpenter, 1985), played by John Harding. He also appeared as a minor character in Richard Kluger's 1992 novel The Sheriff of Nottingham, and he is mentioned in Wilson Harp's 2013 novel The Ghost of Sherwood as the High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests, but the acting sheriff in his name in the story is a fictional brother named Robert Brewer. ==NotesReferences== * Church, S.

It was the 76th annual Grand Final of the Victorian Football League, staged to determine the premiers for the 1972 VFL season. The match, attended by 112,393 spectators, was won by Carlton by a margin of 27 points, marking that club's 11th premiership victory. ==Background== At the conclusion of the regular home-and-away season, Carlton had finished first on the ladder with 18 wins, 3 losses and a draw. Richmond had finished second with 18 wins and 4 losses. In the finals series leading up to the Grand Final, Richmond defeated Collingwood by 44 points in the Qualifying Final before meeting Carlton in the Second Semi Final. This game resulted in a draw, with both teams scoring 8.13 (61). In the Second Semi Final Replay, Richmond won comfortably by 41 points, sending them straight through to the Grand Final. Carlton then beat St Kilda by 16 points to match up with Richmond once again in the premiership decider. Richmond went into the Grand Final as the clear favourites. Even though Carlton finished on top of the ladder, they had lost twice to Richmond during the regular season, and then were thrashed in the Second Semi Final replay. The statistics lent further weight to Richmond's favouritism; Carlton had not beaten the Tigers in a final since 1920.Cartledge, 2011, p. 239 As Richmond coach Tom Hafey recalled: \\"We were expected to kill [Carlton] in the grand final.\\" ==Teams== { width=92%  -   } { valign=\\"top\\" ==Match summary== The 1972 Grand Final was played under dull skies but on a superb MCG surface.Cartledge, 2011, p.240 Carlton made eight positional changes to its team, the most notable was that of captain-coach John Nicholls, who put himself in the forward pocket, and gave first ruck responsibilities to Peter \\"Percy\\" Jones. Less than two minutes into the game, Trevor Keogh opened the scoring for Carlton before goals to Barry Richardson and Neil Balme put Richmond in front. But then Carlton kicked the next four goals – two of them to Nicholls – and would never again relinquish the lead. At quarter time, Carlton led by 18 points, having kicked 8.4 (52), a record first-quarter score for a Grand Final, to 5.4 (34). Some thirteen goals had been scored, and it wouldn't end there. As good as Carlton had played in the first quarter, they were even better in the second. Although Kevin Morris opened the scoring within 30 seconds to cut the margin to 12 points, the Blues responded by kicking four goals in four minutes.Cartledge, 2011, p. 241 By the 23-minute mark of the quarter, the Blues had kicked eight goals to reach 100 points. At the main break, Carlton led by 45 points, 18.6 (114) to 10.9 (69). Richmond had still managed to score five goals for the quarter, but Carlton were unstoppable, kicking a record ten goals for the quarter. The only worry was on the injury front; David McKay had had his jaw broken in two places by Balme, and Vin Waite had been stretchered off with a broken ankle.Cartledge, 2011, p. 243 And when Syd Jackson kicked truly at the 30-minute mark of the third quarter, the Blues had broken the record for the highest score in a Grand Final with still over a quarter to play. At the last change, Carlton held a 54-point lead, 25.9 (159) to 15.15 (105). Exactly 50 goals were kicked in the game, with the teams compiling a combined score of 50.27 (327). This was, at the time, the highest scoring game in VFL history, Grand Final or otherwise, and has been bettered only seven times since. Carlton's score of 28.9 (177) remains the highest in Grand Final history, and Richmond's 22.18 (150) remains the highest losing score in a Grand Final. Richmond's score was the tenth highest score of the season: only in 1924, 1937, 1940, 1954, 1962, 1976 and 2001 have other teams lost matches with scores among the ten highest of a season. Carlton vice-captain Robert Walls was unanimously rated best on ground, kicking six goals and directly assisting in seven others. Ruckman Peter \\"Percy\\" Jones played arguably his finest game for Carlton, while Alex Jesaulenko kicked seven goals and John Nicholls bagged six. Richmond had eleven individual goal-kickers, with Neil Balme kicking five. Carlton's opening term score of 8.4 (52) and second term score of 10.2 (62) set the records for the best first and second quarter scores in Grand Final history (Hawthorn would later equal the first quarter score in the 1989 VFL Grand Final). ==Epilogue== The 1972 premiership victory was John Nicholls' finest moment, cementing his place in football history as one of the great strategists. After being mocked by opponents and berated by critics following Carlton's thrashing in the Second Semi Final, Nicholls knew that the only way to beat Richmond was to outscore them. So he made some positional changes, loading the forward line with his best players, and instructed the team to play a fast, direct game that would not allow Richmond to settle. Nicholls was also aware that in the 25 games that both Richmond and Carlton had played in 1972 leading up to the Grand Final, Richmond had conceded nearly 500 more points than Carlton. The unsuspecting Tigers fielded the same six defenders that had held Carlton to nine goals in the Second Semi Final replay two weeks earlier. Nicholls put himself in the forward pocket against Ray Boyanich and made him pay for loose play by kicking six goals, three of them in the first quarter. Afterwards Nicholls said it was the easiest physical game he had played in.Cartledge, 2011, p. 246 Full-back Dick Clay described the loss as \\"surreal\\", Francis Bourke as \\"almost eerie\\". If this was Nicholls' finest moment, it was also the worst day of Richmond coach Tom Hafey's career. Several days after the match, former footballer and journalist Percy Beames wrote in The Age wrote that losing the Semi Final replay was the best thing that could have happened to Carlton. He reasoned that: > [Carlton] would have gone into the Grand Final under-conditioned, and would > not have learned the lessons that brought the Tigers undone [... In > addition,] Carlton would have been lulled into the belief that its best > chance of winning the premiership rested in retaining its players in the > same positions they occupied throughout the season. Until then, the Blues > had argued that it was because of this that they had finished on top of the > ladder. No one believed this after the Richmond thrashing -- least of all > Nicholls. This was the first of two consecutive Grand Finals to be contested between these teams. In the 1973 VFL Grand Final the fortunes were reversed, with Richmond running out winners by a margin of 30 points. ==Match Scorecard== {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\\" - ! colspan=\\"5\\" vs - !Team !

The house was demolished in 1994. ==Description== The Thomas S. Sprague House was a 2-1/2 story Queen Anne / Shingle style house. The front facade had a variety of projecting and receding elements, and a variety of surface treatments, creating an asymmetric composition with rich texture. A one-story hipped roof porch covered the center entrance, and wrapped around a corner octagonal turret. To the side of the entrance was a triple window surmounted with stained glass. Double hung first floor windows in the turret were also topped by arched stained glass sections. The turret was topped with a gable which made the structure into a bay window. Another bay window was set into the opposite side of the facade. The interior of the house was maintained in nearly original form for almost 100 years. The interior contained combination gas-electric chandeliers, stained glass windows, patterned hearth tiles, and a radiator with a glass door warming oven. A unique asymmetrical butternut fireplace with mantelpiece was in the parlor. ==References== Category:Houses in Detroit Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Detroit Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Houses completed in 1884 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Detroit Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1994 ","title":"Thomas S.

The incident involved a France-bound Eurotunnel Shuttle train carrying heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) and their drivers. The fire lasted for sixteen hours and reached temperatures of up to 1000 °C. Of the 32 people on board the train, 14 suffered minor injuries, including smoke inhalation and were taken to hospital. When the fire was reported, the tunnel was immediately shut to all services except emergency traffic. The undamaged south tunnel was reopened on 13 September with a freight train entering the tunnel at Folkestone at 00:08 BST and a limited service provided with trains travelling in turn in alternating directions in the one tunnel. By the end of September, two thirds of the north tunnel had reopened. Full service resumed in February 2009 after repairs costing €60 million. This fire was the third to close the tunnel since it opened in 1994, the first being the 1996 Channel Tunnel fire and, in August 2006, the tunnel was closed for several hours after fire broke out on a truck loaded onto a HGV Shuttle. == Fire == The fire was reported on 11 September 2008, at approximately 13:57 UTC (14:57 BST / 15:57 CEST) from the French entrance to the tunnel in the North Tunnel. The blaze spread to other trucks on the train during the evening, destroying six carriages and one locomotive. The fire continued to burn overnight and was reported to have been put out by 06:00 UTC the following day, although fire crews continued to smother minor fires nearby for a further two hours. More than 300 firefighters from both sides of the English Channel helped tackle the blaze, with emergency services from East and West Sussex, London and Essex providing support. A simple cross- section view of the Channel Tunnel facing towards the UK 32 people on board the train were led to safety down a separate service tunnel; fourteen people suffered minor injuries, including smoke inhalation, and were taken to hospital. The shuttle was carrying 27 vehicles. A lorry carrying 100 kg of phenol (carbolic acid), a toxic product used in the pharmaceutical industry, was initially thought to be close to the seat of the fire; however, this was discovered to be an error and only 100 g was carried.Technical Investigation Report p85 Eyewitness accounts state that two loud bangs, described as explosions, were heard and then thick smoke swept through the carriage. The train came to a grinding halt, and the lights went out. Further eyewitness accounts suggest that the emergency exit was jammed, and one passenger smashed a window with a hammer in order to climb out. The temperature in the tunnel was described as \\"very hot\\". About of tunnel was damaged by the fire, 50% more than during the fire of November 1996. ==AftermathTunnel closure and reopening=== As the tunnel was closed, Operation Stack phase 3 was initiated to deal with queuing road freight, closing a coast-bound section of the M20 motorway, between junctions 8 and 9 in Kent. Private motorists with Eurotunnel tickets were given vouchers for cross channel ferries. The fire caused the recall of five Eurostar passenger trains en route at the time, affecting 2,000 passengers. At midday on the following day, the ‘bi-national status’ of the operation was lifted making it a French incident. Eurotunnel retook control of the infrastructure and its technicians started to carry out a physical inspection to allow operations in the south tunnel to resume. Eurotunnel initially announced that all services would be suspended until 14 September; however, after inspection found no damage to the south tunnel, empty test shuttles were trialled during the evening of 12 September. A freight train was permitted to enter the tunnel in the early hours of the morning on 13 September, and limited Eurostar services resumed at 06:00 BST later that morning, with 18 services in each direction, including a return journey from London to Disneyland Paris. Some passengers arriving at St Pancras Station reported smelling smoke whilst travelling through the tunnel. A limited passenger shuttle service restarted on 14 September with the 06:18 BST from Folkestone. Services were increased when the section of the north tunnel was reopened from Folkestone to the UK crossover on 22 September, and again on 29 September when the tunnel between the crossovers was brought back into service. While the final sixth of the tunnel was being repaired, trains were limited to by the Intergovernmental Commission. Service levels were reduced so that only 90% of Eurostar services, 60% of Eurotunnel passenger vehicle shuttles and 70% of the HGV shuttles were able to run, costing Eurotunnel an estimated £185 million (€200 million) in lost revenue. ===Tunnel repair=== Repair works were estimated at about €60 million. On 18 October, the investigation authority released the damaged section of tunnel back to Eurotunnel who then assessed the tunnel lining and replaced over one thousand bolts holding the concrete lining. The damaged concrete was then removed with high pressure water jets, damage to the reinforcing steel mesh repaired and a new concrete lining applied by a shotcreting process. This used about 4000 tonnes of new concrete and was completed in early January 2009. During the remainder of January, tunnel equipment was repaired and replaced as necessary, with the installation of overhead line equipment on 28 January. After test running, Eurotunnel reopened on 9 February 2009. ===Eurotunnel response=== When the train stopped in the tunnel due to a fire, the procedure was that the smoke had to be removed by the high powered ventilation before evacuation could be allowed. However, when the train came to a halt, people saw the smoke and some panicked, broke a window and started to evacuate on their own. The evacuation procedure is now shown in nine languages in the lorry driver's club car. Eurotunnel was also concerned because it took 75 minutes before the fire services started to tackle the blaze and that the ventilation was on during this time, fanning the fire and increasing the damage. After tests in April 2010, Eurotunnel built four \\"fire-fighting stations\\" in the tunnel. When a fire is detected on a train, it continues to the next station, passengers and crew are evacuated into the service tunnel and an automatic system puts the fire out with water mist. These were operational in autumn 2011, and tested in January 2012. === Investigation === The investigation was led by the French Land Transport Accident Investigation Bureau (') and supported by the British Rail Accident Investigation Branch.

The film stars Sikandar Kher, Gul Panag, Yuvika Chaudhary, Arjan Bajwa and Alekh Sangal. == Plot == Rahul (Sikandar Kher), Priyanka (Yuvika Chaudhary), Qateel (Arjan Bajwa), Bagani (Alekh Sangal) and Vishaka (Gul Panag) are medical college students with carefree attitudes. Rahul and Priyanka's failed relationship is shown in flashbacks. Rahul argues with an independent candidate and plans to make a political party and contest the college elections. Later he patches up with a bigger political party and gets the independent candidate arrested in fraud case of suicide attempt by his girlfriend. After that Rahul doesn't want to back off from elections. To avert this they plan to go for internship. The group goes to a village in rural Maharashtra that is struck by farmer suicide. There they work as medical interns in the village hospital. The group plans a vacation to Goa until they are awoken to the plight of the poverty-ridden villagers by the village doctor, Mukya (Ashutosh Rana). In addition to their torment, a cruel zamindar (Vikram Gokhale) and his son (Prosshant Narayanan) trouble the villagers with excessive interest rates. As a solution, a reformed criminal (Sachin Khedekar) offers monetary aid to the oppressed in form of microcredit loans. This comes as an able ally to students who vow to help the villagers. However, naxalites and corrupt politicians complicate their efforts. How these socially-awakened students rise above these problems forms the rest of the story. ==Cast== * Sikandar Kher as Rahul * Yuvika Chaudhary as Priyanka/Pepsi * Arjan Bajwa as Qateel * Alekh Sangal as Bagani * Gul Panag as Vishaka/Mother-T * Ashutosh Rana as Dr. Mukya * Madhurjeet Sarghi as Kamla * Vikram Gokhale as Wagh * Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Digambar * Prosshant Narayanan as Wagh's son * Sachin Khedekar as Shankya * Neetu Chandra as Digambar's Wife * Jayant Kripalani as Principal * Rasika Dugal as Rasika * Divya Dutta as Dancer ==Production== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\" \\"We are always talking about India being a superpower, and just 70 km away from any of us, the reality is something else, where 70 per cent of the people are unhappy.\\" --Suhail Tatari, director, while speaking about the choice of the subject. } Suhail Tatari, had previously directed features for Doordarshan's Surabhi, a popular programme in the 1990s. He continued his association with television by directing soap operas such as Reporter, Kanyadaan, Kashmeer and Don. After making an award-winning documentary on breast cancer, Tatari felt the urge to venture into commercial cinema. After meeting producer Atul Pandey, who was contemplating on a story about college students, Tatari convinced him to make it more relevant to the farmer suicides. Actress Gul Panag treated Tatari as her mentor who moulded her into an actress. Hence, she thought it was obvious that she acted in his first film. Coming from a modest beginning, Yuvika Chowdhary was happy that her stint in the television industry helped her to adjust well to films. While shooting a cameo appearance in Farah Khan's Om Shanti Om, Yuvika was offered a role in this film. She was, however, unsure of committing to it because of the number of newcomers. However, Shahrukh Khan admonished her for the reason and cited examples from his own professional career. Chowdhary, after completing the shoot, was happy for her decision to act in this film. Being the son of veteran Bollywood character actors, Anupam Kher and Kirron Kher, Sikander Kher considered himself lucky that directors readily gave him their time if he sought an appointment. Kher, whose debut was first with Woodstock Villa, thought that Yuvika Chaudhary was a glamorous and a fun-loving person and this helped him enjoy working with her. Being cast opposite two newcomer actress, Chowdhary and Neha Oberoi (in Woodstock Villa), Kher thought he cared more for the character than being cast alongside established actots. He was grateful to the director for choosing him to work in the film. Alekh Sangal, the son of veteran filmmaker Ambrish Sangal, thought that despite four other characters sharing screen space with him, he was happy with the way his character was sketched out. He was also quite happy working with Kher and Panag and felt that the movie was a good learning experience for him. The story, which is based on the agrarian crisis of the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, was written by Bijesh Jayarajan. While talking about the extremities in the urban and rural parts of India, Jayarajan said that the focus of his story was on how money-lenders are exploiting the helpless farmers. One of the characters, which Jayarajan created was inspired by Muhammad Yunus, the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner and founder of Grameen Bank, Bangladesh's biggest microcredit institution. About what he termed as success for the film, Jayarajan said: > The mainstream media in the country has made a conscious effort to shield > people, especially youngsters living in metros, from the rural realities. If > those watching Summer 2007 at multiplexes realise this, and wonder why they > never bothered about Vidarbha, the film will have achieved its goal. Due to technical and logistic reasons, the film was shot in Wahi instead of the originally planned setting of Vidarbha. Throughout the shoot of 45 days, the cast was aware of the farmer suicides. Panag became emotional during their discussions during filming breaks. ==Soundtrack== The music was composed by Gourav Dasgupta and released by T-Series. ==See also== * Farmers' suicides in India * Microcredit ==References * Category:2008 films Category:Indian films Category:2000s Hindi-language films Category:2008 drama films Category:Films about farmers' suicides in India Category:Films featuring an item number ","title":"Summer 2007"},{"id":"19275226","text":"(born 17 May 1963) is a Japanese wrestler and Olympic champion in Freestyle wrestling. ==Olympics== Kobayashi competed at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul where he received a gold medal in Freestyle wrestling, the light flyweight class.\\"1988 Summer Olympics - Seoul, South Korea - Wrestling\\" databaseOlympics.com (Retrieved on 11 September 2008) ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Olympic wrestlers of Japan Category:Wrestlers at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Japanese male sport wrestlers Category:Olympic gold medalists for Japan Category:Olympic medalists in wrestling Category:Asian Games medalists in wrestling Category:Wrestlers at the 1982 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Asian Games gold medalists for Japan Category:Medalists at the 1982 Asian Games ","title":"Takashi Kobayashi (wrestler)"},{"id":"19275238","text":"Seven Utes Mountain, elevation , is a summit in the Never Summer Mountains of northern Colorado.

His parents were first cousins, thus making Geoffrey a great-grandson of William IV twice over. His grandfather on his paternal side was Lord George Augustus FitzClarence and his grandmother on his maternal side was Lady Augusta FitzClarence, who were brother and sister. Geoffrey was the third son of nine children. His elder brothers, Edward and Lionel, both died before reaching their majority. Edward died at the age of 14, Lionel as a young child. ==Military career== Lord Tewkesbury was commissioned into the British Army as a subaltern of the 2nd Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps (then the 60th Rifles). He served in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in 1879-1880 at the age of 19, was present at the engagement at Ahmed Kheyl, and Uraco, near Ghaznee, and accompanied Lord Roberts in the march to Kandahar, and was present at the battle of that name. He also saw some service with the third battalion of his regiment in the First Boer War in 1881. He became captain in 1888 and resigned his commission in the Regular Forces in 1895. After his retirement he joined the 3rd (Militia) battalion of the Royal Scots as a captain on 25 March 1896, and after some years´ service in command of a company was promoted to the honorary rank of major. The battalion was embodied in December 1899 to serve in the Second Boer War, and in early March 1900 left Queenstown on the SS Oriental for South Africa. Lord Tewkesbury was mentioned in dispatches and received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his service. ==Peerage== It was during his last military engagement in South Africa that Lord Tewkesbury received notice of his father's death and his own succession to the Munster earldom and other titles. He never returned to the United Kingdom, dying in South Africa at the age of 42 from an accident at Lace Mines, just nine months after becoming 3rd Earl of Munster. The 3rd Earl was unmarried and had no children. The earldom and other titles therefore passed to his next brother Aubrey. ==Titles== * Hon Geoffrey FitzClarence (1859-1870) * Lord Tewkesbury (1870-1901) * The Rt Hon the 3rd Earl of Munster (1901-1902) ==References== * Category:1859 births Category:1902 deaths Geoffrey FitzClarence, 3rd Earl of Munster Category:Schuyler family Category:Van Cortlandt family Category:English people of Dutch descent Category:Companions of the Distinguished Service Order Category:Royal Scots officers Category:King's Royal Rifle Corps officers Category:British Army personnel of the Second Boer War Category:British military personnel of the First Boer War Category:British military personnel of the Second Anglo-Afghan War 3 ","title":"Geoffrey FitzClarence, 3rd Earl of Munster"},{"id":"19275300","text":"Sam Sexton (born 18 July 1984) is a British professional boxer.

On 6 November at the same venue, he stopped Rogan in a rematch to retain his title. Rogan's corner threw in the towel before the start of the 7th round, handing Sexton the win.

I can’t believe that it will be nearly seven years since the British Heavyweight title was last seen on free-to-air in the UK on Channel 5.\\" Fury started the fight moving around the ring throwing jabs and right hands. The movement looked to frustrate Sexton in round 3. Fury knocked Sexton down twice in the fight in dropping him in rounds 4 and 5.

This village is situated on the bank of 'Kari Koshi' a tributary of River Koshi. The village came into limelight when the government of India constructed a huge aerodrome for strategic purposes known as Chunapur Aerodrome. The village is best known for the Roys who were one of the biggest Zamindars of Bihar. Late Deonath Roy was a renowned freedom fighter who along with Jay Prakash Narayan, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia and Narsingh Narayan Singh waged a war against British rule. Late Deonath Roy later became Member of Legislative Assembly of Bihar. The village is very rich insofar as education is concerned. There are more than 15 doctors, 20 - 25 engineers, many administrative officers, lawyers. Prominent amongst the successful professionals are: Late Dr. Mohan Roy, a renowned cardiovascular surgeon and a philanthropist in USA; Dr. V. C. Roy, an orthopedic surgeon of national repute; Rajeev Roy, a prominent advocate practicing in Patna High Court (Bihar) and Supreme Court of India Ms. Shuchi Roy (Delhi School of Social Work & JNU), besides many teachers, professors, politicians. It also has an airbase for Indian Air Force. == Establishment of Middle School == For the development of their village, Late Shri shardanand roy, Dr. Mohan Roy along with Mr. Kumar Roy took the initiative to establish reputed education system in Chunapur. This effort was initially made by their grandfather Shri. Bankhandi Roy, who constructed a Sanskrit school in the year 1935. The school could not operate after the death of Shri. Bankhandi Roy in the year 1942. Dr. Mohan Roy along with Mr. Kumar Roy took steps to set up free education for their village. They started the work to build a school in the name of their parents Smt. Shashimukhi Roy and Shri. Ramnarayan Roy. About 3 acres of land were required for building the school. Mr. Kumar Roy persuaded a number of landowners in the village to donate land. These included Shri. Ramnarayan Roy, Shri. Sunderkand Jha, Shri. Sambhunath Roy and Shri.Tirpit Roy. Mr. Kumar Roy’s business (Four Star Picture Palace) also funded the construction of the school building. In 1988, the construction of \\"Shashimukhi Ramnarayan Aadarsh Madhya Vidyalaya\\" (Middle school) was finished and donated to the government of Bihar.This school creates many bright students of the chunapur who are currently serves all over the country for the betterment of the humanity. == DAV Public School == Further to establish a quality education system in Chunapur, Dr. Mohan Roy and Mr. Kumar Roy reached out to the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic School System to open their branch in Chunapur. Shri Ramnarayan Roy, father of Dr. Roy and Mr. Roy, donated his land for the proposed school. D.A.V system opened their branch in Chunapur in the year 1998. The school was called S. R D.A.V Public School (Shahsimukhi Ramnarayan DAV public school) in honor of the couple Mrs. Shashimukhi Roy and Mr. Ramnarayan Roy. This school served the entire Purnea area. However, Chunapur was not very well connected to the city of Purnea, which was an inconvenience for the school students. For this reason, the school decided to move to the Purnea Municipal Area. Dr. Mohan Roy donated land in Purnea for this move. In the year 1999, S.R.D.A.V Public School moved from Chunapur to Purnea. ==References== Category:Villages in Purnia district ","title":"Chunapur"},{"id":"19275320","text":"Birat is a village development committee in Jumla District in the Karnali Zone of north-western Nepal.

As a young man he and his brothers operated a stage line from Lawrenceville to Petersburg via Boydton. He removed to Bolivar County, Mississippi, in the 1840s. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Congress in 1846, but later served in the lower house of the state legislature from 1850 to 1854, and was a member of the senate from 1856 to 1862. ==American Civil War== Starke became Colonel of the 28th Mississippi Cavalry regiment by commission, dated February 24, 1862. His regiment was attached to the command of Brigadier-General Martin Smith, for the defense of Vicksburg, Mississippi, and in September was nearly 700 strong. Stationed at Panola in November, he gave notice of the advance of Hovey's expedition from Arkansas, and during that fruitless movement by the enemy his regiment was engaged in various skirmishes. From this time during the long-continued efforts for the reduction of Vicksburg the Confederate cavalry was busily engaged in watching the movements of the enemy. At the organization of forces outside Vicksburg by General Joseph Johnston he and his regiment were assigned to the cavalry brigade of Brigadier-General William Jackson, first composed of the regiments of Pinson, Harris, Starke, and Adams', and Steede's battalion. In March 1863, he participated in the victory at Thompson's Station, under Major-General Earl Van Dorn.Wheeler and Hooker, 1899, pp. 270–73 When Jackson became commander of a cavalry division, under Major-General Stephen Lee, Starke was assigned to command of the brigade, which in February 1864, included the regiments of Pinson, Starke and Ballentine, Webb's Louisiana company, and the Columbus light artillery. He was stationed before Vicksburg when Sherman started out on the Meridian Expedition. He resisted the advance of one corps of the enemy on February 4, and on February 24 attacked Sherman's retreating column at Sharon, inflicting considerable loss on the enemy. His conduct in this campaign was warmly commended by General Jackson, and General Lee said: \\"Colonel Starke, commanding brigade, showed skill and gallantry on every occasion, and won my confidence.\\" During the Atlanta Campaign his brigade was commanded by Brigadier-General Frank Armstrong, and he was for a part of the time in command of his regiment. Commissioned brigadier-general November 4, 1864, he took part in the cavalry operations during Hood's Tennessee campaign. On February 1865, he was assigned to command, near Columbus, Mississippi, of one of the three brigades into which Brigadier-General James Chalmers divided the Mississippi cavalry, and the following regiments were ordered to report to him: Wilbourn's Fourth, Wade's Sixth Mississippi and Eighth Confederate, White's Eighth Mississippi, Twenty-eighth, Eighteenth battalion, and part of the Fifth regiment. His command was included in the surrender of Lieutenant- General Richard Taylor's army. ==Later life== From 1866 to 1872, Starke was a member of the board of Mississippi levee commissioners; and was also appointed for one term as sheriff of Bolivar County. Since all of the children of his first marriage had died after the war, he returned to Virginia in 1873 and settled in his native county near Lawrenceville. He died there on July 13, 1888, and is buried on what was formerly the farm of his second wife's family. ==See also== * List of Confederate States Army generals * List of people from Virginia * List of slave owners ==NotesReferences== * * ==Further reading== * Eicher, John H., and David J.

He let people address him as Count, but it is clear that he was not part of a noble family.Alain Mathieu, Dictionnaire de biographie mauricienne, p.2063 De Marigny assumed the French title of Count from his mother's side of the family.King of Fools, by John Parker (author), New York 1988, St. Martin's Press. ===Sir Harry Oakes murder case=== De Marigny married Sir Harry Oakes's daughter, Nancy, the day after her 18th birthday. It was de Marigny's third marriage; both of the first two were also to wealthy women who broke off those relationships soon after marriage. When Sir Harry was murdered on July 7, 1943, de Marigny was the main suspect and was arrested shortly after. At his trial, detectives which the Duke of Windsor, then Governor of the Bahamas, had brought in from Miami claimed to have found de Marigny's fingerprint near the bed of Sir Harry Oakes. The defense argued that the fingerprint had been lifted and placed in the bedroom. Nancy Oakes supported her husband throughout the trial and testified on his behalf. There is a theory that Sir Harry was murdered because he was going to reveal the existence of a scheme involving the Duke of Windsor and Nazi German money being laundered through Mexico. Implicated in this treasonous venture, as well in as the murder, are Harold Christie and his brother Frank. It is typical of the good burghers of Nassau, the very same people whom de Marigny despised, that any scandal involving \\"one of their own\\" is swept under the carpet. The jury acquitted de Marigny of the murder charge but gave a recommendation that he was an \\"undesirable alien\\" and should be removed from the island. The deportation recommendation is rumored to have been influenced by his unpopularity among the ruling class on the island. (The Duke of Windsor had described de Marigny as \\"an unscrupulous adventurer [with] an evil reputation for immoral conduct with young girls\\".) Following his deportation, the de Marignys settled in Cuba before separating in 1949. Several books have been written about the case, including one by de Marigny himself. Many theories have been advanced, including suspected mob involvement, but the Nassau newspaper editor John Marquis insisted in his book Blood and Fire (published in 2005) that the murder was strictly a local affair, planned by wealthy Nassau whites to prevent Oakes from moving his money to Mexico. It implicated Sir Harold Christie in the plot and blamed the Duke of Windsor for orchestrating a cover-up by importing two crooked Miami detectives to conduct the investigation. ===Marriage and children=== De Marigny was married four times: #Lucie-Alice Cahen for four months in 1937, #Ruth Fahnestock Schermerhorn (1937-?) #Nancy Oakes (1942–1949) #Mary Morgan-Taylor (1952–1998) His fourth marriage was the only one to produce children (3 sons). ===Later life=== De Marigny went to Canada toward the end of World War II and enlisted in the Canadian Army in July 1945. He lived in Quebec for three years before being deported. He spent various amounts of time in the United States, Jamaica, Haiti and the US again before finally moving to Central America.Bourrie [1998]. Flim Flam, 37.

The service is operated by Northern. The route covered by the service was historically part of the Midland Railway. The line is electrified at 25 kV AC overhead between Leeds City and Skipton, a section known as the Airedale line. == The route  Airedale line (Leeds–Skipton) === The first section, between Leeds City and was opened by the Leeds and Bradford Railway on 1 July 1846, and extended to Skipton by the Leeds and Bradford Extension Railway. === Skipton–Settle === The line from here, known as the \\"Little\\" North Western Railway, opened as far as Clapham on 30 July 1849Binns, D (1982) The 'Little' North Western Railway, Wyvern Publishing, Skipton. , p.9 and through to on 1 June 1850.

The line was frequently used as an alternative through route when the Settle-Carlisle main line was blocked. It was opened from Ingleton by the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway in 1861: the route was closed to passenger traffic on 1 February 1954 and completely in 1966. * Bentham * Wennington – here the route divided, with the Furness and Midland Joint Railway connecting with the original NWR/Midland line.

Trains now continue via Carnforth, with stations at: * Melling (closed 1952) * Arkholme (closed 1960) * Borwick (closed 1960) *' – here the line joins the Furness line and then the WCML. *Lancaster *'''''' *Morecambe == Loss of services == The line has only existed in its current form since January 1966 – prior to this the Leeds to Morecambe service used the 'Little ' North Western Railway route via Lancaster, with the Furness & Midland Joint line to Carnforth served mainly by through carriages detached from/attached to main line trains at Wennington (although a small number of local trains operated between there and Carnforth only). The Beeching Report of 1963 deemed this service pattern unsatisfactory and proposed that services be 'modified', with the original route from Wennington to Lancaster and Morecambe eventually being closed in favour of the F&MJ; line on 3 January 1966.Marshall, J (1981) Forgotten Railways North-West England, David & Charles (Publishers) Ltd, Newton Abbott. , p.158 From that date all trains ran Carnforth, the WCML, Hest Bank North Junction and the former LNWR Morecambe branch line to reach their destination. This routing had one major drawback in that travellers could no longer reach Lancaster directly, instead having to change at Carnforth onto Furness line services – a situation that would remain unchanged until the early 1980s. The service was by now operated by DMUs as an extension of the Leeds to Skipton commuter route, with a train every two hours for most of the day (the BR timetable of 1975 had seven trains per day running in each direction on weekdays and three or four on Sundays depending on the time of year). All stations between Skipton and Carnforth (except Hellifield) were reduced to unstaffed halt status in October 1970, when 'Pay Train' working was introduced. The line was also used by several freight trains each day, including train loads of ammonia from Teesside to the ICI plant at Heysham and bitumen from Stanlow to a distribution plant at Skipton. Steam- hauled charter specials also appeared on the line from time to time from the mid-seventies onwards, running to and from the Steamtown museum at Carnforth. Borwick Station in 1962 From 1982 however the line's timetable was modified, with several services speeded up (by omitting the intermediate station calls north of Skipton) and diverted to run via Lancaster to provide connections into and out of WCML trains to and from Carlisle & Glasgow. This was due to the controversial decision to reroute Nottingham–Glasgow trains away from the Settle–Carlisle line as part of BR's ongoing plan to close it. Had these plans come to fruition, the route would also have been used by a twice-daily replacement Leeds–Carlisle service via the WCML which would have reversed in the loops immediately south of Carnforth station (details were provided in the 'Heads of Information' document issued by BR to all objectors to the 1983 closure proposals). This new timetable restored the direct link between Lancaster and Leeds for the first time in more than fifteen years and also brought upgraded rolling stock to the route in the shape of Class 123 and Class 124 DMUs formerly used on Hull–Manchester Trans-Pennine services. The benefits though were mainly overlooked due to the circumstances in which they were introduced (most rail users considered the new services to be poor substitutes for the direct Leeds to Glasgow trains they replaced) Towler J, (1990) The Battle for The Settle & Carlisle, Platform 5 Publishing, Sheffield, , p.44 and also the increase in journey times to and from Morecambe caused by the Lancaster re-routing (and subsequent curtailment there when locomotive- hauled stock took over for a short time in the mid-eighties). Up freight train near Bell Busk in 1961 Freight services on the route ended in 1986 following the closure of the Heysham chemical plant and the loss of the Stanlow–Skipton bitumen traffic to road, leaving the Leeds to Lancaster/Morecambe passenger service as the only user of the route (apart from occasional steam excursions and empty coaching stock transfers) – a situation that remains unchanged to the present day. The timetable has also undergone further alterations in recent years, including the ending of the semi-fast trains and the routing of all services via Lancaster in May 1987. The biggest change though came in 1990-91, when a DMU shortage led to BR summarily cutting the service frequency almost in half – from seven trains each way per day to just four, of which only one ran beyond Lancaster.GB NRT May 1989 & May 1991 Editions, Table 36 This prompted the formation of the Lancaster & Skipton Rail Users Group later the same year to help promote the route and campaign for service improvements.'A short history of the Bentham Line Community Rail Lancashire Retrieved 1 February 2016 An extra weekday train in each direction was subsequently added in May 1995 (bringing the total to five) and through running to Morecambe restored, but despite the efforts of the user group and the various local authorities along the line (which had its own Community Rail partnership set up in 2006 and was formally designated as a Community rail line in October 2012Bentham community rail lineDepartment for Transport; Retrieved 1 February 2016), the current service frequency remains less than ideal with large gaps (of up to four hours) between trains. ==Current services== Since the December 2019 timetable change, most services on the line have been operated by Class 158 DMUs; previously Class 144 and 142 Pacer units were used. Occasionally, other units are used, such as the Class 150 and 153. The 2008 Network Rail plan for the route involved new signalling (there are currently no intermediate signals anywhere between Settle Junction and Carnforth, the block section of more than 24 miles being the longest in the country and a consequent constraint on capacity) and other improvements for the sections of the line beyond Skipton. Carlisle services would be increased to a basic two-hour pattern with extra services to 'fill in the gaps' at peak times during the day to give a 1 train per hour frequency. The current mid- morning Leeds to Morecambe train (and corresponding return service in the afternoon) was extended to Heysham Harbour from the December 2008 timetable change.GB National Rail Timetable December 2008-May 2009, Table 36 This reinstated the direct service between Leeds/Skipton and beyond and Heysham that last ran more than 30 years ago. The Sunday service on the line was also enhanced at the start of the new May 2011 timetable, with the two trains that used to run only during the summer months extended to operate right through until the end of the timetable period in December.Northern Rail Timetable 7 – Leeds to Carlisle//Leeds to Morecambe & Heysham PortNorthern Rail; Retrieved 1 February 2016 In the new Northern franchise, won by Arriva Rail North and which started in April 2016, there will be an increase in services between Leeds and Lancaster, up from four trains westbound and five trains eastbound currently to seven in each direction on weekdays/Saturdays and five on Sundays. These trains will stop at all intermediate stations and will include trains at suitable times for commuters working in both Leeds and Lancaster. There will also be a later last train from Leeds on weekdays. The new services will be introduced at the May 2018 timetable change. Northern has also stated its intention to upgrade facilities at various stations on the route over the next few years - these will include the provision of customer information screens, LED lighting, video help points and self-service ticket machines at each location.\\"Official Opening For New Giggleswick Shelter\\" Community Rail Lancashire news article; Retrieved 15 December 2016 Work on these improvements has been ongoing throughout 2019 and should be complete by early 2020. The improved timetable took effect from 20 May 2018 - though the overall service frequency has improved, the number of through trains beyond Lancaster has actually fallen slightly (from four to three) whilst the Heysham direct service has been withdrawn (passengers now have to change at Lancaster). The May 2019 timetable has addressed this issue by introducing two additional through trains to/from Morecambe and an extra departure from Leeds in the a.m peak, returning from Morecambe mid-morning. ==Freight artery == A recent report by Modern Railways claimed that a solid hourly service would operate on the line as far as Long Preston, but would serve Carlisle and Lancaster alternately. It may also become a freight artery to improve capacity on the West Coast Main Line. == See also == *Other services partly sharing this route's tracks: **Airedale line (Leeds–Skipton) **Settle–Carlisle line (Leeds–Settle) **West Coast Main Line (Carnforth–Lancaster) **Morecambe branch line (Lancaster–Morecambe) *Original railway companies: **Leeds and Bradford Railway (Leeds–Shipley) **Leeds and Bradford Extension Railway (Shipley–Skipton) **\\"Little\\" North Western Railway (Skipton–Wennington – and dismantled Lunesdale line) **Furness and Midland Joint Railway (Wennington–Carnforth) **Lancaster and Carlisle Railway (Carnforth–Morecambe) == References  External links == * Community Rail Lancashire – The Bentham Line Category:Rail transport in West Yorkshire Category:Rail transport in Lancashire Category:Transport in the City of Lancaster Category:Transport in Leeds Category:Railway lines in North West England Category:Railway lines in Yorkshire and the Humber ","title":"Leeds–Morecambe line"},{"id":"19275432","text":"The University of Castilla–La Mancha (UCLM) is a Spanish university.

It is also commonly known as Salerno-Pontecagnano Airport. List of Italian certified airports by ENAC ==History== The airport was founded in 1926 by Aeronautica Militare, Italy's military air force. A flight training facility was established between 1933 and 1943. The first hangar was designed by the famous architect Pier Luigi Nervi. In 1946, a meteorological service was established, and in 1952, the Salerno Air Club was founded. The airport has hosted the Carabinieri helipad since 1975, and the Firefighter helipad and a parachuting school since 1984. A new control tower was built in 1987. The airport was exclusively used by the Carabinieri, Firefighters, flight and parachuting school and small private jets until 2007. The airport was then developed to accommodate civil traffic on a large scale, with four check-in desks, two boarding areas, luggage belts and waiting rooms. The runway has a VOR system, a radio direction finder VDF and a lighting system. The runway was extended for a total length of 1 654 m, with an extensions to 2 020 m planned. In 2011 was presented the project for the extension of the runway up to 2020 m (more than 60 m of anti blast) and for the creation of new buildings and other technical adjustments. ==Airlines and destinations== Scheduled flights started in 2008 with the company VolaSalerno, which worked from August 2, 2008 to December 18, 2008, followed by Air Dolomiti from July 27, 2009 to May 7, 2010, Alitalia from December 1, 2010 to March 23, 2012, Skybridge AirOps, Air Dolomiti and Danube Wings from June, 2012 to October, 2012.

He holds the record for most wins in match play competition. The PGA Championship is an annual golf competition formerly held in mid-August until 2019, when it moved to mid-May. It was established in 1916 and is one of the four major championships played each year which include the Masters, the U.S. Open, and the Open Championship (British Open). In addition, this championship is conducted by the Professional Golfers Association (PGA). Due to World War I and II, the competition was not held from 1917 to 1918 and in 1943, respectively. The reigning champion of the competition is automatically invited to play in the other three majors for the next five years, and is exempt from qualifying for the PGA Championship for life. The champion also receives membership on the PGA Tour for the following five years and invitations to The Players Championship for five years. The prize of the tournament is the Wanamaker Trophy, which the champion keeps until the following year's competition. The PGA Championship was originally a match play event; however, in 1958 it was changed to a stroke play event. Walter Hagen (match play) and Jack Nicklaus (stroke play) hold the record for the most victories; both men have won the competition five times. Hagen holds the record for most consecutive wins in match play with four (1924–27), and Tiger Woods holds the record for most consecutive wins in stroke play with two, which he did twice (1999–2000, 2006–07). Julius Boros is the oldest winner of the PGA Championship; he was 48 years, 142 days old when he won in 1968. The youngest winner of the PGA Championship is Gene Sarazen, who was 20 years, 174 days old when he won in 1922. David Toms holds the record for the lowest score over 72 holes, which is 265. Jason Day holds the record for most strokes under par for 72 holes, 20, when he won the 2015 PGA Championship. This is the record under par score in all major championships. The PGA Championship has had three wire-to-wire champions: Bobby Nichols in 1964, Raymond Floyd in 1982, and Hal Sutton in 1983. Four others have led wire-to-wire if ties after a round are counted: Floyd in 1969, Nick Price in 1994, Woods in 2000 and Mickelson in 2005. ==ChampionsMatch play=== Gene Sarazen, three-time PGA Championship champion (1922, 1923, and 1933).

At Christmas there is no tree or Christmas stocking for them. When the parents believe them safely tucked up in bed, the children creep out and watch through the window the preparations being made for the holiday in a wealthy neighbour’s home across the way. While they are absorbed in this, Fairy Berylune enters. She is a witch who demands from the children that they bring her the grass that sings, and the bird that is blue so that her own little child who is sick may be restored to health and happiness. Upon agreeing to find the bird, the fairy crowns Tyltyl with a magic cap set with a wonderful diamond, which has power to disclose the past and future, and to turn inanimate objects and animals into speaking creatures. Everything around the children begins to take life and voice: milk, sugar, light, bread, the fire, cat and dog. Suddenly the window opens and the children set off on their quest. They go first to the Land of Memory, then the Palace of the Night, Garden of Happiness, the Cemetery and then the Kingdom of the Future, but cannot capture the blue bird. They return home to bed. When morning comes, a neighbour who looks like the Fairy enters to beg for a blue bird so that her sick child may be cured by the sight of it. Looking around, the children are amazed to see that their own turtle dove has turned blue. They gladly offer it for the sick child, and with the gift the invalid’s spirits return. When Tyltyl asks for its return and the child shows reluctance to give it back, the blue bird escapes from both and flies off. ==References== Category:Operas by Albert Wolff Category:French-language operas Category:Opera world premieres at the Metropolitan Opera Category:1919 operas Category:Operas Category:Operas based on plays Category:Operas based on works by Maurice Maeterlinck ","title":"L'oiseau bleu (opera)"},{"id":"19275608","text":"Ikupasuy are wooden, carved ceremonial sticks used by Ainu men when making offerings to spirits.

Historically, this has been accomplished through the electrical stimulation of a phrenic nerve by an implanted receiver/electrode, though today an alternative option of attaching percutaneous wires to the diaphragm exists. ==History== The idea of stimulating the diaphragm through the phrenic nerve was first firmly postulated by German physician Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, who in 1783 proposed that such a technique could be applied as a treatment for asphyxia. French neurologist Duchenne de Boulogne made a similar proposal in 1855, though neither of them tested it. It wasn't until a year later that Hugo Wilhelm von Ziemssen demonstrated diaphragm pacing on a 27-year-old woman asphyxiated on charcoal fumes by rhythmically faradizing her phrenic nerves, saving her life. Duchenne would later in 1872 declare the technique the \\"best means of imitating natural respiration\\". However, advances in mechanical ventilation by the likes of George Poe in the early twentieth century ended up being initially favored over phrenic nerve stimulation. Harvard researchers Sarnoff et al. revisited diaphragm pacing via the phrenic nerve in 1948, publishing their experimental results on dogs. In a separate publication a few days before, the same group also revealed they had an opportunity to use the technique \\"on a five-year-old boy with complete respiratory paralysis following rupture of a cerebral aneurysm\\". Referring to the process as \\"electrophrenic respiration\\", Sarnoff was able to artificially respirate the young boy for 52 hours. The technology behind diaphragm pacing was advanced further in 1968 with the publication of doctors John P. Judson and William W. L. Glenn's research on the use of radio-frequency transmission to at whim \\"adjust the amplitude of stimulation, and to control the rate of stimulation externally\\". Teaming up with Avery Laboratories, Glenn brought his prototype device to commercial market in the early 1970s. The Avery Breathing Pacemaker received pre-market approval from the FDA in 1987 for “chronic ventilatory support because of upper motor neuron respiratory muscle paralysis” in patients of all ages. In the 1980s, “sequential multipole stimulation” was developed in Tampere, Finland. This technology was commercialized as the Atrostim PNS system and became commercially available in Europe in 1990. By the early 1990s, long-term evaluations of the technology were being published, with some researchers such as Bach and O'Connor stating that phrenic nerve pacing is a valid option \\"for the properly screened patient but that expense, failure rate, morbidity and mortality remain excessive and that alternative methods of ventilatory support should be explored\\". Others such as Brouillette and Marzocchi suggested that advances in encapsulation and electrode technologies could improve system longevity and reduce damage to diaphragm muscle. Additionally, new surgical techniques such as a thoracoscopic approach began to appear in the late 1990s. In the mid-2000s, U.S. company Synapse Biomedical began researching a new diaphragm pacing system that wouldn't have to attach to the phrenic nerve but instead depended on \\"four electrodes implanted in the muscle of the diaphragm to electronically stimulate contraction\\". The marketed NeuRx device received several FDA approvals under a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE), one in 2008 and another in 2011. ==Methodology and devices== The basic principle behind a diaphragm pacing device (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration identifies the device as a \\"diaphragmatic/phrenic nerve stimulator\\") involves passing an electric current through electrodes that are attached internally. The diaphragm contracts, expanding the chest cavity, causing air to be sucked into the lungs (inspiration). When not stimulated, the diaphragm relaxes and air moves out of the lungs (expiration). According to the United States Medicare system, phrenic nerve stimulators are indicated for \\"selected patients with partial or complete respiratory insufficiency\\" and \\"can be effective only if the patient has an intact phrenic nerve and diaphragm\\". Common patient diagnoses for phrenic nerve pacing include patients with spinal cord injury, central sleep apnea, congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (i.e., Ondine's curse), and diaphragm paralysis. There are currently three commercially distributed diaphragm pacing devices: Synapse Biomedical, Inc.'s NeuRx (US), Avery Biomedical Devices, Inc.'s Mark IV Breathing Pacemaker (US), and Atrotech OY's Atrostim PNS (Finland). The Synapse and Avery devices are distributed worldwide and approved for use in the United States. The Atrotech device is not available in the U.S. As of December of 2019, FDA Premarket Approval was given to Avery's Spirit Transmitter Device, replacing the Mark IV transmitter. In May 2020, Canadian company Lungpacer Medical received approval for emergency use by the USFDA amid the COVID-19 pandemic.SFU professor's invention to help recovery of ventilator patients approved for emergency use in U.S. - Meera Bains, CBC, 8 May 2020 ==Surgical procedure== In the case of the Atrostim and Mark IV devices, several surgical techniques may be used. Surgery is typically performed by placing an electrode around the phrenic nerve, either in the neck (i.e., cervically; an older technique), or in the chest (i.e., thoracically; more modern). This electrode is connected to a radiofrequency receiver which is implanted just under the skin. An external transmitter sends radio signals to the device by an antenna which is worn over the receiver. For the cervical surgical technique, the phrenic nerve is approached via a small (~5 cm) incision slightly above, and midline to, the clavic. The phrenic nerve is then isolated under the scalenus anticus muscle. For the thoracic surgical technique, a small (~5 cm) incisions over the 2nd or 3rd intercostal space. The electrodes are placed around the phrenic nerves alongside the pericardium. Use of a thorascope allows for this technique to be performed in a minimally-invasive manner. In the case of the NeuRx device, a series of four incisions are made in the abdominal skin. Several tools such as a laparoscope and probe are used to find the best four locations on the diaphragm to attach four electrodes, which have connections outside the body. A fifth electrode is placed just under the skin in the same area. All these connect to the device. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * Category:Medical treatments Category:Respiratory system procedures de:Elektrolunge ","title":"Diaphragm pacing"},{"id":"19275710","text":"Violet is a small unincorporated community with a population of around 40 in Nueces County, Texas, United States. It lies along State Highway 44, between the cities of Corpus Christi and Robstown. ==History== In the early 1900s, German immigrant farmers moved to the region where cattle was raised, and began to grow crops. In December 1906 Erwin Cushman and Louis Petrus jointly acquired a 1030-acre plot in the area then known as Land Siding. Petrus soon bought out Cushman, and in early 1908, he appointed John W. Hoelscher to sell the land in exchange for a commission of fifty cents (now approximately $12) per acre. Hoelscher decided to promote the area specifically to German- American Catholic farmers. He advertised in several Texas German newspapers and secured the endorsement of Reverend Peter Verdaguer, the apostolic vicar of Brownsville (the precursor to the Diocese of Corpus Christi). In 1910, the population had increased to the point where a new school had to be built. Louis Petrus and Charles Hoelscher donated land for the school to Reverend Verdauger, and Charles Hoelscher donated money for the project. The school was opened in December 1910 with Geraldine Dunn as the first teacher. The school also served as a church until a church building could be built, and on December 26, 1910, the Reverend Ferdinand Joseph Goebbels presided over the first Mass there. In 1911 an acre of land was set aside for a cemetery, and in 1912 a rectory was built. The next year, the rectory was converted to a school, and the old school was then used exclusively for a church. In 1913 the community was renamed from Land Siding to Violet, after the wife of storekeeper John Fister, and a post office was built, which remained in operation until 1947. In 1918 a new school was built to accommodate a growing number of kids, and the next year, the church, named St. Anthony's, was renovated and expanded. In 1952, a new church was built, and the old church was moved to nearby Clarkwood and renamed Our Lady of Mount Carmel. In 1972 the old church was abandoned and the Violet Historical Society was founded to raise money to return the building to Violet. In 1975 it was placed about 200 feet east of the original site and restored by descendants of the original builders. In the late 1990s, the Texas Department of Transportation bought up the land surrounding Highway 44, reducing the town's population. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Texas Category:Unincorporated communities in Nueces County, Texas Category:Corpus Christi metropolitan area ","title":"Violet, Texas"},{"id":"19275718","text":"These are The Official UK Charts Company UK Official Indie Chart number one hits of 2001.

She also writes urban fiction as Meesha Mink and young adult fiction as Simone Bryant. ==Biography== Niobia Bryant was born and raised in the Central Ward of Newark, New Jersey to Letha and Ernest. She has one brother, Caleb. Bryant was raised in a single-parent home and credits her mother for introducing her to books at an early age.http://hoodwives.wordpress.com Bryant was educated in the Newark Public Schools system and graduated from University High School, eventually earning a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and a Bachelor of Arts in Social and Behavioral Science with an accompanying Psychology minor from Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey. Bryant finished her first book, an African-American romance she entitled Down Home Girl in 1999 and submitted it to several publishers. After offers from two publishing houses, she accepted the deal with BET Book/Arabesque. The title was changed to Admission of Love and her debut was released August 2000 to rave reviews. Her second book from BET Books, Three Times a Lady (2001), became her first national bestseller. In 2003 Three Times a Lady was selected by the Books for the Blind (Talking Books) program to be transcribed into an audio recording supplied free of charge to people who are blind or visually impaired.https://www.loc.gov/nls/tbt/2003/5sepoct.html Her romances, \\"Make You Mine\\" and \\"Red Hot\\" won for the 2009 and 2013 Romantic Times Best African- American Romance Awards, respectively. In 2007, her first mainstream Live and Learn was published by Kensington Publishing. In her mainstream books the subject matter steered away from the happily ever after of romance and took on more complex and darker themes like adultery, drug addiction, and domestic violence. Since Live and Learn Bryant has written several mainstream novels that have showcased her diverse writing ability, including her bestselling Mistress series (Message from a Mistress, Mistress No More, Mistress, INC., The Pleasure Trap, and the upcoming Mistress for Hire). The Pleasure Trap was nominated for a 2014 RT Award for Best Multicultural Fiction.https://www.rtbookreviews.com/book-review/pleasure-trap-0 In 2017 Message from a Mistress was made into a TV movie broadcast on Centric.

The second book, All Hail the Queen, was released February 2015. The Meesha Mink website credits the author with saying: > The stories about inner cities need to be as diverse as the people who live > in these environments. Growing up on 16th Ave in Newark all my life, I knew > in a one block radius you could either have: a single mother or a married > couple raising their family; dope dealers or people working forty hours a > week; a homeowner or someone renting a low income apartment. For me, urban > fiction isn't about glorifying the negatives in the 'hood, but simply > telling the real stories that do exist. As a writer and a reader I can > always respect the gift of storytelling of ALL stories. Since her 2000 debut, Bryant's books have consistently received top reviews; hit bestseller lists; been released as audiobook, book club and large print editions; and garnered award nominations/wins.

The encoded protein is thought to have a potential role in the induced radioresistance. Also it appears to have some involvement in the control of the cell cycle. FKBPL is involved in cellular response to stress. It was first isolated in 1999 and was initially named DIR1. It was later reclassified because of its homology to the FKBP family of proteins and was renamed FKBP-like (FKBPL). A separate study that found it to be involved in the stabilisation of newly synthesised p21 termed it Wisp39. It is known to interact with Hsp90, glucocorticoid receptor and dynamitin and may play a role in signalling, like other FKBPs. FKBPL has also been shown to influence estrogen receptor signalling and can have a determinant effect on response to the breast cancer drug tamoxifen. ==References== Category:EC 5.2.1 Category:Co-chaperones ","title":"FKBPL"},{"id":"19275827","text":"Allen Danziger (born July 23, 1942) is an American former actor, perhaps best known for his role as Jerry in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). ==Biography== Danziger was born in the Bronx, New York.

Norwegian National Road RV 555 crosses Puddefjord bridge over Damsgårdssundet into the tunnels Løvstakk tunnel (Løvstakktunnelen) to Fyllingsdalen and Damsgårds tunnel (Damsgårdstunnelen) to Laksevåg. The bridge carries six lanes of motor vehicles and two cycle/footpaths across the Puddefjorden in central Bergen, between Møhlenpris in the city centre and Gyldenpris in Årstad borough. Although it does not have official motorway status, it is an important part of the city's motorway network, linking the westbound motorway, Sotraveien, to European route E39. The bridge was important in the development of the valley of Fyllingsdalen, which was annexed by Bergen in 1955. It also served as a more convenient road to the city centre for the residents of Laksevåg, who prior to its construction had to drive through Danmarksplass or take the ferry across the Puddefjord.

Originally broadcast a single two-part pilot, before being followed by a series of three two-part stories, Second Sight follows DCI Ross Tanner (Clive Owen), a maverick cop who finds out that he has a rare disease which is causing him to go blind. Tanner's boss, Superintendent Lawson (Thomas Wheatley), little suspects that the man he named to head the elite Specialist Elite Murder Unit is losing his sight. Tanner struggles keep his condition a secret, but soon asks himself – how long can he keep solving crimes that not even the fully sighted can fathom. The series also follows Tanner's battles with his irrepressible Inspector, Catherine Tully (Claire Skinner), who urges him to tell the truth for the sake of his own health.

One Nevada remains one of the strongest credit unions or banks in the state with more than 14.44% in capital reserves.Source: ONCU Financials, 4/14 ==History== One Nevada has its beginnings in two separate credit unions that merged many years later. The Vegas Air Base Federal Credit Union was started on February 10, 1950, when nine civilian employees pooled $5 each to begin their credit union. The credit union changed its name to Nellis Federal Credit Union in 1958. Meanwhile, at Las Vegas City Hall, seven City employees began the Las Vegas City Employees Federal Credit Union on February 14, 1951. For the next 30 years or so, both credit unions served the employees of their respective employers and their families. Both credit unions grew and expanded their services. On August 31, 1983, the Nellis Southern Nevada Federal Credit Union and the Las Vegas Federal Credit Union merged and adopted the name Nevada Federal Credit Union. During the 1980s, several smaller credit unions joined with Nevada Federal. Those smaller credit unions include the Showboat Credit Union, the Commercial Center Credit Union, the Nevada Air Guard Credit Union, the Washoe State Employees Federal Credit Union, the North Las Vegas City Employees Federal Credit Union, the Vegas Village Credit Union, the Tropicana Employees Federal Credit Union and others. In August 2011, the members of Nevada Federal Credit Union approved the conversion from a federal charter to a Nevada state-charter. The credit union changed its name to One Nevada Credit Union shortly thereafter. ==Timeline== {  -  1950s • 1950 – Vegas Air Base Federal Credit Union was started • 1950 – Vegas Air Base Federal Credit Union reaches 77 members with $1,807 in assets • 1951 – Las Vegas City Employees Federal Credit Union was started • 1951 – Las Vegas City Employees Federal Credit Union reached 66 members with $2,205 in assets • 1958 – Vegas Air Base Federal Credit Union changed its name to Nellis Federal Credit Union  Las Vegas City Employees Federal Credit Union One of the First ATMs -  1980s • 1981 – Nellis Federal became Nellis Southern Nevada and Las Vegas City Employees became Las Vegas Federal Credit Union • 1983 – Nellis Southern Nevada Federal Credit Union and the Las Vegas Federal Credit Union merged and adopted the name Nevada Federal Credit Union • 1983 – NFCU reaches 57,000 members with $106 million in assets  Nellis-SoNev Federal Credit Union One of the First Teller Lines -  2000s • 2000 – NFCU reaches 79,000 members with $511 million in assets • 2001 – Authorized by the Federal government to serve all residents of Clark County, Nevada • 2002 – Authorized to serve all residents of Pahrump and a large portion of Reno • 2002 – Ranked #1 in the best places to work by the Southern Nevada Human Resources Association • 2003 – Ranked #1 in the best places to work by the Southern Nevada Human Resources Association • 2004 – Ranked #1 in the best places to work by the Southern Nevada Human Resources Association • 2006 – Voted Nevada State Psychologically Healthy Workplace Award for top mid- size, non-profit company • 2006 – Ranked #1 in the best places to work by the Southern Nevada Human Resources Association • 2006 – Voted Company of the Year by the Moms in Business Network and the International Association of Working Mothers • 2007 – Voted Diversity Champion by the Southern Nevada Hispanic Employment Program • 2007 – Ranked #1 in the best places to work by the Southern Nevada Human Resources Association • 2008 – AARP Best Employers for Workers Over 50 • 2008 – Ranked #1 in the best places to work by the Southern Nevada Human Resources Association • 2009 – Best Place to Work by the Society for Human Resource Management ranking No. 21 • 2009 – Ranked #1 in the best places to work by the Southern Nevada Human Resources AssociationRobison, Jennifer.

Unlike a traditional bank owned by public stockholders, a member election for the Board of Directors is held once a year. Any member in good standing can petition to run for the Board of Directors. Board volunteers are not paid for their time or service. The Board also appoints a volunteer Supervisory Committee. The Credit Union's income, aside from operating expenses and funding capitalization, are returned to the members in the form of lower loan rates, expanded services and normally, higher dividends on deposit accounts. Therefore, the credit union, like all others in the U.S., maintains a federal tax-exempt status because of the cooperative, not-for-profit organizational structure. ==References External links == *Official Site Category:Credit unions based in Nevada Category:Companies based in Winchester, Nevada Category:Microfinance Category:Banks established in 1950 ","title":"One Nevada Credit Union"},{"id":"19275959","text":"Ken Catran (born 16 May 1944) is a children's novelist and television screenwriter from New Zealand.

As a mythological figure, she is most notable for bearing by Phorcys a host of monstrous children. The small solar system body 65489 Ceto was named after her, and its satellite after Phorcys. Ceto was also variously called Crataeis (Κράταιις, Krataiis, from κραταιίς \\"mighty\\") and Trienus (Τρίενος, Trienos, from τρίενος \\"within three years\\"), and was occasionally conflated by scholars with the goddess Hecate (for whom Crataeis and Trienus are also epithets). This goddess should not be confused with the minor Oceanid also named Ceto, or with various mythological beings referred to as ketos (plural ketea); this is a general term for \\"sea monster\\" in Ancient Greek.\\"κῆτος\\" in Liddell, Henry and Robert Scott. 1996. A Greek-English Lexicon. Revised by H.S. Jones and R. McKenzie. Ninth edition, with revised supplement. Oxford: Clarendon Press. ==In ancient texts== Hesiod's Theogony lists the children of Phorcys and Ceto as Echidna, The Gorgons (Euryale, Stheno, and the infamous Medusa), The Graeae (Deino, Enyo, Pemphredo, and sometimes Perso), and Ladon, also called the Drakon Hesperios (\\"Hesperian Dragon\\", or dragon of the Hesperides). These children tend to be consistent across sources, though Ladon is sometimes cited as a child of Echidna by Typhon and therefore Phorcys and Ceto's grandson. The Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius cites Phorcys and Ceto as the parents of the Hesperides, but this assertion is not repeated in other ancient sources. Homer refers to Thoosa, the mother of Polyphemus in The Odyssey, as a daughter of Phorcys, but does not indicate whether Ceto is her mother. Pliny the Elder mentions worship of \\"storied Ceto\\" at Joppa (now Jaffa), in a single reference, immediately after his mention of Andromeda, whom Perseus rescued from a sea-monster. S. Safrai and M. Stern suggest the possibility that someone at Joppa established a cult of the monster under the name Ceto. As an alternative explanation, they posit that Pliny or his source misread the name cetus—or that of the Syrian goddess Derceto.Colitur illic fabulosa Ceto. Pliny, Book 5, chapter 14, §69; this same paragraph will be referred to as v.14, v.69, V.xiv.69; and v.13 (one of the chapter divisions is missing in some MSS).

This understanding found increased importance in the Second Vatican Council. This includes the understanding that everyone is capable of growing in charity (also called sanctifying grace and divine life) by responding to the God-given Spirit within every human person. This Spirit is also experienced as the \\"voice of conscience\\". While one learns from Christian revelation that all those saved are incorporated into the \\"body of Christ\\" in heaven, we are sons and daughters of God by God's grace whether or not while here on earth we come to believe in Christ. ==In Supernaturalism== According to supernaturalism, a supernatural order is the original and fundamental source of all that exists.

Documentation shows that he lived an unusually long life (almost 90 years) and was quite influential among indigenous and immigrant populations. The Hackensacks were a sub-group of the Unami, or Turtle Clan, of the Lenni-Lenape, numbering close to a thousand. They occupied the territory called Ack-kinkas-hacky (various spellings include Achkinhenhcky, Achinigeu- hach, Ackingsah-sack). Essentially a sedentary, agricultural society, the Hackensacks set up seasonal campsites and practiced companion planting, hunting, trapping, fishing, and shell-fishing. They maintained a village near the Tantaqua (Overpeck Creek), while their council fire was located at Gamoenpa (Communipaw). Their territory roughly corresponds to the Upper New York Bay, Newark Bay, Bergen Neck, the Meadowlands, and the Palisades, in Hudson and Bergen Counties. During Oratam's chieftaincy, the region was settled by New Netherland Dutch, an amalgam of northern Europeans. The New Netherland Dutch arrived in 1633, establishing Pavonia, with homesteads and ports at Paulus Hook, Communipaw, Harsimus, and Hoboken. Other settlements were Achter Col and Vriessendael. In 1661, the region was given a municipal charter and named Bergen.Laws and Ordinances of New Netherland 1638-1674, compiled and translated by E.B. Callaghan, 1868 The society of the Unami was based on governance by consensus, or unanimous agreement, which its leaders were obliged to follow or to abdicate. The totem of the turtle was held in great esteem by other groups, particularly as peacemakers.Indian Tribes of Hudson's River; Ruttenber, E.M.; Hope Farm Press, 3rd ed, 2001, Native People of NJ - Lenni-Lenape Having attained an old age, Oratam likely enjoyed a position of great honor and respect. Considered a sage negotiator, Oratam brokered many land deals, truces, and treaties between the native and colonizing peoples. On occasion he was aided by David de Vries, a Dutch landowner, and Sara Kiersted, a prominent New Amsterdammer who had mastered the Unami language, and to whom he made a large land grant in 1664. It was within the bounds of Oratam's sachendom that one of the first genocides of Native Americans by European settlers took place. In February 1643, the governor of New Netherland William Kieft allowed the massacre of eighty Wecquaesgeek and Tappan who had taken refuge near one of the plantations at Harsimus in Pavonia. The Hackensacks, Tappans, and Montauks made common cause with the Wappinger, and retaliated by attacking \\"bouweries\\" (home farms) and plantations (outlying fields). By April, though, Oratam, representing the Tappans, Reckgawanacs (Manhattans), Kicktawancs, and Sintsinck, concluded a treaty with the New Netherlanders. Nonetheless, due to other events taking place, mostly on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley, hostilities escalated and what became known as Kieft's War continued for another two years. It was not until August 1645, at a \\"summit\\" in New Amsterdam in part organized by Oratam, that a truce was declared and a treaty signed. For nearly ten years the two communities co-existed peacefully, if somewhat tenuously, in some measure due to Oratam's influence in not allowing incidents between the parties to escalate to violent confrontation. However, in 1655, the murder of a Hackensack woman found stealing peaches from the orchard of a Dutch farmer on Manhattan, opened the flood gates for the release of pent-up frustrations, and once again the colony of Pavonia was raided, requiring settlers there to abandon their farms. This incident initiated the Peach Tree War. Oratam was likely involved in the return of some of the hostages who had been held at Paulus Hook. In 1660 Oratam's diplomatic skills were again requested. After a year of conflict between the Esopus Indians (Lenape of the Munsee branch) and the New Netherlanders in Ulster County, the sachem of the Warranwonkongs asked Oratam to act as emissary to the government at New Amsterdam. Petrus Stuyvesant, who had become Director-General of New Netherland, enlisted his support, and Oratam traveled to the territory and organized a \\"conference\\" that lead to a treaty which temporarily ended the hostilities.English, French, and Dutch Colonies 1643-1664 Oratam played a vital role in the negotiations for the sale of land to Robert Treat at what would grow to become Greater Newark in 1666.Meisner, Marian.

He was also a playwright, writer of books and newspaper articles, the producer of sporting events other than pugilistic, such as wrestling matches and women's marathon bicycle races. Billy Madden was born on December 10, 1852, in London, England, to Irish immigrant parents, and died on February 22, 1918, in White Plains, New York, after a protracted illness, reportedly a stomach cancer. Although some sources report that he came to the United States as a boxer, he would have been in his very early teens at that time. His first recorded prize fight in the United States was against Hurley, at age 15. As a welter weight pugilist he won numerous documented fights in the United States and was involved in numerous exhibition matches (in the US and abroad) with notable fighters such as Sullivan, McAuliffe, and Kilrain. Purportedly, he never was punched in the face. Billy Madden was probably the best known of the late 19th-century American boxing managers. He was reportedly the first to use modern advertising techniques and campaigns to create laudable careers for the pugilists he managed. He was credited with discovering and was indeed the manager of John L. Sullivan, as well as such other noteworthy fighters as Charlie Mitchell, \\"Nonpariel\\" Jack Dempsey, Jake Kilrain, McAuliffe, Peter Maher, among others. Reportedly, he coined the term \\"Knock-Out\\" and the phrase \\"the hand is quicker than the eye\\". His international reputation was for being \\"on the level\\" and he was highly respected in sporting circles. His friendship with sports writer and lawman Bat Masterson was of long standing, as was his friendship with Theodore Roosevelt, the newspaper reporter, sports writer, Governor of New York State and President of the United States. Billy Madden's obituary in the New York Times of February 22, 1918, notes that Madden had a versatile career: as well as his sports experience, he was nominated to run for the New York legislature from the fifth district of Brooklyn in 1906. According to the October 16, 1906, Gilliams Press Syndicate, he was nominated by The Independent League of New York as their candidate for the New York State Senate. The Press Syndicate quoted him as saying \\" If I go to Albany I will hand a few jolts to the Trusts to show them they cannot control me. I am for the Poor People - You Bet!\\". In his obituary in the New York Times it was noted that Billy Madden wanted to be known as a self-made man. Billy Madden was inducted, as a Boxing Manager, into the Bare Knuckles Boxing Hall of Fame in 2010. ==Sources== * https://groups.google.com/group/alt.obituaries/browse_thread/thread/d59f332f92165537/216049e61a7912e6?hl=en&lnk;=gst&q;=billy+madden#216049e61a7912e6 * https://www.nytimes.com/1918/02/22/archives/billy-madden-is-dead-former- manager-of-sullivan-succumbs-to-long.html * http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/madden-billy.htm * Boston's Boxing Heritage: Prizefighting from 1882-1955 by Kevin Smith * The Manly Art: Bare- Knuckle Prize Fighting in America by Elliott Gorn * John L Sullivan and His America (Sport and Society) by Michael T.

Above a Yoga posture statue from Kashmir, a center of monistic Agama texts. Agamas, states Rajeshwari Ghose, teach a system of spirituality involving ritual worship and ethical personal conduct through precepts of a god. The means of worship in the Agamic religions differs from the Vedic form. While the Vedic form of yajna requires no idols and shrines, the Agamic religions are based on idols with puja as a means of worship.Ghose, Rajeshwari (1996). The Tyāgarāja Cult in Tamilnāḍu: A Study in Conflict and Accommodation. Motilal Banarsidass Publications. . Symbols, icons and temples are a necessary part of the Agamic practice, while non-theistic paths are alternative means of Vedic practice. Action and will drive Agama precepts, while knowledge is salvation in Vedic precepts. This, however, does not necessarily mean that Agamas and Vedas are opposed, according to medieval-era Hindu theologians. Tirumular, for example, explained their link as follows: \\"the Vedas are the path, and the Agamas are the horse\\".Thomas Manninezhath (1993), Harmony of Religions: Vedānta Siddhānta Samarasam of Tāyumānavar, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 135 Each Agama consists of four parts:Jean Filliozat (1991), Religion, Philosophy, Yoga: A Selection of Articles, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 68–69 * Jnana pada, also called Vidya pada – consists of doctrine, the philosophical and spiritual knowledge, knowledge of reality and liberation. * Yoga pada – precepts on yoga, the physical and mental discipline. * Kriya pada – consists of rules for rituals, construction of temples (Mandir); design principles for sculpting, carving, and consecration of idols of deities for worship in temples; for different forms of initiations or diksha. This code is analogous to those in Puranas and in the Buddhist text of Sadhanamala. * Charya pada – lays down rules of conduct, of worship (puja), observances of religious rites, rituals, festivals and prayaschittas. The Agamas state three requirements for a place of pilgrimage: Sthala, Tirtha, and Murti. Sthala refers to the place of the temple, Tīrtha is the temple tank, and Murti refers to the image of god (usually an idol of a deity). Elaborate rules are laid out in the Agamas for Silpa (the art of sculpture) describing the quality requirements of the places where temples are to be built, the kind of images to be installed, the materials from which they are to be made, their dimensions, proportions, air circulation, lighting in the temple complex, etc. The Manasara and Silpasara are some of the works dealing with these rules. The rituals followed in worship services each day at the temple also follow rules laid out in the Agamas. ==Philosophy== The Agama texts of Hinduism present a diverse range of philosophies, ranging from theistic dualism to absolute monism.DS Sharma (1990), The Philosophy of Sadhana, State University of New York Press, , pages 9–14 This diversity of views was acknowledged in Chapter36 of Tantraloka by the 10th-century scholar Abhinavagupta.Richard Davis (2014), Ritual in an Oscillating Universe: Worshipping Siva in Medieval India, Princeton University Press, , page 167 note 21, Quote (page 13): \\"Some agamas argue a monist metaphysics, while others are decidedly dualist. Some claim ritual is the most efficacious means of religious attainment, while others assert that knowledge is more important.\\" In Shaivism alone, there are ten dualistic (dvaita) Agama texts, eighteen qualified monism-cum-dualism (bhedabheda) Agama texts, and sixty-four monism (advaita) Agama texts.Mark Dyczkowski (1989), The Canon of the Śaivāgama, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 43–44 The Bhairava Shastras are monistic, while Shiva Shastras are dualistic.JS Vasugupta (2012), Śiva Sūtras, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 252, 259Gavin Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, , pages 162–167 A similar breadth of diverse views is present in Vaishnava Agamas as well. The Agama texts of Shaiva and Vaishnava schools are premised on existence of Atman (soul, self) and the existence of an Ultimate Reality (Brahman – called Shiva in Shaivism, and Vishnu in Vaishnavism). The texts differ in the relation between the two. Some assert the dualistic philosophy of the individual soul and Ultimate Reality being different, while others state a Oneness between the two. Kashmir Shaiva Agamas posit absolute oneness, that is God (Shiva) is within man, God is within every being, God is present everywhere in the world including all non-living beings, and there is no spiritual difference between life, matter, man and God. The parallel group among Vaishnavas are the Shuddhadvaitins (pure Advaitins).Ganesh Tagare (2002), The Pratyabhijñā Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 16–19 Scholars from both schools have written treatises ranging from dualism to monism. For example, Shivagrayogin has emphasized the non-difference or unity of being (between the Atman and Shivam), which is realized through stages which include rituals, conduct, personal discipline and the insight of spiritual knowledge. This bears a striking similarity, states Soni, to Shankara, Madhva and Ramanujan Vedantic discussions.Jayandra Soni (1990), Philosophical Anthropology in Śaiva Siddhānta, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 178–181, 209–214 ===Relation to the Vedas and Upanishads=== The Vedas and Upanishads are common scriptures of Hinduism, states Dhavamony, while the Agamas are sacred texts of specific sects of Hinduism. The surviving Vedic literature can be traced to the 1st millennium BCE and earlier, while the surviving Agamas can be traced to 1st millennium of the common era. The Vedic literature, in Shaivism, is primary and general, while Agamas are special treatise. In terms of philosophy and spiritual precepts, no Agama that goes against the Vedic literature, states Dhavamony, will be acceptable to the Shaivas. Similarly, the Vaishnavas treat the Vedas along with the Bhagavad Gita as the main scripture, and the Samhitas (Agamas) as exegetical and exposition of the philosophy and spiritual precepts therein. The Shaktas have a similar reverence for the Vedic literature and view the Tantras (Agamas) as the fifth Veda. The heritage of the Agamas, states Krishna Shivaraman, was the \\"Vedic peity maturing in the monism of the Upanishads presenting the ultimate spiritual reality as Brahman and the way to realizing as portrayed in the Gita\\".Krishna Sivaraman (2008), Hindu Spirituality Vedas Through Vedanta, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 263 ==TextsShaiva Agamas=== The Shaiva Agamas are found in four main schools: Kapala, Kalamukha, Pashupata and Shaiva, and number 28 in total as follows: # Kamikam # Yogajam # Chintyam # Karanam # Ajitham # Deeptham # Sukskmam # Sahasram # Ashuman # Suprabedham # Vijayam # Nishwasam # Swayambhuvam # Analam # Veeram # Rouravam # Makutam # Vimalam # Chandragnanam # Bimbam # Prodgeetham # Lalitham # Sidham # Santhanam # Sarvoktham # Parameshwaram # Kiranam # Vathulam Saiva Siddhanta The Shaiva Agamas led to the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy in Tamil-speaking regions of South-India and gave rise to Kashmir Saivism in the North-Indian region of Kashmir. Kashmiri Shaivism The Agamas of Kashmiri Shaivism is also called the Trika Shastra.Singh, J. (1979). Śiva Sūtras: The Yoga of Supreme Identity : Text of the Sūtras and the Commentary Vimarśinī of Kṣemarāja Translated Into English with Introduction, Notes, Running Exposition, Glossary and Index. Motilal Banarsidass Publications. . LCCN lc79903550. It centers mainly on the Trika system of mAlinI, siddha and nAmaka Agamas and venerates the triad Shiva, Shakti, Nara (the bound soul) and the union of Shiva with Shakti.Sharma, D.S. (1983). The Philosophy of Sādhanā: With Special Reference to the Trika Philosophy of Kashmir. State University of New York Press. . LCCN lc89027739 The trika philosophy derives its name from the three shaktis, namely, parA, aparA and parApara; and provides three modes of knowledge of reality, that is, non-dual (abheda), non-dual-cum-dual (bhedabheda) and dual (bheda). The literature of Kashmiri Shaivism is divided under three categories: Agama shastra, Spanda shastra, and Pratyabhijna shastra. Although the Trika Shastra in the form of Agama Shastra is said to have existed eternally, the founder of the system is considered Vasugupta (850 AD) to whom the Shiva Sutras were revealed. Kallata in Spanda-vritti and Kshemaraja in his commentary Vimarshini state Shiva revealed the secret doctrines to Vasugupta while Bhaskara in his Varttika says a Siddha revealed the doctrines to Vasugupta in a dream. ===Shakta Agamas=== The Shakta Agamas deploy Shiva and Shakti, and a unified view as the foundation for spiritual knowledge. The Shakta Agamas are commonly known as Tantras, and they are imbued with reverence for the feminine, representing goddess as the focus and treating the female as equal and essential part of the cosmic existence.Rita Sherma (2000), Editors: Alf Hiltebeitel and Kathleen M Erndl, Is the Goddess a Feminist?: The Politics of South Asian Goddesses, New York University Press, , pages 31–49 The feminine Shakti (literally, energy and power) concept is found in the Vedic literature, but it flowers into extensive textual details only in the Shakta Agamas. These texts emphasize the feminine as the creative aspect of a male divinity, cosmogonic power and all pervasive divine essence. The theosophy, states Rita Sherma, presents the masculine and feminine principle in a \\"state of primordial, transcendent, blissful unity\\". The feminine is the will, the knowing and the activity, she is not only the matrix of creation, she is creation. Unified with the male principle, in these Hindu sect's Tantra texts, the female is the Absolute. The Shakta Agamas are related to the Shaiva Agamas, with their respective focus on Shakti, or Lambda with Shiva in Shakta Tantra and on Shiva in Shaiva texts. DasGupta states that the Shiva and Shakti are \\"two aspects of the same truth – static and dynamic, transcendent and immanent, male and female\\", and neither is real without the other, Shiva's dynamic power is Shakti and she has no existence without him, she is the highest truth and he the manifested essence. The Shakta Agamas or Shakta tantras are 64 in number. Some of the older Tantra texts in this genre are called Yamalas, which literally denotes, states Teun Goudriaan, the \\"primeval blissful state of non- duality of Shiva and Shakti, the ultimate goal for the Tantric Sadhaka\\".Teun Goudriaan (1981), Hindu Tantric and Śākta Literature, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, , pages 39–40 ===Vaishnava Agamas=== The Vaishnava Agamas are found into two main schoolsPancharatra and Vaikhanasas. While Vaikhanasa Agamas were transmitted from Vikhanasa Rishi to his disciples Brighu, Marichi, Atri and Kashyapa, the Pancharatra Agamas are classified into three: Divya (from Vishnu), Munibhaashita (from Muni, sages), and Aaptamanujaprokta (from sayings of trustworthy men). Vaikhanasa Agama Maharishi Vikhanasa is considered to have guided in the compilation of a set of Agamas named Vaikhānasa Agama. Sage Vikhanasa is conceptualized as a mind-born creation, i.e., Maanaseeka Utbhavar of Lord Narayana.SrI Ramakrishna Deekshitulu and SrImAn VaradAccAri SaThakOpan Swami. SrI VaikhAnasa Bhagavad SAstram Originally Vikhanasa passed on the knowledge to nine disciples in the first manvantara -- Atri, Bhrigu, Marichi, Kashyapa, Vasishta, Pulaha, Pulasthya, Krathu and Angiras. However, only those of Bhrigu, Marichi, Kashyapa and Atri are extant today. The four rishis are said to have received the cult and knowledge of Vishnu from the first Vikahansa, i.e., the older Brahma in the Svayambhuva Manvanthara. Thus, the four sages Atri, Bhrigu, Marichi, Kashyapa, are considered the propagators of vaikhānasa śāstra. A composition of Sage Vikhanasa's disciple Marichi, namely, Ananda-Samhita states Vikhanasa prepared the Vaikhanasa Sutra according to a branch of Yajurveda and was Brahma himself. The extant texts of vaikhānasa Agama number 28 in total and are known from the texts, vimānārcakakalpa and ānanda saṃhitā, both composed by marīci which enumerate them. They are:Venkatadriagaram Varadachari (1982). Agamas and South Indian Vaisnavism. Prof M Rangacharya Memorial Trust. The 13 Adhikaras authored by Bhrigu are khilatantra, purātantra, vāsādhikāra, citrādhikāra, mānādhikāra, kriyādhikāra, arcanādhikāra, yajnādhikāra, varṇādhikāra, prakīrnṇādhikāra, pratigrṛhyādhikāra, niruktādhikāra, khilādhikāra. However, ānanda saṃhitā attributes ten works to Bhrigu, namely, khila, khilādhikāra, purādhikāra, vāsādhikāraṇa, arcanādhikaraṇa, mānādhikaraṇa, kriyādhikāra, niruktādhikāra, prakīrnṇādhikāra, yajnādhikāra. The 8 Samhitas authored by Mareechi are Jaya saṃhitā, Ananda saṃhitā, Saṃjnāna saṃhitā, Vīra saṃhitā, Vijaya saṃhitā, Vijita saṃhitā, Vimala saṃhitā, Jnāna saṃhitā. However, ānanda saṃhitā attributes the following works to Marichi—jaya saṃhitā, ānanda saṃhitā, saṃjnāna saṃhitā, vīra saṃhitā, vijaya saṃhitā, vijita saṃhitā, vimala saṃhitā, kalpa saṃhitā. The 3 Kandas authored by Kashyapa are Satyakāṇḍa, Tarkakāṇḍa, Jnānakāṇḍa. However, Ananda Saṃhitā attributes the satyakāṇḍa, karmakāṇḍa and jnānakāṇḍa to Kashyapa. The 4 tantras authored by Atri are Pūrvatantra, Atreyatantra, Viṣṇutantra, Uttaratantra. However, Ananda Saṃhitā attributes the pūrvatantra, viṣṇutantra, uttaratantra and mahātantra to Atri. Pancharatra Agama See main article: Pañcaratra Like the Vaikhanasa Agama, the Pancharatra Agama, the Viswanatha Agama is centered around the worship of Lord Vishnu. While the Vaikhansa deals primarily with Vaidhi Bhakti, the Pancaratra Agama teaches both vaidhi and Raganuga bhakti.Awakened India, Volume 112, Year 2007, p.88, Prabuddha Bharata Office. ===Soura Agamas=== The Soura or Saura Agamas comprise one of the six popular agama-based religions of Shaiva, Vaishnava, Shakta, Ganapatya, Kaumara and Soura. The Saura Tantras are dedicated to the sun (Surya) and Soura Agamas are in use in temples of Sun worship. ===Ganapatya Agamas=== The Paramanada Tantra mentions the number of sectarian tantras as 6000 for Vaishnava, 10000 for Shaiva, 100000 for Shakta, 1000 for Ganapatya, 2000 for Saura, 7000 for Bhairava, and 2000 for Yaksha-bhutadi-sadhana.Banerji, S. C. (2007). A Companion To Tantra. Abhinav Publications. ==History and chronology== The chronology and history of Agama texts is unclear. The surviving Agama texts were likely composed in the 1st millennium CE, likely existed by the 5th century CE. However, scholars such as Ramanan refer to the archaic prosody and linguistic evidence to assert that the beginning of the Agama literature goes back to about 5th century BCE, in the decades after the death of Buddha.Hilko Wiardo Schomerus and Humphrey Palmer (2000), Śaiva Siddhānta: An Indian School of Mystical Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 7–10 Temple and archaeological inscriptions, as well as textual evidence, suggest that the Agama texts were in existence by 7th century in the Pallava dynasty era. However, Richard Davis notes that the ancient Agamas \\"are not necessarily the Agamas that survive in modern times\\". The texts have gone through revision over time. ==See also== * Āgama (Buddhism) * Jain Agamas (Śvētāmbara) * Jain Agamas (Digambara) * Sacred geometry ==ReferencesSources== * Category:Hindu texts ","title":"Agama (Hinduism)"},{"id":"19276127","text":"Bois-Francs, Quebec may refer to: *Bois-Francs or the Centre-du-Québec *Bois- Franc, Quebec, a small municipality in Quebec *Bois-Franc, a neighbourhood in Saint-Laurent, Quebec ","title":"Bois-Francs, Quebec"},{"id":"19276134","text":"Ali Pur Chattha is a town of Gujranwala District in the Punjab province of Pakistan.

Muse are an English alternative rock band from Teignmouth, Devon. Originally formed in 1994, the band features vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Matt Bellamy, bassist and backing vocalist Chris Wolstenholme, and drummer Dominic Howard. The band released their debut full-length studio album Showbiz in 1999, songwriting for which was credited entirely to Bellamy. Origin of Symmetry followed in 2001, which once again credited Bellamy for songwriting, but also featured the band's first cover version recording in the form of \\"Feeling Good\\". In 2002 the band released their first live video album Hullabaloo: Live at Le Zenith, Paris, which was accompanied by Hullabaloo Soundtrack featuring a number of B-sides from previously released singles and live tracks from the video album. The Hullabaloo albums also spawned one single, \\"Dead Star/In Your World\\", which featured a cover of Frankie Valli's \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\\" as one of its B-sides. Absolution was released in 2003, which is the band's only album released to date to credit all three members for composition of the music. Muse returned in 2006 with their fourth album Black Holes and Revelations, which reverted to crediting solely Bellamy for songwriting. In 2009 this was followed by The Resistance, on which the song \\"United States of Eurasia\\" featured elements from Frédéric Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2, and \\"I Belong to You\\" featured elements from Camille Saint-Saëns' \\"Mon cœur s'ouvre à ta voix\\". \\"Neutron Star Collision (Love Is Forever)\\", a single from the romantic fantasy film The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, was released the following year. The 2nd Law was released in 2012, which featured the first songs written and sung by Wolstenholme: \\"Save Me\\" and \\"Liquid State\\". The band's seventh studio album, Drones, was released in 2015, once again crediting Bellamy alone. Simulation Theory is the eighth studio album by English rock band Muse. It was released on 9 November 2018 through Warner Bros. Records and Helium-3. Muse co-produced the album with Rich Costey, Mike Elizondo, Shellback, and Timbaland. Following the darker themes of Muse's prior albums, Simulation Theory incorporates lighter influences from science fiction and 1980s pop culture, with extensive use of synthesisers. The contemporary political climate of the United States informed the lyrics. ==Songs== Muse frontman Matt Bellamy has been credited with writing the majority of the band's songs. Christopher Wolstenholme wrote two songs on The 2nd Law, and was co-credited for music on Absolution. Drummer Dominic Howard was co-credited alongside Bellamy and Wolstenholme on Absolution. Muse released a cover of \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\\", originally recorded by Frankie Valli, in 2002. The band released a recording of \\"Man of Mystery\\", originally by The Shadows, in 2007. \\"United States of Eurasia\\" contains elements of Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2 by Frédéric Chopin. \\"I Belong to You\\" includes \\"Mon cœur s'ouvre à ta voix\\", written by composer Camille Saint-Saëns.

It is a four-story brick building in the Second Empire architectural style. Built in 1874, it is considered the best example of that style in the city, with an unusually decorative front facade. ==Register of Historical Place designation== In 1971 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Thirteen years later, when the Downtown Cohoes Historic District was added to the Register, the Music Hall was listed as a contributing property. After a restoration it began putting on performances again in the 1970s. It is the fourth-oldest music hall currently in use in the country, and also serves as the city's visitor center. ==Building== The Music Hall is nine bays wide by six deep. It is made of brick with alternating courses of limestone, a material also used for the hooded trim on the windows. The mansard roof found on many Second Empire buildings is pierced by several decorative corbeled brick chimneys. Below it is a bracketed cornice. The east (front) facade is faced in green marble at street level, making it unusually decorative for a Second Empire building and one of the most ornate in Cohoes. Inside, the third and fourth stories host a 375-seat auditorium, with a balcony on the upper level. Much of the original interior furnishings and decor remains. ==History== Two local businessmen, newspaper owner James Masten and miller William Acheson, partnered to build the Music Hall in 1874. Nichols and Halcott of nearby Albany designed and built it for a cost of $60,000. It opened with a performance of Dion Boucicault's London Assurance. They leased the space on the ground floors to stores and other businesses to provide extra income, starting with the local post office. Two years later the city's library rented some space on the second story. In 1878 Masten sold his interest to Mary Acheson for 25 cents, because he felt the local market was oversaturated. Performers who played the building over the years included Sarah Bernhardt, Buffalo Bill Cody, George M. Cohan, Jimmy Durante, Lillian Russell, John Philip Sousa, General Tom Thumb and then-Cohoes native Eva Tanguay (supposedly booed on her first appearance). In 1880 the First National Bank moved into the first floor. By 1905 it had taken over ownership of the building, putting its name on the entablature at the roofline. They closed the theater after discovering one of the roof trusses was sagging. By the middle of the 20th century, as the city declined along with its textile industries and the Erie Canal, the Music Hall had begun to deteriorate and fall into disuse. It became city property for one dollar in 1969,. and was in danger of being demolished just before it was added to the Register. An extensive restoration allowed to reopen a year after its centenary, with another production of London Assurance. In 2002 it became the home of C-R Productions, which was committed to revitalize the theater and attract visitors to Cohoes by presenting quality theater and educational programs. To the former end, it has staged popular musicals like Chicago and Miss Saigon. C-R Productions ceased production of mainstage shows in 2015. The street-level area serves as the city's visitor center, with displays on the history of the textile industry in the city and information about historic sites and other local attractions. In 2015 the City took over control of the theater and it is now a venue for local, regional and international talent. It is currently managed by the Palace Performing Arts Center. Its programming features local groups and non-profit organizations, including partner theatre Park Playhouse's off season productions. ==References *Website Category:Music venues in New York (state) Category:Theatres in New York (state) Category:Theatres on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Second Empire architecture in New York (state) Category:Music venues completed in 1874 Category:Cohoes, New York Category:Buildings and structures in Albany County, New York Category:Tourist attractions in Albany County, New York Category:1874 establishments in New York (state) Category:National Register of Historic Places in Albany County, New York Category:Event venues on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Performing arts centers in New York (state) ","title":"Cohoes Music Hall"},{"id":"19276201","text":"Grave of Andrew Kirkaldy at the Eastern Cemetery, St. Andrews Andrew Kirkaldy (18 March 1860 – 16 April 1934) was a Scottish professional golfer who played during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In 2005, her social history, Corpses, Coffins, and Crypts: A History of Burial, was named one of the 100 Best of the Best Books for the 21st Century by members of the Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA), a division of the American Library Association (ALA). ==Early life== Penny Colman was born Penelope Granger Morgan on September 2, 1944, in Denver, Colorado, to her father, Norman Charles Morgan, and her mother, Marija (known as Maritza) Leskovar Morgan. She lived in Seattle, Washington, Portland, Oregon, and Lexington, Kentucky, before her parents settled in north Warren, Pennsylvania, in 1949. Here, Colman, her parents, and her three brothers, all lived on the grounds of Warren State Hospital, a mental hospital where her father worked as a psychiatrist. In 1953, when Colman was nine years old, her parents bought a farm from the hospital. This same year, Colman's mother joined the staff of the local newspaper as a photographer and journalist and her father began writing a weekly column, \\"Everyday Psychology,\\" for several newspapers. In 1962, Colman graduated from high school and in the fall she attended Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio. After two years of college, Colman dropped out of college and decided to hitchhike through Europe. After she returned from Europe, her older brother Jon died from viral pneumonia at the age of twenty and her father died three years later from terminal cancer. Despite hardship, Colman graduated from The University of Michigan; earned a master of arts in teaching from Johns Hopkins University. Then she married Robert \\"Bob\\" Colman and had three sons, Jonathan, and twins; David and Stephen. After twenty-five years, Colman and her husband were divorced. She now lives and writes in Englewood, New Jersey. ==Non-fiction writing genre== Colman writes predominantly in the genre of nonfiction and most often about women. She attributes her interest in the genre to parental influence. During Penny Colman's youth, her mother worked as a newspaper photo-journalist and Colman accompanied her on various assignments. Colman’s father, a psychiatrist, wrote a weekly column that appeared in several newspapers. Immersed in these experiences during her formative years, she developed a belief “that nonfiction is a valuable vehicle for sharing true stories and discussing issues and ideas\\". Throughout her childhood, Colman enjoyed family visits to museums, historical sites, and landmarks igniting an interest in history that continues today. She recognized the void in the historical record of women’s accomplishments and their subsequent impact on the nation (USA). She has written twelve nonfiction books concerning women’s struggles, achievements and contributions beginning to fill that void. Her latest book, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony: A Friendship that Changed History due for release March 2011, continues the effort. In her book, Adventurous Women: Eight True Stories about Women Who Made a Difference, Colman defines her objective in this manner, \\"My intent is not to replace men but to add women (4). All of her books require extensive and meticulous research conducted solely by Colman and often includes \\"shoe leather research\\". Colman explains her motivations for becoming a writer, \\"I became a writer because there are things that I have to say. Things that I have to write. Things that I feel passionate about, such as the importance of thinking and learning, of equality and justice, and of sharing and caring\\". Rosie the Riveter: Women Working on the Home Front in World War II received the Orbis Pictus Honor Award for Outstanding Nonfiction from the NCTE and an International Reading Association’s Teachers’ Choice and Young Adult Choice. Her book of essays, Adventurous Women: Eight True Stories About Women Who Made A Difference, was named a Notable Trade Book. Since 2003, Colman has been a distinguished lecture at Queens College, the City University of New York. Her academic writings include, “A New Way to Look at Literature: A Visual Model for Analyzing Fiction and Nonfiction Texts,” Language Arts, 2007. She was honored by the New Jersey State Legislature for books and public appearances that have \\"contributed to the advancement of women.\\" ==Selected bibliography== * Spies: Women in the Civil War, 1992. * Breaking the Chains: The Crusade of Dorothea Lynde Dix, 1992. * Fannie Lou Hamer and the Fight for the Vote, 1993. * A Woman Unafraid: The Achievements of Frances Perkins, 1993. * Madam C.

The population according to the census of 1901 was 76,573, compared with 93,648 in 1891, a decrease of almost 20,000. The decrease being due to migration into the Chenab Colony. The tahsil contained the towns of Montgomery (1901 population, 6,602), the headquarters, and Kamalia (6,976); and 218 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 78,000. The greater part of the tahsil was uncultivated. It included on the south a narrow strip of the Sutlej valley, from which it rises abruptly into the desert uplands lying between the old banks of the Beds and the Ravi. Farther north lie the Ravi lowlands, interspersed with great stretches of jungle, and, beyond the river, sloping gently upwards towards the fertile plateau irrigated by the Chenab Canal. Cultivation is confined to the lands along the river, and a few scattered patches round the wells elsewhere.

He participated in two important campaigns in the Western Theater, including the Vicksburg Campaign in 1863.Ohio Civil War Trails Retrieved 2008-09-11 A talented gunsmith, Maltby was the inventor of one of the first telescopic sights. ==Early life and career== Maltby was born in 1826 in rural Kingsville, Ohio, where he was educated in the common schools. He participated in the Mexican War as a private in the 15th U.S. Infantry. He was wounded in action on September 20, 1847, during the Battle of Chapultepec. He was honorably discharged from the service on August 3, 1848, and settled in Chicago, Illinois.The Galena generals website Retrieved 2008-09-11 He subsequently moved to Galena, Illinois, and became a gunsmith, living in a room above the shop with his wife and son.Eicher, p. 362. ==Civil War service== With the outbreak of the Civil War, Maltby enlisted as a private in the 45th Illinois Infantry (known as the \\"Lead Mine Regiment\\") on December 26, 1861. He was elected as the regiment's lieutenant colonel that same day. He participated in the 1862 attack on Fort Donelson in Tennessee, and was wounded in the elbow and both thighs. He was eventually shipped home to Galena to recuperate. After his recovery, he was promoted to colonel. The following year he commanded his Illinois troops in Ulysses S. Grant's operations against the Confederate defenses of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Maltby was again wounded during an attack on Fort Hill on June 25. Union troops had tunneled under the 3rd Louisiana Redan and packed the mine with 2,200 pounds of gunpowder. The resulting explosion blew apart the Confederate lines, while troops from John A. Logan's division of the XVII Corps followed the blast with an infantry assault. Maltby's 45th Illinois charged into the diameter, deep crater with ease, but were stopped by recovering Confederate infantry. The Union soldiers became pinned down while the defenders rolled artillery shells with short fuses into the pit with deadly results. Maltby suffered severe injuries to his head and right side and never fully recovered, but was able to continue in the army.Grabau, pp. 428-38; Bearss, vol. III, pp. 908-30. He was promoted to brigadier general on August 4, 1863. On September 8, he took command of the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, of the XVII Corps in the Army of the Tennessee. For much of 1864, his brigade was in the 1st Division of the Department of Vicksburg, but for part of summer was temporarily commanded by Colonel John H. Howe while Maltby recovered from complications from his Vicksburg wounds. Maltby's Brigade remained in Vicksburg throughout the year while much of the army fought in northern Georgia and later in Tennessee.Official Records, Series 1, Vol. XXXVIII, Part 4, p. 376 ==Postbellum career== When the war ended in 1865, Maltby remained in Vicksburg in the Regular Army. He served as the city's military governor from September 6, 1867, until December 12 when he stepped down due to illness. Maltby died ten days later in Vicksburg from either yellow fever or a cardiac arrest. His body was returned to Galena and buried there in Greenwood Cemetery. His brother William H. Maltby was the captain of a Confederate artillery battery and was taken as a prisoner of war in a skirmish on Mustang Island along the Texas Gulf Coast.

A foundation bearing his name was started in 2008 with an aim to support artistically gifted people with mental illness. ==School and breakdown== Ayers began playing the double bass during middle school. He attended the Juilliard School in New York as a double bassist, but suffered a mental breakdown during his second year and was institutionalized.

After his mother's death in 2000, he moved to Los Angeles, thinking that his father lived there. Homeless and suffering from the debilitating symptoms of schizophrenia, Ayers lived and played music on the streets. ==The Soloist== Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez met Ayers at Pershing Square in 2005, and discovered his background at Juilliard. Lopez wrote several columns about his relationship with Ayers, and Nathaniel's slow transition out of homelessness. Lopez's subsequent book, The Soloist: A Lost Dream, an Unlikely Friendship, and the Redemptive Power of Music, was based on his relationship with Ayers. The book has been adapted into a film and a play titled The Soloist, released April 24, 2009 with Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. in the lead roles. In the film, Ayers is depicted as a cellist, rather than a bassist. Ayers and Lopez's relationship was also nationally highlighted in the March 22, 2009 episode of 60 Minutes on CBS. ==The Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Foundation== Ayers's sister, Jennifer Ayers-Moore, is the chairwoman and founder of the Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Foundation. The foundation, launched in 2008, began with Jennifer’s desire to help what she and Nathaniel hope will be thousands of people. An endowment will be set up to continue their ability to keep the public awareness about mental health at the forefront of the nation's consciousness. The NAAF will facilitate the appreciation of the contributions that artistic expression make to the advancement of wellness and treatment, collaborate with mental health and arts organizations to identify and exhibit the work of the artistically gifted, and to provide for grants to worthy nonprofit organizations that embody the mission of the foundation. ==References * Los Angeles Times special 'Steve Lopez on Nathaniel Anthony Ayers' * The Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Foundation * TED Talk 'Robert Gupta: Music is medicine, music is sanity' Category:American classical violinists Category:Male classical violinists Category:American male violinists Category:American classical cellists Category:American classical double-bassists Category:Male double-bassists Category:African-American musicians Category:People with schizophrenia Category:Outsider musicians Category:Musicians from Cleveland Category:Musicians from Los Angeles Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Homeless people Category:Classical musicians from California Category:Classical musicians from Ohio Category:21st-century classical violinists Category:21st-century double- bassists Category:21st-century American male musicians ","title":"Nathaniel Ayers"},{"id":"19276314","text":"The Honourable Robert Grimston (born 18 September 1816 at Mayfair, London; died 7 April 1884 at Gorhambury House, Hertfordshire) was an English amateur cricketer and a pioneer of electric telegraphy. ==Career== Grimston was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford. Ruskin, who was a fellow- undergraduate and Christ Church, described him as \\"a man of gentle birth and amiable manners, and of herculean strength, whose love of dogs and horses, and especially of boxing, was stupendous.\\" He played cricket for Oxford University, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and several other teams, making 63 known appearances in first-class matches from 1836 to 1855.CricketArchive record He was a right-handed batsman. He was one of the first members of I Zingari, and held the post of honorary treasurer. He was also a member of the MCC, and for some time president; he frequently played in matches at Lord's, and preserved his interest in the game till his death. In 1846 he assisted in the formation of a Surrey county eleven, which began playing in Kennington Oval, then a market garden.DNB gives the year as 1846, but other sources give 1845 for the formation of Surrey County Cricket Club. After Grimston's death, the MCC's annual report said of him: \\"His name has been for so many years connected with our national game, as well as with every other manly British sport, that his death must be deeply regretted by all past and present cricketers, but by none so deeply as the members of this club, with which he had been so long associated, and in which he was so justly esteemed as a true friend, a thorough sportsman, and the type of an honourable English gentleman.\\" After graduating at Oxford, Grimston studied law and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1843, but he was not adapted for the law, and practically gave up the profession in 1852, and devoted himself to the then novel enterprise of electric telegraphy, joining the board of the Electric Telegraph Company. Later he was a director of the Atlantic Telegraph Company and chairman of the Indo-European Telegraph Company. ==Family== Grimston was the fourth son of James Grimston, 1st Earl of Verulam. Three of his brothers James, Edward and Francis all played first-class cricket, as did his nephews Walter Grimston and Lord Hyde. He was also a supporter of the boxing arts and in the early 1850s, he and his brother James frequented middleweight champion Nat Langham's Rum Pum-Pas club, a dining and boxing establishment in Westminster popular with the aristocracy.List of patrons, location and details of the Rum Pum-pas club in Thormanby, (1900) Boxers and their Battles; Antecdotal Sketches and Personal Recollections, London, R.

It is situated on the southern side of the main Birmingham to Coventry Road A45 at the end of a lane called the Fordrough that leads to the factory of Webster & Horsfall Ltd. It has long been associated with the Horsfall family who built the church and continue to be its owners. Built in the 19th century of red brick in the Gothic Revival style it is dedicated to St Cyprian the third century martyr and Bishop of Carthage who although coming from a wealthy background gave away a portion of his wealth to the poor of Carthage, he was beheaded by the Romans in 258.Pagans and Christians, Robin Lane Fox, 1986 The church is now Grade II listed.Birmingham City Council web site ==History== James Horsfall was a wire drawer from Digbeth who invented high tensile steel wire. He moved to Hay Mill, a disused blade and sword factory at a water mill on the River Cole, rebuilding it as a steam-driven mill. The mill originally belonged to Hay Hall in Tyseley. In 1855 his company merged with Joseph Webster's of Penn Mill, Sutton Coldfield. He was a major manufacturer and exporter of the piano wire to Europe in 1824. In 1853 Horsfall had patented a heat treatment process which strengthened the wire. This led to improved piano wire (giving a near monopoly), wire for making needles in Redditch, fishhooks, and umbrella frames. The firm made the armoured wire for first successful transatlantic telegraph cable in 1866, using 30,000 miles of wire (1600 tons), made by 250 workers over 11 months.History of the Atlantic Cable & Undersea Communications The strengthened wire also made possible the construction of aeroplanes and automobiles. The company today also makes springs.Webster & Horsfall web site Horsfall built houses and, in 1860, a schoolroom for his workers’ children. This was subsequently converted into a Chapel, the present school room which stands beside the church was built in 1863. The services for the chapel were conducted by the senior curate of Yardley and in 1866, Sunday evening services were held and a Sunday School started for the children. In the following year, six buttresses were erected and two stone crosses were fixed to the apex of the roof. In 1869 the organ and organ chamber were added. In 1873 the foundation stone was laid and work began to incorporate the former chapel as the present chancel.The Parish church of St.Cyprian Hay Mill, Birmingham, booklet by then vicar Maureen Alderson 2001 To this, designed by Frank Barlow Osborn English Heritage listed building status Accessed 24 December 2010 but often wrongly ascribed to Martin & Chamberlain, and built by William Partridge was added the nave, the side aisles, the gallery, porch, tower, spire and vestries.Churches built since 1800', A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 7: The City of Birmingham (1964) The church was consecrated in 1878 and the first Church Council was elected in 1899 consisting of twelve members of the church, in addition to the Vicar, Churchwardens and six Sidesmen. During the Second World War in 1940 the building was damaged by enemy action but not beyond repair. ==Architecture== Interior of the Horsfall Mortuary Chapel The church, in the Gothic style, is of red brick with a minimum use of black brick and stone dressings; it has a tile roof.

The institutions mission is to train and educate regular officers for the Estonian Defence Forces and Estonian Defence League, as well as for other military institutions. It has established a national reputation for expertise in military research and development. The academic program of EMA provides a balanced education in military and civilian subjects. The academic staff members of the EMA are supported by members of the academic community from universities throughout Estonia. ==History1919 - 1940=== The school was established on April 3, 1919, by the decree of the commander-in-chief of Estonian Defence Forces, General Major Johan Laidoner. During the Estonian War of Independence, preparation of non-commissioned officers was limited because men and resources were needed on the front line. However, after the war, there was a growing need for officers, who could train and teach soldiers. Thus a school for non-commissioned officers was formed. Cadets were taught tactics, topography, administration, fortification, machine-gun employment, military law, health care, Estonian, artillery science and gymnastics. The first courses lasted 4 months. After completion of the course, cadets were promoted to the rank of ensign. Infantry school was founded on May 20, 1920. In 1921, studies were lengthened to three years and divided into three classes: general class, I special class, and II special class. Young men with six-grade education were admitted to the general class, where they were taught gymnasium subjects alongside military subjects. Men with secondary education were admitted to the I special class, and II special class was for reserve officers. During that same year, infantry-, artillery- and cavalry schools were merged into the non-commissioned officer school. On 29 August 1923, all military schools were merged into the academy, which consisted of the Military School, Higher Military School and the School of Non-Commissioned Officers. In 1927, prior military service became a prerequisite for entering the military school. In 1928, training of conscript NCO's ended in the School for Non- Commissioned Officers. The school itself was moved from Juhkentali to Tondi. Officer training also changed, with a class for aspirants, and classes for junior cadets and senior cadets. Aspirant class was for reserve officers and cadet classes were for regular officers. Training of officers changed again in 1935, when all officers began to be trained in aspirant and officer classes. Graduates of the aspirant class received reserve officer training, while in the officer classes, postgraduates of the aspirant class received additional training to become regular officers. In 1936, the School for Non-Commissioned Officers was dissolved and a new school was formed in its place. In 1940, after the Soviets had annexed Estonia, the academy was reorganized into an infantry school for the Red Army. ===1998 - present=== The Estonian National Defence College was restored on March 17, 1998. Before that, officers received training in the Defence College of the Estonian Academy of Security Sciences. Since 1998, there were two curriculums - one provided vocational higher education for officers who would mainly become platoon commanders, the other provided diploma studies for future company and battalion commanders. Studies took three and a half years and gave the students basic knowledge of history, politology, social-, behavioral-, and humanitarian sciences, natural- and exact sciences, and native and foreign languages. The academy operated on the premises of Estonian Academy of Security Sciences until 1999, when it moved to Tartu. Between 2001 and 2002, Finland helped organize courses for logistics, engineering, artillery and communication specialties. Finland also helped in organizing logistics, artillery, and air-defence courses between 2003 and 2004. In 2004, the institution adapted its curriculum in line with the Bologna declaration. In 2005, it became a vocational university, which could also issue a masters degree. The university received its first accreditation from an international commission in 2006. In 2008, the academy opened its curriculum for air force officers, and in 2011, for navy officers. Between 2010 and 2013, the academy offered a course for junior officers. In 2010, the university also started offering external studies for officers who would not be able to partake in regular studies. The Estonian National Defence College received its flag in 2013, from the Estonian Reserve Officers’ Association. In 2019, the university went through a restructuring and was renamed the Estonian Military Academy. To reflect that change, in February 2020, it received a new flag from the Estonian Reserve Officers’ Association, cadet council of the City of Tartu and the Defence Forces. == Officer training == * Basic Officer Training Course is the first level programme with a three-year study period carried out in the Estonian National Defense College. In the course, the cadets acquire the skills of a platoon leader and company commander. On completion of the course, the cadets will have applied higher education and the rank of a second lieutenant. * Advanced Officer Training Course is the second level of officer training with a two-year study period, whereby the students acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to perform the duties of junior staff officers of an infantry battalion or brigade. * Senior Staff Officer Course -- the third level of officer training -- is a one-year course conducted in cooperation with the Baltic Defence College in the same building with the ENDC (or relevant training in some educational institution abroad). * Higher Staff Officer Course, the fourth level of officer training, is conducted in higher staff officer courses and general staff officer courses in educational institutions abroad. The Estonian National Defence College offers the first level and, since the 2005/2006 study year, the second level of military higher education. == See also == * Baltic Defence College * Estonian Academy of Security Sciences * List of universities in Estonia ==References External links == * Estonian National Defence College Category:Military academies of Estonia Category:Education in Estonia Category:Education in Tartu Category:Educational institutions established in 1919 Category:1919 establishments in Estonia ","title":"Estonian Military Academy"},{"id":"19276365","text":"Kris S.

Barth joined the anti- war Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) in 1917, and became leader of the revolutionary shop stewards in January 1918. He was one of six members of the Council of the People's Deputies (Rat der Volksbeauftragten) created on 10 November 1918 in Berlin to govern Germany after Kaiser Wilhelm II had abdicated and the Republic had been proclaimed by Karl Liebknecht and Philipp Scheidemann. Three members of the Council were Majority Social Democrats (Ebert, Scheidemann and Landsberg), and three were Independent Social Democrats (Haase, Dittmann and Barth). While the former two USPD commissioners were moderate and interested in conciliation with the MSPD, Barth was the most left-wing, associated with Karl Liebknecht, who refused to serve on the Council because it had a non-revolutionary majority. That same day, 10 November, Barth first acceded to Ebert's plan to place the revolutionary soldiers back under the command of their (counter-revolutionary) officers, but then changed his position in a drawn-out but stormy speech later that evening. The soldiers should not submit to the old \\"discipline\\" of their officers. Many heeded Barth's call, and the revolution gained momentum during November. On 29 December 1918, Barth and the other USPD members resigned from the Council to protest Ebert's use of army regulars to disperse a 24 December demonstration by revolutionary sailors demanding back pay. The Council then added two MSPD members, Noske and Wissell, and began calling itself Reich Government. Although he became somewhat more moderate by the end of 1918, Barth had always been the Council's most radical member, calling on workers, for instance, not to 'debase the revolution to a movement for wages,' since that would merely ameliorate conditions, making fundamental change less likely (in an article in Die Rote Fahne, 28 November 1918). In 1920 Barth published his memoirs as From the Workshop of the Revolution, in which he claimed that the USPD had worked toward fomenting revolution against the German war machine already years earlier, and portrayed himself somewhat grandiosely as a major leader. That book was later (for instance in the 1925 Dolchstoss-Trial) used as evidence that the left had undermined the war effort. In 1921/22 Barth became a member of the SPD when the MSPD and USPD merged into one party again. (He did not join the more radical Communist Party KPD, which had split from the USPD in early 1919.) He held some speeches for the SPD during the 1920s, and was arrested several times during the Nazi period after 1933. He died in 1941. ==Works== *Emil Barth, Geldwert, Geldentwertung und Proletariat (Berlin: A.

Almost two-thirds of the upland rice area is in Asia. Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Northeastern India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, Nepal, and Vietnam are important producers.Phool Chand Gupta, J. C. O'Toole. 1986. Upland Rice: A Global Perspective, By International Rice Research Institute Published by International Rice Research Institute, 1986 , Upland rice is grown in rainfed fields prepared and seeded when dry, much like wheat or maize. The ecosystem is extremely diverse, including fields that are level, gently rolling or steep, at altitudes up to 2,000 metres and with rainfall ranging from 1,000 to 4,500 mm annually. Soils range from highly fertile to highly weathered, infertile and acidic, but only 15 percent of total upland rice grows where soils are fertile and the growing season is long. Many upland farmers plant local rices that do not respond well to improved management practices—but these are well adapted to their environments and produce grains that meet local needs.Joshi, K.D., R.B. Rana and A. Subedi. 2001. Farmer and Researcher contributions to the selection of Landraces of Ghaiya (Upland rice) for Tar areas of Nepal. L-BIRD/SANFEC. Katmandu / Dhaka Although the rice technology of the 1960s and 70s focused on irrigated rice, farmers in the uplands were not forgotten. Researchers produced cultivars adapted to poor soils, and with improved blast resistance and drought tolerance.Adhikari, B. B. and Rosyara, U.R. 2007. Collection of Upland Rice Landraces from Western Mid Hill Districts and Evaluation for Drought Tolerance. Report submitted to Nepal Academy of Science Some have outyielded traditional rices by more than 100 percent in evaluations. Scientists at national agricultural research systems have crossed these improved rices with local cultivars and farmers are now beginning to grow the progeny. But more improvements are needed to meet the new challenges. == Upland rice farmers' challenges == New challenges are emerging in the world's upland rice farming areas, where already some of the world's poorest farmers try to wrest a living from fragile soils that are fast being degraded. Upland rice field near Sundarbazaar Lamjung, Nepal Population growth, the demands of urbanism and industry, and the increasing adoption of high value cash crop farming in the surrounding lowlands are leading to strong competition for upland terrain. The uplands have traditionally suffered from drought and infertile soils, weeds and plant diseases. Soils there have been badly eroded and degraded as a result of the slash-and-burn agriculture that for many years followed logging. This, in turn, destroys the watershed, producing problems in the lands below. Already the new upward pressures are resulting in a movement toward permanent agriculture and intensification of land use in upland areas. Those involved find themselves faced—in addition to the usual upland problems—with an urgent need to conserve the soil and the diversity of plant species, and to cope with increasingly frequent and severe weed and disease infestations. == Fighting the Blast fungus == Recently, scientists have been improving their knowledge of the genetics of resistance to the Blast fungus, one of the most damaging diseases of rice, and are using the techniques of biotechnology to develop cultivars with more durable disease resistance. In the uplands, blast is particularly important because the environment favors its proliferation. Although many traditional upland cultivars show stable resistance to this disease under low-input cropping practices, they have other characteristics that make them difficult to use in intensified systems. So the risk from blast increases as cropping practices intensify and improved varieties are introduced. Scientists from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) have been working with colleagues in the Upland Rice Research Consortium to better understand pathogen populations and to identify resistance genes found in some cultivars. Armed with this knowledge, they are working with IRRI's upland rice breeder to combine such genes with other desirable traits for incorporation into new upland varieties. Consortium scientists are also trying to understand how upland rice farmers' cropping systems contribute to soil erosion, with the aim of proposing possible erosion control techniques. Studies in the Philippines have shown, for example, that hedgerows of trees, shrubs and grasses along hill contours can help reduce soil erosion up to 90 percent. Rice or other crops are planted between these strips of permanent ground cover. Leguminous plants in hedgerows make substantial amounts of atmospheric nitrogen available to both riceplants and annual crops and recycle other nutrients and organic matter. Such legumes can simultaneously increase farmers' incomes and contribute to sustainability of the farming system. Drought stress tolerance screening using a chlorophyll meter == The importance of weeds == Weeds are the most serious biological constraint to upland rice production. IRRI scientists are pursuing projects on managing weeds with less herbicide use. One approach is to search for rice plant species that exhibit a characteristic known as allelopathy. Allelopathic plants can affect the growth of nearby plants through the production of biological compounds they release into the environment. If an allelopathic rice—or other plant species—could be found that could inhibit the growth of weeds important in rice production, it might be possible through genetic engineering to develop rice cultivars that would provide their own weed control. Most weed species also are victims of their own diseases. Purposeful application of the agents of such diseases to weed pests among rice crops could constitute another approach to weed control. Researchers from IRRI, Maejo University and Chiang Mai University launched a study in 1993 of the interactions between weeds, crop environmental conditions, and farmers' practices in upper northern Thailand. The goals are to understand the diversity of farmers' practices and decisionmaking processes and to grade the factors that limit rice crop yields. IRRI scientists are also studying how fertilizer and cultural practices influence weed communities. In one project on phosphorus management, they are investigating how weed communities change as soil fertility is improved over time in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand. Riceplant cultivars differ in their ability to compete with weeds in the field. Scientists in the Philippines tested the competitiveness of a dozen cultivars against weeds to help farmers choose the most highly competitive one. By planting this cultivar and enhancing its competitive ability through good management practices, farmers should be able to reduce the number of handweedings necessary while achieving maximum yields. Difference in establishment A). drought tolerant variety Pakhejhinuwa vs B). drought sensitive Mansuli == Improving soil fertility == Research on farms in Thailand, Laos and the Philippines has confirmed what scientists had long suspected: that a lack of phosphorus in upland farms is limiting rice crop yields. Their suspicions arose from the fact that many highly weathered upland soils are inherently low in phosphorus and are acidic. But the scientists found that the lack of phosphorus will limit production even if calcium is added to the soil to overcome the acidity, or if acid-tolerant cultivars are planted. Rotations of rice and legumes could lead to stable, higher value production, they concluded. But first it is necessary to ensure by adding phosphorus that soil quality does not degrade over time. Eventually, the investment in soil inputs should pay off as added phosphorus exceeds crop needs and as other nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen are better cycled and used. == Breaking the acid barrier == The acidity present in the subsoil of many upland areas prevents plant roots from reaching the moisture and nutrients therein, thus reducing crop yield. Adding lime to the subsoil is not practical, but in 1994 IRRI and Indonesian scientists began experiments to see if components of lime applied to the soil surface could be leached down into the subsoil. This would be done by manipulating soil chemistry and using deep- rooted, acid-tolerant rice cultivars to help capture the leached components. At present they are studying the processes that govern the rate of leaching of lime components and their accumulation in the subsoil. They plan then to construct mathematical models that will be used to develop practical technologies and to indicate under what conditions the technologies might be effective. The experiments began at the Upland Rice Research Consortium site at Sitiung, Indonesia. French collaborators from l'Institut francais de recherche scientifique pour le developpement en cooperation are planning similar experiments in Thailand and Vietnam. == A perennial upland rice plant? == A rice plant that would not have to be planted annually could help reduce erosion by providing a permanent ground cover. Perenniality exists in several wild species of rice from Southeast Asia, but their yields are low. These species, however, can be crossed with cultivated rice. The challenge facing scientists is to produce a high-yielding perennial plant adapted to the poor soils of the uplands, and one that is highly responsive to low amounts of purchased inputs, and that resists diseases and insect pests. It is a challenge IRRI scientists are currently working on. New biotechnology tools will be used to transfer the perennial characters into cultivated rice, and new knowledge of genetic diversity will be applied to develop pest resistance. See: Developing Perennial Upland Rice I: Field Performance of Oryza sativa/O. rufipogon F1, F4, and BC1F4 Progeny.

It is housed in what was the Palacio del Arzobispado (Palace of the Archbishopric), built in 1530 under Friar Juan de Zumárraga on the base of the destroyed pyramid dedicated to the Aztec god Tezcatlipoca. It remained the archbishphoric until 1867 when the Finance Ministry Accountancy Department was established there. The modern museum houses an exhibit dedicated to this god as well as a large art collection. ==History== The building was the colonial archbishop's palace and contains two stone-columned courtyards. In 1530, Friar Juan de Zumárraga became the first archbishop of New Spain, which at that time included most of the Americas and the Philippines. He decided to place the see in two houses near where the cathedral would later be built. After initial adaptation, two structures were added: one to cast bells and the other served as a prison. The structure continued to be modified until 1771 when it attained the appearance still seen today. The complex is topped by a cornice on with inverted arches are combined with merlons. Two estipite columns flank the bay of the portal, through which the highest ecclesiastical authorities of colonial times once passed. Remnants of the pyramid of Tezcatlipoca can be seen on the ground floor. This is because of a restoration project concluded in 1997. Along with restoring the colonial building, two excavations were carried out to expose details of the pre-Hispanic structures. Imprisoned here was one of the first conspirators for Mexican Independence, Francisco Primo de Verdad y Ramos, who died here in 1808. Interior patio of the SHCP Museum. ==Museum== Mural \\"Canto a lo Heroico\\" by Jose Gordillo in the main stairwell. Portion of museum dedicated to the site of the building, displaying pre-Hispanic artifacts found here. The modern museum houses a collection of art from the 18th to 20th centuries, including works by Juan Correa, Diego Garcia, Rufino Tamayo, Federico Cantú, Antonio Ruiz, Adolfo Best Maugard and Raúl Anguiano. The central and permanent exhibit is called the \\"Pago en Especie y Acervo Patrimonial\\" (payment in kind and cultural heritage). It features works done by Mexicans and foreigners living in Mexico, many of whom donated the works here in lieu of paying their taxes, as part of a program initiated in 1957 as part of an initiative to stimulate artistic activity in Mexico for Mexico. The program's foremost promoter was artist David Alfaro Siqueiros. However, the idea did not really take off until the 1970s when Jaime Saldívar, Inés Amor, Gilberto Aceves Navarro repromoted Siquieros' idea, gaining backing from president Luis Echeverría Álvarez in 1975. The revived project has enjoyed enthusiastic support from contemporary artists such as Luis López Loza, Roberto Doniz, Luis Nishizawa, Ángela Gurría, Roger von Gunten, Francisco Corzas, Feliciano Béjar, Francisco Capdevilla, Fernando Castro Pacheco, Arnaldo Coen, José Luis Cuevas, José Chávez Morado and Arnold Belkin, among others, many of whom still make donations to the museum's collection. Because of this, the museum has been able to assemble exhibits of works by individuals such as Rodolfo Morales, Rafael Coronel, Manuel Felguérez and Vicente Rojo. The museum also hosts temporary exhibits, mostly of contemporary art. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1530 Secretaria De Hacienda Y Credito Publico Secretaria De Hacienda Y Credito Publico Secretaria De Hacienda Y Credito Publico Secretaria De Hacienda Y Credito Publico Secretaria De Hacienda Y Credito Publico Category:Historic center of Mexico City Category:Palaces in Mexico Category:Landmarks in Mexico City Category:History of Mexico City Category:Mexican culture Category:Aztec sites Secretaria De Hacienda Y Credito Publico Category:1957 establishments in Mexico Category:Colonial Mexico Category:Spanish Colonial architecture in Mexico ","title":"Museo de la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público"},{"id":"19276539","text":"Shakori may refer to: Shakori Tribe a Native American Indian tribe.

The conference consisted of mostly American schools, with some British schools, from mostly 11 nations - Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Syria, and the UAE. At its peak, 27 schools were a part of the conference. Occasionally, schools who were not EMAC members and even from other countries (like Saudi Arabia) were allowed to participate in certain tournaments as affiliates. EMAC ceased to exist as a conference in 2011. ==Tournaments== The schedule of tournaments for the following year were decided around April. Teams from individual schools would typically prepare months in advance before an EMAC tournament, which was usually scheduled over a weekend, so as not to disturb school sessions (however, as most EMAC events would last on average from 3 to 5 days, some days would fall on a normal school day). Participating schools took turns hosting the various events, meaning that they were responsible for facilitating the events on their own campuses. They were also responsible for housing the traveling athletes with their own students. Occasionally, some students would stay in hotels if there were not enough student hosts available for housing. Due to the large amount of participating member schools, most schools would host only one tournament each year, either in the fall or spring semester. In some cases, a school might have hosted two events or even none, depending on the schedule from year to year. The events hosted by each member school would usually differ from year to year. The activities were held in the mornings and afternoons of the tournament, while evenings were usually kept free for the team members to socialize and experience the host city. The teams were often taken to malls and shopping centers, as well as to visit local or historical landmarks. On many occasions, they were also invited to a school- chaperoned mixer or BBQ organized by the host school. ==ActivitiesAthletic=== The following athletic activities were offered: *Badminton *Basketball *Cross country *Soccer *Softball *Swimming *Tennis *Track & field *Volleyball *Wrestling Varsity teams were for students aged 16 and older, while Junior Varsity teams for participants under the age of 16. Both Track & Field and Swimming, however, also included Under 13 teams as well. Typically, each sport would have four separate tournaments, with a distinction made between boys and girls teams, as well as between Varsity and Junior Varsity teams. This would result in Varsity Boys, Varsity Girls, JV Boys, and JV Girls teams and tournaments. However, both gender tournaments were usually, but not always, hosted together at each level (e.g. the Varsity Girls Basketball and Varsity Boys Basketball tournaments would happen simultaneously and be hosted by one school). The exceptions to this were both the Track & Field and Swimming events. Both sports would have roughly 6 tournaments each (Varsity Boys, Varsity Girls, JV Boys, JV Girls, Under 13 Boys, and Under 13 Girls) happening simultaneously and be hosted by one school. In its later years, EMAC also offered an activity called the Middle School Festival, a noncompetitive tournament in which participants played a variety of sports and gained exposure to athletics and team play. ===Non-athletic=== EMAC also offered three non-athletic activities: *Academic Games *Debate & Forensics *Fine Arts Festival The teams for all 3 events were gender-neutral, as unlike the athletic events, there was no distinction between a boys and girls team. However, both the Academic Games and the Fine Arts Festival still had Varsity and Junior Varsity teams. The Debate & Forensics did not, as membership to the D&F; teams was open to students of all ages and genders; this made the Debate & Forensics tournament the only tournament without separate Varsity and Junior Varsity tournaments, and separate boys and girls tournaments. ==Code of Conduct== All EMAC participants were required to sign an official form stating that they agreed to adhere to the Code of Conduct, which prohibited the participant from possession/use of alcohol and illegal narcotics, as well as enforcing a strict curfew. Any participant found to have violated these rules may be punished with a 12-month ban from all EMAC activities, and would also likely face punishment from their own school administration. ==Member schools== The EMAC member schools (full-time and affiliate) included, but were not limited to, the following schools: *Campion School, Athens, Greece - Left EMAC in 2007 *American Community School of Abu Dhabi - Left EMAC to form MESAC in 2010 *American School of Dubai - Left EMAC to form MESAC in 2010 *American School of Doha - Left EMAC to form MESAC in 2010 *Cairo American College - Left EMAC to form MESAC in 2010 *Dubai American Academy - Left EMAC to form MESAC in 2010 *American School of Kuwait - Left EMAC to join ISAC in 2011, now a part of NESAC *American International School of Kuwait - Left EMAC to join ISAC in 2011, now a part of NESAC *American British Academy - Left EMAC in 2011 when conference folded, now a part of MESAC *American Community School in Amman - Left EMAC in 2011 when conference folded, now a part of NESAC *American Community School at Beirut - Left EMAC to join ISAC in 2011, now a part of NESAC *Schutz American School, Alexandria - Left EMAC in 2011 when conference folded *British International School in Cairo - Left EMAC in 2011 when conference folded *Damascus Community School *American Community School of Athens ==References== Category:Sports leagues established in 1978 Category:Sports leagues disestablished in 2011 Category:High school sports Category:Eastern Mediterranean Category:Sports associations ","title":"Eastern Mediterranean Activities Conference"},{"id":"19276578","text":"Montmorin, Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Navy, and Evèque d'Adran, i.e. Pigneau de Béhaine.Mantienne, p.97/204 The Treaty of Versailles of 1787 was a treaty of alliance signed between the French king Louis XVI and the Vietnamese lord Nguyễn Ánh, the future Emperor Gia Long. Nguyễn Ánh, whose family, the Nguyễn family, had been decimated by the Tây Sơn rebellion when he was 16 or 17, received the protection and aid of the French Catholic priest Pigneau de Béhaine, titular bishop of Adran.

A road course ringer, he drove the 98 Dixien/OmniSource Chevrolet for Transnet Racing, a team which García owns. Alex García made his NASCAR Nationwide Series debut in the 2007 Telcel Motorola Mexico 200 in Mexico City,2007 NNS Results: 2007 Telcel Motorola Mexico 200 where he became the first Venezuelan to race in one of NASCAR's top three series. == Background == Originally from Caracas, Venezuela, García immigrated to the United States with his family in 1988 at the age of 11. He and his family settled in Marietta, Georgia, where he still lives today. At the age of 16, several years after his Argentine uncle sparked his interest in racing, García drove his first race car. After that, García decided to embark on a career in professional racing. An owner of his equipment from the beginning of his racing career, García formed Transnet Racing, which began with a single mechanic in his parents' garage, and has now grown into an established organization with a shop in Morrow, GA, just south of Atlanta.Official Transnet Racing Website == Open Wheel career == Alex García began his racing career in open wheel racing. In 1994 Alex raced at the amateur level in SCCA Formula Vee racing, scoring five top-five finishes in his first season. The following year García moved up to Formula Ford racing, where multiple victories and eleven top-five finishes progressed his career from regional racing to success at the national level. By 1997 Alex was able to go pro, racing Formula Ford 2000. 1998 was a successful season in Formula Ford 2000, and García earned top-ten and top-five finishing and starting positions throughout the season. By 2000 García developed a sponsorship deal with Dixien Automotive Stampings and OmniSource, relationships which still exist today, and this allowed García to begin full-time racing in Atlantic Championship. In 2004, the Atlantic operation expanded to a two car team, and Transnet Racing began to experience tremendous success in the series, earning the first of the team’s podium finishes, with both cars consistently bringing home top-five's and top-ten's. Seeking to diversify his skills, García began to test other forms of auto racing, which led to experimentation with Daytona Prototype, and, ultimately, stock car racing. == Transition to stock cars == Alex García in his ARCA RE/MAX Series debut at Salem Speedway, September 2006 In 2005 García received an invitation to compete in the Six Hours of Bogotá, finishing second in a field of over 64 cars. That same year García tested his first stock car at Peach State Speedway, and made his official stock car debut at Music City Motorplex in the NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division. Participating in five races with Clyde Moody Enterprises, Alex earned several top-tens, as well as a POWERade Move of the Race award. Realizing his ultimate passion for full-bodied cars, García purchased his first stock car, and debuted in the ARCA RE/MAX Series at Salem Speedway in September 2006. By December of the same year, García announced that Transnet Racing would run a partial NASCAR Nationwide Series season in 2007, focusing on road courses, at which he excelled. ==NASCAR career== Alex García's No. 98 NASCAR Nationwide Series car in Montreal, Quebec In March 2007, Alex García made his NASCAR Nationwide Series debut at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Mexico City, Mexico, becoming the first Venezuelan to race in one of NASCAR's top three series.

Top- level players Erik Hoftun, Ardian Gashi, Alex Valencia, Vegard Forren, Pål André Helland and Magnus Stamnestrø began their careers here. ==History== KIL/Hemne were formed in 1988 and were promoted to the 2nd Division in the same year. The club played the next four seasons in the Third Division. They stayed there until 2001, when they were relegated. They went back up to the Third Division in 2003 and the Second Division in 2005. In 2006 they again went down to the 3rd division after a season that was full of long term injuries to almost all key players. On 20 October 2007 KIL/Hemne were again promoted to the Second Division after beating Verdal over two playoff games. ===2007 Cup run=== Skeid Fotball - KIL/Hemne Fotball 7-3, Norwegian second division (level 3) group 2, 17 August 2008. Flamur Kastrati, Skeid (left); unknown player, KIL/Hemne (right) In the 2007 Norwegian Football Cup KIL/Hemne caused one of the biggest shocks when they beat Molde 3-1 at home in the cup first round. The same team had previously beaten KIL/Hemne 11-1 a year earlier. In the second round, the team were up against Rosenborg. RBK took a 16th-minute lead through Didier Konan Ya. However, just two minutes later, former Rosenborg player Ole Johan Singsdal made it 1-1. KIL/Hemne continued to press and went into the break level. Just after half-time KIL/Hemne shocked Norwegian football by taking a 2-1 lead after Asgeir Snekvik scored in the 46th minute. However, RBK scored 8 minutes later through Roar Strand. In the 83rd minute KIL/Hemne again shocked Norway when Espen Sødahl made it 3-2. However, the goal was disallowed because KIL/Hemne's Ole Johan Singsdal pushed Per Ciljan Skjelbred in the chest. After full-time it stood at 2-and went to extra time. Only five minutes into the first half of extra time, RBK took the lead through Alexander Tettey and most people thought that the game was over. However, after 116 minutes, Asgeir Snekvik scored to make it 3-3 and take it to penalties. One minute later, with one minute remaining of stoppage time, RBK had a free kick in a good position and Didier Konan Ya swung it around the wall and up into the top corner. The drama didn't stop there. In the last second, KIL/Hemne had a corner and sent all of their players up in the home of making it 4-4 and keeping it to penalties.

It was the first Williams chassis to be powered by a turbocharged Honda V6 engine, for which Frank Williams negotiated a deal towards the end of 1982 and the beginning of 1983. Honda was already supplying the small Spirit team for 1983, but was enthusiastic about supplying Williams, who not only had the reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg as lead driver, but were one of the leading constructors in Formula One who had previously won both the Drivers' and Constructors titles on two occasions, a résumé that neither Spirit nor their young Swedish driver Stefan Johansson could match. Williams had agreed to help develop the engine under Grand Prix race conditions. Spirit folded shortly afterwards. ==1983== The chassis was built from aluminium with carbon fibre used at stress points and was based on the reasonably successful 1983 Williams FW08C. The engine cover had to be redesigned as the car was powered by a smaller, but more powerful () V6 engine rather than the Cosworth V8 that powered the FW08C. The front of the car was also redesigned giving the car cleaner aerodynamics. The FW09 was introduced at the South African Grand Prix, the last race of the 1983 season, which was nothing more than a shakedown exercise. Rosberg showed the potential of both car and engine by qualifying sixth and finishing in fifth place while team mate Jacques Laffite started 10th (after failing to qualify the old car at the previous European Grand Prix at Brands Hatch), but spun off under braking for Crowthorne Corner at the end of the long main straight on lap two, his car ending up in the tyre barrier and out of the race. ==1984== The car was then raced in the season by Rosberg and team mate Laffite. Both drivers found extra power of the engine to their liking, but not the chassis which suffered from the sudden bursts of power that the Honda gave, upsetting the balance of the car- and the engine power delivery was so abrupt that parts of the 1.5L Honda block were actually found to have twisted during the race. Furthermore, the car body was found to produce a lot of drag at high speeds. The problems with the 1984 chassis were noted by broadcaster Clive James, opining in FOCA's season review video that \\"Rosberg had managed to make the Williams look driveable, which everyone including Frank Williams knew it really wasn't\\".'Two Till The End' (1984) – VHS – EAN: 5017559030650 – Publisher: Duke Video – Studio: Formula One Constructors Association Keke Rosberg won the 1984 Dallas Grand Prix in a Williams FW09 Reliability was also a problem, with Laffite only recording five finishes during the whole season, but the basic speed was there with the Honda powered FW09 consistently among the fastest cars through the speeds traps on many tracks despite the car itself producing high drag. Indeed, both drivers recorded a top speed of in qualifying and the race at the 1984 South African Grand Prix (although it wasn't as fast as the Brabham-BMWs which recorded in qualifying). Rosberg had a more successful year than Laffite, managing to tame the car's unpredictable handling by winning the attrition-filled Dallas Grand Prix for his and the team's first win since the 1983 Monaco Grand Prix, and giving Honda its first Formula One Grand Prix win since John Surtees won the 1967 Italian Grand Prix at Monza and its first win with a turbo engine. A modified version of the car dubbed the FW09B was introduced in Round 10 of the season at Brands Hatch for the 1984 British Grand Prix. The car featured 'coke bottle' type sidepods pioneered by McLaren. Unfortunately from that race until the end of the season both Rosberg and Laffite only recorded one finish each and neither was in the points. Rosberg was 8th at the Dutch Grand Prix while Laffite ended the season in Portugal with a disappointing 14th place, following which the FW09 was retired. One particular incident that was more or less a summation of Williams's season was at the Austrian Grand Prix at the Österreichring – which was at the time the fastest circuit used by Formula One with average lap speeds as high as 150+ mph – Rosberg drove into the pits from 9th place and informed technical director Patrick Head that he was retiring the car from the race because it was dangerously unstable at the Österreichring's very fast sweepers and he feared he might have a massive accident – all too commonplace at such a fast circuit. The Finnish driver, who had amazing reflexes and had a flat-out driving style was not one to just quit out of fear, and Head, a hard-nosed character with little patience for losing, accepted Rosberg's decision wholeheartedly. Williams, which along with Ferrari and Brabham were one of the few race winners in a season dominated by McLaren drivers Niki Lauda and Alain Prost, finished sixth in the constructors' championship in 1984 having scored 25.5 points. The FW09 was retired following the 1984 season.

He served as the Maritime Administrator, the head of the U.S. Maritime Administration, an agency of the United States Department of Transportation, from 2006 until early 2009. Connaughton served as Chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors from January 1, 2000 until his appointment as Maritime Administrator. He is also a lawyer, unsuccessful 2005 Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, former United States Coast Guard officer, and a retired officer of the United States Naval Reserve. He was confirmed as Maritime Administrator by the Senate on August 3, 2006. President George W. Bush nominated Connaughton to serve as Commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission. Congress did not take up the nomination. He left federal service to work as the Corporate Vice President of Government Affairs for the American Bureau of Shipping. Connaughton became the Secretary of Transportation in the Cabinet of Governor Bob McDonnell in January 2010. ==Education== Connaughton is a 1979 graduate of Chaminade High School. He received a B.Sc. from the United States Merchant Marine Academy in 1983 and a law degree from George Mason University in 1992. Connaughton also has a Masters in Public Administration from Georgetown University and is a graduate of the Naval War College. ==Early career== Immediately upon graduation from the United States Merchant Marine Academy, Connaughton accepted a Commission as an Officer in the United States Coast Guard, remaining on Active Duty until 1986 when he joined the United States Naval Reserve. He became a civilian employee of the Coast Guard in the marine safety and environmental protection area. He then worked at the American Petroleum Institute during the Exxon Valdez calamity and went to law school at night. Connaughton entered private legal practice in 1992. His legal career is highlighted by his service as Co- counsel on the case Intertanko v. Locke, winning a unanimous decision before the United States Supreme Court ==Chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors== Connaughton was elected Chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors in November 1999, defeating the incumbent, Democrat Kathleen K. Seefeldt. He was re-elected to a second four-year term, beginning January 1, 2004. He resigned that position on September 6, 2006. The Washington Post characterized Connaghton as a \\"pragmatist\\" during his tenure. Connaughton capped the growth of all real estate taxes at 5.9%, despite double-digit growth in real estate value and the jurisdiction achieved a AAA Bond Rating. He also successfully campaigned to bring AOL, General Dynamics, Comcast, Eli Lilly and other major employers to Prince William. ==Maritime Administration== In September 2006, Connaughton assumed the helm of the Maritime Administration. He focused on laying the foundation for a marine highways system, greater opportunities for American mariners, and a reorganization of the agency to make it more effective are significant steps he's taken during his watch. During his tenure Connaughton was consistently cited as one of the best Federal transportation policy leaders by Members of Congress, industry and the media. Connaughton received several awards and recognitions for his service as Administrator, including: Vincent T. Hirsh Maritime Award for Outstanding Leadership by the Navy League of the United States (2009), \\"Maritime Person of the Year\\" by the Propeller Club of the United States (2007), \\"Maritime Samaritan Award\\" from the Apostleship of the Sea of the United States (2009) and \\"Government Man of the Year\\" by the Maritime Port Council of Greater New York (2007). Additionally, the Journal of Commerce named him to its 2008 \\"JOC Leadership Roll\\". Connaughton's service was also recognized by the Massachusetts Maritime Academy in 2007 through the awarding of an Honorary Doctorate in Public Administration. ==Virginia Secretary of Transportation== On December 22, 2009 Virginia Governor-elect Bob McDonnell announced Sean Connaughton as his appointment to Secretary of Transportation for the Commonwealth of Virginia. He was sworn into office on January 16, 2010. As Secretary, Connaughton oversees seven agencies with over 10,000 employees and combined budgets of more than $5 billion. After taking office, he initiated multiple audits of the Virginia Department of Transportation which identified more than $1.4B of misallocated funds that were then deployed to advance stalled projects. Connaughton led efforts to grow private investment in the Commonwealth's aging infrastructure system by establishing a new P3 Office, streamlining the Public-Private Transportation Act process and recognizing innovative financing opportunities. Under his leadership, a state investment of less than $600 million has been leveraged into over $3 billion worth of infrastructure, ranking Virginia #2 worldwide for P3 deals. He has overseen the creation of the Virginia Transportation Infrastructure Bank, providing a resource that public-and private-sector entities can use to finance projects and accelerate construction. Most critically, Connaughton is credited with enabling passage of Virginia's Road to the Future, the first comprehensive transportation funding bill approved in the Commonwealth in 27 years. His efforts secured a historic bipartisan compromise in the Virginia General Assembly, resulting in a tax reform package that boosted projected transportation revenues $7B over the next 6 years by diversifying the revenue base away from declining gas tax to greater reliance on sales tax funding. ==Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association== Since leaving government in 2014, Connaughton has been President and CEO of the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association in Richmond, Virginia. The Association has as its members all of Virginia's hospitals and health systems and represents them before the federal and state governments, as well as providing safety, quality, educational, population health and emergency preparedness services. Connaughton was instrumental in Virginia's passage of Medicaid expansion in 2018 and was a leader in Virginia's response and recovery to the COVID-19 pandemic. Connaughton is currently the Chair of the Board of Directors of the 9/11 Pentagon Memorial Fund and its drive to build a Visitor's Center for the 9/11 Pentagon Memorial. He is also Lifeguard Member at George Washington's Mount Vernon. ==References== Category:County supervisors in Virginia Category:Living people Category:United States Merchant Marine Academy alumni Category:George Mason University alumni Category:Virginia Republicans Category:State cabinet secretaries of Virginia Category:United States Department of Transportation officials Category:United States Coast Guard officers Category:People from Long Island Category:People from Prince William County, Virginia Category:1961 births ","title":"Sean Connaughton"},{"id":"19276752","text":"Mahat Gaun is a market center in Chandannath Municipality in Jumla District in the Karnali Zone of north-western Nepal.

It contains memorials to Scrope Howe, 1st Viscount Howe (died 1712), Emanuel Scrope Howe, 2nd Viscount Howe (died 1734), and Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe (died 1799). The North Transept contains monuments to the Chaworth family of nearby Wiverton Hall. In the South Transept is a magnificent monument to Thomas, Lord Scrope and his wife, Philadelphia, with their son, Emanuel, kneeling at their feet.

It was written by Roberto Casalino and Tiziano Ferro and co-produced by Fabrizio Giannini. The song was released as the singer's second single on 30 May 2008 in Italy, and peaked at number one in Italy, where it became one of the best-selling and most-downloaded singles of all the time and also reached the #1 in Greece, the top 30 on the sales charts in Switzerland and the top 20 position on a composite European Singles Chart. ==Background== \\"Non ti scordar mai di me\\" was originally written by Roberto Casalino several years ago, then Italian popstar Tiziano Ferro has collaborated on the melody when the song has been offered to Giusy Ferreri.http://www.tgcom.mediaset.it/spettacolo/articoli/articolo416292.shtml The song world-premiered on 27 May 2008 on the last episode of the first Italian edition of X Factor. A similarity of the song with \\"Back to Black\\", by English singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse, and \\"Coming Home\\" by the American band Alter Bridge has been noted.http://www.plagimusicali.net/archivio/altergiusy.mp3 ==Release== It has been made available on CD single and digital download, from 30 May 2008. From 27 June 2008 it has been included in the debut EP, Non ti scordar mai di me, together with five covers performed by the singer. The single has been included in the first official album Gaetana, too. == Music video == The music video for \\"Non ti scordar mai di me\\" was directed by Cosimo Alemà and entered the planning of the thematic channels from June 30, 2008. It shows the singer to interpret the passage sat on the angle of a bed. To these sequences are alternated other, in which the principal history of the video is told. In these sequences Ferreri has shown in the meticulous preparations of a romantic dinner. On the screen sometimes is shown the schedule in which the action develops. At 19.35 Ferreri chooses the suit to wear, at 20.18 it's everything ready but at 21.02 the guest is not introduced yet. The video continues showing Ferreri who becomes impatient, she waits up to midnight, then she eats greedily alone the prepared dinner, as long as 02.16 when the telephone rings. Nevertheless, he is not the man, but a friend of her. == Chart performance == The single debuted on the Italian Singles FIMI at #2 on 5 June 2008, contemporarily, \\"Remedios\\", another cover song by Ferreri, peaked at #7 only on digital downloads. The following week \\"Non ti scordar mai di me\\" peaked at #1, but next week it was knocked off by the song \\"Cry\\" by Italian band Novecento. However, it returned at #1 after a couple of weeks and it held the pole position for an astonishing total of 15 non-consecutive weeks, becoming one of the longest running number-one hit singles as well as one of the best- selling singles ever in FIMI charts' history. The song debuted at #39 on the Italian Downloads Chart, and the following week raised-up at #2. Then it stayed atop for 15 consecutive weeks. The single has been a huge broadcast success, reaching the top spot of the Nielsen Music Control chart, which controls the Italian broadcast circuit. ==Formats and track listingsCD single=== # \\"Non ti scordar mai di me\\" 3.31 # \\"Nunca te olvides de mì\\" (Spain only) 3.31 ==Charts== {  - ! style=\\"width:150px;\\"Chart (2008) !!

Most of the participants expressed a desire to belong to a professional society of marine surveyors who would have a different purpose and outlook than found in the existing professional organizations of the day. Among the participants were Jim Robbins of C.A. Hansen Corporation and Fred Lowe, formerly Instructor of Marine Surveying at the Chapman School of Seamanship, Stuart, Florida. Jim Robbins and Fred Lowe founded the Society of Accredited Marine Surveyors during the early part of 1987 and enlisted Michael Strocchi of Strocchi & Co. to join them on the original Board of Directors. A carefully chosen cadre of fifty (50) charter members was solicited to be the foundation of the organization. Over the next 18 months and three national meetings, the organization of SAMS was put into place. The Society headquarters was moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where it continues to provide services to its members. Accredited Marine Surveyors are expected to follow a course of continuing education to maintain their accreditation.

Ashley notes that it is actually an alternate arrangement of the multiple overhand noose. His diagram shows how the knot can be manipulated into the more familiar form. This knot is also called the Duncan loop, after Norman Duncan who developed it independently as a fishing knot in the early 1960s. The knot was popularized as the uni knot by Vic Dunaway, an editor at the Miami Herald, in a 1970 fishing book. Currently, in American English the knot is known as the Uni-knot referring to its ability to work with mono- filament or fluorocarbon fishing lines. However, in British English it is commonly known as the Grinner Knot. The Uni knot is used by popular television host, Jeremy Wade, on the Animal Planet TV series River Monsters. ==Use== The uni knot is widely used for attaching hooks, rings and swivels to the end of the line and it is also used for joining two fishing lines together. The bend form of the uni knot (for joining two lines) is not a noose; rather it is akin to a multiple fisherman's knot with the two opposing knotted parts arranged in the manner of uni knots. The uni knot retains much of the fishing line breaking strength and the uni knot works well with monofilament, fluorocarbon and braided fishing lines. ==See also== *List of knots ==References * Video instructions on how to tie a Uni Knot *Uni knot illustration Category:Fishing knots ","title":"Uni knot"},{"id":"19276921","text":"Charles West (born 1927), British crime novelist, is a former actor.

The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent players and elected three: Bill Dickey, Rabbit Maranville, and Bill Terry. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on August 9, 1954, with Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick presiding. ==BBWAA election== Any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Votes were cast for 53 players; a total of 252 ballots were cast, with 189 votes required for election. A total of 2,091 individual votes were cast, an average of 8.30 per ballot. The three candidates who received 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in italics. Players were eligible if they had finished their career between 1928 and 1952. Starting with this election, players had to have been retired from baseball (including no longer working as a manager) for a minimum of five seasons to be eligible, unless they had received at least 100 votes in the prior year's election—those who qualified under this clause were Joe DiMaggio and Ted Lyons. {  border=\\"1\\" - !

After her mother's death when she was 15, Farner was brought up by her elder sister. After leaving school, she worked as a governess in Scotland for eight years. == Public life == After nursing several family members through illness, she became disillusioned with her previous choice of career. Deciding instead on medicine, she first gained the necessary school-leaving certificate (teaching herself Latin and mathematics in record time) before entering Zurich University in 1871. In 1877 she completed her medical degree, only the second Swiss woman to do so, and continued her training in Vienna, Paris and Budapest before returning to Zurich to open a practice. During the thirty-six years it operated, the practice grew to be one of the biggest in the city and, despite offering free service to the poor, Farner had amassed a not insignificant fortune. Beyond the medical world, Farner put her considerable talent in public speaking to good use in the leading role she played in the Swiss women's movement. Under her leadership, the Swiss Worker's Union secured a placement centre for female domestic servants, a women's clinic and a sanatorium for women in Urnasch (in 1907 she donated this to the city of Zurich for use as a holiday camp). In 1892, Farner and her partner Anna Pfrunder were arrested for embezzling of 60000 Francs of ward money, an erroneous charge brought about by opponents of the women's movement scared of her success. Despite no evidence, Farner and Pfrunder were imprisoned for seven months in solitary confinement before eventual acquittal following a drawn-out investigation by one General Judge Wittelsbach. Their release garnered support for their cause from other women's movements Europe-wide and led to Meta von Salis-Marschlins in an editorial in the commemorative issue of Philanthropin calling for universal suffrage, as only this could prevent such an injustice happening again and “that women have to be employed in government, court, police, prison authorities, in short, wherever women’s interest are concerned.” Returning to work after the courtcase and she continued her practice until her death in 1913. Following the death of Pfrunder in 1925, their house was gifted to the Zurich section of the Lyceum Club. Furthermore, they established the Anna-Carolina Foundation to support female students, an organisation that continues to award scholarships to this day. Her life has also become the subject of a novel by Rosemarie Keller entitled Ich bereue nicht einen meiner Schritte. Leben und Prozess der Ärztin Caroline Farner (or I do not Regret Any of my Actions: the Life and Trial of Doctor Caroline Farner.) == Private life == Farner lived with Anna Pfrunder for thirty-two years, first in Pfrunder's parents' house and then, following friction, in a house of their own; the Villa Ehrenberg, Rämistrasse 26 in Zurich. Pfrunder brought her niece with her when she moved to Villa Ehrenberg and it was the prolonged legal battle to gain guardianship of her nephew as well that brought the couple to the attention of Judge Wittelsbach. In the end, the guardianship was refused on the grounds that \\"the office for orphans cannot have any faith that those two women can give the two children a proper upbringing\\" after Pfrunder \\"had estranged herself from her father and mother, both infirm and frail, to cuddle up with a strange person and to live with this person.\\" Despite the undoubted strains the many trials and the eventual imprisonment they suffered, the couple remained companions for life, still together when Farner died in 1913. == References == Category:1842 births Category:1913 deaths Category:Feminism and history Category:Swiss women physicians Category:Swiss feminists Category:20th-century Swiss physicians Category:19th-century Swiss physicians Category:20th-century women physicians Category:19th-century women physicians ","title":"Caroline Farner"},{"id":"19277123","text":"Three check valves in corrosion-resistant Hastelloy Haynes International, Inc., headquartered in Kokomo, Indiana, is one of the largest producers of corrosion-resistant and high-temperature alloys. In addition to Kokomo, Haynes has manufacturing facilities in Arcadia, Louisiana, and Mountain Home, North Carolina. The Kokomo facility specializes in flat products, the Arcadia facility in tubular products, and the Mountain Home facility in wire products. In fiscal year 2018, the company's revenues were derived from the aerospace (52.1%), chemical processing (18.2%), industrial gas turbine (12.0%) and other (12.3%) industries. The company's alloys are primarily marketed under the Hastelloy and the Haynes brands. They are based on nickel, but also include cobalt, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, iron, silicon, manganese, carbon, aluminum, and/or titanium. ==History== The company was founded by Elwood Haynes in 1912 in Kokomo, Indiana, as Haynes Stellite Works. Haynes had recently received a patent for a metal he created, which he named Stellite. In 1920, the company was acquired by Union Carbide. In 1922, the company invented its first alloy under the Hastelloy brand, derived from the words \\"Haynes Stellite Alloy\\". In 1927, Charles Lindberg's aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis, which included hard-surfaced engine valves manufactured by Haynes, crossed the Atlantic Ocean. In 1970, Cabot Corporation purchased the company. In 1989, the investment banking firm of Morgan, Lewis, Githens, and Ahn purchased the company. In 1997, the Blackstone Group purchased the company. The debt incurred ultimately forced Haynes into bankruptcy in March 2004, from which it emerged 5 months later in August 2004. In 1999, the company opened an office in Singapore, its first sales office in Asia. In 2004, the company acquired Branford Wire & Manufacturing of Mountain Home, North Carolina. In March 2007, Haynes became a public company via an initial public offering. The space shuttle program, which ended in 2011, used total of 47 parts made from Haynes 188 alloy and 7 from Haynes' Hastelloy B alloy in its engines. Hastelloy C-22 alloy was used for the fuel line bellows that assisted in achieving takeoff. In 2015, the company acquired Leveltek Processing. In 2016, the company expanded its operations in LaPorte, Indiana. The expansion created 52 jobs. In 2018, chairman Michael Shor became President and chief executive officer of the company. ==References Category:1912 establishments in Indiana Category:Manufacturing companies based in Indiana Category:Companies based in Kokomo, Indiana Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1912 Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ Category:Metal companies of the United States Category:Nickel alloys Category:Superalloys Category:Refractory metals Category:Cobalt alloys Category:Chromium alloys Category:2007 initial public offerings ","title":"Haynes International"},{"id":"19277132","text":"James West James West PRS (2 May 1703 – 2 July 1772) was a British politician and antiquary, who served as President of the Royal Society between 1768 and 1772. ==Life and career== He was the only son of Richard West of Priors Marston, Warwickshire and St. Swithin's, London and educated at Balliol College, Oxford (1719). He then entered the Inner Temple to study law and was called to the bar in 1728 and made a bencher in 1761. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1727, and acted as the society's treasurer from 1736 to 1768. He served as President of the Royal Society from 1768 until his death in 1772. He was elected as MP for St Albans at the 1741 general election. In 1768 he became the member for Boroughbridge, Yorkshire which he served until 1772. West served twice as junior Secretary to the Treasury and twice as senior Secretary to the Treasury. ==Family== Alscot Park, Preston-on-Stour He married Sarah, the daughter of Sir Thomas Steavens, a wealthy timber merchant of Eltham, Kent. They lived in the Piazza in Covent Garden and bought Alscot Park, then in Gloucestershire but now in Warwickshire, as a country retreat to which he could retire. He replaced the old house with the present one built in a Rococo Gothic style and moved in c.1762. James West the younger, the only son of West and Sarah Steavens, died in 1795, predeceasing his mother. Alscot Park thereby passed to James West the younger's son, James Robert West (died 1838). ==References== * Category:1703 births Category:1772 deaths Category:Alumni of Balliol College, Oxford Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Members of the Inner Temple Category:Presidents of the Royal Society Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1741–1747 Category:British MPs 1747–1754 Category:British MPs 1754–1761 Category:British MPs 1761–1768 Category:British MPs 1768–1774 ","title":"James West (antiquary)"},{"id":"19277138","text":"Colombia is divided into 32 departments.

He published his first book, Emergence from Chaos, in 1957 at the age of twenty-three. The same publisher, Victor Gollancz, had recently published The Outsider, the first book by Holroyd's friend Colin Wilson. Wilson and Holroyd, along with the novelist Bill Hopkins, were associated with the literary movement known as the Angry Young Men. In the same year, Holroyd, Wilson and Hopkins each contributed an essay to Declaration - an anthology of statements by writers and artists then labelled, rightly or wrongly, as Angry Young Men (the contributors included not only John Osborne and Kingsley Amis but Doris Lessing and the director Lindsay Anderson). On 9 March 1958, Holroyd's play, The Tenth Chance was produced at the Royal Court Theatre; disturbances in the audience during the single performance, and a subsequent confrontation in a nearby public house involving Kenneth Tynan, Christopher Logue and Colin Wilson were widely reported.\\"Sloane Square Stomp\\", Time, Monday, 24 March 1958 Emergence from Chaos was a literary/psychological study of several modern poets. Holroyd's next book, Flight and Pursuit (1959) was an autobiographical examination of the author's search for \\"spiritual values\\". In 1961, Holroyd married Susan Joy Bennett. (He was earlier married to Anne Elizabeth Freeman, they married in 1950 and divorced in 1958.)

Critic Raymond L. Williams has explained that Fuentes modelled the tripartite structure of Terra Nostra on that of the Escorial, where Philip consciously set out to create a world apart. The novel makes the architecture a metaphor for Spain's imperial stance towards the New World.Raymond L.

In one scene the book's protagonist - a young Englishman who through mischance finds himself involved in the Spanish invasion fleet - is taken to the Royal Palace in Madrid and meets with a man sitting writing at a modest desk. First considering him a minor clerk, the protagonist discovers that he is in the presence the hard- working, frugal King in person. ==Film and television== *Sam De Grasse in In the Palace of the King (1923) **Raymond Massey in Fire Over England (1937); Breaking with British artistic tradition, the portrayal of the former English co-monarch is not entirely unsympathetic. He is shown as a very hard working, intelligent, religious, somewhat paranoid ruler whose prime concern is his country. As he orders the Armada to sail to its doom he admits to having no understanding of the English. *Montagu Love in The Sea Hawk (1940) *Paul Scofield in That Lady (1955) *Günther Ballier in The Mayor of Zalamea (1956) *Fernando Rey in El Greco (1966) and Cervantes (1967) *Peter Jeffrey in Elizabeth R (1971) *George Yiasoumi in Elizabeth (1998) *Jordi Mollá in Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007) *Juanjo Puigcorbé in La Conjura de El Escorial (2008) *Mathew Baynton in Horrible Histories (2011–12) *Ben Willbond in Bill (2015) *Marcel Borràs and Pablo Arbués in Carlos, rey emperador (2015–16) *Carlos Hipólito in El ministerio del tiempo (2016) ==Theater== *Philip's marriage to his third wife Elisabeth of Valois and problems with his first son Carlos, Prince of Asturias, may be alluded to in Lope de Vega's 1631 drama Castigo sin venganza (Punishment without Revenge). In the view of the play's translator and editor Gwynne Edwards: \\"The relationship in the play between Casandra, the Duke's wife, and his son Federico was not unlike that between Prince Carlos, son of Philip II, and Isabel [Elisabeth] who became Philip's wife and Carlos's stepmother\\"; Edwards argues that these events were recent enough to have embarrassed the court of Philip IV and may have been a reason for the play's withdrawal after one performance.Gwynne Edwards, Introduction to Three Major Plays by Lope de Vega, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008, , pp. xxv–vi. *Vittorio Alfieri Filippo.

It portrays the King as an anxious, jealous, loveless hypocrite who rationalizes his bloody atrocities, pretends to be powerful but is controlled by the Inquisition, and is dangerous to his family, his friends, and almost everyone else.http://operawire.com/on-this-day-verdis-don-carlo-as-a-world-of-failures/ ==Poem== *In his 1915 poem Lepanto, the Catholic G. K. Chesterton commemorated the response of Philip and his brother Don John of Austria to the Ottoman Turks, which climaxed in the Christian victory at the Battle of Lepanto (1571). Chesterton's poem was conceived as \\"a call to Christians to take action against the modern forces of unbelief\\".Arnold Sparr, To Promote, Defend, and Redeem: The Catholic Literary Revival and the Cultural Transformation of American Catholicism, 1920–1960, Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1990, , p. 75. It contrasts King Philip, occupied with alchemy in his chamber at home in Spain, with Don John's activities at sea: > King Philip's in his closet with the Fleece about his neck (Don John of > Austria is armed upon the deck.)

By Juan Pantoja de la Cruz, 1590–98 #In this portrait, Philip is wearing the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece and dressed in black armour similar to that made for him by Desiderius Colman of Augsburg, with gold damask work by Jorg Sigman, now in the Real Armería de Madrid. The Valencian Alonso Sánchez Coello (1531/2–1588) was a pupil of Antonis Mor (1517–1574) and a favourite painter of Philip.M. J. Rodríguez-Salgado, Armada: 1599–1988, London: Penguin/National Maritime Museum, 1988, , pp. 88–90. #This bronze is believed to have first been cast in 1551. Giorgio Vasari notes that the Milan- based Leone Leoni (1509–1590) also made heads of Philip and of Charles V.Rodríguez-Salgado, p. 47. His son Pompeo Leoni (c. 1533–1608) produced a bust of Philip, c. 1556, painted silver,Stefano Zuffi, European Art of the Sixteenth Century, Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum, 2006, , p. 171. and later worked on the royal chapel at Phlip's palace of El Escorial.Anne Sutherland Harris, Seventeenth-century Art and Architecture, London: Laurence King, 2005, , p. 197. #As he grew into middle age, the pious Philip favoured an austere style of dress for himself and his court. He is depicted here, as usual, wearing the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece, and he holds a rosary. The painting has traditionally been identified as by Sánchez Coello because of the stylistic similarity with his portrait of Anne of Austria. More recently, however, it has been attributed to Sofonisba Anguissola, the artist from Cremona who served as lady-in-waiting to Philip's third wife, Elisabeth of Valois, and painted the royal family, often working closely with Sánchez Coello.Rodríguez-Salgado, p. 92. #Sánchez Coello’s successor as royal painter was his pupil Juan Pantoja de la Cruz (1553–1608), who painted this portrait of Philip in old age and went on to serve under Philip's son Philip III. In 1593, the Venetian ambassador Contarini reported that problems of debt, famine, and the succession \\"trouble the king's spirit and do much harm to his appearance\\". As described by the historian Henry Kamen, Pantoja de la Cruz’s portrait \\"reflects perfectly the wastage of the years. Philip stands erect, dressed from tip to toe in black, with the Fleece as his only ornament. His face is ashen white, the same colour as his beard and hair. The lips sag. His eyes now … are weary, the lids half-closed\\".Henry Kamen, Philip of Spain, New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1998, , p. 300. In the view of the art historian Jonathan Brown, Pantoja de la Cruz continued the style of Sánchez Coello but added the influence of Flemish painters, particularly of Rubens, resulting in a freer technique and greater psychological penetration.Jonathan Brown, Painting in Spain, 1500–1700, New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, , p. 85. ===Allegories=== Image:Family of Henry VIII, an Allegory of the Tudor Succession.png1.

The Milch Cow, by an unknown artist, c. 1583 #Mixing portraiture and allegory, this Elizabethan painting shows Henry VIII of England and his three children alongside figures from mythology. Henry died in 1547, but his daughter Mary is shown on the left of the painting next to her husband, Philip, whom she did not marry until 1554 when she was queen. Mars, god of war, looming behind the couple, symbolises their wars. Owing to a similarity of style and composition with Lucas de Heere's Solomon and the Queen of Sheba (1559) and other works, the art historian Roy Strong has attributed the work to de Heere (1534–1584). The art scholar and curator Karen Hearn, however, regards the attribution as speculative. Another source for the composition may be the group portrait The Family of Henry VIII (c. 1545). Prototypes for the figures of Philip and Mary are found in the portraits of Anthonis Mor.Karen Hearn, Dynasties, London: Tate, 1995, , pp. 81–82. #Titian’s allegorical canvas, painted in the artist's nineties when he had not seen Philip for many years, celebrates both the victory of the Holy League over the Ottoman Turks at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 and the birth shortly afterwards of a male heir to Philip, Don Fernando. The two events were seen as signs of God's favour. The battle is shown in the background, and a bound and defeated Turk slumps at Philip's feet. The king holds Fernando up to an angel, to receive a palm branch with the motto: \\"Majora tibi\\" (may you achieve greater deeds). A favourite artist of King Philip, Titian died in 1576, and Prince Fernando followed in 1578. Lepanto effectively ended Ottoman ambitions in the western Mediterranean.Robert Enggass and Jonathan Brown, Italian and Spanish Art, 1600–1750: Sources and Documents, Evanston: IL: Northwestern University Press, 1992, , p. 213. #El Greco may have painted The Adoration of the Name of Jesus in an attempt to win favour with King Philip, but he never achieved that aim. The subject is based on a text in Paul but may also be read as an allegory of the Holy League's victory over the Ottoman fleet at Lepanto in 1571. The black-clad figure in the foreground is identifiable as King Philip; the man in the yellow robe as a doge of Venice; the old man opposite him as the pope; and the figure on the left as Philip's brother John of Austria, the commander of the Christian fleet. In the heavens shines a monogram formed from IHS, the first three letters of the name Jesus in Greek—also In Hoc Signo and Jesus Hominum Salvator. A larger version of the painting, a votive altarpiece called The Dream of Philip II, is in the Escorial, Spain.Michael Scholz-Hansel, El Greco: Domenikos Theotokopoulos, 1541–1614, Cologne: Taschen, 2004, , p. 25; Donald Bruce, \\"Illuminated Gospels 'Seeing Salvation' At The National Gallery\\", Contemporary Review, April 2000. #The Milch Cow was probably completed in the period following the visit to Queen Elizabeth's court in 1581–1582 of François, Duke of Anjou, brother of King Henry III of France, to discuss his marriage proposal and military support for the Anglo-Dutch alliance against the Spanish. Anjou's subsequent mission to the Netherlands met with disaster when the citizens of Antwerp massacred his army in early 1583. This satirical cartoon, one of several painted versions of the joke, depicts a cow which represents the Dutch provinces: King Philip is vainly trying to ride the cow; Queen Elizabeth is feeding it; William of Orange is milking it; and the cow is shitting on the hand of the Duke of Anjou, who is holding its tail. The caption reads: > Not longe time since I sawe a cowe Did Flaunders represente Upon whose backe > King Philup rode As being malecontnt. The Queene of England giving hay > Wheareon the cow did feede, As one that was her greatest helpe In her > distresse and neede. The Prince of Orange milkt the cowe And made his purse > the payle.

In 1824, My Duong, the eldest son of Prince Canh, was apparently accused of incest with his mother (Prince Canh's widow) by mandarin Lê Văn Duyệt, with the result that he was banished from the royal court, while his mother died in prison.

Le Trung's eldest son was Anh Nhu (also known as Tang Nhu), who was considered as a candidate to the throne under French rule, following the establishment of the protectorate on Annam in 1884, and once again after the death of Đồng Khánh in 1889. Anh Nhu, grand-grandson of Prince Canh, was the father of Cường Để, the eldest son of three, who became a well-known independentist and collaborator with the Japanese during World War II.

Congress then passed the Trade Mark Act of 1881, which was based on the Commerce Clause power, and therefore passed constitutional muster. The three cases were United States v. Steffens, United States v. Wittemann, and United States v. Johnson. Steffens and Wittemann dealt with alleged counterfeiting of marks associated with champagne, while Johnson dealt with alleged counterfeiting of a mark associated with whiskey. The opinion was written by Justice Samuel Freeman Miller. The Court did not exclude all possibility of Congress regulating trademarks. Congress, however, read the decision very strictly and in a new trademark law enacted in 1881 regulated only trademarks used in commerce with foreign nations, and with the Indian tribes, areas specified under the Commerce Clause. It was not until 1905 that Congress would again enact a trademark law generally governing marks in use in the United States, though the 1905 act was also carefully worded to fall within the Commerce Clause. ==ReferencesCategory:1879 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Waite Court Category:Criminal cases in the Waite Court Category:Copyright Clause case law Category:United States trademark case law Category:Unanimous votes of the United States Supreme Court ","title":"Trade-Mark Cases"},{"id":"19277487","text":"The Victoria County Station was a proposed nuclear power plant, in Victoria County, 13.3 miles south of Victoria, Texas.

The organization's funding was eliminated as part of the 2012 Canadian federal budget and NAHO ceased operations on June 30, 2012. Incorporated in 2000, NAHO received core funding from Health Canada to undertake knowledge-based activities such as education, research and knowledge dissemination. With Aboriginal communities as its primary focus, NAHO used both traditional Aboriginal and contemporary Western healing and wellness approaches. NAHO defined \\"Aboriginal Peoples\\" using the Canadian Constitution Act, 1982, sections 25 and 35, to consist of three groups – Indian (First Nations), Inuit, and Métis. Its main objectives were to improve and promote Aboriginal health, understanding of health issues affecting Aboriginal Peoples and research, foster participation of Aboriginal Peoples in delivery of health care, and affirm and protect Aboriginal traditional healing practices. == Structure == NAHO was governed by a Board of Directors made up of 13 directors, 8 of which were appointed by: Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Métis National Council, and Native Women's Association of Canada. An additional five board members were elected by the 10 appointed board members. NAHO was subdivided into three centres - the First Nations Centre, the Inuit Tuttarvingat (formerly known as the Ajunnginiq Centre), and the Métis Centre. They advanced health and well-being by focusing on the distinct needs of their respective populations and promoting culturally relevant approaches to health care. == Activities == NAHO had a number of projects that addressed Aboriginal health care issues including suicide prevention, healthy living, midwifery, and traditional health and healing.

The parish includes the villages of Manningford Abbots, Manningford Bohune and Manningford Bruce, and the hamlet of Manningford Bohune Common, together known as the Manningfords. The parish is in the Vale of Pewsey which carries the upper section of the Salisbury Avon. Pewsey is about to the northeast; the nearest towns are Marlborough, northeast, and Devizes, to the west. The parish is long and narrow in shape, stretching from the Salisbury Avon valley in the northwest to higher downland towards Upavon, on the northern edge of Salisbury Plain. The A345 Pewsey–Upavon road passes to the south of the three villages. ==HistoryManningford Abbots or Abbas=== The eastern third of the parish, so-called from its ownership by the Abbot of Hyde Abbey, Winchester. The Abbot held it, together with the chapelry at Alton Priors, until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. In 1547 it went to the Seymour family (Dukes of Somerset and then Northumberland) until it was split up in 1768. In 1428 there were fewer than ten households; by 1801 the population rose to 131, and to 165 by 1831. In 1931, shortly before Manningford Abbots was amalgamated with the other two parishes, the population was 121. ===Manningford Bohune=== The western third of the parish, held by Amelric de Drewes in 1086. The name is from Humphrey de Bohun in the 12th century (related to the Bohun Earls of Hereford). Formerly a detached tithing of Wilsford parish, lying about east of Wilsford village. In 1801 the population of the tithing was 163, rising to 283 in 1841. Wilsford and Manningford Bohune became separate civil parishes in 1871. The northwestern boundary of the tithing was the Woodborough stream, a tributary of the Avon; thus Bottlesford hamlet was within Manningford Bohune. At some point after 1971,VCH Wilsford has Bottlesford in Manningford Bohune; current boundaries from Ordnance Survey Election Maps boundary changes moved Bottlesford into North Newnton parish and transferred land north of the railway into Woodborough parish. ===Manningford Bruce=== The central third of the parish, held by Grimbald the Goldsmith in 1086, named after the Norman William de Breuse in 1275. The site of a Roman villa is near the church. The population was 213 in 1801, increasing to 275 in 1851, then declining to reach 194 in 1931. A small schoolroom was built c. 1841 in the south of the village; in 1881 around 80 pupils attended, including children from Abbots. Numbers declined in the 1970s and the school closed in 1977. == Swanborough Tump == Markers near Swanborough Tump The ancient parishes of Abbots and Bruce, and possibly Bohune, were within Swanborough Hundred. One of the hundred's meeting-places was Swanborough Tump, a low earthwork in the north of Abbots parish, near the boundary with Wilcot. The site, now a scheduled monument, is described in the Victoria County History as a bowl barrow but more recently by Historic England as a medieval construction. The tump was on an important east-west road. In the 20th century a stone with plaques was erected at the roadside near the tump, next to an unidentified older stone. == Religious sites  Parish church === Church of St Peter, Manningford Bruce The parish church of Saint Peter at Manningford Bruce was described by Pevsner as \\"a very completely preserved Norman church\\". The aisleless nave and the chancel are from the late 11th or early 12th centuries and are built in flint laid in a herringbone pattern. There are three windows from the 12th century, and the chancel arch has Norman carving. Two windows were added in the 15th century. Careful restoration by J.L. Pearson in 1882 included reroofing and the rebuilding of the bell-turret and south porch. Two stained glass windows were added, made by Clayton and Bell, who also painted the reredos. The building was designated as Grade I listed in 1964. The benefice was united with Manningford Abbots in 1924, together with the southern part of the benefice of Manningford Bohune, to form the parish of Manningford Bruce and Abbots. The benefice was held in plurality with Everleigh from 1967, and in 1975 became part of a team ministry which today covers a wide area in the Pewsey Vale. The former rectory, now known as Manningford Bruce House, is from the 18th century and has fragments of an earlier building. === Chapel === Providence Chapel was built by Baptists on the main road at Manningford Bohune, and carries a date of 1869. The chapel continues in use. === Former churches === There was probably a parish church at Manningford Abbots in the 10th century and certainly one in 1291; its dedication is unknown. The church was rebuilt in 1861–64 to designs by the architect S.B. Gabriel of Bristol.Pevsner & Cherry, 1975, page 330 It was declared redundant in 1984. The rectory was a 17th-century timber-framed building, which from 1812 was encased in red brick and enlarged, with a five-bay facade; the house was sold in the 1920s after the union with Manningford Bruce. Manningford Bohune was anciently a detached tithing of Wilsford. The Church of All Saints was built in 1859 to designs by the architect Whitley C. Clacy. It was declared redundant in 1973. ==Local government== The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. Until 1934 there were three parishes: Manningford Abbots, Bruce and Bohune. == Railway == The Berks and Hants Extension Railway from Hungerford to Pewsey and Devizes was built across the north of the parish and opened in 1862. Manningford Halt was opened in 1932, near the bridge carrying the road to Wilcot; it closed in 1966 when local services on the line were withdrawn. ==Notable people== *Dr Robin Baker, author and broadcaster, lived in Manningford Bruce 1944–1962 *J.

It had representatives in the Maltese Legislative Assembly and Council of Government between 1921 and 1945, and again between 1950 and 1953, forming a government between 1927 and 1930 with the support of the Labour Party. A splinter group, the Progressive Constitutionalist Party was represented in Parliament between 1962 and 1966. The party was very much centred on the figure (and wealth) of its long-time leader Lord Strickland, with party supporters colloquially known in Maltese as \\"Stricklandjani\\". ==HistoryFoundation=== The Party was formed in 1921, in time for the first elections to the Legislative Assembly. It was a merger of Strickland's Anglo-Maltese Party and the Maltese Constitutional Party of Augusto Bartolo, editor of the Malta Chronicle. The predecessor parties had only recently been founded and the choice to merge was strategic: they were both pro-British and, united, they stood a better chance against the Nationalists. Despite this, the merger still came as a surprise as there were some personality difference. Strickland had been Principal Government Secretary who had become unpopular for raising taxes through Orders in Council, something of which Bartolo was highly critical. It was rumoured that Strickland threatened Bartolo that he would use his personal wealth to create a paper that would kill off the Chronicle if the merger did not come about. Strickland was to make the threat true years later with the creation of Progress Press and the publication of the dailies Il-Berqa (in Maltese) and the Times of Malta which did, eventually, kill off the Chronicle. ===Early years=== The party did surprisingly well in the first elections, considering that everyone thought that Strickland's previous unpopularity would harm his chances. In the elections to the Legislative Assembly it obtained 25.31% of the first preference votes, and won 7 of the 32 seats. Strickland was appointed Leader of the Opposition. While still remaining in opposition, the party made considerable gains in the 1924 elections, winning 33.95% of the vote and 10 seats, emerging as the joint-largest party with the Maltese Political Union which, until then, had been the largest party in the Assembly. The party also won two of the four seats in Gozo, which was considered an incredible feat. With the coalition between the Maltese Political Union and the Democratic Nationalist Party and their eventual merger into the Nationalist Party, some sort of rapprochement between the Constitutionals and Labour, the other party in the Assembly, was inevitable. The parties agreed to an electoral alliance known as the \\"Compact\\" for the 1927 elections. Labour's and the Constitutional's similar stances on various policy-areas (such as public education) made this alliance more workable. ===In government=== Voting document for the cancelled 1930 elections in Malta The Party obtained a relative majority of 15 seats out of 32 in the 1927 elections. Labour was invited to participate in a coalition. The offer was declined but, in terms of the \\"Compact\\" agreement, the three Labour MPs supported the government giving it a majority. The government, however, lacked a majority in the Senate which, at the time, could still reject money bills. After a protracted battle, Letters Patent were issued, amending the Constitution, so that bills could be carried by a simple majority of both Houses combined. The other major battle of this government was with the Church. There had been a long buildup to the crisis. The Church was perceived as being sympathetic to the Nationalist Party and the Progress Press papers lost no opportunity in condemning the behaviour of priests particularly in Gozo. A trivial incident led to things boiling over. The government decided to intervene when a superior at the Franciscan convent in Valletta (who happened to be an Italian by the name of Padre Carta) decided to send to Italy Rev. Micallef, a Maltese priest under his responsibility. Strickland's papers alleged that this amounted to exile of a Maltese and was due to Micallef's pro-Strickland sympathies. In the feast of Christ the King of 1930 the Bishop's sermon (in Italian) was interrupted by Labour and Constitutional supporters who clamoured for Maltese. This was a signal and outside St John's Co-Cathedral pro- and anti-Church crowds verbally confronted each other. Tensions rose as the different factions shouted \\"Viva Calles!\\" and \\"Viva Kristu Re!\\" in reference to the contemporary anti-clerical policies of Plutarco Calles and the resistance put up by the Cristeros in Mexico. On 1 May 1930, as the elections approached, Bishops Dom Mauro Caruana and Mikiel Gonzi issued a pastoral letter imposing mortal sin and an interdict on voters of the Constitutional Party and its allies (taken to refer to Labour). This gave the pretext to the colonial authorities to claim that a free and fair election was not possible in the circumstances and, therefore, to suspend the constitution. Strickland and his ministers were held on as a caretaker government. ===In opposition=== The suspension of the Constitution was to last three years. During this time a Royal Commission visited Malta and interviewed the parties concerned. In its final report the Commission sharply rebuked Strickland, and recommended some changes to ameliorate Church-State relations. The scene was set for elections in 1932. Technically, the prohibition for Catholics to vote Constitutional and Labour was still in place. Only on the eve of the election did Strickland ask for forgiveness and, although this was granted and the interdict lifted, it was too late to have much impact on the electoral result. The Constitutional Party gained 10 seats out of 32 (down from 15); its ally, the Labour Party, managed to elect only its leader Paul Boffa. Strickland was sworn in as Leader of the Opposition. The Nationalists' stint in government was to be short lived. The following year, the constitution was again suspended when the government in its financial estimates increased funding for the teaching of Italian. With Mussolini's growing ambitions in the Mediterranean the Colonial authorities saw this as a threat on the domestic front and dismissed the government. Strickland argued that, as leader of the second largest party in the Assembly, he was supposed to be summoned and requested to try to form a government. The matter was the subject of a lengthy legal case which went all the way to the Privy Council. Strickland's plea was not upheld. ===Council of Government=== A constitution was given in 1936 which created a Council of Government of which less than half were elected representatives. The first election under this constitution was held in 1939. With a strong pro-imperial and pro-British sentiment prevailing, the Constitutional Party elected six councillors to the Nationalists' three and Labour's one. Strickland died in 1940 to be succeeded as Party leader by Robert Galea. ===Post-War=== The Constitutional Party did not contest the 1945 elections, and the following year it was dissolved.Vincent E McHale (1983) Political parties of Europe, Greenwood Press, p.631, In 1950 it was resurrected by Galea and Mabel Strickland. In the 1950 elections it ran on a platform opposing tax rises and accusing Labour of being infiltrated by Communists. It won four seats, which it retained in the elections the following year. However, Mabel Strickland had to resign after her the publishing company won a major government contract. Strickland was also at odds with the other Party MPs who, in the emerging Two-party system, tended to side with Labour leader Mintoff. Mabel Strickland went on to form the splinter Progressive Constitutionalist Party but neither party gained seats in the general election of 1953. After this defeat the Constitutional Party was dissolved. ==Electoral results== { class= style=\\"text- align: left;\\" - ! Election ! Leader ! Votes ! % ! Seats ! +/– ! Position !

It is undertaken for a variety of reasons that include environmental rehabilitation, structural weakness and maintenance expense. All dams negatively affect the aquatic environments of rivers that they are located on, but those effects are often negated by the stated purpose of the dam, whether it is hydroelectric power, flood control, or other functions. When the negative environmental effects outweigh the benefits, a dam may be considered for removal. This happened on the Elwha River in Olympic National Park in Washington when extraordinarily rich salmon habitat was being disrupted by an out-dated hydroelectric plant. Before dams were built on the Elwha River, 400,000 salmon returned each year to spawn, but that number dropped to fewer than 3,000 after dams were put up. Once the hydroelectric power generating capacities of the dams had outlived their useful lives, the importance of this salmon habitat necessitated the removal of the dams on the Elwha River. Dam failure is another threat that can lead to the removal of dams. Sometimes the fear of failure is due to seismic activity or the placement of the dam. Additionally, the older the dam is, the more likely it is to fail. Around the world, a growing number of 20th-century dam construction projects are reaching the end of their design lives: as of 1996, 5,000 large dams around the world were more than 50 years old. By 2020, in the United States alone, 85% percent of the country's dams will have exceeded that 50 year threshold. Finally, economic reasons often provide a convincing reason to remove a dam. The cost of keeping outdated hydroelectric equipment running decades after it was installed or upgrading dam safety systems may not be worth it. Additionally, population centers and industrial facilities that demanded hydropower decades ago can move and leave the dam without a purpose. Since around 2000, most major dam removal projects, and the largest single project, the $350M removal of two Olympic Peninsula dams as part of the Elwha Ecosystem Restoration, have been driven by restoration of river habitat and fish passages. Inspired by the Elwha project, a French group called SOS Loire Vivante successfully lobbied for the removal of two dams in the Upper Loire Valley, and the re-engineering of a 1941 hydroelectric dam on the Allier River to restore habitat for Atlantic salmon. In the United States roughly 900 dams were removed between 1990 and 2015, with another 50 to 60 more every year. France and Canada have also completed significant removal projects, and Japan's first removal, of the Arase Dam on the Kuma River, began in 2012 and is scheduled to complete in 2018. ==Purposes and effects of dams== Grand Coulee Dam, Columbia River, Washington, United States Many of the dams in the eastern United States were built for water diversion, agriculture, factory watermills, and other purposes that are no longer seen as useful. Because of the age of these dams, over time the risk for catastrophic failure increases. In addition, many of these dams block anadromous fish runs, such as Atlantic salmon and American shad, and prevent important sediments from reaching estuaries. Many dams in the western United States were built for agricultural water diversion in the arid country, with hydroelectric power generation being a very significant side benefit. Among the largest of these water diversion projects is the Columbia Basin Project, which diverts water at the Grand Coulee Dam. The Bureau of Reclamation manages many of these water diversion projects. Some dams in the Pacific Northwest and California block passage for anadromous fish species such as Pacific Salmon and steelhead. Fish ladders and other passage facilities have been largely ineffective in mitigating the negative effects on salmon populations. Bonneville Power Administration manages electricity on 11 dams on the Columbia River and 4 on the Snake River, which were built by the Army Corps of Engineers. Clear water below Glen Canyon Dam, Arizona, United States In the Desert Southwest, dams can change the nature of the river ecosystem. In the particular case of the Glen Canyon Dam, the originally warm, sediment-filled, muddy water, instead runs cold and clear through the Grand Canyon, which has significant impacts on the downstream ecosystems. Three native fish species have become extinct in the Grand Canyon and others are endangered since the dam was completed, including humpback chub and razorback sucker. Some dam projects, such as those on the Salt River Project in Arizona, eliminate the flow of the river downstream, by diverting the flow into the Arizona Canal system for use in agriculture and urban usage, such that only a dry channel or arroyo heads out across the desert. So much water is taken out of the Colorado River for agriculture, urban use, and evaporation behind the dams, that the river no longer flows into the Gulf of California. == Methods of removal == There are several ways dams can be removed and the chosen method will depend on many factors. The size and type of the dam, the amount of sediment behind the dam, the aquatic environment below the dam, who owns the dam and what their priorities are, and the timeframe of dam removal are all factors that affect how the dam will be removed. Removal is costly no matter what and expenses typically rise when greater weight is given to environmental concerns. Fortunately, the cost of dam removal is usually shared by multiple stakeholders such as the dam owner and either the federal, state or local government. Four of the most common dam removal methods are described below. Sediment management is a driving force in all of them. A common problem for dams is how sediment carried naturally by the river is deposited in the reservoir and eventually fills it up with silt. This excess sediment reduces the hydroelectric generating capacity of a reservoir, changes the river channel downstream, traps nutrient-rich sediment behind the dam, and can put a dangerous amount of pressure on the dam itself. Oftentimes the sediment stored in a reservoir is good for the riparian corridor below the dam, can rebuild fish habitat, provide nutrients, and add onto a beach or estuary. Other times, the sediment can increase the turbidity of the river harming fish, scour the landscape, and bury infrastructure. Here five notches can be seen at the Glines Canyon Dam as it was removed in a multi-year process. Sediment can be tested before it is released to determine if it will be harmful to the landscape below the dam. Dam removal can have adverse consequences if this is not done. For example, when the Fort Edward Dam on the Hudson River was removed in the 1970s, PCBs in the sediment were released, affecting human and wildlife health downstream. === Notch and release approach === The notch and release approach is commonly used because of its ecological benefits. It is a slow method in which the reservoir is drained through notches cut into the dam. New notches are cut in so the water drains out of the reservoir at a consistent flow. The sediment trapped behind the dam flows downstream in a fixed rate that allows the ecosystem to adjust to the changes. This method can take months or even over a year but has proven success with restoring fish species to rivers. The Elwha and Glines Canyon dam removal project used the notch and release approach to great success. === Rapid release approach === The rapid release approach is both the quickest and least expensive way to remove a dam, but comes with significant drawbacks. In this approach, a large tunnel is dug through the base of the dam and then connected to the reservoir. The entire body of water will drain through this tunnel in a matter of minutes or hours and the massive release of water and sediment can cause severe flooding and erosion along the river downstream for miles. This can devastate the riparian ecosystem along the river as well as dangerously scour bridge pilings, buried pipes, levees, and other infrastructure. However, if the reservoir held back by the dam is relatively small and quickly drains into a larger river or lake, this approach can be carried out with minimal impact on either the ecosystem or human infrastructure. === Dig and dewater approach === The dig and dewater approach is typically the most expensive dam removal method, but is necessary in some cases. It entails emptying the entire reservoir, allowing the sediment to dry, and then transporting it to a safe location for disposal. It is costly and slow, but if the reservoir is located very near hydroelectric generating facilities that would be greatly impacted by released sediments, it may be necessary. Another situation is if the sediments behind the dam contain toxins. Hauling them away and disposing of them safely is important for the ecological health of the river. === Retained sediment approach === The retained sediment approach is the final commonly used approach and involves leaving the sediment behind where it is. To do this, the river or creek must be rerouted around the damsite which can prove expensive and challenging. This may be carried out in places where the dig and dewater approach makes sense, but are too remote to be cost-effective. == Alternatives to removal == Fish ladder at John Day Dam on the Columbia River. While fewer than 1% of United States dams are being considered for removal, there has been a push in recent years to address the deficiencies in existing dams without removing them. These goals include maximizing the efficiency of existing dams and minimizing their environmental impact. Updating equipment and acknowledging that dams have a limited life span are two ways to achieve those goals. As part of them, a plan for decommissioning the dam and restoring the river should be drawn up long before the dam exceeds its design life. One part of river restoration that does not have to wait until the dam is removed is introducing environmental flow. Having variable amounts of water flow through the dam at different seasons mimics natural seasonal variations in water level from winter and spring storms. Additionally, fish ladders can be added to dams to increase the connectivity of a river and allow fish to reach their spawning grounds. There's debate about the effectiveness of fish ladders, but generally some fish will make it through as opposed to zero fish spawning in their traditional location. == Completed projects == Condit Dam, Washington, United States * 1973 - Lewiston Dam, South Fork Clearwater River, Idaho – The dam was built in 1927 as a hydroelectric facility, but lacked fish ladders. Upon completion of the Lower Granite Dam and its reservoir, the lack of gradient on the river made it obsolete. Its removal improved salmon runs on the river. * 1997 - Marie Dorian Dam, Walla Walla River, Oregon – The dam blocked passage to Pacific Salmon and steelhead into the Blue Mountains from the Columbia Basin. * 1999 - Edwards Dam, Kennebec River, Maine – Built in 1837, the dam blocked access to Atlantic Salmon and American Shad. This was a landmark case in which a U.S. federal agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, required the decommissioning and removal of a dam against the operator's wishes. * 2004 - Embrey Dam, Rappahannock River, Virginia - On February 23, 2004 the 22-foot-tall, 770-foot-long, 1910 hydroelectric Embrey Dam was demolished, using 600 lbs of explosives, by divers from an engineering detachment at Fort Eustis. The aim of removal was to re-open miles of spawning grounds to aid populations of American Shad, herring, catadromous American eel, and other species. The historical character of the Ambursen-type reinforced concrete structure required a parallel documentation and (partial) preservation project by industrial archeologists. In 2008 longtime U.S. Senator from Virginia John Warner described the removal of Embrey Dam as the \\"proudest achievement in his legislative career.\\" * 2004 - Cuddebackville Dam, Neversink River, New York - Built in two portions dating from the 1820s (for water diversion into a canal) and 1915 (for hydroelectric power), the dam had been abandoned since 1945. The dam was removed in October 2004 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in a novel partnership with the Nature Conservancy, to benefit the aquatic life in the area, specifically the Dwarf Wedge Mussel and the American Shad. * 2007 - Marmot Dam, Sandy River, Oregon – The removal of this dam by Portland General Electric has been extremely successful at improving access for Pacific Salmon and steelhead to the upper Sandy River watershed up into the Mount Hood Wilderness. * 2008 - Milltown Dam, Missoula, Montana - Dam held startling levels of toxic sediments from 100 years of mining and logging. Removal improved water quality, trout habitat, and the general ecological condition of the watershed. * 2009 - Savage Rapids Dam, Rogue River, Oregon – Built for agricultural water diversion, it was removed by the Bureau of Reclamation due to its out-dated facilities and non- functioning fish ladders that prevented fish migration past the dam. * 2011 - Condit Dam, White Salmon River, Washington – The dam blocked access for Pacific Salmon and steelhead runs on of river. PacifiCorp proposed to remove the dam, rather than paying for fish passage upgrades. Removal was proposed in 2006, but actions from Skamania and Klickitat counties held up the process. In fall 2008, salmon were trucked up above to dam to allow them to spawn higher up the river. In October 2011, PacifiCorp contractors used explosives to blow a hole in the dam to drain its reservoir and allow young salmon to enter the Columbia River and head to sea. * 2012 - Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams, Elwha River, Washington – The largest dam removal project in history is the Elwha Ecosystem Restoration project on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington. Starting in 2012, and finishing in 2014, the Elwha Dam and the Glines Canyon Dam were removed to restore stocks of Pacific Salmon and trout species to the Elwha River watershed. The removal of these blockades allows migratory salmon to travel past the dam sites and upriver, an event that has not occurred since the dams' creation in 1913. After spawning there, the salmon die and their carcasses decompose, releasing marine nutrients laid down in their bodies as they fed in the open ocean. This reintroduction provides a valuable research opportunity for interested parties. Since the dam removal, reservoir beds that looked like moonscapes have returned to vibrant rich habitat. Within a year of the Elwha Dam removal, an increase in salmon-derived nutrients was documented in the American dipper. * 2012 - Great Works Dam, Penobscot River, Maine. Removed as part of the Penobscot River Restoration Project. * 2013 - Veazie Dam, Penobscot River, Maine. Removed as part of the Penobscot River Restoration Project. * 2015 - San Clemente Dam, Carmel River, California. This 106 ft dam was deemed unsafe back in 1992 by the Department of Water Resources. The dam was no longer serving its use by supplying water to the Monterey Peninsula and blocked steelhead from spawning upstream. ==Proposed removalsLower Snake River Dams, Washington, US=== Little Goose Dam, Washington, USA Four dams along the lower Snake River, built and still operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, serve as hydroelectric power sources as well as maintaining an inland port at Lewiston, Idaho for agricultural barge traffic. The four are candidates for removal because of millions of cubic yards accumulated behind the dams, which are raising water levels for riverside cities. They include: the 1975 Lower Granite Dam, the 1970 Little Goose Dam, the 1969 Lower Monumental Dam, and the 1962 Ice Harbor Dam. Three million new cubic yards of sediment are deposited behind the lower four dams on the Snake River annually.Barker, E. (2007, February 16). Corps of engineers gets earful about sediment problems. Lewiston Tribune. The city of Lewiston, Idaho and others along the Snake have built a system of levees maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers. The levees in Lewiston were designed to leave five feet between water levels and the top of the levees. As of 2011, two feet remained. As water levels continue to rise, either some of the dams must be removed or dredged, or the municipal levees will continue to be raised. The Corps admits that the amount of sediment in the riverbed is too great for dredging to be effective, and Lewiston community leaders are worried that higher levees will further cut the town off from its rivers.\\"Why Restore Wild Salmon?\\" Save Our Wild Salmon. Retrieved 18 May 2011. . The Corps began dredging behind Lower Granite Dam in 2015.http://portoflewiston.com/facts/dredging/ ===Rindge Dam and Matilija Dam, Southern California=== Rindge Dam near Malibu, California, built in 1924, completely silted and abandoned by the 1950s The privately owned Rindge Dam on Malibu Creek in the Santa Monica Mountains of California was built in 1924 and has been allowed to completely fill with sediment, making it functionally obsolete but still a potential hazard. Malibu Creek once supported the southernmost steelhead population in the world. But today, steelhead no longer occupy the creek. The similar 1947 Matilija Dam near Ojai, California was built against the advice of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, among others, and also blocked steelhead trout spawning grounds. After being notched twice and largely silted up, 90% of its design capacity has been lost. As of 2013 stakeholders agree that the dam and its sediment be removed, but no funding source has been identified. ===Klamath River Dams, California / Oregon border=== Demonstrators calling for removal of dams on the Klamath River in Oregon and California, USA As resolution of several long-range issues centered on water rights in the Klamath Basin, the multi-party Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement was signed in early 2008. Parties to the agreement included the state of California, the state of Oregon, three Native American tribes, four counties, and 35 other local organizations and individuals. This agreement called for the removal of four of the Klamath River Hydroelectric Project dams: the 1958 John C. Boyle Dam, the 1922 Copco Number 1 and Copco Number 2, and the 1964 Iron Gate Dam. All four are privately owned by PacifiCorp. At the time PacifiCorp faced a relicensing cycle with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, with potentially expensive fixes for salmon passage and to address the growth of the toxic bacteria Microcystis aeruginosa in the Copco and Iron Gate Reservoirs. On September 29, 2009, Pacificorp reached an agreement in principle with the other KBRA parties to remove the four dams, pending Congressional approval. Congress did not act, so as of February 2016, the states of Oregon and California, the dam owners, federal regulators and other parties reached a further agreement to remove all four Klamath basin dams by the year 2020, contingent only on approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The new plan has been endorsed by the governors of California and Oregon, as well as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior. ===Glen Canyon Dam, northern Arizona === Glen Canyon Dam The Glen Canyon Dam has been proposed for removal because of the negative effects it has on the water quality and riparian habitat of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon National Park. In addition, the reservoir impounded behind it, Lake Powell has filled all of the canyons for up to above the dam. This lake, while providing recreational opportunities, has eliminated more than of habitat for endangered Colorado River fish species. The reservoir also loses more than 6 percent of the total annual flow of the Colorado River to evaporation and seepage. Advocates of dam removal such as the Glen Canyon Institute also cite these losses of stored water as reason to decommission the dam. If it were to be removed, it would dwarf any completed dam removal project in history. ===O'Shaughnessy (Hetch Hetchy) Dam, California=== O'Shaughnessy Dam in California was completed in 1923 and represented the first great environmental controversy in the US as it was constructed in a national park. The debate over the dam and reservoir continues today. Preservationist groups such as the Sierra Club lobby for the restoration of the valley, while others argue that leaving the dam in place would be the better economic and environmental decision. ===Kinnickinnic River Dams, Wisconsin === The Upper \\"Junction Falls\\" Dam on the Kinnickinnic River in River Falls, Wisconsin as it appears today. The Historic Junction Falls are obscured by its presence, the lowest ledge of the Junction Falls now sits as the dry ledge below the base of the dam. The historic Junction Falls of the yet-undammed Kinnickinnic River in River Falls, Wisconsin. Photograph taken by John Carbutt between 1864 - 1865 and published as a stereoview in a set of scenery pictures of \\"The Upper Mississippi, Minnesota and the Vicinity\\". The two remaining dams on the Kinnickinnic River in River Falls, Wisconsin are being considered for removal in order to completely restore the Kinnickinnic River to its natural state. The Kinnickinnic River, called the Kinni for short, is a U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed October 5, 2012 river in northwestern Wisconsin in the United States. The Kinni is a cold water fishery supporting a population of native Brook Trout and naturally reproducing Brown Trout. The Kinnickinnic River is officially designated as a Class I trout stream by the WI DNR, indicating it is a \\"high quality\\" trout water that has sufficient natural reproduction to sustain populations of wild trout, at or near carrying capacity. The Kinnickinnic is also designated as an Outstanding Resource Water (ORW) by the WI DNR both above State HWY 35, and below the Powell Falls Dam, however, the stretch of the Kinni through the City of River Falls is not included in this designation where the river is impounded into two reservoirs which do not support a fishery. This ORW designation indicates the Kinni provides outstanding recreational opportunities, supports valuable fisheries and wildlife habitat, has good water quality, and is not significantly impacted by human activities. This designation indicates that the State of Wisconsin has determined the Kinnickinnic River warrants additional protection from the effects of pollution. These designations are intended to meet federal Clean Water Act obligations requiring Wisconsin to adopt an “antidegradation” policy that is designed to prevent any lowering of water quality – especially in those waters having significant ecological or cultural value. Local stakeholder organizations in the FERC relicensing process include the Friends of the Kinni, the Kiap-TU-Wish Chapter of Trout Unlimited, the Kinnickinnic River Land Trust, and the River Alliance of Wisconsin. Government agencies also serving as stakeholder organizations include the Wisconsin DNR, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service. ==See also== *Dam failure *Environmental impact of reservoirs *Riparian zone restoration *DamNation *Dam Removal Europe ==References * American Rivers - Dam Removals Interactive Map * Dam Removal Success Stories - American Rivers * The Friends of the Kinni * Exploring Dam Removal: A Decision Making Guide * Small Dam Removal in Oregon * US Army Corps of Engineers: Engineering and Ecological Aspects of Dam Removal—An Overview * Beyond Dams: Options and Alternatives * Dam Removal: A New Option for a New Century * Dam Removal Research: Status and Prospectus * Elwha River Dam Removal Study * Dam Removal Success Stories:Restoring Rivers through Selective Removal of Dams that Don't Make Sense * Portland General Electric Marmot Dam * Army Corps of Engineers Dam Removal Page * Friends of the Earth River Restoration Page * Natural Resources Council of Maine Kennebec River Restoration *Spot.us - Story: The Story Behind the World's Biggest Dam Removal - Rough Water Category:Dams Category:Demolition Category:Environmental issues with water Category:Environmental impact of the energy industry Category:Ecological restoration ","title":"Dam removal"},{"id":"19277648","text":"Stanley Brown Thomas (born July 11, 1949) is a former professional baseball pitcher.

He won 32 caps for Wales and was selected to play in the British Lions on the 1950 tour of Australia and New Zealand. He was the son of a past Welsh rugby international, Glyn Stephens, who was also president of the Welsh Rugby Union. Born in 1922 in Neath, Stephens played under-14s rugby for Wales and then after being accepted to Llandovery College, he played for Wales Secondary Schools. During the Second World War Stephens played scratch rugby for many clubs while working as a miner. Initially a number eight, Stephens would later switch to the second row. ==International career== Stephens made his official debut for the senior Wales team against England in 1947 under the captaincy of Haydn Tanner. Stephens had turned out against the French team in the 1945/46 'Victory' internationals, but his first capped games were during the 1947 Five Nations Championship. The 1947 England game at the Cardiff Arms Park saw Wales lose 9–6 though Stephens did manage to score a try in the game, one of only two he would manage in his long career. During the 1947/48 season, Stephens lost his position to the returning Les Manfield, but Stephens was back for Wales's final game of the 1948 Championship game against Ireland. Over the next two years he would drop in and out of the Welsh squad, often through injury sometimes through selection choices, but in 1950 he and Bleddyn Williams were chosen to represent the British Lions of their tour of Australia and New Zealand. ===International matches played=== Wales * 1947, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1957 * 1947, 1949, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1957 * 1947, 1948, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957 * 1953 * 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1957 * 1951 ===British Lions=== During the 1950 Lions tour, Stephens was chosen for the opening match against a joint Tasman regional team.

From 1796 until 1807 he was Reigning prince of the principality of Anhalt-Bernburg, and from 1807 until 1834 the first Duke of the Duchy of Anhalt-Bernburg. ==Life== Alexius Frederick Christian was born on 12 June 1767 at Ballenstedt. He was the only son of Frederick Albert, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg, by his wife Louise Albertine, daughter of Frederick Carl, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg- Plön. From early childhood, he and his sister Pauline received an excellent education. After the death of his father in 1796, Alexius Frederick Christian inherited Anhalt-Bernburg. The territories of Anhalt-Bernburg were augmented one year later with the formal division of Anhalt-Zerbst in 1797; Alexius Frederick Christian received the towns of Coswig and Mühlingen, which represented 1/3 of the defunct principality. In 1812, with the extinction of the Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym branch of the House of Ascania, he inherited Hoym and some Prussian enclaves. Alexius improved education with the building and enlargement of many churches and schools. He demonstrated a special interest in expanding the road network, especially in the newly acquired areas of his principality. The mining and metallurgical industry also benefited from his attention. Alexius Frederick Christian initiated several major construction projects, such as the Saalebrücke in Bernburg (Saale), which was later destroyed. In 1810 he founded the Alexisbad in Selketal and later, in the Prussian area of Gernrode, he created the Beringer Bad. In matters of religion, he was tolerant and enlightened; in 1820 he finally declared the Reformist and Lutheran faiths to be the official co-religions of his state. In 1826 he joined the German Zollverein and in 1829 created a civil fund for orphans, widows, and servants. The Emperor Francis II elevated him to the rank of Duke in 1807. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Alexius Frederick Christian, with his kinsmans the Dukes of Anhalt-Dessau and Anhalt-Köthen, joined the Confederation of the Rhine. Some of his troops fought for Napoleon in Tyrol, Spain, Russia, Gdańsk, and Kulm. On 13 December 1813 he resigned from the Confederation of the Rhine and sent his troops with his allies in 1814 and 1815 to Belgium and France. On 8 June 1815 he joined the German Confederation.

Ballenstedt, 23 May 1818), who shortly after the wedding was ennobled and created Baroness of Hoym (German: Frau von Hoym). The union only lasted four months until Dorothea's death.

It introduced a popular dance of the same name with \\"Folks in Georgia's 'bout to go insane.\\" It became a ragtime, pop, and trad jazz standard, and has been recorded hundreds of times. ==Origin== The origins of the term are obscure. Around the same time the song came out, the expression \\"ballin' the jack\\" was used by railroad workers to mean \\"going at full speed.\\" 'The 'Jack' was the slang name for a railroad locomotive, and balling meant going at high speed, itself derived from the ball type of railroad signal in which a high ball meant a clear line. The composer and entertainer Perry Bradford claimed to have seen the dance steps performed around 1909 and they are similar to the shimmy which has black African origins. The dance moves were standardized in the Savoy Ballroom, and put to music by Smith and Burris in 1913. The tune became popular in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1913. ==Film usage== The song and dance were performed in For Me and My Gal, the 1942 movie starring Judy Garland and Gene Kelly.Judy Garland and Gene Kelly singing \\"Ballin' the Jack\\" in film For Me and My Gal (1942) on YouTube It was also performed by Danny Kaye in the 1951 movie On the Riviera, and Dean Martin and Polly Bergen in the 1951 movie That's My Boy.

Prior to the year of entry, application forms are distributed to High Schools in different areas, students who are looking to enrol at the college may attend an open evening. All students who accept a position to study at St. John Rigby College are invited to attend a New Students' Day in June. Dependent upon the route taken will depend on the points necessary to guarantee a place in the college, (Route A) 40 Points, (Route B) 35 Points (Route C) 25 Points, (Route D) 15 Points. These will be calculated from the best 8 GCSE's which may be any or specific GCSE's may be required to be included in the best 8 at a certain grade. (See below for points table): {  style=\\"text-align:center; width:5%\\" ! Grade !! Points -  A* 8 -  A  7 -  B  6 -  C  5 -  D  4 -  E  3 -  F  2 -  G  1 } ===Acceptance=== If accepted, students can choose at what level they wish to study from. This consists of 5 levels: *Entry Level - Entry Level *Level 1 (Introductory Level) - NVQ Level 1, BTEC Introductory Award *Level 2 (Intermediate Level) - NVQ Level 2, BTEC First Diploma, GCSE *Level 3 (Advanced Level) - NVQ Level 3, BTEC National, AS and A Level *Level 3 (Degrees) - NVQ Level 4, BTEC Higher National, Foundational Degrees As well as completing chosen courses, students are also required to study 'Values for living' and are also required to take on 'extended studies'. This can be a course completely different from the courses students have chosen to take (e.g., School Production, Driving Theory, First Aid). The majority of students who are enrolled at the college are aged 16–18 and are on Level 3 programs full-time. From here they then proceed to a range of universities across the UK. ==Campus== The College is large consisting of 6 blocks and is situated on a single campus 3.5 miles west of Wigan on Gathurst Road, Orrell, near the birthplace of the man for whom the school was named (St John Rigby) and has one of its buildings named after his birthplace, the building being named Harrock House. In February 2006 the College opened its new Learning Resource Centre (LRC) which offers a wide range of services and support to students. ===Sports facilities=== The College boasts the largest all weather football pitch in the country and has extensive playing fields surrounding the campus. The Sports Hall has facilities for a wide range of sports, a fitness suite, as well as being used by students, the pitch is also used by others outside the college (e.g. Wigan Athletic F.C. have used the pitch in the past for practice). ===College Chapel=== As a Roman Catholic school, students can visit the newly built College Chapel, which is available at any time of the day as a place of prayer, reflection or quietness. The college Chaplaincy team currently runs a Fairtrade store which is open to all students and staff ===SJR Community Team=== The college is currently building up a community team involving a large number of students getting involved with open days, college events such as Rigfest (a night when student bands play their music) and getting involved with tea and coffee mornings and working with the chaplaincy team with other events. ===The Learning Resource Centre (LRC)=== The college Learning Resource Centre offers a wide range of service and support to students such as over 11,000 books in stock, DVDs and online resources. ===Open Learning Centre (OLC)=== In the Open Learning Centre, Students have access to over 96 network connected computers to aide them in their learning, with Computer Technicians available to help with any problems any time of the day. ==Pearson Teaching Awards== In 2012, Physical education lecturer and head of department, Mr. John Ireland, was awarded the \\"Further Education Teacher of the Year Award in the North\\"http://www.bee- it.co.uk/documents/Pearson%20Teaching%20Awards%20Regional%20Winners%202012.pdf in the Teaching Awards. He was awarded due to numerous nominations by students past and present, as a thank you for his 32 years of passionate teaching to students in sport, which has led to some of the most great successes, including students going on to play for top teams such as 'Wigan Warriors'. ==Student Council== The college considers the student council to be a very important asset as it gives students the opportunity to have their say in which they think the quality of college life can be improved and also into any future plans the college intends to make. The student Council is a governing body who are representatives of the students and on their behalf put forward any suggestions of improvement that any students think should be considered as well as organising college events. The college is currently focusing on building up a council team in partnership with Loreto College in Manchester and always encourages its students to be involved. ==Notable alumni== * Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, former chaplin * Iain Coyle, TV presenter, TV producer and stand-up comedian * Jon Culshaw, impressionist and comedian * Shaun Edwards, Rugby League International/Welsh Union coach * Mark Edwardson, BBC North West Tonight TV news presenter * Eva Pope, Actress (Waterloo Road) * Vernon Kay, TV presenter, DJ and former model * Joe Lydon, Rugby League International * Stuart Maconie, BBC Radio 2 DJ/TV presenter * Luke Marsden, Big Brother 2008 (UK) * Paul Rowley, BBC political correspondent * Iain Thornley (Wigan Warriors Rugby league player) * Sean O'Loughlin (Wigan Warriors Rugby League Captain) * Phil Clarke (Sky Sports Rugby League Pundit, former Wigan and GB Player) * Joe Burgess (Wigan Warriors) - Rugby Player * Jennifer Reynolds, Actress (Coronation Street) ==External links== * St John Rigby College Official Website * College Prospectus for 2012 ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Wigan Category:Education in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan Category:Sixth form colleges in Greater Manchester Category:Catholic universities and colleges in England ","title":"St John Rigby College, Wigan"},{"id":"19277859","text":"Antonin Svoboda or Antonín Svoboda may refer to: * Antonín Svoboda (athlete) (1900–1965), Czech Olympics sprinter * Antonín Svoboda (computer scientist) (1907–1980), Czech computer scientist * (born 1969), Austrian film director and producer == See also == * Svoboda (surname) * Antonin (name) ","title":"Antonin Svoboda"},{"id":"19277870","text":"Tom Nelson (born March 3, 1976) is an American Democratic politician from Kaukauna, Wisconsin and the County Executive of Outagamie County, since April 19, 2011.Bach, Peter. \\"Tom Nelson edges Jack Voight in Outagamie County Executive race: Nelson edges Voight in tight Outagamie executive race\\" Appleton Post-Crescent April 6, 2011 Nelson was the Democratic nominee for the United States House of Representatives seat for Wisconsin's 8th congressional district in 2016. He was defeated in the general election by Republican nominee Mike Gallagher. == Background == Born in St. Paul, Minnesota on March 3, 1976, and grew up in Little Chute, WI. Nelson graduated from Little Chute High School in 1994, earned a B.A. from Carleton College in 1998, and an M.P.A. from Princeton in 2004. == Education == Nelson graduated valedictorian at Little Chute High School in 1994 and was featured in Post Crescent. He matriculated at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota in 1994 and graduated in 1998. He is listed as one of the college's top famous alumni by ranker.com. He was profiled at the Princeton University School of Public and International Affairs. == Family == Nelson is married to Maria Nelson and the couple reside in Appleton with their two young children. The Nelsons have an interfaith marriage and are members of Christ the King Lutheran Church in Combined Locks, Wis. and St. Therese Catholic Church of Appleton, Wis. The Nelsons were featured in The Compass, the official newspaper of the Catholic Diocese of Green Bay on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of the Reformation (2017) highlighting their interfaith marriage. They co-led an interfaith workshop following an ecumenical service of the Northeast Wisconsin ELCA synod and Green Bay Diocese. According to Nelson, “There aren’t crucial differences between the faiths. The most difficult part is coordinating weekend schedules so we can get to both service and Mass.” Maria added, “Early on in our relationship, I think I was hesitant to admit that I liked our Lutheran church because it meant that somehow our Catholic church is lacking. As the years have passed, however, I’ve learned that seeing the individual beauty in each church doesn’t question or diminish our faith.” ==Legislative career== Nelson is a former member of the Wisconsin State Assembly representing the 5th Assembly District (northeastern Outagamie County, western Brown County and the Town of Maple Grove in Shawano County) from 2005 - 2011. He was first elected to the Assembly in 2004, defeating Republican incumbent Becky Weber 51 percent to 49 percent. He was the only Democratic to unseat an incumbent legislative Republican. When he took office on January 3, 2005, he was the youngest member of the state Assembly. Nelson was assigned to the standing committees on health, insurance, rural development and transportation. At the start of the 2005-06 session, Nelson was viewed as a top target in the 2006 election but GOP failed to recruit a strong challenger. Nelson defeated Jim Reigel of Hobart 62 percent to 38 percent. === SeniorCare === In the spring of 2007, the state of Wisconsin did not receive a waiver from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to continue SeniorCare, an affordable prescription drug program for low-income elderly. Without a wavier the state would no longer have the authority nor the funding to continue the program. At the time, approximately 104,000 were enrolled in the program. Nelson organized a grass-root effort to save the program and lobbied for it in Washington, DC. In May 2007, Senator Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold authored an amendment to emergency spending bill for the Iraq War to renew the waiver, which effectively saved the program and extended it through 2009. Nelson along with other state leaders was credited with having successfully lobbied officials to continue the program. He continued to work on this issue for the rest of his time in the legislature and as county executive. Again in 2015, the program's future was uncertain because Governor Scott Walker did fund SeniorCare in the 2015-2017 biennial budget. “SeniorCare is good policy then, and its good policy now,” County Executive Nelson told a press conference in February of that year, referring to the ordeal of 2007. Approximately 2700 residents of Outagamie County were enrolled in the program. In May, the Joint Finance Committee which consists of members of both houses of the legislature and is responsible for marking up the executive budget, announced it would reject Walker's proposal and continue funding SeniorCare. Funding remained intact for the rest of the budget process and was adopted as part of the budget in July. === Kimberly-NewPage mill closing === In August 2008, Nelson called for a special session of the state Assembly in response to the proposed closing of the Kimberly-NewPage paper mill. The mill employed by 600 workers. It was a particularly important development because NewPage was the largest employer in the village of 6,803 and the country was in the Great Recession and the number of unemployed rose by 592,000 in August alone. Nelson authored a resolution that would call on NewPage to continue running the mill or sell it on the open market. The United Steelworkers supported Nelson's legislation and also called for the assembly to come into session. The legislature never convened and the resolution was not adopted. The mill was shut down on September 8 and was bought by Aim Demolition on June 7, 2011 which subsequently tore it down beginning April 2, 2012. Nelson would work on another effort to save a mill later in his service as county executive (see below). Nelson sought re-election again in 2008, beating Jim Steineke 64 percent to 34 percent vote. Members of the Assembly Democratic caucus elected him Majority Leader on November 12, 2008 for the upcoming 2009-10 session. == Run for Lieutenant Governor == In 2010, Nelson announced that he was running for the position of Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin, rather than seek re- election to the Assembly. He gave up his leadership post to help Tom Barrett defeat Scott Walker. Mordecai Lee, a UW-Milwaukee political scientist and former state senator said lieutenant governors could affect the outcome of the race. “Normally I would say the lieutenant governor is an afterthought. But this year, with the volatile political climate, the governor’s running mate could end up making a difference.” Nelson waited until the end of the legislative session to launch his campaign because he wanted to focus on “his legislative responsibilities”. As majority leader he chaired the Rules committee which sets the legislative agenda, specifically which bills would be voted on by the state Assembly. Nelson filed papers with the state elections board to run on April 27, 2010. That day, Milwaukee alderperson and lieutenant governor candidate Tony Zielinski dropped out of the race at the behest of Barrett's advisors, according to Zielinski. In a statement, Zielinski said Nelson “would be a strong candidate, which is needed when someone is in a position that is one step away from the governor.” Nelson officially announced his candidacy on May 25, 2010 just over three months before the fall primary on September 10, 2010. As late as August, Nelson had not yet distinguished himself from the other candidates. Said Jack Craver of The Isthmus and frequent commentator on the race that year, “The Democratic primary for lieutenant governor has been a wash so far. It's hard to pinpoint a front- runner, despite assumptions (I plead guilty too) at the beginning of the campaign that Tom Nelson would eventually box-out all of his competition, perhaps with the help of Tom Barrett and the DPW.” On September 14, Nelson won the Democratic nomination in a four-way race, winning an absolute majority (52%) over state senator Spencer Coggs (21%) and two others. The Barrett campaign was pleased with Nelson's election. Said Barrett spokesman Phil Walzak, “We will use Nelson to help advance Gov. Barrett’s agenda and vision. We are happy to have him.” During the general election, Nelson made repeated requests to Republican lieutenant governor nominee Rebecca Kleefish to debate, but Kleefisch refused. Sitting lieutenant governor and Democrat Barbara Lawton said Nelson and Kleefisch should debate because “it was important for voters to learn about the lieutenant governor candidates since they would take over for the governor should he no longer be able to serve.” The gubernatorial candidates debated three times. Nelson and running mate Tom Barrett (who ran as a ticket) were defeated in the 2010 general election by Rebecca Kleefisch and Scott Walker. Democrats across the nation and in particular, Wisconsin incurred substantial electoral defeats. In Wisconsin, Democrats lost both houses of the legislature, a US Senate seat and two US House seats, in addition to the governorship and lieutenant governor. == County executive == On April 5, 2011, Nelson defeated former Republican State Treasurer of Wisconsin Jack Voight for county executive of Outagamie County, by roughly 52% - 48%. He had advanced to the general election by winning a six-way primary in February. Voight had characterized the race as a grudge match with Walker, telling the National Review that he “[was] attempting to ‘fight the battle again; it’s a re-battle of November against Scott Walker’.” Voight also recognized the political unrest stemming from Scott Walker's policy drive to eliminate public workers' collective bargaining powers, saying \\"The labor movement has not only energized the Democratic Party base but a lot of the independents\\".[1] As county executive, Nelson refused salary raises. and included county board supervisors in his budget writing sessions, a “gesture” that made him stand out vis-à-vis former county executives, according to one former board chair. He sought re-election two times in 2015 and 2019 and was uncontested in each race. === Appleton Coated=== In his second term, Nelson filed an objection in Outagamie County Circuit Court to the sale of Appleton Coated, a paper mill founded in 1889 in the village of Combined Locks to an industrial scrap dealer, Industrial Assets of California. The distressed mill had filed for receivership in August 2017. The United Steelworkers which represented hourly workers at the mill also objected. Under Wisconsin receivership law, individuals or entities affected by the sale can object to the sale. At subsequent court hearings, USW and Nelson's case was heard. Their appeal was successful. The presiding judge directed the presumptive new owner, Industrial Assets, to run the plant or find a buyer who would. Industrial Assets chose to run the facility as a going concern and not sell it off as parts and the mill was operational beginning December of that year. The third and final paper machine went online in March of the following year. According to Nelson and company CEO Kyle Putzstuck, it is rare for mills in these situations to continue operating. Its restart was considered “improbable” by the Appleton Post Crescent. === Sales tax === At the beginning of his third term in 2019, Nelson opposed the adoption of a county-wide sales tax. Outagame County was one of just six counties (out of 72) that had not yet implemented a county sales tax and had been debating the matter on and off since the 1980s. In June 2019, Nelson vetoed the tax, citing widespread opposition to the measure and that it was a regressive tax that hurt those least able to pay it. The county board overrode his veto and the tax took effect in January 2020. The event was not without controversy. Prior to his veto, Nelson ran a radio ad touting his objection to the sales tax and calling on residents to contact their supervisors. Supervisors demanded Nelson to take down his ad, but Nelson demurred, citing his right to run the ads. ==2016 U.S. House of Representatives election== On April 7, 2016, Nelson announced that he would run for the U.S. Congress seat being vacated by retiring Representative Reid Ribble. The decision was hailed by Democrats across the state because it was viewed as “one move in a complex board game” that could lead to a Democratic take-over of the House of Representatives. Nelson was recruited by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The committee reserved $730,000 for its independent expenditure arm and the Super PAC, House Majority PAC, $200,000. Late in the campaign, Nelson made the committee's Red to Blue program, the top-tier races. At the beginning of the general election campaign following the August primary, the race was considered a pure toss up by the Rothenberg and Gonzalez Political Report. As late as October 24, 2016, Nelson's race was listed as one of the top 40 US House races likely to flip party control despite the fortunes of congressional Democrats beginning to slip. Nelson was one of the first congressional candidates to use footage of Donald Trump's Access Hollywood tapes in a campaign ad, linking their opponent to Trump. His ad was featured on the Rachel Maddow Show on October 11, 2016 as an example of the message that would be replicated elsewhere. “The Democratic Party says ads like that will run against congressional Republican candidates all over the country. They're going to tie every Republican candidate in the country to Trump.” Nelson was endorsed by Our Revolution a coalition of former Bernie Sanders that backed progressive candidates across the country. He also received substantial labor backing with contributions from thirteen labor- PACs. He also received endorsements from the National Committee to Protect Social Security and Medicare and League of Conservation Voters. Nelson raised about $1.8 million over the course of a seven-month campaign [FEC]. However, Gallagher raised almost $1 million more ($2.7 million) than Nelson. Outside groups outspent Nelson by a margin of three-to-one compared to his opponent Gallagher. Nelson was overrun by national headwinds that wiped out the Democratic ticket in Northeast Wisconsin that included Hillary Clinton and Russ Feingold. He lost to former Walker aide and US Senate staff Mike Gallagher, who won 63% of the vote. == References  External links == * * Follow the Money - Tom Nelson **2008 2006 2004 campaign contributions *Campaign 2008 campaign contributions at Wisconsin Democracy Campaign Category:1976 births Category:Carleton College alumni Category:County executives in Wisconsin Category:Living people Category:Members of the Wisconsin State Assembly Category:People from Kaukauna, Wisconsin Category:Politicians from Saint Paul, Minnesota Category:Wisconsin Democrats Category:Princeton School of Public and International Affairs alumni Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Tom Nelson (Wisconsin politician)"},{"id":"19277881","text":"The Silver Shoes are the magical shoes that appear in L. Frank Baum's 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz as heroine Dorothy Gale's transport home. They are originally owned by the Wicked Witch of the East but passed to Dorothy when her house lands on the Witch. At the end of the story, Dorothy uses the shoes to transport her back to her home in Kansas, but when she arrives at her destination finds the shoes had fallen off en route. == Appearances in books The Wonderful Wizard of Oz=== The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) is the only book in the original series to feature the Silver Shoes directly. They are the property of the Wicked Witch of the East until Dorothy's house lands on and kills her. They are then given to Dorothy by the Good Witch of the North, who tells Dorothy that \\"there is some charm connected with them; but what it is we never knew.\\" When Dorothy is captured by the Wicked Witch of the West, she tries to steal the shoes. She finally gets one by tricking Dorothy into tripping over an invisible iron bar. Dorothy then melts the Witch with a bucket of water and recovers the shoe. In the final chapters of the book, Glinda explains that the shoes can transport the wearer anywhere they wish. If the Silver Shoes have any other powers they are never outlined in the books, however the Witch of the West was obsessed with obtaining them, as they would give her much greater power than any other thing she possessed, suggesting the shoes hold immense magic. After saying goodbye to her friends, Dorothy knocks her heels together three times, and commands the Shoes to carry her home. When Dorothy opens her eyes, she has arrived in Kansas. She finds that the shoes are gone, having fallen off during her flight and landing somewhere in the Deadly Desert. Though they are mentioned several times in sequels, they never appear again in the original series. ===The Wizard of the Emerald City=== In Alexander Melentyevich Volkov's The Wizard of the Emerald City (1939), the Silver shoes or Serebryaniye bashmachki as they are called in the manuscript, are the source of Elly's (his version of Dorothy) protection instead of the good Witch's kiss. She is therefore attacked once by an Ogre when removing them, and afterward wears them even when she sleeps. They are not taken from the Witch's body, but rather brought by Toto from her dwelling (a dark cave). This was possibly done to avert the problem of a person wearing the shoes to be impossible to harm, since in that book the hurricane is created by the Wicked Witch to destroy mankind, and redirected upon her by the Good Witch of the North, who suffers no ill effects for harming her. It is said the Witch only wore the shoes on very special occasions. They are lost just like in Baum's book. ===Dorothy of Oz=== In Roger S. Baum's Dorothy of Oz (1989), Glinda recovers the silver shoes and presents them to Dorothy. They have enough power remaining that Dorothy can travel once more to Oz and back to Kansas. ===Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West=== In Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (1995), the silver shoes are a gift to Nessarose (the Wicked Witch of the East) before she and her sister, Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West) start college. They are made by her father using special glass beads another man (Turtle Heart, possibly her biological father) taught him to make, which make the shoes shiny and iridescent, not necessarily a true silver. They are later enchanted by Glinda (the Good Witch of the North) to give Nessarose the necessary balance to walk. In the Broadway musical adaption of the book, Elphaba is the one who enchants the shoes. Her spell makes the silver shoes burn red hot, turning them into the ruby slippers. ==Appearances in filmWizard of Oz (1925 film)=== The shoes were absent from the 1925 movie. ===The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)=== In the 1939 movie the shoes served the same purpose as in the book but were changed to red by its screenwriter Noel Langley. He gave a notably different appearance than in Denslow's illustrations. In addition to the silver shoes' powers, the Ruby slippers in the film were magically protected from being removed from the feet of the person wearing them unless said person is dead ===The Wiz=== In The Wiz (1978), the shoes are silver high heels. This movie gives further insight into the shoe's magical protection. When Evillene (the witch of the west) tries to obtain them magically, her fingers are bent painfully backwards. ===The Wizard of Oz (1982 film)=== In the anime movie, the shoes are once again transformed into the ruby slippers, though they are never referred to by that name. They are heeled shoes with pointed, slightly curled toes, similar to their appearance in Denslow's illustrations. Unlike the book, the shoes are still on Dorothy's feet when she arrives in Kansas. ===Return to Oz=== In Return to Oz (1985), the Ruby Slippers are used once again. In this movie, the slippers have more power than simply transporting people. They allow the Nome King to conquer Oz and turn every one in the Emerald City to stone. Dorothy later uses the shoes to reverse this process. This extra power is due to the fact the slippers replace the Nome King's Magic Belt. In the original draft of the script, the Nome King had refashioned the slippers into the actual Magic Belt from the novels. Upon his death, they reverted into the form of slippers. This was cut from the final filming of the movie. ===The Muppets' Wizard of Oz=== In The Muppets' Wizard of Oz (2005), the Silver Shoes are portrayed as sparkling, bejeweled, glittery Manolo Blahnik high-heels. The laws of ownership are again displayed in that the Witch of the West tries to cut off Dorothy's feet to obtain the shoes. Once again the shoes remain on Dorothy's feet when she arrives home. ==Appearances in televisionThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1986 anime)=== When first seen on the feet of the Witch of the East in the 1986 anime version, they are brown peasant's shoes. When the Witch of the North then magically transfers them to Dorothy's feet, they take on the appearance of white slip-on shoes. When Dorothy is forced to give one of the shoes to the Witch of the West, it reverts to the peasant form. After the Witch is melted and Dorothy is shown wearing it again, it has returned to its white form. The shoes are used twice after they initially send Dorothy home. The first time, she is holding them in her hands when she clicks the heels and drops them. Consequently, Dorothy is transported to Oz and the shoes are left in Kansas (Glinda sends her home). The second time occurs while Dorothy is sleeping. Tik-Tok is emitting a distress signal and the shoes activate, transporting Dorothy to the Land of Ev in a beam of light. Her clothes are changed in mid flight. ===The Wizard of Oz (TV series)=== In the 1990 The Wizard of Oz television series, the Ruby Slippers are used to transport Dorothy back to Oz. They are depicted to possess other powerful magical capabilities that Dorothy did not fully understand, and as such, often served as a form of deus ex machina against hopeless situations. They are no longer depicted as high heels. A unique concept proposed by this series is that the Ruby Slippers' magic is linked to the glow of their red coloration. Their powers only function while a dim glow of red light emanates from them, initiated by Dorothy clicking her heels; and the effects of their magic immediately cease after the shoes cease to glow. Also, the Wicked Witch was once able to annul their abilities entirely, by capturing a red Luminary (teardrop-shaped creatures who control all color in Oz) and forcing him to drain the red color from the slippers themselves. However the slippers regained their powers after the Luminary escaped. This series also proposes that the slippers do not necessarily have to be on the user's feet for their powers to work, as Dorothy once used them by tapping the heels together when she held the shoes in her hands (since the ground's sandy surface prevented her from clicking the heels together). Also worth noting in a single episode, is that Truckle, the series' lead Flying Monkey, was once able to wear the Ruby Slippers and thus utilize their powerful magic for his own whims. Even with his generally dim wits and reckless disregard, the slippers gave him sufficient power to overwhelm the Wicked Witch of the West's magical attacks, and temporarily reduce her to his servant. This once again demonstrates that the shoes' users need not be a skilled/knowledgeable spellcaster, in order to gain great power. The Cowardly Lion also gets to wear them briefly. ===Once Upon a Time (TV series)=== In the Once Upon a Time television series, the Silver Slippers are first alluded to in \\"The Doctor\\", when Rumpelstiltskin sends the Mad Hatter to the Land of Oz in order to locate and retrieve the shoes so that he could travel to the Land without Magic in order to locate his lost son Balefire. In \\"It's Not Easy Being Green\\", shortly before \\"The Doctor\\", Zelena, the woman who would eventually become the Wicked Witch of the West, goes to the Wizard in order to seek out her family. Upon discovering that she was abandoned by her mother, Cora, and that her half-sister, Regina became Queen and was being trained by Rumpelstiltskin, the Wizard gives Zelena the shoes so that she can travel to the Enchanted Forest to try and replace Regina as Rumpelstiltskin's student. Upon being rejected by him, Zelena turns green with envy. She mocks Rumpelstiltskin with the power of the Silver Slippers, thus causing his later desire to obtain them. Using the Silver Slippers again she returns to Oz and dethrones the Wizard. In \\"Kansas\\" the Slippers appear again, as Zelena, posing as the Wizard of Oz, gives Dorothy the Silver Slippers in order to send her back to Kansas, in the hopes that it would keep Dorothy from becoming a powerful witch herself, and from defeating and replacing Zelena as the Witch of the West. In \\"Our Decay\\", an adult Dorothy has returned to Oz via the Slippers to face down Zelena and rescue the Scarecrow from her. In \\"Ruby Slippers\\", the Silver Slippers appear one last time, enabling travel between the Underworld and Oz so that Ruby (Red Riding Hood) can rescue Dorothy from a sleeping curse Zelena has placed her under. Zelena, who is trying to change her ways gives the Slippers over to the heroes so Ruby and Snow White can make their way back to Oz. ==Appearances in other mediaDorothy of Oz=== The Dorothy of Oz series completely revamps the Silver Shoes. They are instead depicted as red boots created by Selluriah, the Witch of the East. When Mara (codename Dorothy) stomps the heels of said boots, she takes on the form and powers of a witch. This power is channeled (rather inexpertly) through the staff Thrysos. The transformation is rather embarrassing, as it involves Mara being momentarily nude and various men are always apt to spot her. It is yet to be revealed if these boots will help Mara return home. ===Fables=== The shoes are shown in the DC comics Vertigo series Fables. Dorothy, who's portrayed as a cold, merciless assassin, found that she enjoyed killing after being hired by the Wizard to kill the Witch of the West. However, she loses them on the way back to Kansas over the Deadly Desert, and goes to great lengths to get them back. She has several encounters with Fabletown spy Cinderella, which climaxes with them facing off in the mini- series Cinderella: Fables Are Forever. After deducing that they are actually too big to fit Dorothy, Cinderella takes them and pushes her out of an airship over the Deadly Desert to her apparent death, though her body is not seen. Cinderella then looks over the shoes and decides they're just the right size to fit her. ==References== Category:Oz (franchise) Category:Shoes Category:Fictional footwear Category:Magical objects ","title":"Silver Shoes"},{"id":"19277882","text":"The STK 50 MG, formerly known as the CIS 50MG, is a gas-operated, air-cooled, belt-fed heavy machine gun developed and manufactured by Chartered Industries of Singapore (CIS, now ST Kinetics) in the late 1980s, in response to a request by the Singaporean Defence Ministry to replace the 12.7mm Browning M2HB machine guns then in ubiquitous service with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). The aim was to have a brand new heavy machine gun design, that fires the same type of .50 cal rounds as the M2HB machine guns and to have the gun parts more readily available in view of easing SAF's chain of logistics and supplies. ==Design== Close in defence aboard RSS Resilience The CIS engineers learnt from the lesson of the canceled (lack of funding) American \\"Dover Devil GPHMG\\" program known as the Special Projects Group at Picatinny Arsenal led by Charles J. Rhoades. Curt Johnson and Phil Baker developed the original concept to create a modular weapon suited for modern tactical doctrines and production techniques. In 1988, CIS introduced the new 12.7mm machine gun which was aptly named as the CIS 50MG, after two years of development and testing phase. As the STK 50 MG is a gas-operated, air-cooled, belt-fed weapon, the gun is operated using dual gas pistons, located in two gas tubes placed on either side of the barrel. The barrel is locked by means of a rotary bolt with multiple radial lugs that engages the barrel extension, eliminating the need for headspace adjustments. The CIS 50MG utilises the same \\"constant recoil\\" system used in the Ultimax 100 and it also has a quick-detachable barrel equipped with a carrying handle to facilitate the ease of barrel changing under combat situations or during operational manoeuvres. ===Features=== The one unique feature of the weapon is its dual belt-feed system, the system allows for fast and easy switching of ammunition from standard ball rounds to the Raufoss Mk 211 Armor-Piercing-Incendiary rounds or the Saboted light armor penetrator (SLAP), which are capable of penetrating a rolled homogeneous armour plate with a thickness of from a range of . Such systems are more commonly used in modern automatic cannons such as the M242 Bushmaster 25mm cannon and the Mk44 Bushmaster II 30mm cannon, both of which are also in use by the Singapore Army's Bionix AFVs. ==Users== * : In service with the Bangladeshi military. * : Licensed production by PT Pindad as the Pindad SMB- QCB (Senapan Mesin Berat-Quick Change Barrel) for the Indonesian military.

Known formerly as Rift Valley University College, RVU was granted full-fledged university status in 2014 by Ethiopia's Ministry of Education. ==Founding== Five persons founded the university in 2000: * Dinku Deyasa, an investor in Ethiopia and owner of NFYD PLC, * Dr. Haileleul Zeleke (Assistant Professor), * Frezewed Lemma (lecturer) from Adama University (the then Nazareth Technical Teachers’ College), * Reta Bekele, lawyer, * The first batch of students set foot on RVU's first campus in Adama in October 2000. It began with a capital of 1,300,000 Eth. Birr, 154 evening program students, and five part-time staff. Prior to launch, a survey was conducted to identify the fields of study most desired by the community in and around Adama and Asella towns. On the basis of the findings, academic programs commenced at a diploma level in five fields of study, namely Accounting, Computer Science, Law, Marketing Management, and Secretarial Science and Office Management. The Asella satellite campus was launched three months later with Accounting, Law and Marketing Management fields of study. This new learning community was housed in one rented block that consisted of a single administrative office and a few classrooms. By the end of 2000/2001 academic year, total enrolment at the two locations was about 250 students in the five diploma programs of study. ==Accreditation== The first accreditation by the Ministry of Education in five diploma level programs of study was earned in 2001 from HERQA and TVET Commissions. In September 2003 and 2004, Gotera and Batu (Ziway) campuses came into being respectively; Bishoftu campus was launched two years later followed by Dire Dawa and Chiro, which begun to operate in August 2005. Bole and Gullele campuses came into being in October 2005. Harar campus was established in October 2006. When the institution was empowered to grant a bachelor's degree, Accounting, Business Management and Law were the first academic programs on offer at the Adama campus. ==Campuses== At the start of the 2015/2016 academic year, RVU operated in many campuses country-wide, one campus in Somaliland and seven distance education centers, each with more than a dozen branch coordination units throughout the country. Through these centers, RVU is able to reach students in remote parts of the country and beyond. After conducting an evaluation of its systems, physical facilities, and learning resources of its campuses and faculties, the Ministry of Education, in collaboration with Higher Education Relevance and Quality Agency (HERQA), granted Rift Valley the status of a full-fledged University in August 2014. ==Programs and partnerships== RVU offers more than 20 undergraduate and five graduate programs in business, technology, health and social science fields. RVU provides dozens of Technical Education and Vocational Training programs at all levels. The university has collaborative partnerships and affiliations with higher learning and research institutions, health service providers, professional associations, industries, and financial institutions locally and internationally. ==Branches of Rift Valley University== Abichu, Adama, Ambo, Asella, Bahir Dar,Bale Robe, Batu, Bishoftu, Bole, Burayu, Chaffe, Chiro, Dire dawa, DembiDollo, Gelan, Gotera, Gullele, Harar, Hawasa, Jimma, Jigjiga, Kality, Kemise, Lancha, Lebu Lafto, Lege Tafo, Mekele, Meri Goro, Mojo, Negele, Nekemte, Shashemene, Sululta, Waliso, W/Sodo, Yeka, Metahara, wolenchiti, Diregerfersa ==References *Official website Category:2000 establishments in Ethiopia Category:Universities and colleges in Ethiopia ","title":"Rift Valley University College"},{"id":"19277936","text":"Darren John Lavett (October 31, 1964 – October 11, 2012) was an American music video director, who directed videos for The Offspring, Bad Religion, Bush, Voodoo Glow Skulls, Claw Hammer, Testament and several other bands.

The basis for its public law is the 1980 Constitution, reformed in 1989 and 2005. According to it Chile is a democratic republic. There is a clear separation of functions, between the President of the Republic, the Congress, the judiciary and a Constitutional Court. See Politics of Chile. On the other hand, private relationships are governed, mainly, by the Chilean Civil Code, most of which has not been amended in 150 years. There are also several laws outside the Code that deal with most of the business law. == Public law  Constitution=== The current Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile, approved by Chilean voters in a tightly controlled plebiscite on September 11, 1980 under Augusto Pinochet, and made effective on March 11, 1981, has been amended in 1989, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2005. In 2005 over 50 reforms were approved, which eliminated some of the remaining undemocratic areas of the text, such as the existence of non-elected Senators (appointed senators, or senators for life) and the inability of the President to remove the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. These reforms led the President to controversially declare Chile's transition to democracy as complete. There is a constitutional court (Tribunal Constitucional) with the competence to declare a singular law \\"not applicable\\" to an individual case (inaplicabilidad por inconstitucionalidad) and, having declared that at least once, the unconstitutionality of that law in general. === Administrative law === The President of the Republic must fulfill the administrative function, in collaboration with several Ministries or other authorities with ministerial rank. Each Ministry has one or more sub secretaries. The actual satisfaction of public needs is performed through public services, dependant or at least related to one of those sub secretaries. All Ministries and public services have a body of workers or administrative personnel (funcionarios públicos). Public property is subject to privileges and burdens, because it serves public purposes. The sea, rivers and lakes, mines and natural reservations belong to the state and may be used by \\"anyone\\", but when individual exploitation is possible then it is in the hands of privates. On the other hand, buildings, cars and other supplies that are necessary for the work of public agencies are also property of the state. Public entities act through administrative procedures, that is, processes with formal stages where opportunities to deliver evidence and exercise appeals are granted to the citizens. The recent basic law of administrative procedures deals with most of the general matters pertaining the administrative procedures of all public entities. There is not a singular Administrative court to deal with actions against the administrative entities, but several specialized courts and procedures of review. However, civil courts have jurisdiction over all matter that are not in the scope of other tribunal, such as public liability and the overturn of single administrative acts. === Regulation === Since the privatization of most economic activities in the 1980s, the President and the independent agencies became the main policy makers regarding the regulation of the economy, subordinated to legislation. The exploitation of mines and water resources is given in concession to private entrepreneurs. All activities that can have a significant impact on the environment must obtain an administrative authorization and are subject to heavy regulation by several different agencies. There are agencies (Superintendencias) dealing with: * Electricity and Fuels (Superintendencia de Electricidad y Combustibles, SEC), * Water Supply and Treatment (Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios, SISS), * Banking and Finance (Superintendencia de Bancos e Instituciones Financieras, SBIF), * Stock Exchange and Insurances (Superintendencia de Valores y Seguros, SVS), * Casinos (Superintendencia de Casinos de Juegos, SCJ) * Bankruptcy (Superintendencia de Insolvencia y Reemprendimiento, SIR), * Environmental Protection (Superintendencia de Medio Ambiente, SMA), * Pensions and Retirement Funds (Superintendencia de Pensiones, SP), * Social Security (Superintendencia de Seguridad Social, SUSESO), * Health (Superintendencia de Salud), * Education (Superintendenica de Educación), etc. == Private law  Civil Code === The Civil Code of the Republic of Chile is the work of the Chilean-Venezuelan jurist and legislator Andrés Bello. After several years of individual work (though officially presented as the work of multiple Congress commissions), Congress passed the Civil Code into law on 14 December 1855, and came into force on 1 January 1857. The Code has kept in force since then though it has been the object of numerous alterations. The main modernisations the code has undergone have affected family law and the law of successions. On one hand, these reforms have introduced more equal relations between men and women and, on the other, they have eliminated discriminations between children born from married couples and those born extramaritally. Being part of the civil law tradition, there is no obedience to precedent in Chilean law. Nevertheless, sentences of a higher court can be appealed to the Supreme Court based in the erroneous application of the law, thus being able to deliver uniform decisions in controversial matters of law. See Judiciary of Chile. === Commerce === Though the Commerce Code of 1868 was the main source of business law, nowadays the legislation is widely spread in many legislative bodies. For instance, both the Civil Code and the Commerce Code deal with the basic matters of enterprises, but Corporations and limited liability enterprises have a statute of its own. Recently the law of bankruptcy has been incorporated in the Commerce Code, in a process of re-codification. Matters such as banking and the stock exchange are strongly regulated by government agencies and therefore are subject to public scrutiny. Recently, these agencies have fined important executives for insider trading . ==Criminal Law== Since the year 2000, Chilean criminal procedure is experiencing one of the most important legal reforms of the country's history, completely replacing an inquisitory procedure by an accusatory system, very similar to that of Germany or the United States. While the prosecution is in charge of an autonomous authority (Ministerio Público), the actual judgement is made by a collegiate court (Tribunal de Juicio Oral en lo Penal). Trials are public and verbal. However, the law grants several alternatives to the defendant so as to avoid the trial, but, at the same time, grant the victim's satisfaction and the public safety. The Chilean Criminal Code, which defines the conducts that constitute an offense and the applicable conviction, dates back to 1874. It was greatly inspired by the Spanish Code of 1848 and the Belgian Code of 1867. The Code has been widely criticized, and the Ministry of Justice is studying a complete replacement by the year 2010 . ==See also== *History of Chile *Economy of Chile ==References== *Brief review of Chile's constitutional history - Chile's Library of Congress (in Spanish) *Vergara Blanco, Alejandro, \\"Panorama General del Derecho Administrativo Chileno\\", in Santiago González- Varas (dir.)

Brien, 763 N.W.2d 862 (Iowa 2009), was an Iowa Supreme Court case in which the Court unanimously held that the state's limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples violated the equal protection clause of the Iowa Constitution. The case had the effect of legally recognizing same-sex marriage in Iowa. In 2007, a lower court had granted summary judgment in favor of six same-sex couples who sued Timothy Brien, Polk County Recorder, for refusing to grant them marriage licenses. In 2010, Iowa voters defeated the retention of three of the judges responsible for the decision. However, in 2012, voters retained the one judge who participated in the decision and whose term would otherwise have ended, following various polls showing that a majority of Iowans support marriage equality. ==Issue== Six same-sex couples went to the Office of the Polk County Recorder in Des Moines, Iowa, at various times between November 2005 and January 2006 in an attempt to apply for marriage licenses. Each couple's application was denied because in each case the couple was composed of two people of the same sex, and Iowa law only permitted couples composed of one man and one woman to marry.The Iowa legislature amended the marriage statute in 1998. Iowa Code section 595.2(1) provided \\"[o]nly a marriage between a male and a female is valid.\\" See Iowa Supreme Court decision, p. 8. The couples filed suit in Polk County District Court, arguing that this law violated certain rights guaranteed by the Iowa constitution.See Iowa Constitution, Article I, Section 6: \\"All laws of a general nature shall have a uniform operation; the general assembly shall not grant to any citizen, or class of citizens, privileges or immunities, which, upon the same terms shall not equally belong to all citizens.\\" ==District Court ruling== Judge Robert Hanson of Polk County District Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on August 30, 2007. He ruled that the marriage statute was unconstitutional, and that the Polk County Recorder was required to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples who otherwise meet the requirements for marriage. Hanson's ruling states, in part, that: Judge Hanson issued a stay of his ruling on August 31, 2007, in anticipation of an appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court. One same-sex couple was able to obtain a marriage license in the brief time between Hanson's ruling and the stay. ==Iowa Supreme Court ruling== A rally held in Iowa City following Varnum v. Brien. The purple placecard in the center shows Iowa's state motto. Polk County appealed Hanson's ruling to the Iowa Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on December 9, 2008. There were 24 amicus curiae briefs filed with the court. In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Mark S. Cady, the Court affirmed Hanson's decision on April 3, 2009. The Supreme Court initially stated its duty to protect the right of individuals:Iowa Supreme Court decision, page 15. The Court noted that Iowa has a long history of progressive thought on civil rights. Seventeen years before the Dred Scott decision, the Iowa Supreme Court \\"refused to treat a human being as property to enforce a contract for slavery and held our laws must extend equal protection to persons of all races and conditions.\\"Iowa Supreme Court decision, page 17. Eighty-six years before \\"separate but equal\\" was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled such practices unconstitutional in Iowa. In 1869, Iowa was the first state in the union to admit women to the bar and allow them to practice law. Three years later the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the State of Illinois's decision to deny women admission to the bar. The Court stated that the equal protection clause of the Iowa Constitution requires that laws treat alike all those who are similarly situated with respect to the purposes of the law,Iowa Supreme Court decision, page 27. and concluded that homosexual persons are similarly situated compared to heterosexual persons for purposes of Iowa's marriage laws.Iowa Supreme Court decision, page 28. The Court applied the standard of review known as intermediate scrutiny to assess the government's objectives as described by the county: maintaining traditional marriage, promotion of an optimal environment to raise children, promotion of procreation, promotion of stability in opposite-sex relationships and conservation of resources.Iowa Supreme Court decision, pages 52-63. The Court concluded that:Iowa Supreme Court decision, page 67. But the court noted the national development of gay rights in both Lawrence v. Texas and Romer v. Evans, and it cited discussion in these cases as evidence of a history of discrimination against gays and lesbians. Because plaintiffs brought a state constitutional claim, the state Supreme Court was not constrained by federal precedents, and the decision was not subject to review by a federal court. On April 27, 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court issued a procedendo directing the Iowa District Court for the County of Polk to \\"proceed in the manner required by law and consistent with the opinion of the court.\\" The court's decision became effective with the issuance of the procedendo.Attorney General issues statement on gay marriage ruling . Radio Iowa Blog, April 3, 2009. ==Reaction== In a joint press release on April 3, Iowa House Speaker Pat Murphy and Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal welcomed the court's decision, saying \\"When all is said and done, we believe the only lasting question about today's events will be why it took us so long. It is a tough question to answer because treating everyone fairly is really a matter of Iowa common sense and Iowa common decency. Iowa has always been a leader in the area of civil rights.\\"Iowa Supreme Court: Gay marriage ban illegal , Southwest Iowa News, April 3, 2009 Iowa State Senator Matt McCoy, who is openly gay, welcomed the decision, calling it \\"a red letter day for the state of Iowa.\\" The state Senate Republican leader, Paul McKinley, expressed disappointment and called for a constitutional amendment that \\"protects traditional marriage.\\" Iowa Governor Chet Culver stated that he was \\"reluctant to support amending the Iowa Constitution to add a provision that our Supreme Court has said is unlawful and discriminatory.\\"There are two ways to amend the Iowa constitution. One way is for an amendment to pass the legislature in two successive sessions, then be approved by a popular vote. The other is for a popular vote to convene a constitutional convention and then have any amendments approved by a popular vote. The people of Iowa are given the option of forming a constitutional convention every ten years in Iowa. Critics contended that court rulings that grant same-sex couples the right to marry overstep the constitutional authority of the judicial branch, that such decisions should be left to more representative processes such as legislation and ballot-initiatives. Others contended that equal treatment under the law and due process with respect to denying same-sex couples the right to marry unequivocally deserved a response from the court. In declaring the DOMA statute an unconstitutional violation the Iowa's equal protection clause, the court referred to the constitutional provision declaring such statutes \\"void.\\" Following the decision, groups opposed to same-sex marriage organized a campaign against Chief Justice Marsha Ternus, Justice David L. Baker, and Justice Michael Streit in their subsequent retention election, \\"with heavy support from out-of-state conservative and religious groups.\\" All three were dismissed by Iowa voters on November 2, 2010, marking the first time an Iowa Supreme Court justice was not retained since the retention system was adopted for Iowa justices in 1962. In 2012, the three of them received Profile In Courage Awards from the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. In presenting the award, Caroline Kennedy said: In the November 6, 2012, election, voters retained Justice David Wiggins, the one judge who participated in Varnum whose retention was on the ballot, by a 54% to 46% margin. ==See also== * Same-sex marriage in the United States * LGBT rights in Iowa * Baker v.

It is the only high school in the Seymour Community Schools district. ==History== Prior to 1870, an iron fence separated a tract of forest land from the growing town of Seymour. In that year the tree-covered plot was leased by the town school board and work began on a three-story brick building facing the east. The heirs of Captain Meedy Shields later gave this land to the city for school purposes. Here stood the first Shields High School, surrounded by trees and for many years bordered on the west by a pond. On the first floor were two grade rooms and the public library; on the second, two grade rooms and the superintendent's office; and on the third, the music room and the assembly room. In 1876 there had been an addition of six rooms, but the growing population of Seymour now demanded even more space if the supply of rooms was to meet the needs of the pupils. In 1911, a new school building arose on the foundations of the old. This building is the one which houses the Shields Junior High School today. It was not long until sports and inter- school competition came into prominence. By 1922 students and citizens alike complained of the smallness of the Shields gymnasium, so in 1922 a south wing was added to the school. This contained an auditorium-gymnasium and above it six classrooms. In the middle of the 1930s sports fans again began to clamor for a gymnasium big enough to house all the Owl supporters and in November 1937 a fire-proof structure with a capacity of 3308 was begun as a WPA project. The seating capacity was later expanded to 3800. In September 1959, Shields High School was moved to completely new facilities on at the west edge of Seymour. The 9th grade remained, along with grades 7 and 8, in the Shields High School facilities and became known as the Shields Junior High School. In addition to classroom and laboratory facilities, the new two-story building contained the school's administrative ad guidance offices, a 110-seat library, an 1100-seat auditorium, and a 300-seat cafeteria. In 1960 the football stadium and an all-purpose track were added to the high school campus. In 1968 work began on a new gymnasium, indoor swimming pool, and a separate academic facility consisting of ten classrooms, two science labs, and two industrial arts labs. These new facilities were ready for occupancy in the fall of 1970, and at that time, ninth grade students again became part of the high school. The gymnasium, dedicated in 1970, seats 8,228 and ranks as the largest high school gym in the United States. It was renamed in honor of Lloyd E. Scott in 1998, who coached the boys’ basketball team from 1961-1974. A fourth building, the power heating plant, varsity and reserve baseball diamonds, and eight tennis courts are also located on campus. Lloyd E. Scott Gymnasium, the nation's largest high school gym In 1988, the library and business classrooms above the library were renovated and enlarged, and an additional computer lab was constructed for the business department. In 1992, the guidance and administrative offices were renovated and enlarged. In 1997 a two-year, $18 million renovation and building expansion project that included the construction of a new auxiliary gym, a new science wing, a hallway linkage between the original building and the 1968 building, and extensive remodeling of all classrooms, the cafeteria, and the Earl D. Prout was completed. In the spring of 2000 ground was broken on a major renovation of the stadium including the remodeling of locker rooms and the construction of a new weight and training room. In 2007, the girls softball facility was completely remodeled including the construction of dugouts and an announcers' booth. An indoor multi-purpose athletic facility was also constructed adjacent to the varsity baseball field. In 2011, due to a flood, the street in front of the Auditorium had to be removed and replaced. In 2016, a new turf soccer field and stadium were built on the west side of the school grounds.

Shields has played for thirteen separate clubs in Scotland, England and Malta, in a career spanning three decades. ==CareerRaith & Sunderland=== Beginning his career in Kirkcaldy with Raith Rovers, Shields scored in his first full start for the side in a match against Airdrieonians. After a successful start for The Rovers, Shields earned a move to Sunderland in December 2002, in a deal though to be worth up to £100,000. Despite spending three years at the Stadium of Light, Shields never made a first-team appearance and was loaned to Scarborough scoring nine goals and then to Doncaster Rovers during his time in England. In January 2003, Shields returned to Raith on a free transfer, two years after leaving. ===Brechin, Cowdenbeath & Gretna=== Released after only spending a few months on his return as club went into administration Stark's Park, Shields joined Brechin City at the start of the 2003–04 season, only to move on loan closer to his home town Cowdenbeath. Cowden made the move permanent in early 2004, tying Shields to a two-and-a-half-year contract. A year later, Cowdenbeath chairman Gordon McDougall said it would take an \\"exceptional offer\\" to sell Shields after interest from Gretna and Hearts, and it was Gretna's offer that saw Shields move to the Scottish Borders club in January 2005, where he made only three substitute appearances in what was the remainder of Gretna's title-winning season. He took part in the side's historic Scottish Cup run, playing in the Scottish cup Semi-final at Hampden park against Dundee. Shields was loaned to Scottish First Division side Stranraer in the first few weeks of the 2005–06 season. On his return to Raydale Park, Shields played nine matches of Gretna's second successive title win, missing out on a winner's medal by one match. Shields was loaned out again at the start of the following season, this time to Stirling Albion, scoring nine goals in eighteen games, and although he played one match for Gretna on his return, it was to be his last before a January 2007 move to Ross County. ===Ross County, East Fife & Raith=== Shields spent two and half years in Dingwall winning the Scottish Second Division, scoring fourteen goals in thirty-six appearances. In September 2008, Shields made East Fife his eleventh club when he joined on loan for the rest of the year, failing to score in ten appearances for the Methil side. On 19 February 2010 after being a free agent he re-signed for Raith Rovers. ===Malta=== Shields signed for Hamrun Spartans in the Maltese Premier League in August 2010, spending two seasons with the side and scoring eighteen goals in twenty-eight games. Shields then signed for Xewkija Tigers in the Gozo First Division. In his first season with the club Shields scored eighteen goals, finishing as the side top scorer. His second season with The Tigers ended in a similar fashion to the first, with Shields again scoring eighteen goals in eighteen matches. In his final season with Xewkija, Shields helped the club win their seventh league title, scoring in a match against Kerċem Ajax. ===Return to Scotland=== After five years in Malta, Shields returned to Scotland signing for Scottish League One side Brechin City for a second time. Shields lasted only six months in his homeland, leaving the club in January 2016 to return to Malta for personal reasons, making his final appearance in a league match against Stenhousemuir which was abandoned after 45 minutes. Shields made 9 appearances for the City, scoring 2 goals. ==Statistics== {   - ! colspan=3  Club performance ! colspan=2  League ! colspan=2  Cup ! colspan=2  League Cup ! colspan=2  Total - !

It was subsequently translated into English by William Weaver in 1973. The novel is set in the city of Turin, and deals with the investigation of commissioner Santamaria about the murder of an architect of dubious fame, Garrone. Among the protagonists are Anna Carla Dosio, a beautiful and rich woman, and her friend Massimo Campi, a rich homosexual, who, while playing an intellectual game, had the architect Garrone killed in a letter. Later in the novel, Campi's boyfriend, Lello, a municipal clerk who was investigating by himself on the murder, is also killed. In the end of the novel, suspicions against the two are raised when Santamaria discovers that Garrone had been killed for his blackmailing, related to a project for a new quarter of buildings, against an old woman. The book is notable for its ironic portrait of Turin's bourgeoisie. It is also considered one of the first examples of modern Italian crime novels. ==Film== A movie with the same title, directed by Luigi Comencini, was released in 1976, starring Marcello Mastroianni as Santamaria, Jacqueline Bisset as Anna Carla and Jean-Louis Trintignant as Massimo.

Maghsoudlou has, in the words of Cinema Without Borders editor-in-chief Bijan Tehrani, \\"dedicated his life [to] recording valuable information about Iran’s contemporary art and culture.\\" Bahman Maghsoudlou by Pouria Afkhami Pixoos 03 ==Career== Bahman Maghsoudlou is the recipient of Iran's Forough Farrokhzad literary award for writing and editing a series of books about cinema and theater (1975), including Iranian Cinema (1987, New York University's Center for Middle Eastern Studies). He was presented this award at the fourth Forough Farrokhzad awards ceremony, held at the Central Palace for Young Adults in February 1975. Bahman Maghsoudlou by Pouria Afkhami Pixoos 02 Maghsoudlou wrote, directed and produced a short documentary on artist Ardeshir Mohasses called Ardeshir Mohasses & His Caricatures in 1972. This would turn out to be the first in a series of films on Iran's most important artistic figures, the Great Iranian Artists series, although the follow-ups would not be produced for many years afterwards. In 1998, he produced Ahmad Shamlou: Master Poet of Liberty which was subsequently followed by Ahmad Mahmoud: A Noble Novelist in 2004 and Iran Darroudi: The Painter of Ethereal Moments in 2009. Maghsoudlou served as director for the latter two of these films, as he has for all but one of the films in the series. A 2013 addition to the series was an update to his earlier film on Mohasses, entitled Ardeshir Mohasses: The Rebellious Artist. Maghsoudlou had long wished to update his earlier film on his friend and the inspiration came after two occurrences in 2008: a long overdue retrospective of Mohasses's work at the Asia Society in New York City and the artist's untimely passing. The new film features interviews with prominent critics and friends from around the world and emphasizes the eternal truth in Mohasses's struggles with censorship. The film had its world premiere in April 2013 at the Palm Beach International Film Festival. The next addition to the series was 2013's Abbas Kiarostami: A Report, a look at the work of acclaimed Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami, examining the themes and techniques that have run through his body of work, with a particular focus on his debut feature, The Report. The film had its world premiere at the Montreal International Film Festival and was also featured at the 2016 Festival International du Film d'Histoire in Pessac, France, in a special section dedicated to Kiarostami. This was Maghsoudlou's first feature-length documentary, and as well as being an entry in the Renowned Iranian Artists series, it is also the first installment in another series, Iranian Cinema, Searching for the Roots. This new series, as planned, will have ten parts. Bahman Maghsoudlou by Pouria Afkhami Pixoos 05 Maghsoudlou's next feature documentary, released in 2016, was called Razor's Edge: The Legacy of Iranian Actresses. This film, like the Kiarostami film, served as the next entry in both the Iranian Cinema series and the Renowned Iranian Artists series. Through copious interviews with the most prominent actresses of the pre-Revolutionary period (including Pouri Banayi, Susan Taslimi, Irene Zazians (a.k.a. Iren) and Shohreh Aghdashloo) and an abundance of rare clips from their films, the documentary examines the role of women in Iranian cinema from both cultural and artistic standpoints. In an article in Asharq Al-Awsat, journalist Amir Taheri wrote that the film \\"contains a number of exciting surprises,\\" also noting that the interviews with the actresses \\"[shed] light on a chunk of Iran's contemporary history\\" and \\"[remind] us that it was always difficult to be a woman in Iran even under the Shah, and that being a film actress was even more of a gamble.\\" The next film, the third to represent both series, focuses on filmmaker, critic and playwright Bahram Beyzai, and is called Bahram Beyzaie: A Mosaic of Metaphors. As a producer, Mr. Maghsoudlou's films have been to more than 100 film festivals worldwide. These films include: The Suitors, selected for the Cannes in 1988; Manhattan by Numbers (by Amir Naderi), selected for Venice and Toronto 1993; Seven Servants by Daryush Shokof, selected for Berlin, Toronto and Locarno 1996, and Silence of the Sea, selected for the Mannheim Film Festival 2003. Along with Iranian Cinema: Searching for the Roots, Maghsoudlou is also working on another long-term documentary project, The Life and Legacy of Mohammad Mossadegh. Having organized the first ever Iranian Film Festival in New York in 1980, he organized the International Short Film Festival: Independent Films on Iran, which was held in October 2007, in New York. In 2009, Maghsoudlou authored the book Grass: Untold Stories which detailed the background stories related to the making of the 1925 silent movie, Grass. A major part of the movie had been filmed in Maghsoudlou's native Iran. Bahman Maghsoudlou by Pouria Afkhami Pixoos 01 A graduate in cinema studies from the College of Staten Island with a PhD from Columbia University, Maghsoudlou lives in New Jersey. He became a member of the prestigious list of PEN American Center in 2011. Maghsoudlou has served as a jury member for a number of prestigious international film festivals. He had the honor of being the lone non-Spanish member of the jury for the 3rd Edition of the Ibn Arabi International Film Festival (IBAFF) (held March 5 through 10th in Murcia, Spain), serving alongside a group of notables of the Spanish film scene, including Alberto Elena. And most recently he served as president of the jury for the Zeniths for the Best First Fiction Feature Films section of the 2014 Montreal World Film Festival. ==Filmography== {  - ! Year !

It was the last tour with founding member and rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young, who left the band in September 2014 due to ill health and it was also the last tour with longtime drummer Phil Rudd who was charged in November 2014 for hiring a hitman to murder someone and possession of drugs. They were replaced by Stevie Young and Chris Slade respectively. This was also the last full tour to feature longtime lead vocalist Brian Johnson as he left the band halfway during the Rock or Bust World Tour due to hearing problems and was replaced by Axl Rose. On September 30, 2020, AC/DC officially confirmed that Johnson and Rudd has rejoined the band for a new studio album and possibly tour, signaling that the “Black Ice” tour may not be the last tour with Rudd, and the last full tour with Johnson. The tour began in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States in late October 2008. By spring 2010, the tour had reached North America, Europe, South America, Oceania and Asia. The three concerts at River Plate were filmed and recorded, and were later released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc. The outdoor concerts outside of United States also had the red Angus Young Devil hats on the stage set. The tour ended up being the most successful by AC/DC, grossing roughly $441.1 million, making it the fourth highest-grossing concert tour of all-time. ===History=== The tour began with a North American leg, kicking off in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in late October and continuing until late December. The initial leg was met with unprecedented demand, with 18 record sell-outs across the continent. A second North American leg commenced in January 2009, ultimately culminating later in the month in Nashville, Tennessee. In February 2009, the group began their first round of European shows, beginning in Oslo and wrapping up in Birmingham, U.K. in April. One of two dates scheduled in Antwerp, Belgium was cancelled after lead singer Brian Johnson fell ill. On 29 March, the concert in Zürich, Switzerland was postponed due to undisclosed \\"technical difficulties\\" and was rescheduled for 6 April. In May 2009, the band commenced a second European leg – all in outdoor stadiums and venues – beginning in Leipzig, Germany and ended the following month in Glasgow, Scotland. In July 2009, the band started a third leg of North America, playing a mix of outdoor and indoor venues. The tour reached many Canadian markets that had been missed on the previous two legs. A fourth leg, which included dates in Mexico and Puerto Rico, followed in October and November. The initial six dates on the leg were postponed after Johnson underwent a medical procedure which subsequently required rest. Five of these shows were ultimately rescheduled for spring 2010; one date to be held in Phoenix, Arizona was cancelled due to a \\"scheduling conflict\\". In November and December 2009, the band headed to South America, playing shows in Brazil and Argentina. The concerts in Buenos Aires were filmed for the DVD Live at River Plate, to be released on 10 May 2011. Footage was also used in the video for \\"Shoot to Thrill\\", on the Iron Man 2 soundtrack, along with another video with footage and audio from the Buenos Aires shows of \\"Highway to Hell\\" which is also featured in the Iron Man 2 soundtrack. Earlier in November, it was falsely reported that a group of fans had issued a complaint to the band, criticising the setlist; it was merely a request to mix up the current touring setlist. In January 2010, the group began a round of dates in New Zealand, subsequently reaching their native Australia in February. The Australian shows were the fastest selling concerts in the history of the country, with extra dates added in most markets due to demand. In early February, Johnson responded to the internet fans who had asked for a setlist change, saying \\"Fuck them\\", and that the stage show was too complicated for them to change songs easily. Following the Australian tour, which ended in Perth, Western Australia, the group played three shows in Japan. On the Oceania tour leg from 28 January 2010 – 8 March 2010, \\"High Voltage\\" was played in tribute to Bon Scott around the 30th anniversary of his death. Scott appeared on the screen during the chorus. In April 2010, the band returned to the United States to play the five shows rescheduled from October 2009. Later that month, Iron Man 2 – soundtrack to the film of the same name – was released. It comprised a host of the group's hits and lesser-known songs from early to recent years, and debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 album chart. In May 2010, the band commenced a third leg of Europe, which included an appearance at the Download Festival in the U.K. \\"The reports that AC/DC believe their record-breaking fourth appearance at the Donington site to be their own gig, rather than part of the festival, is compounded by the fact that they've brought their own stage,\\" remarked Classic Rock. \\"In Brian Johnson's grunted banter between songs there's no reference to this being anything other than another AC/DC gig, but another AC/DC gig these days is better than almost anything else you're gonna see.\\"Johnston, Emma; Ewing, Jerry; Selzer, Jonathan; Milas, Alexander; Ling, Dave, \\"Reviews: Download festival\\"; Classic Rock No. 148, August 2010, p111 In Oslo in late May, the group were forced to cut their set short due to the local curfew, after an aircraft malfunction caused a delay to the band's arrival. \\"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\\" was omitted from the setlist for the first time since 30 July 2003. The tour wrapped up in Bilbao, Spain at Estadio San Mamés in late June. The tour won the \\"Major Tour of the Year\\" award at the 2009 Pollstar Concert Industry Awards. The tour was also nominated in the \\"Top Tour\\" and \\"Top Draw\\" categories at the 2009 Billboard Touring Awards. According to Billboard, the tour \\"has clearly tapped into a demand for AC/DC, resulting from the band's eight-year absence from touring, and takes its place as one of the band's most successful tours.\\" By the tour's culmination, the group had played over 160 shows to approximately 4.9 million people. It was one of history's highest grossing concert tours, grossing $441.6 million, third behind The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang Tour, which grossed $558.3 million in the mid-2000s, and U2's 360° Tour, which grossed $736.1 million in 2011. It dropped to fourth place after Roger Waters' The Wall Live tour when the latter ended in 2013. ==Personnel== ;AC/DC *Brian Johnson – lead vocals *Angus Young – lead guitar *Malcolm Young – rhythm guitar and background vocals *Cliff Williams – bass and background vocals *Phil Rudd – drums ==Tour dates== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" !width=\\"150\\"Date !width=\\"170\\"City !width=\\"170\\"Country !width=\\"275\\"Venue !width=\\"170\\"Tickets sold / Available !width=\\"170\\"Revenue - - ddd;\\" colspan=\\"6\\"North America - 28 October 2008 Wilkes-Barre  rowspan=\\"5\\"United States Wachovia Arena at Casey Plaza - 30 October 2008 rowspan=\\"2\\"Rosemont rowspan=\\"2\\"Allstate Arena rowspan=\\"2\\"27,770 / 27,770 rowspan=\\"2\\"$2,485,415 - 1 November 2008 - 3 November 2008 Indianapolis Conseco Fieldhouse 14,458 / 14,458 $1,314,215 - 5 November 2008 Auburn Hills The Palace of Auburn Hills 15,189 / 15,189 $1,276,091 - 7 November 2008 Toronto Canada Rogers Centre - 9 November 2008 Boston rowspan=\\"9\\"United States TD Banknorth Garden 13,718 / 13,718 $1,255,040 - 12 November 2008 rowspan=\\"2\\"New York City rowspan=\\"2\\"Madison Square Garden rowspan=\\"2\\"28,136 / 28,136 rowspan=\\"2\\"$2,465,450 - 13 November 2008 - 15 November 2008 Washington, D.C.

The film was originally titled Jayne Mansfield: A Symbol of the '50s. The script is based on the book Jayne Mansfield and the American Fifties by Martha Saxton. It originally aired on CBS on October 29, 1980. The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made. ==Plot== The film tells the fictionalized rise and fall of Hollywood bombshell and sex symbol Jayne Mansfield. The Jayne Mansfield Story opens in 1967 in Mississippi with Jayne Mansfield closing a show and then talking on a payphone with Mickey Hargitay about going on a new tour together. Intercut with scenes of Mansfield getting into a car and then crashing when the driver tries to overtake a spray truck is film of a teleprinter typing out the news of Mansfield's death. An announcer reads the text over both scenes. The film then goes to credits, intercut with still images of Mansfield as a child and young woman. The next scene is of an unnamed woman interviewing Hargitay about Mansfield (Hargitay's graying hair indicates that this is some time after her death). Hargitay shows her photos including one where a dark-haired Mansfield poses with a chimpanzee as a publicity stunt to promote a film premiere at the theater where she worked as a popcorn salesperson. (Hargitay narrates throughout the rest of the film). At a scene from the theater and at home Mansfield expresses her desire to act in films and she is shown as a single mother, taking care of her only daughter Jayne Marie after the father left because he disagreed with her acting ambition. In the next scene Mansfield approaches talent agent Bob Garrett on the street (whom she met, off-screen, at the premiere). She manages to convince Garrett to give her an audition for a one line part in a film after pushing her chest out and declaring that she has something more than Marilyn Monroe. At the audition, Mansfield declines to read the line given to her, opting instead to read a line from Come Back, Little Sheba. She doesn't get the part. Meeting later with Garrett, Mansfield makes a high pitched cooing sound and strikes a pose, asking rhetorically if this is what they want. Garrett tells her she might be on to something and tells her to lose weight and change her hair. Mansfield states that she'll project an airheaded bimbo image until her career gets going and then she'll switch to more serious roles. A month later Mansfield meets with Garrett at a car dealership, with blonde hair and wearing a pink polka-dot dress, she's received a pink Cadillac for free as promotion. Next, Mansfield appears at the Southern California press club (courtesy of Garrett to raise her profile), handing out Christmas presents while wearing a white fur trimmed bikini top and bottom. At a Florida poolside photoshoot, Mansfield pretends to fall in the pool (losing her bikini top in the process), shouting that she can't swim to get the attention of the photographers who eagerly take pictures of her. ==Cast== * Loni Anderson as Jayne Mansfield * Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mickey Hargitay * Ray Buktenica as Bob Garrett * Kathleen Lloyd as Carol Sue Peters * G.

It is widely used in practice to reduce or alter dosing for targeted radiation therapy. ==Compensating for missing tissue or irregular tissue shape== It must be possible to mould the bolus to fill the tissue space. Lincolnshire and Spier's bolus, which is loosely packed in polyethylene bags, is suitable as the bolus bags take the shape of the skin surface these bags are easily smoothed to achieve a flat surface. ==Modifying dose at the skin surface and at depth== A specific thickness of bolus can be applied to the skin to alter the dose received at depth in the tissue and on the skin surface. A typical example of this is the application of a defined thickness of bolus to a chest wall for post-mastectomy chest wall treatment, to increase the skin dose. The thickness of bolus applied is dependent on the skin dose required and the angle of incidence of the treatment beams. For example if oblique 6 MV beams are used for tangential pair, 1 cm of bolus effectively becomes 1.5 cm, i.e., \\"full bolus\\". When a full bolus is applied, bolus thickness equal to the depth of the build-up region removes the skin- sparing effect of a megavoltage x-ray beam. ==Pliable bolus== Suitable material must be pliable and easily moulded to the skin surface, but retain a constant thickness. One example includes paraffin gauze. ==Rigid bolus== For smaller areas which do not require the bolus to be moulded over the skin, Perspex can be used. The use of Perspex bolus is advantageous for electron set-ups because it is transparent. Since the f.s.d. for most electron fields is 95 cm, so that the movements of the couch are not isocentric, inaccuracies may arise for aligning angled fields when an opaque bolus is inserted. ==Positioning bolus in the treatment beam== To ensure that the patient receives the required dose, bolus of the right thickness must be placed correctly. Therefore bolus requirements must be clearly documented in the setup sheets of the treatment card. When using bolus to compensate for missing tissue, the whole of the bolussed area must be level with the point on the patient where the f.s.d. is set, to ensure dose homogeneity. When the bolus is used to reduce the skin-sparing effect, the bolus does not necessarily need to touch the skin all over the bolussed area as the scatter is of sufficiently high energy to be unaffected by an air gap. However, it is important that the bolus is uniform thickness. Some bolus materials are easily squashed and must be carefully measured at regular intervals. ==References== * Perez and Brady's Principles and Practice of Radiation Oncology Category:Oncology Category:Radiation Category:Radiation therapy ","title":"Bolus (radiation therapy)"},{"id":"19278463","text":"Political opportunity theory, also known as the political process theory or political opportunity structure, is an approach of social movements that is heavily influenced by political sociology. It argues that success or failure of social movements is affected primarily by political opportunities. Social theorists Peter Eisinger, Sidney Tarrow, David Meyer and Doug McAdam are considered among the most prominent supporters of the theory. ==Description== Three vital components for movement formation are the following: # Insurgent Consciousness: certain members of society feel deprived, mistreated, and have grievances directed at a system that they perceive as unjust (see also deprivation theory).Ryan Cragun, Deborah Cragun, et al, Introduction to Sociology, Blacksleet River, , Google Print, p.233-234 When a collective sense of injustice develops, it motivates people to become movement members. Movement activists do not choose their goals at random, but the political context stresses certain grievances around which movements organize. # Organizational Strength: similar to the main argument of the resource mobilization theory, the argument here is that the social movement must have strong and efficient leadership and sufficient resources. The political opportunity theory has much in common with the related resource mobilization theory, particularly when it is seen as focusing on mobilization of resources external to the movement. Associated and indigenous organizations also play a major role in recruiting and motivating actors to join and participate within social movements. Often, the rise of a movement merges with other pre-existing and highly-organized blocs of individuals, who lend the movement resources and support. The more heavily that individuals are integrated into disconnected but otherwise mobile communities, the higher the likelihood of those communities merging and lending support to causes that their members are active in. # Political Opportunities: if the existing political system is vulnerable to a challenge, it creates an opportunity for others, like the movement members, to issue such a challenge and try to use this opportune time to push through a social change. The vulnerability can be the result of: ## Increasing political pluralism ## Decline in repression ## Division within elites, particularly when it grows to a point where some support organized opposition ## Increased political enfranchisement Political opportunity theory argues that the actions of the activists are dependent on the existence or the lack of a specific political opportunity.David S. Meyer, Protest and Political Opportunities, Annual Review of Sociology, Vol. 30: 125-145 (Volume publication date August 2004), There are various definitions of political opportunity, but Meyer (2004) stresses that of Tarrow (1998): From the three components emerges what proponent Doug McAdam terms cognitive liberation, the ability for those active in political protest to recognize their collective strength and take advantage of political opportunities as they become available to them. As political opposition to the movement's demands weakens, members may feel a collective sense of symbolic efficacy, the capacity to enact significant change within the political arena. This opens up significant opportunities for movements to both recruit members and mobilize under a concentrated and effective cycle of demands. Over time, the broad socioeconomic processes develop, maintain and cause decline within the movement. A movement, once developed, may be affected by the level of social control placed on it, which, in turn, affects its ability to mobilize and maintain members since when the movement's demands are portrayed as underdeveloped or unattractive, they risk losing or failing to receive support from outside institutions. Furthermore, movements may be affected by oligarchization, a class of individuals within the movement working to ensure the maintenance of the movement itself, rather than a continual push for collective goals, or co-optation, when outside support is garnered for the movement at the same time as it is forced to sacrifice its goals to meet the demands of those supporting institutions. That, in turn, may lead to the loss of indigenous support and, along with it, many of the supporting grassroots organizations that were able to quickly mobilize members at the onset of the movement. Meyer (2004) credited Eisinger (1973) with first use of the political opportunity theory framed in such a way (traces of which, of course, go further back). Eisinger asked why in the 1960s, the level of riots about race and poverty varied between different places in the United States and noted that lack of visible openings for participation of repressed or discouraged dissident made riots more likely. Thus, the inability to air grievances legally was the political opportunity which led to organization and the mobilization of movements expressing their grievances by rioting.Eisinger P . 1973. The conditions of protest behavior in American cities . Am. Polit. Sci. Rev. 81 : 11 – 28 Meyer (2004), in his overview of political opportunity theory, noted that this broader context can affect: * \\"mobilizing\\", * \\"advancing particular claims rather than others\\", * \\"cultivating some alliances rather than others\\", * \\"employing particular political strategies and tactics rather than others\\", and * \\"affecting mainstream institutional politics and policy\\". A key advantage of the theory is that it explains why social movements emerge and/or increase their activity at a given time. When there are no political opportunities, simply having grievances (organizational consciousness) and resources is not enough. It is only when all three of these components are present that the movement has a chance to succeed. ==Comparison with political structure== Within the structure and agency debate, actions of activists (agents) can be understood only when they are seen in the broader context of political opportunities (structure). The term structure has been used to characterize political opportunities in older scholarship. A political opportunity structure has been defined as the circumstances surrounding a political landscape.Jereon Gunning, Hamas, democracy, religion and violence However, Tarrow, who used the term in his earlier publications, now argues it is misleading, as most opportunities need to be perceived and are situational, not structural. Rather than just a political landscape, political opportunity structures can be described as a specific configuration of resources, institutional arrangements and historical precedent for social mobilizations. Political opportunity structures are prone to change and can alter in days or last for decades. Demographics and socioeconomic factors create \\"structure\\" that affects political actors. ==Political mediation model== One side model, based on the political opportunity theory, is known as the political mediation model. The political mediation model focuses on how the political context affects the strategic choices of the political actors. The model goes beyond looking at whether the movements just succeeded or failed and analyzes other consequences, including unintentional ones as well as collective benefits. The opposite of political opportunity is a political constraint. ==Criticism== The political process model has been criticized both structurally and conceptually. Critics suggest that political process theorists use overly- broad definitions as to what constitute political opportunities, and those definitions vary widely based on the historical context of the social movement itself. Furthermore, as political process theory frames movements as legally or politically detached from the state, it ignores movements that form out of cultural solidarity or do not directly stand in opposition to extant rules or regulations. Critics contend that theorists place too great an emphasis on the role of social networks and often almost entirely ignore the cultural underpinnings that allow the networks to form and subsist. In response to some criticisms, Doug McAdam, Sidney Tarrow and Charles Tilly proposed the Dynamics of Contention research program, which focuses on identifying mechanisms to explain political opportunities, rather than relying on an abstract structure.McAdam D, Tarrow S, Tilly C. 2001. Dynamics of Contention. Cambridge University Press. == Examples == MoveOn.org is an organization that started in 1998 and still operates. MoveOn.org is a progressive organization that specifically centers on political issues. MoveOn.org allows viewers to start their own petitions, a form of collective behavior, which could potentially start a social movement of its own. MoveOn.org also includes other petitions and political articles and video clips on the front page for people to sign and view as a mechanism for people to assemble over a similar issue, perpetuating the concept of solidarity, or a sense of collective identity over political discourse. MoveOn.org can also be applied to resource mobilization theory since MoveOn.org is a site that is meant to assemble people, which adds to the strength and success of the organization. ==See also== * Opportunism * Legal opportunity structure * Social movement impact theory ==ReferencesSources== * Meyer DS, Minkoff DC. 2004.

The film is about three men who move from New Jersey to Miami; two of them end up killing the third. Because of numerous production problems, the film shoot was moved from Miami to Mexico. The film was never released on any format due to legal action instigated by Sylvester Stallone, who did a cameo in the film as a favor to his brother. He claims that a promotional reel of the film used his scene excessively, therefore was promoting him as the star, instead of the cameo that he had agreed upon. He sued for $20 million; his average salary at the time. The producers countersued, and in 1999 the case was settled out of court. ==Plot== Three guys move from New Jersey to Miami and two of them end up killing the third. ==Cast== * Frank Stallone as Tony Piano * Dennis Hopper as Mr. B * Peter Dobson as Gerard * Andrew Dice Clay as Albert * Erik Betts as Charles * David Anthony Pizzuto as Fredo * Sylvester Stallone had a cameo as a Boss ==ProductionDevelopment=== The budget of this independent film was around 5 million dollars.

The director at the start of the project was Barry Samson, who left and was replaced by screenwriter and producer Alan Mehrez; Samson is not credited in the film. ===Disputes=== The presence of Sylvester Stallone in the film was limited to a simple cameo, a favor he, along with his brother Frank, the protagonist of the film, made to the brothers Alan and Diane Mehrez, producers of the film. The problems arose when the Mehrez brothers promoted the film as soon as the shooting was over, as if Stallone were the protagonist; the plaintiff sued the two producers and the distribution of the film was thus blocked.. The film was canceled and still remains unpublished, as Stallone asked for 20 million dollars to let the film be distributed with its leading name, that is the compensation it took in that period. ==ReleaseDistribution=== Only one video remains of the film that the production company DEM Films has broadcast through the CNN channel. ==References * Category:1997 films Category:American crime comedy films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:1990s crime comedy films Category:1997 comedy films ","title":"The Good Life (1997 film)"},{"id":"19278494","text":"Twin Cone is a cinder cone in northern British Columbia, Canada.
