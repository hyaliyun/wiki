Construction workers in Germany were organised in the German Union of Building Trades until 1933, when it was banned by the Nazis. A new union was founded in October 1949, at a conference in Karlsruhe. It was the last of the sixteen affiliates of the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) to be established, because of difference of opinion between the communist-influenced construction union in the British occupation zone, members of the South Baden and Bavarian union who would have preferred to remain independent, and restrictions on unions in the French occupation zone. All the initial executive members of the union had been prominent trade unionists in Weimar Germany, and as a result they had the highest average age of executive members of any DGB affiliate. The union established the Beneficial Vacation Fund for the Construction Sector, and membership grew through the post-war need for reconstruction, although there were some downward pressures on wages from exiles from East Germany moving to the West. The union became more active under Georg Leber's leadership, from 1957, although he controversially argued that wage increases should be linked to productivity growth. However, he did negotiate additional increases for the lowest-paid workers. He also argued for an Advantage Equilisation Fund, whereby non-unionised construction workers would pay for training, scholarships and rest facilities, to benefit everyone in the industry. This was widely opposed and the policy was soon abandoned. Under the leadership of Rudolf Sperner, from 1966, the union was less prominent, but despite several recessions, it increased its membership to a record peak in 1981. It absorbed the East German Building, Construction and Wood Union in 1990, and by 1995, it had 639,851 members. At the start of 1996, it merged with the Horticulture, Agriculture and Forestry Union, to form IG Bauen-Agrar-Umwelt.

By virtue of their geometric constraint, these compounds exhibit distinct electronic structures and reactivities, which bestow on them potential to provide unique nonmetal platforms for bond cleavage reactions.  Synthesis  The first examples of nontrigonal pnictogen compound were synthesized by Arduengo and co-workers in 1984, through condensation of a diketoamine with a phosphorus trihalide in the presence of base. This group reported also on the first systematic investigations into its chemical behavior. Later, on similar routes, the corresponding and isostructural arsenic and antimony species were also synthesized. Other synthetic methods involve deprotonation of OH or NH groups in the presence of ECl3 (E=P, As, Sb and Bi), salt metathesis or reduction of pentavalent pnictogen compounds. Synthetic scheme of notrigonal pnictogen compounds  Structures and properties  The molecular structures of nontrigonal pnictogen compounds reveal the steric strain in these molecules, and significantly differing bond angles at the pnictogen atoms indicate a considerable distortion of the coordination spheres. Inversion of the configuration via planar coordinated pnictogen atoms In particular, the geometry at the central part of these compounds deviate strongly from traditional pnictogen compounds, and indicate molecular strain with an approach to a T-type molecular configuration. With different ligand motifs, the bond angles at pnictogen atoms can vary from 100˚ to almost 180˚. The flattened geometry of these molecules influences the relatively low energetic barriers for inversion of the configuration via planar coordinated pnictogen atoms in the transition state. These low barriers are in accordance with the dynamic behavior and fast equilibration processes observed in ambient temperature NMR. Results of quantum chemical calculations confirm that in these compounds, the lone pair of electrons at the pnictogen atoms is localized in orbitals with relatively high s-character. From these results, only weak nucleophilicity was derived in accordance with some experimental observations such as the inertness towards benzyl bromide. The LUMO is delocalized but has important contributions from pnictogen empty p orbitals, which should favor a nucleophilic attack of substrates at this position in accordance with experimental findings. The pnictogen atom forms a three- center-four-electron bond with the two flanking nitrogen atoms, which is manifested by the HOMO-2. Left: LUMO of a nontrigonal phosphorus compound, which consists mainly of the empty p orbital; Right: HOMO-2 of a nontrigonal phosphorus compound, which manifests the three-center-four-electron bond For nontrigonal bismuth compounds, a Bi(I) electronic structure could be shown to be most appropriate. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis reveals an s-type lone pair and a p-type lone pair at the metal, with the remaining two p orbitals being involved in one two-center-two-electron bond and one three- center-two-electron bond. The p-type lone pair NBO has less than 2 electron occupancy as it is delocalized over the ligand frame. Although considerable Bi(I) character is indicated for the Bi compound, it exhibits reactivity similar to Bi(III) electrophiles, and expresses either a vacant or a filled p orbital at Bi. Left: filled s-type lone pair NBO at Bi of a nontrigonal bismuth compound; Right: partially filled p-type lone pair NBO at Bi of a nontrigonal bismuth compound Resonance structures of nontrigonal pnictogen compounds From these results, two types of resonance structures can be drawn, one with a filled s-orbital and a vacant p orbital at the pnictogen center, the other one with negative charge on pnictogen, arising from the redox-non- innocent nature of the ligand. This is evident by shorter C-N bond lengths in nontrigonal pnictogen compounds than C-N single bonds in the corresponding ligands. These structures may reflect the specific bonding situation in these strained molecular systems.  Reactivity  These easily available and sterically constrained compounds are potentially suitable for an application in a wide variety of secondary processes such as small molecule activation or the generation of new catalysts based on main-group and transition-metal elements.  Redox reactions  Since the LUMOs of nontrigonal pnictogen compounds consist mainly of the vacant p orbitals of the pnictogen nuclei, they could undergo one-electron reduction to afford radical anions if the energy levels of LUMOs are appropriate. For a less sterically hindered compound, the generated radical anion readily dimerizes to form a dianion with a P-P bond. When a sterically encumbered tris-amide ligand is used, stable radical anions bearing T-shaped pnictogen nuclei can be isolated and characterized. Reduction of nontrigonal pnictogen compounds The oxidation of nontrigonal phosphorus compounds and transfer of halogen molecules to the phosphorus atoms to generate phosphoranes with phosphorus atoms in an oxidation state of +5 was achieved by various synthetic procedures. These dihalides are promising starting materials and potentially applicable for the generation of numerous secondary products, but only few reactions have been reported so far in the literature. Nontrigonal phosphorus compounds can also be oxidized by organic azide to yield phosphazenes. Oxidation of nontrigonal pnictogen compounds  Oxidative addition  Oxidative addition of nontrigonal phosphorus compounds These sterically constrained phosphorus compounds show remarkable reactivity towards protic reagents such as primary amines and alcohols, which results in intermolecular oxidative addition of these O−H and N−H bonds. This reaction tolerates a variety of different substrates, including ammonia and water. Two mechanisms have been suggested for the understanding of the unusual insertion of phosphorus atoms into polar X−H bonds by oxidative addition. Nontrigonal phosphorus compounds can also react with ammonia–borane to form a formal dihydrogen oxidative addition product. This compound proved to facilitate the catalytic reduction of azobenzene.  Coordination chemistry  The first transition metal complexes of nontrigonal pnictogen compounds have been reported in the 1980s and '90s. Up to now, several complexes have been successfully synthesized, but they have not yet been applied in secondary processes, such as catalytic cycles. In 2018, the synthesis and reactivity of a chelating ligand containing a nontrigonal phosphorus center was reported. It is worth noting that, apart from direct metalation of this ligand with RuCl2(PPh3)3, metalation with a ruthenium hydride compound RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 yields a complex with net insertion into the Ru−H bond. These ligands, along with recent developments for higher valent states of Sb ligands, may possess rich potential in the field of catalysis and sensing.

Life  Fernande de Mertens was the fifth of six children of the baron Edouard Mertens and his wife Sophie Lambertine Woelfling, and Fernande was thus a baroness herself. Hélène Échinard writes that in Marseille, Fernande attended the École des Beaux-Arts where she was taught by Théodore Jourdan and Dominique Antoine Magaud. Aged 35, on April 27, 1886, she married the French painter Pierre Jean, and thus acquired French citizenship. In 1888, she became a member of the Société des Artistes Français. The couple had a dedicated studio at the Boulevard de la Corderie in Marseille, where she taught the use of pastel – a popular technique at the time for young girls of respected background. Fernande and her husband never had children. Although her father Edouard and his three brothers had a total of fourteen children among them, there were no grandchildren for the Mertens nobility; the last known bearer of the name and title died in 1926, not long after Fernande's own death.  Work  Portrait of Pierre Jean (1889). The Provençal painters of the late 19th and early 20th century, favouring subjects from the Provence region, are often referred to as the Provençal School, with Fernande de Mertens being one of their few female painters. Aside from pastel, in which she has produced primarily female portraits, she also worked with oil, producing portraits as well as genre scenes. Her works have been exhibited in multiple salons, including Nîmes, Montpellier, Lyon, Niort, Draguignan, Aix-en-Provence, and her hometown Marseille. Starting from 1879, her paintings have been exhibited in Paris as well, including in the Paris Salon, where she has presented at least 13 paintings between 1879 and 1900, primarily portraits. Many portraits were of Marseille locals, and known or attributed portraits include one she painted of the painter Alfred Casile, of Gabriel Fabre, and of her husband Pierre Jean. (Her husband, incidentally, had presented a portrait of her at the salon two years earlier.) A portrait of her mother, presented in 1882, received a gold medal at Nîmes the next year, the same year her mother died; following this, the portrait would remain in Mertens' own private possession. In 1884, her work received an honorable mention at the Paris Salon, and between 1886 and 1897, most of her contributions have received illustrations in the Salon's catalogue. Her genre scene Chez Grand-Père was lauded as \\"a family scene from which a great poetry emerges\\". Among others, her works are now in the collections of Musée Ziem in Martigues and Musée des Beaux-Arts as well as Musée Cantini in Marseille. Since her marriage, her works have been signed as F. de Mertens, J.-F. de Mertens, and F. Jean de Mertens.

Early life and education  Barbara Brown Lee was born to Betty and John Brown. Betty Brown had training as an art teacher and shared her love of art with her children. In March 1949, when her family temporary moved to Racine, Wisconsin, she would take art classes, and eventually volunteer, at the Wustum Museum at the age of 9.Brown Lee, Barbara (October 16, 2019). Interviewed by Brie Rosenbloom. After Barbara Brown Lee graduated from Milwaukee-Downer Seminary in 1958, she attended Pine Manor College for two years. She later graduated from the University of Arizona in 1962. During her time in Arizona, she worked at the school's museum, and decided to continue to pursue museum work as a career. During Summer 1962, Lee attended a graduate art history program at the University of Guadalajara in Jalisco, Mexico. She also attended Attingham Summer School in 1973.  Career  In 1962, Barbara Brown Lee searched for museum positions in New York, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Upon returning to Milwaukee, she met with Tracey Atkinson, the director of the Milwaukee Art Center, which would later become the Milwaukee Art Museum. Barbara Brown Lee was offered the position of Curatorial Assistant and began her career at MAM during January 1963. Barbara began to learn the collection as a curatorial assistant, until February 15, 1967 when the Head of Adult Education at the Milwaukee Art Museum, Franny Lee, died. Barbara Brown Lee took her place as the Head of Adult Education, and later became Chief Educator until her retirement. Barbara Brown Lee retired in February 2013, but continues to educate at the Milwaukee Art Museum as a volunteer.  Legacy programming  During her career, Barbara Brown Lee oversaw the development and implementation of educational programming that the Milwaukee Art Museum still facilitates today. Barbara Brown Lee was involved with the Scholastic Art Awards, a student art competition in Wisconsin. The resulting juried show of student art has been exhibited in the Milwaukee Art Museum since 1976. Barbara helped to start the Milwaukee Art Museum's Junior Docent School Program in 1977 in partnership with the Golda Meir School. In 2019, this program was offered to 52 schools from third to fifth grade, and involves multiple visits to the museum during that time to train students as if they were docents or curators. Students present a final project during the 10th and final visit in the program. In the 1980s, Barbara Brown Lee implemented the Satellite Art Program in association with the art program for Milwaukee Public Schools. In this program, students interested in a career in art would come to the Milwaukee Museum of Art every weekday for a semester, which was sometimes extended to a year. Participants in the Satellite Art Program could utilize the Milwaukee Museum of Art's collection to learn skills necessary for a career in art. The program was recognized by the Getty Center for Education in the Arts as an example of Disciplinary Based Art Education.  Publications  Brown, Barbara L., Manger, Barbara, & Shannon, John. (2015).

Before formation of the brigade, there were no official 'AA formations' on Gibraltar, but this shortly changed following the Battle of France. The brigade continued to serve as the prime AA defence formation until it was disbanded in 1944. History left Background On the outbreak of war in September 1939, there had only been two batteries (9 and 19 AA Btys) manning the totally inadequate AA defences of Gibraltar, which consisted of four old 3-inch guns and four new 3.7-inch guns, spread in two-gun sections to give the widest possible coverage, and two of the new Bofors 40 mm guns to protect the Royal Navy Dockyard, with the assistance of Royal Navy (RN) 2-pounder pom-pom guns. 10th AA Rgt was formed in December 1939 to command 9 and 19 AA Btys and train the AA Section of the new Gibraltar Defence Force (GDF), which took over the 3-inch guns. Apart from occasional shots fired at unidentified aircraft penetrating Gibraltar's airspace, there were no attacks on the fortress during the 'Phoney war' period.Routledge, Table XI, p. 68; Table XIII, p. 69.Routledge, pp. 200-4. After the Fall of France in 1940, a group of AA detachments under 53rd (City of London) AA Rgt escaped from Marseilles aboard the SS Alma Dawson. A French dockyard strike prevented them from loading any of their 3-inch guns or vehicles, but they mounted Bofors guns on the ship's deck and put to sea on 18 June. On arrival in Gibraltar, they reinforced 10th AA Rgt. 82nd (Essex) AA Regiment arrived on 27 June 1940, and once it had unloaded its guns and equipment 53rd AA Rgt re-embarked for home.53 HAA Regt War Diary 1940–41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2343.Joslen, pp. 552–3. There followed a reorganisation of the AA units in Gibraltar: 19 AA Bty joined 82nd AA Rgt, together with the GDF HAA battery, while 9 AA Bty took over all the Bofors guns. A searchlight battery arrived, and an AA Operations Room (AAOR) was established to control all the gun sites and to coordinate with AA-equipped ships in the harbour. 10th AA Rgt HQ was ordered to be transferred to Malta in July, but this did not occur until November when, as part of Operation Coat, a reinforcement convoy for Malta put in at Gibraltar and picked it up. The first serious air raid on Gibraltar came at 02.00 on 18 July 1940, when two unidentified aircraft bombed the slopes of the Rock, causing some fatalities. The attack was thought to be by the Vichy French Air Force in retaliation for the British attack on the French fleet at Mers-el- Kebir on 3 July (Operation Catapult), which had been carried out by Force H from Gibraltar. On 21 August the AA defences brought down a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bomber during a raid by the Italian Regia Aeronautica. On 24 and 25 September waves of Vichy bombers attacked Gibraltar again in retaliation for the British and Free French attack on Dakar (Operation Menace), and caused considerable damage. Several of these bombers were shot down by the combined AA fire. On other occasions the guns fired at single Italian reconnaissance aircraft, known to the garrison as 'Persistent Percy'.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 130–37, 142.Rankin, pp. 1–7.Smith, pp. 57–88.Farndale, pp. 200–1.Rankin, pp. 295–9. Formation During to the increase of raids and the coming North African Campaign, the War Office (WO) approved the formation of a new AA Brigade which would handle the increasing demands brought on CRA, Gibraltar. This new formation was to be known as the 15th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (15th AA Bde) which was to take over all AA matters on the rock. On 2 September 1941, the brigade was constituted with HQ based at RAF Gibraltar.Frederick, p. 1049.The Gibraltar Defence Force training on a 3.7-inch gun. The brigade was then organised as;Routledge, Table XXXIV: Page 212. * Brigade Headquarters under Brigadier Duncan Alexander LearmonthAssigned directly by the Governor of Gibraltar in September 1941 * 142nd General Operation Post (Operations Room) *13th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (Regular, composite) — raised in Gibraltar with composite AA units based there, later disbanded on 10 December 1942 ** RHQ ** 288th HAA Bty — from 94th HAA Regt, RA **1st Rocket AA Troop, Royal Artillery (AA Rockets) ** 1st Radar Detection Finding Bty, RA *82nd (Essex) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (TA) ** RHQ ** 156th, 193rd, and 256th HAA Btys **Gibraltar Defence Force HAA Bty, RA *3rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (Regular) — raised in Woolwich 2 September, arrived in Gibraltar on 27 September 1941 ** RHQ ** 9th, 114th, and 126th LAA Btys * 3rd Searchlight Bty, RA (Regular) — Formed 30 December 1939 in Gibraltar, formally administered by the 10th HAA Regt, RA Gibraltar 'Blitz' Mobile 3.7-inch HAA gun deployed at White Rock Battery, November 1941 Searchlights over Gibraltar during an air-raid practice on 20 November 1942 Among the many tasks facing 15th AA Brigade was the integration of AA fire in defence against sea or land invasion, in which it played an important part. Equally important was the careful distribution of gun and radar positions to ensure the most effective converge from the increased firepower and the constant practice of day and night barrages, in which live firing was regularly employed and closely recorded, to eliminate errors and weak spots. Aware of the vulnerability of positions to direct attack after opening fire, each AA position was given a 20mm Oerlikon for self-defence. The basis of the plan for the revised layer was to bring the fire of 20 HAA guns to bear on a target travelling at 240 mph, approaching from any direction and at a typical height of 12,000 feet.Routledge, Map 12: The Defence of Gibraltar July 1940 In January 1942, the Governor of Gibraltar, General the Viscount John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort (Lord Gort) wrote to the War Office asking for more HAA guns, preferably 5.25 inch heavy AA guns, for GLII sets with semi-automatic plotters and another 8 x Bofors 40 mm gun (LAA guns). Part of this request was due to 15th AA Brigade's wish to provide the North airfield with its own LAA defence; hitherto it had depended on the main layout for coverage. Nothing was sent, however, other than 3-inch rockets and their launchers and the airfield received only a small deployment of 20 mm Polsten and Bofors 40 mm guns together with some machine-guns, all withdrawn from other positions, and three searchlights. During the whole of 1942, there were six bombing raids on Gibraltar, two of which were unidentified, and 18 reconnaissance overflights, all but two of them German. Four aircraft were shot down and others crash- landed in Spain. Some of the Italian raids missed their targets and dropped their bombs in Spanish territory, and Spanish AA guns sometimes opened fire as a raid passed towards them. By the end of 1942, the AA defences of Gibraltar reached a peak of scale and efficiency, but the threat had dwindled. There were only two or three reconnaissance flights during 1943.Joslen, pp. 552–3. Later years It was War Office policy that army units should be replaced after three years' service overseas. Therefore, in accordance with this policy, the 13th, 82nd, and 3rd AA regiments were removed, being replaced by the 175th and 141st. This left, the brigade organised by May 1943, as: * Brigade HQ * 142nd General Operation Post (Operations Room) * 175th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (Regular) ** RHQ ** 1st Range and Detection Finding (Radar) Battery **1st Anti-Aircraft 'Z' Troop, Royal Artillery ** 375th, 386th, 441st, and 228thOn 25 August, the battery was replaced by 596 HAA Bty, which moved 177th HAA Rgt.

Queering the Map  In May 2017, LaRochelle launched the community-based collaborative mapping platform Queering the Map, on which users submit their personal queer experiences to specific locations on a single collective map. LaRochelle has cited the lasting impact of personal memories on their perceptions towards places and Sara Ahmed's ideas on queerness as an orientation towards space as influences behind the project. In February 2018, a cyberattack generating pins with comments in support of U.S. president Donald Trump forced LaRochelle to take down the site, relaunching it in April 2018. Since its inception, users have contributed over 80,000 submissions in 23 languages to the platform.

It consists of Ikuro Kwon, Jacob Fatu, Josef Samael and Simon Gotch. Fatu is the reigning World Heavyweight Champion in his first reign. The stable was formed at the SuperFight event on February 2, 2019 when Fatu and Samael made their MLW debut and formed their alliance with Gotch by attacking his opponent Ace Romero. The group made its televised debut at Intimidation Games and dominated MLW roster throughout the year, becoming the top villainous group of the company. The group cemented its dominance over MLW when Fatu won the World Heavyweight Championship at Kings of Colosseum on July 6, 2019. Ikuro Kwon was added to the group as its fourth member in August. History Background and formation Simon Gotch Jacob Fatu and The Almighty Sheik were previously a part of a stable called the \\"Warbeast\\" with Brody King and Kevin Sullivan and competed on the independent circuit winning many tag team titles in various promotions. In January 2019, Warbeast members Fatu and Sheik signed a contract with Major League Wrestling and MLW announced on its website that Jacob Fatu would make his MLW debut at SuperFight. Sheik was repackaged as Josef Samael and he and Fatu made their MLW debut in a non- televised match by defeating local wrestlers Chico Adams and Kwame Nas at SuperFight. Later at the event, the duo allied themselves with Simon Gotch by attacking his opponent Ace Romero, during which Gotch proclaimed that the group as \\"global merchants of violence\\" and named it \\"Contra\\" and waved a self-designated Contra flag. The pair made its televised debut at Intimidation Games by attacking Tom Lawlor after he retained the MLW World Heavyweight Championship against Low Ki in a steel cage match. Contra Unit led another attack on Ace Romero during Romero's match against Simon Gotch on the March 9 episode of Fusion. The next week, on Fusion, Fatu and Samael had their first televised match in MLW against Chico Adams and Vertigo Rivera, where they got themselves disqualified after Samael brutalized them with his spike. Fatu entered the titular match at the Battle Riot II on April 5, where Contra poured gas on various participants, which led to them being disqualified from the match. Later that night, Contra attacked Tom Lawlor again during a post- event press conference. Contra Unit planned a hostile takeover of MLW, continuing its dominance and rise as Fatu ended Barrington Hughes' undefeated streak in MLW in a quick match on the May 11 episode of Fusion. Fatu and Samael would go on to defeat Hughes and Romero in a tag team match on the May 25 episode of Fusion. Later at that episode, Contra Unit attacked Low Ki as well as Tom Lawlor for the third time after Lawlor's successful title defense against Avalanche. Jacob Fatu's World Heavyweight Championship reign Josef Samael Lawlor enlisted the help of Ross Von Erich and Marshall Von Erich to feud with Contra Unit as the team of Lawlor and Von Erichs defeated Contra Unit in a six-man tag team match. The feud between Lawlor and Contra Unit intensified, which set up a match between Fatu and Lawlor for the World Heavyweight Championship at Kings of Colosseum on July 6, which Fatu won, thus capturing the title and cementing Contra Unit's dominance over MLW. Jacob Fatu The rivalry continued between Contra Unit and the team of Lawlor and Von Erichs, leading up to a War Chamber match at the namesake event. Contra Unit introduced a fourth member Ikuro Kwon on the August 3 episode of Fusion, who spit mist into Marshall Von Erich's eyes. Low Ki would soon join Lawlor and Von Erichs in the feud by helping them fend off an attack by Contra Unit after Fatu successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Lawlor in a rematch on the August 31 episode of Fusion. Contra Unit would lose to Low Ki, Lawlor and Von Erichs in the titular match at War Chamber to settle the rivalry. Contra Unit's next feud was against Salina de la Renta's stable Promociones Dorado, which began after LA Park decided to cash in his Golden Ticket opportunity by winning the Battle Riot against Jacob Fatu for the World Heavyweight Championship at MLW's first-ever pay-per-view Saturday Night SuperFight on November 2. In the warm-up to the match, Promociones Dorado members LA Park, Bestia 666 and Mecha Wolf defeated Kwon, Gotch and Samael in a six-man tag team match on the final episode of Fusion before the pay-per- view. However, Fatu retained the title against Park at Saturday Night SuperFight.

Bolton (1970), the companion case to Roe v. Wade (1973).  Early life  Cano was born in 1947/1948 in Georgia to an impoverished, abusive family. She stood out among her peers, as she was overweight, had Bell's Palsy, and had a learning disability. She went to school until she dropped out in the ninth grade. She met Joe Bensing, a gas station employee from Oklahoma, when she was seventeen years old and soon became pregnant with his child. Her parents called a \\"shotgun\\" wedding in 1965 when they found out. Prior to their relationship, Bensing was convicted multiple times as a child molester and kidnapper and continued to violate his probation throughout their marriage.  Journey to Supreme Court case  In 1968, her mother forced her into a mental institution due to her stress from her chaotic marriage, but she escaped soon after and never went back. She still had concerns with her mental stability, causing the juvenile court's decision to place her children in foster care. When she was twenty-two years old, she sought out a lawyer to help her get a divorce and gain custody of her two children in foster care. She discovered the Atlanta Legal Aid Office and was introduced to an ACLU lawyer named Margie Pitts Hames when she was pregnant with her fourth child. Personal position While working on Cano's divorce and custody case, Hames became involved in the Doe v. Bolton case, a lawsuit against the Georgia attorney general Arthur K. Bolton. There is no clear claim as to how Cano became involved in the Doe case despite her self-proclaimed pro-life stance; Cano claims that Hames never notified her of her role as a plaintiff in a case to legalize abortion and was asked to sign documents, which Cano never read. Other stories claim that Cano purposely went to the Atlanta Legal Aid to file for a divorce alongside an abortion on March 25, 1970, at the Grady Memorial Hospital, the only nearby hospital where impoverished people could receive free abortions.  Lower court decision  A month later, three local district court judges heard her case. After sixteen days, they ruled in favor of Hames' argument and struck down parts of Georgia's abortion law. The law stated that women who wanted an abortion needed to consult their primary doctor, two other doctors, and the hospital's committee. It also limited abortion to residents of Georgia who had evidence of carrying deformed fetuses, health-risking pregnancies, and being victims of rape. It was sent to the Supreme Court, as both Hames and Bolton appealed. Hames claims that she informed Cano of a chance to testify her wishes to have an abortion, and Cano agreed.  Supreme Court case (Doe v. Bolton)  In preparation for the Supreme Court case, Hames applied Cano for an abortion without Cano's knowledge. When the abortion was approved, Hames notified Cano, who strongly reiterated that she did not want an abortion. At the time, she was 6 months pregnant. Cano, afraid that she would be forced to have the abortion, fled to Oklahoma until her mother and Hames assured her that she would not have to abort the child.  Legal argument  On the day of the Supreme Court case, Hames prepared three arguments supporting the reformation of Georgia's abortion law. First, she argued that there was a conflict of what constituted a \\"legal abortion\\" due to the vague requirements that doctors had to meet in order to approve an abortion. She claimed this was a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hames's second claim was that the abortion law of Georgia did not have the right to override women's decisions to have an abortion. She used the decision made in Griswold v. Connecticut and the Fourteenth Amendment to support her claim. Finally, Hames argued that Georgia's abortion law negatively impacted medical professionals and marginalized women, as abortions were only allowed to be performed in state approved hospitals. This limited the number of hospitals women could receive abortions at, which infringed on the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Cano in court  Despite Hames' argument, Cano did not fully understand the events of the case, and Hames instructed Cano to only spectate the proceedings. She never testified on paper or verbally for her case. Bolton emphasized the fact that Cano was never asked if she was pregnant or if she ever wanted an abortion. If Cano was given the chance to testify, the court would have discovered Cano's pro-life stance. Cano stated feeling manipulated by Hames because she was used to be a plaintiff in a case that supported a view on abortion that she disagreed on, especially by a lawyer who was assisting her in a vulnerable stage in her life.  Decision  The decision for Doe v. Bolton was given on January 22, 1973, the same day as the famous companion case Roe v. Wade. The majority was given by Justice Blackmun in the 7-2 decision, which restricted Georgia's anti-abortion law. The Supreme Court used the Fourteenth Amendment's implied right to privacy to back up their decision. The decision established the definition of the \\"health of the mother,\\" clarifying that the definition of health includes \\"physical, psychological, familial, and the woman's age.\\"  Life after court decision  After the 1973 decision, Sandra strongly reiterated that she was pro-life and searched for ways to overturn her decision. In the following year, she went to Georgia Right to Life, attempting to find someone who could analyze the impact of her role in Doe v. Bolton. She began her alliance with the president of the Justice Foundation, Allan Parker, in Fayetteville, NC. She failed to reverse the decision in 1989, in 2000 in a Rule 60 Motion, and in 2006. In her attempts, she testified that her role in the Doe case was misleading due to her opposition to abortion. She was quoted as saying she \\"[didn't] want to be part of something that is so deadly wrong...\\" In 2007, she and 180 other women who had previous experiences with abortion worked alongside the Justice Foundation to file a Friend of the Court Brief at the Supreme Court in support of a federal ban on partial birth abortion. Taking into account the women's claims on struggle after abortion, including depression and low self-esteem, the Court recognized Cano as pro-life, reversing her reputation from her case. In 2014, Cano worked to support North Dakota's ban on abortions at the point of a noticeable heartbeat, or six weeks, by speaking to the States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.  Later years  Cano was able to reconnect with her daughter, Melissa Able, in 1989, who was 19 years old with a husband and child at the time. They resided together until a fight ensued a few months later about their differing views on abortion. On January 14, 2002, Cano, Norma McCovey, the plaintiff in the Roe v. Wade case, and multiple pro-life organizations came together to create the \\"Shake the Nation Back to Life Campaign\\" with a purpose of convincing President Bush and the Senate that abortion is detrimental to both the child and the mother. They wanted the Bush administration to elect pro-life members of the judicial branch who would change the Constitution's stance on abortion. Cano died on September 30, 2014.

Musa is the first attested member of his family, and he is only mentioned in the sources by name and patronymic, without a nisba. Consequently the exact origin and history of his family prior to him is unknown; however they had clearly settled in Arzanene (Armenian: Aghdznik) as part of the wider influx of Arab tribes into Armenia that began under Harun al-Rashid (), and may well have been members of the Banu Bakr tribe, much like the Shaybanids who dominated the area of Diyar Bakr. Musa's fief of Arzen was the capital of the district of Arzanene, which in turn was held to belong to the Jaziran sub-province of Diyar Bakr. It is known that Musa had five brothers: Sulayman, Ahmad, Isa, Muhammad, and Harun. In common with other Arab leaders in Armenia, Musa married the sister of a Christian Armenian prince, Bagrat II Bagratuni, whose province of Taron bordered Musa's own domain of Arzanene. His ties to the powerful Bagratuni prince certainly strengthened Musa's own position against other rivals, both Christian and Muslim, but it did not stop him from developing a certain enmity towards Bagrat and taking up arms against him. Thus, when the Abbasid governor, Abu Sa'id Muhammad al-Marwazi, sought to reduce the power and autonomy of the Armenian princes, that had grown greatly during the previous years, he chose Musa and another local Arab lord, al-Ala ibn Ahmad al-Azdi. Musa invaded Taron, while al-Ala attacked the other great southern Armenian principality of Vaspurakan, ruled by Ashot I Artsruni. Ashot defeated al-Ala and evicted him from his territory, and then went to the assistance of Bagrat. The Armenian armies faced and defeated Musa near the capital of Taron, Mush, and pursued him until Baghesh, stopping only after the entreaties of Musa's wife, the sister of Bagrat. The Armenians then proceeded to massacre the Arab settlers in Arzanene. At this time, Abu Sa'id invaded Armenia with his own army, but died on the way, and was succeeded by his son Yusuf. The latter managed to capture Bagrat and sent him as a prisoner to the Abbasid capital Samarra, but he was later attacked and killed by the inhabitants of Khoyt in early 852. This prompted the Caliph to intervene in force by sending the general Bugha al-Kabir to Armenia. Musa appears to have joined the Armenian uprising at some point; Bugha also accused him of having been involved in the murder of Yusuf. As a result, he and was also carried into captivity to Samarra by Bugha al- Kabir. After Musa died, he was succeeded by his son Abu'l-Maghra. In order to safeguard his domain against the Shaybanids, he allied himself closely with the Artsruni, marrying an Artsruni princess and even secretly converting to Christianity. In he was taken prisoner by the ambitious Shaybanid ruler of Diyar Bakr, Ahmad ibn Isa al-Shaybani, who annexed the Zurarid domains.

Taxonomy In a revision of the genus Coptomma, Deping Song and Qiao Wang of Massey University synonymised two species and described a new one, Coptomma marrisi, from a male and female collected by Lincoln University entomologist John Marris on an expedition to the Three Kings Islands in 1996. The holotype and paratype were deposited in the Lincoln University Entomology Research Collection. One previous specimen had been collected in 1970 by a DSIR Entomology Division expedition, and lodged in the New Zealand Arthropod Collection. Song and Wang chose the name marrisi to honour the collector of the holotype, John Marris. Description C. marrisi most resembles the striped longhorn beetle C. lineatum, which is widely distributed through mainland New Zealand. It differs in having a wide frons, a hairless stripe on the thorax, and reddish-brown femurs. Its body is just over 15 mm (females) and 11–12 mm (males), and is reddish-brown with four long yellow stripes on each wing cover. File:Coptomma marrisi HT Habitus lateral.jpgLateral view File:Coptomma marrisi HT Habitus ventral.jpgVentral Habitat and distribution This species is known only from Great Island in the Three Kings Islands, and like the Three Kings click beetle Amychus manawatawhi, it may have evolved and persisted on Great Island, rather than being a remnant of a formerly-widespread species. The Three Kings have been isolated from mainland since the Miocene, and are rich in endemic species. Adult beetles were collected on coastal plants, particularly Kunzea, in December. Nothing else is known about their possible host.

Life and Work Born in Rome, he left the capital at an early age to move to Lucca and, later, to Florence, where he graduated in architecture in July 1901. Michelazzi is the architect who is responsible for all the major Art Nouveau architecture in Florence, but due to Art Nouveau's extreme unpopularity in the subsequent decades, some of his buildings were demolished in the 1950s and 1960s. Only in the last fsixty years has his work received scholarly attention, so much so now that critics have given it a prominent place in Italian architecture of the twentieth century. His appearance as an architect on the Florentine scene dates back to 1902-03 with an intervention of initially little importance but which became highly suggestive of the future direction of his design methods in the Tuscan strand of Art Nouveau. It consisted of the addition to a traditional villa located in the nineteenth-century Viale del Poggio Imperiale in Florence of an iron and glass canopy, a new portal, and the complete overhaul of the balcony above, adding concrete uprights that attach to the wall with soft plasticity. With this small intervention Michelazzi clearly revealed the origins of his architectural language--that is, the French and Belgian Art Nouveau--with the delicate decorative elements emerging from a firm masonry structure. Some stylistic elements that he frequently featured in his work included figures, particularly dragons. 1911 represented the peak of activity for Michelazzi with the realization of his masterpiece, the Casa-Galleria Vichi with its tall, narrow façade in the center of Florence. It was also, however, a turning point for his aesthetic vocabulary away from Art Nouveau, as seen in the Baroncelli villa in via Duprè from 1914, and continued with the Renaissance- revival style used for the house on via Giovanni Prati in 1915. He took his own life at just 41 years, on the night of 21–22 August 1920, in front of the Badia Fiesolana, in the San Domenico di Fiesole area, after losing custody of his child to his wife at the time of their separation. The place of death was the school where he intended to register his son. Incidentally, the same area in January 1901 had been the site of the death of Swiss painter and graphic designer Arnold Böcklin, who had bought a villa there in 1895, which had served as an inspiration for Michelazzi himself.

There are also replicas of 10 historical instruments in different moods, of which two models are offered in B and A. Not in the program: the alto clarinet in E flat (looks similar to a basset horn) and the extremely rare contra alto clarinet. The manufacturer S & S has developed several improvements of the mechanics and the soundhole drilling for their clarinets. All instruments are made of wood, mainly of grenadilla wood, but also cocobolo, mopane and boxwood are available, the latter, especially for the historical replicas. The instruments are built to order and primarily for professional clarinetists and are in the top price range. In addition, S & S sells inexpensive schoolboy clarinets produced by the company Buffet Crampon Deutschland GmbH, Markneukirchen, under the trademark \\"W.

First commissioned in 1926, she served in the waters of Japan prior to World War II. During World War II, she operated in the Central Pacific, supported Japanese forces in the Battle of Wake Island and invasion of Rabaul, and took part in the Aleutian Islands campaign. She sank in a diving accident in November 1942. Design and description The submarines of the Type L4 sub- class were copies of the Group 3 subclass of the British L-class class submarine built under license in Japan.Chesneau, Roger, ed., Conway′s All the World′s Fighting Ships 1922–1946, New York: Mayflower Books, 1980, , p. 203. They were slightly larger and had two more torpedo tubes than the preceding submarines of the L3 subclass. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long and had a beam of and a draft of . They had a diving depth of . For surface running, the submarines were powered by two Vickers diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged, each propeller was driven by an electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, they had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . The submarines were armed with six internal torpedo tubes, all in the bow, and carried a total of twelve 6th Year Type torpedoes. They were also armed with a single deck gun and a 6.5 mm machine gun. Construction and commissioning Ro-65 was laid down on 15 November 1924 by Mitsubishi at Kobe, Japan. Launched on 25 September 1925, she was completed and commissioned on 30 June 1926. Service history Pre-World War II Upon commissioning, Ro-65 was attached to the Maizuru Naval District and assigned to Submarine Division 33. On 15 December 1926, she was transferred to the Sasebo Naval District and reassigned to Submarine Division 27 — in which she remained until 1942 — in the Sasebo Defense Division. Submarine Division 27 was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 1 in the 1st Fleet in the Combined Fleet on 15 January 1927, then returned to the Sasebo Defense Division in the Sasebo Naval District on 30 November 1929. On 24 December 1929, the division was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 2 in the 2nd Fleet in the Combined Fleet. It again returned to the Sasebo Defense Division in the Sasebo Naval District on 1 December 1930. Ro-65 was ecommissioned and placed in reserve at Sasebo, Japan, on 1 April 1931. Ro-65 was recommissioned on 1 December 1931, resuming active service in Submarine Division 27 and in the Sasebo Defense Division in the Sasebo Naval District. On 1 October 1932, the division was reassigned to the Sasebo Guard Squadron. On 15 November 1933, the division returned to service in the Sasebo Defense Division, and that day Ro-65 again was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Sasebo. Ro-65 was recommissioned on 1 November 1934, and returned to service in Submarine Division 27 which by then again was serving in the Sasebo Guard Squadron in the Sasebo Naval District. The division was transferred to the Sasebo Defense Squadron on 15 November 1935. On 1 December 1936, Ro-65 again was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Sasebo. She was recommissioned on 20 March 1937 and rejoined Submarine Division 27 in the Sasebo Guard Guard Squadron, but again was decommissioned on 1 December 1937 and returned to a reserve status. She was placed in Second Reserve in the Sasebo Naval District on 15 December 1938. Sources offer different accounts of Ro-65′s status during 1939–1940, asserting or implying that she was recommissioned on 1 November 1939, that she remained in Second Reserve until 15 November 1939 and then was in First Reserve until recommissioning on 15 November 1940, and that she recommissioned on 20 March 1940 or on 28 September 1940. Whatever the case, she was back in active service in time for Submarine Division 27′s reassignment to Submarine Squadron 7 in the 4th Fleet in the Combined Fleet on 15 November 1940. When the Imperial Japanese Navy deployed for the upcoming conflict in the Pacific, Ro-65 was at Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands with the other submarines of Submarine Division 33, and . She received the message \\"Climb Mount Niitaka 1208\\" () from the Combined Fleet on 2 December 1941, indicating that war with the Allies would commence on 8 December 1941 Japan time, which was on 7 December 1941 on the other side of the International Date Line in Hawaii. World War II =Central Pacific= On 5 December 1941, Ro-65 proceeded from Kwajalein to Roi in the Marshall Islands. She departed Roi on 6 December 1941 and made for Wake Island, where the Battle of Wake Island began on 8 December 1941, with Ro-65, Ro-66, and Ro-67 supporting Japanese forces attempting to seize the atoll. United States Marine Corps forces defending Wake drove back the initial Japanese assault that day. While the Japanese gathered reinforcements for a second and larger invasion of the island, Ro-65 conducted her first war patrol, operating off Wake until 13 December 1941. She then returned to Kwajalein, which she reached in company with Ro-67 on 17 December 1941. Ultimately, the Battle of Wake Island concluded on 23 December 1941 with the Japanese conquest of the atoll. Ro-65 departed Kwajalein on 24 December 1941 to begin her second war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the vicinity of Howland Island and the Phoenix Islands. The patrol was uneventiful, and she returned to Kwajalein on 2 January 1942. On 16 January 1942, Ro-65 got underway in company with Ro-67 to support the Japanese invasion of Rabaul on New Britain in the Admiralty Islands, ordered to patrol south of Cape St. George on New Ireland. On 21 January 1942, the two submarines received orders to join the submarines of Submarine Division 33 — , , and — in patrolling in St. George's Channel while Japanese forces landed at Rabaul, but they found no targets. Ro-65 arrived at Truk on 29 January 1942. On 10 February 1942, Submarine Division 27 was disbanded and Ro-65 and Ro-67 were reassigned to Submarine Division 26. The two submarines departed Truk on 18 February 1942 with orders to reconnoiter the Butaritari area in the Gilbert Islands, proceeding to Butaritari after calling at Ponape in the Caroline Islands from 28 February to 3 March 1942. After completing the reconnaissance, the two submarines headed for Japan, calling at Jaluit Atoll in the Marshall Islands from 17 to 18 March 1942 and at Saipan in the Marshall Islands from 24 to 27 March before proceeding to Sasebo, which they reached on 2 April 1942. =Aleutian Islands campaign= On 14 July 1942, Submarine Division 26 was reassigned to the 5th Fleet for service in the Aleutian Islands, where the Aleutian Islands campaign had begun in June 1942 with the Japanese occupation of Attu and Kiska. On 10 September 1942, Ro-65 and Ro-67 departed Sasebo, then called at Ōminato, Japan, from 13 to 15 September and at Paramushiro in the northern Kurile Islandsfrom 19 to 21 September before proceeding to their new operating base at Kiska, which they reached on 26 September 1942. Almost as soon as they arrived, American aircraft attacked the harbor, inflicting damage on Ro-67 that forced her to head back to Ōminato repairs. Ro-65 stayed on at Kiska, and on 28 September 1942 suffered minor damage to her conning tower when American aircraft strafed her during another air raid. Ro-65 departed Kiska in company with the submarine with orders to conduct a reconnaissance of Cold Bay on the Alaska Peninsula in the Territory of Alaska. Ro-65 penetrated Cold Bay on 10 October 1942 and returned to Kiska on 15 October 1942. On 17 October 1942, Ro-65 got underway to rescue the survivors of the destroyer , which had been sunk in an American air attack that day in the Bering Sea northeast of Kiska at , and to stand by to rescue the crew of the destroyer — which had suffered heavy damage in the same attack — in case she sank. Ro-65 left her patrol area on 19 October 1942 and on 21 October received orders to conduct a reconnaissance of Holtz Bay on the northeast coast of Attu. She reconnoitered Holtz Bay on 23 October and returned to Kiska on 31 October 1942. =Loss= Ro-65 was anchored at Kiska on 3 November 1942 when B-24 Liberator bombers of the United States Army Air Forces Eleventh Air Force attacked the harbor. To avoid attack by the approaching bombers, all submarines in the harbor crash-dived as soon as Japanese forces detected the incoming raid. When Ro-65 submerged, her main induction valve and conning tower hatch were still open, and the force of water rushing in shoved her quartermaster aside when he attempted to close the lower hatch to the conning tower. Heavy flooding ensued, drowning 19 members of her crew in her after section as she sank with a 30-degree down angle by the stern, coming to rest with her stern on the harbor bottom. Her 45 survivors escaped through her torpedo tubes, after which her bow section also lost buoyancy and sank to the bottom of the harbor at . The Japanese struck Ro-65 from the Navy list on 1 August 1943. Later events Divers from the United States Navy rescue and salvage ship surveyed the wreck of Ro-65 at Kiska in September 1989.

Due to the popularity of Rumcajs stories in Poland, a Polish baby detergent was named after Cipísek.P. 48 in: Barbara Jędrychowska, Anna Olchówka, Reception of Czechoslovakian Cartoons in the Polish Contemporary Educational Sphere, Czech-Polish Historical and Pedagogical Journal, 2013, vol. 5, issue 2, pp.44-54 On April 4, 2011, the hundredth anniversary of Václav Čtvrtek's birth, Rumcajs and Cipísek featured in the Google doodle on the Czech-language Google home page.\\"Rumcajs tops Google home page in Czech Republic\\" (retrieved on December 5, 2019) A minor character named Rumtzays (Redbeard in the English translation) appears in Blood and Wine, a 2016 expansion pack for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.

It was released on Netflix and in select theaters on January 31, 2020. The film has been described as a \\"raw and emotionally revealing look\\" at Swift \\"during a transformational period in her life as she learns to embrace her role not only as a songwriter and performer, but as a woman harnessing the full power of her voice\\". Miss Americana debuted at the opening night of 2020 Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2020 to critical acclaim, with praise directed towards the documentary's intimacy and vulnerability. It also became the highest-rated Netflix-original biographical documentary by a recording artist in IMDb history. Synopsis Miss Americana follows Swift and her life over the course of several years of her career. It is a biographical compilation of interviews, flashbacks, studio footage, home videos, cellphone videos and concert recordings that cover a number of events in Swift's life and career, including the making of her sixth and seventh studio albums, Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019), her past battle with body dysmorphia and allied eating disorder, her mother's cancer diagnosis, the toxic internet culture and media scrutiny she faces, her sexual assault trial, and her decision to go public with her political views, including LGBT+ allyship. Netflix described the film as a \\"raw and emotionally revealing look\\" at Swift \\"during a transformational period in her life as she learns to embrace her role not only as a songwriter and performer, but as a woman harnessing the full power of her voice\\". The Sundance Institute outlined: \\"Director Lana Wilson offers a multifaceted window into Swift, her creative process, and her singular experience of being one of the brightest lights on the world's global stage. Showcasing Swift's trademark vulnerability and her fierce intelligence and wit, Wilson captures moments both tender and exhilarating as the superstar embarks on the latest chapter of her already extraordinary career\\".

Background Taylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour.alt= Swift expressed interest in making a documentary with Netflix following the concert film Taylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour, which premiered on the streaming platform in December 2018. She was provided with a list of potential directors, of which Wilson was one. Wilson began filming at the end of the Reputation album and tour cycle, and joined Swift for recording sessions of her subsequent album Lover. The title of the documentary is borrowed from \\"Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince\\", the seventh track on Lover, in which Swift expressed her disillusionment over the current state of United States politics. Swift revealed the documentary in November 2019, when she said the owner and founder of her former label Big Machine Records, Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta respectively, blocked her from using older music and performance footage for the documentary. She added that the documentary does not mention Braun, Borchetta, or Big Machine. Big Machine denied the accusations in a statement. In response, a representative for Swift published an email from a Big Machine executive refusing to issue licences in connection to the documentary. In December, Variety reported Big Machine had cleared the use of Swift's older material for the film. On December 2019, Netflix revealed that the documentary was set to premiere at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival. In an interview with Chris Willman of Variety, it was revealed that the opening act of the film deals with \\"juxtaposing the joys of creation with the aggravations of global stardom\\" while the second half is a \\"provocative turn focused on why Swift became a political animal\\". Willman wrote that the film further features clips capturing Swift's increasing LGBTQ allyship, Swift's reaction to her mother's cancer diagnosis, and Swift's response to her 2017 album Reputation not receiving any nominations in general categories at the 2019 Grammy Awards. Wilson stated that she views the movie as \\"looking at the flip side of being America's sweetheart\\", meant to shed light on the less- glamorous side of fame and stardom. Promotion On January 15, 2020, Swift revealed the release date and a poster of the film through her social media accounts. Six days later, an official trailer to the film was released on YouTube and on Swift's social media accounts. On January 30, Swift announced the list of select theatres that will play Miss Americana, for a limited time. It includes 25 Alamo Drafthouse theatres and an iPic theatre in the United States, and the Prince Charles Cinema in the United Kingdom. Music The documentary includes the song \\"Only the Young\\", which plays during the end credits of the film. Swift wrote the song after the 2018 United States elections, though it was not included on Lover. Upon release, the song received acclaim from music critics, who praised its lyrics that deal with gun violence and school shootings in the United States. It debuted and peaked at number one on the US Billboard Digital Song Sales chart. Critical reception Miss Americana was met with critical acclaim upon release. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a \\"certified fresh\\" approval rating of 91% based on 91 reviews, with an average rating of 7.36/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Miss Americana provides an engaging if somewhat deliberately opaque backstage look at a pop star turned cultural phenomenon.\\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". After premiering at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival, the film received critical praise and a standing ovation from the audience. Miss Americana has been described as an \\"intimate\\", \\"genuine\\", \\"funny\\" and \\"empowering\\" film, that documents \\"her humble beginnings as a country-music star to her position as an influential figure in pop culture\\". Critics complimented the film for Wilson's direction, and the \\"emotional heft\\" that came from Swift's vulnerable interviews discussing issues such as eating disorder, self esteem and sexual assault, and also for the portrayal of Swift's creative process. Wesley Morris of The New York Times chose Miss Americana as his \\"critic's pick\\", describing the film as \\"85 minutes of translucence\\" with Swift, stating that she is \\"self-critical, grown up and ready, perhaps, to deliver a message beyond the music\\". Nancy Coleman, of the same magazine, opined that the film \\"opens a rare, honest window on what makes this star [Swift] tick\\". Hannah Woodhead of Little White Lies opined that the film offers \\"unprecedented access to the notoriously private singer and her dizzying world\\" through \\"interviews, studio footage, home videos and concert recordings\\". She described the film as \\"glossy, conventional, flicking between past and present with a warm intimacy\\" as Swift \\"bares her soul in this intimate, earnest docu-portrait\\". Slash Films Chris Evangelita termed the film as a \\"dynamite crowd pleaser\\" and described it as \\"a sweet, surprisingly funny portrait of Taylor Swift growing up and getting political\\". Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter wrote \\"what's ultimately very endearing about Swift is her intelligence and self-awareness, qualities that also make her music compelling, sophisticated and capable of appealing both to adolescent kids and hipster musicologists\\". Writing for The Salt Lake Tribune, Sean Means stated that the film is \\"an eye-opening look at Taylor Swift finding a new voice\\" and \\"shows Swift as an artist and activist just warming up for the next act\\". Amber Wilkinson of The Times wrote that the \\"intimate and open\\" documentary offers \\"a much more personal and open consideration of a star who has always been known for her onstage sound and who is now finding her political voice off stage too\\". The Atlantic's Spencer Kornhaber wrote that Miss Americana portrays \\"a pop star facing a daunting challenge—redefining success\\", acting as \\"a container for the dictates of supposedly meritocratic capitalist patriarchy\\". He added that the film does not depict a \\"drastic change\\" but rather \\"a tough, somewhat deflating process of self-recognition\\". Deciders Anna Menta commented that \\"Wilson and her team captured moments that felt personal, vulnerable, and deeply authentic, and they did so with a skill and artistry that Instagram Live stories just can't match\\". Steve Pond of TheWrap pointed out that \\"the heart of Miss Americana is Taylor Swift telling us what she stands for on gay rights and women's rights, and what she's learned about the fate of being a woman in the public eye\\". Glamours Marie-Claire Chappet wrote: \\"Miss Americana shows Taylor is sick of the restrictive parameters set out for women in the spotlight. She defies her advisors and gets political — breaking her silence and following in the footsteps of the Dixie Chicks – with thankfully less damaging consequences. She begins using her voice for what she cares about – like LGBTQ rights – and stops caring if Twitter thinks she's over – if the industry doesn't think she's 'likeable'.\\" The New Yorkers Amanda Petrusich concluded that the \\"beautiful\\" film is \\"far more interesting than any acceptance speech, red- carpet interview, or paparazzi photo\\". In his critic's pick review, IndieWire's David Ehrlich wrote that \\"the power of Miss Americana\\" is \\"watching someone who stands astride the world gradually realize that her art is the only thing that she can control\\", adding that Wilson is \\"so good at splitting the difference that some of her documentary's most humanizing moments are beautiful for how they contradict Swift's intention\\". He concluded that \\"it's truly enough to make you feel like an asshole for ever thinking that Swift was some kind of Aryan crypto-fascist, and not just a mega-famous young woman who didn't yet love herself enough to be hated for her convictions\\". In a two-star review for The Guardian, Benjamin Lee describes Miss Americana as \\"too stage-managed\\" and a \\"brand management dressed up as insight\\". Nick Allen for RogerEbert.com describes the film as \\"engineered to appease her fans and promote Swift's self-awareness\\". Mike Ryan of Uproxx wrote that the movie is \\"frustrating\\" due to its \\"lack of depth when discussing interesting issues\\", instead opting for \\"montages of victories\\". Beth Webb of Empire opined that \\"nothing new seems to break through her [Swift's] barriers\\" in the documentary. Varietys Owen Gleiberman opined that the documentary is \\"a controlled and sanded-off confection of pop-diva image management\\", where Swift \\"presents of herself is just chancy and sincere enough\\" in the film \\"to draw us in\\".

TechCrunch's Matthew Panzarino stated that, \\"in nearly a decade of attending Sundance, I've never seen a scene like the premiere of Miss Americana\\", and added that the \\"crowd before letting into the theater was huge\\", with rumors about how \\"there wouldn't be room for ticketed attendees\\". Upon release, the film became the highest-rated Netflix-original biographical documentary by an artist in IMDb history. Miss Americana fueled several conversations about eating disorders, body dysmorphia, exercise anorexia, self-esteem, toxic internet culture and sexual assault. Writing for The Washington Post, Jessica Gold, professor of psychiatry at the Washington University in St. Louis, stated that Swift \\"struck a powerful chord with viewers\\" with Miss Americana, \\"thanks to her honesty regarding her struggle for approval as a woman in today's society\\". Gold called Swift \\"the leader we need in 2020\\", who steps up to \\"fill gaps left by political leadership\\", during a time \\"when our political leaders are struggling to build consensus on and convey the gravity of issues\\" like mental health. She further explained that Swift's leadership \\"is commercially savvy, but it also shows how celebrities can now speak directly to fans, doing tremendous good in the process\\", concluding that \\"Swift is sending a powerful message, one that is likely to save lives in myriad ways\\". Kelly Douglas of The Mighty wrote: \\"Swift's powerful candor about her eating disorder behaviors and body image struggles will not only resonate with others facing similar struggles, but could also encourage others to seek help for their eating disorder behaviors\\". The New York Post Elana Fishman opined: \\"every so often, I'll still catch myself criticizing the way my tummy or legs look in a photo or how a certain pair of pants fits me. From now on, whenever that happens, I'll be repeating a line Swift says in the film — We do not do that anymore, because it's better to think you look fat than to look sick\\". Anne Petersen of BuzzFeed News commented that Swift \\"contributes, willingly or not, to our collective understanding of what beauty and success looks like, she is also talking about her susceptibility to the pressure of that understanding. She's refusing to hide, and thus continue to normalize, the behaviors that perpetuate it\\". The Daily Targum stated that despite being an expert when it comes to handling negative comments, even Swift \\"succumbed to insecurities that blossomed into eating problems, which shows how even the strongest among us are susceptible to potential eating disorders due to the toxic environment of social media\\". Ellen Ricks of HelloGiggles stated that \\"what inspires me most about Swift's reveal is how it can potentially impact so many people still fighting\\", as \\"there is still so much stigma and misinformation\\" surrounding eating disorders, thus praising Swift for \\"using her voice to shed light on the issue for her fans\\". In an interview with Glamour, Wilson talked about the positive comments she received regarding her decision to include Swift's eating disorder and body image issues in the film: Miss Americana further prompted many of Swift's past critics to respond to the documentary. American comedian Nikki Glaser wrote an apology on Instagram for her comments about Swift featured in the film. In the apology, Glaser stated that: \\"Unfortunately, I am featured in her [Swift's] new documentary as part of a montage of asshats saying mean things about her, which is used to explain why she felt the need to escape from the spotlight for a year\\", and admitted that her comments may have come from a place of \\"projection\\". She further added that \\"if you're familiar with my 'work' at all, you know I talk openly about battling some kind of eating disorder for the past 17 years, I was probably 'feeling fat' that day and was jealous\\". Swift responded: \\"One of the major themes of the doc is that we have the ability to change our opinions over time, to grow, to learn about ourselves. I'm so sorry to hear that you've struggled with some of the same things I've struggled with. Sending a massive hug\\". American writer Jenny Johnson also posted a lengthy apology on Instagram, writing that her comments about Swift being \\"annoying\\" were \\"made in jest\\", and stated: \\"please know I'm not against you, I'm with you and I apologize.\\" Journalist Richard S. took to Twitter to apologize to Swift for an article he wrote in 2016, titled \\"Taylor Swift Isn't Like Other Celebrities, She's Worse\\". He explained that the article was intended to \\"deconstruct the pettiness of the celebrity–industrial complex\\" and expressed his regret that the headline appeared to be \\"overly critical\\" of Swift. He concluded that he has \\"learned so much from Taylor's artistry over the years, and remain[s] a huge fan\\". American singer Katy Perry praised the film, stating that she was impressed by Miss Americana, because of its self-awareness and vulnerability, and commented that she was \\"really excited for her [Swift] to be able to show that to the world: that things aren't perfect, they don't have to be, and it's more beautiful when they aren't\\". Perry further added that Miss Americana inspires her to make her own documentary. Emily Strayer, of the American country music band The Chicks, commented on the documentary, stating: \\"The power she [Swift] has right now to change things is way beyond any power we [The Chicks] ever had. She's in a different person than we were ever\\". In a Prospect article titled \\"It's time to face the facts—our male pop stars need to try a bit harder\\", Caroline O'Donoghue pointed out how Miss Americana talks about \\"the need for female pop stars to be highly visual, and to change that visual often\\", and quoted a line from the documentary that Swift says: \\"The female artists I know of have to remake themselves 20 times more than the male artists, or else you're out of a job\\".  In popular culture  An alternative poster of the film, featuring a male alter-ego of Swift, appears in the music video for Swift's 2020 single \\"The Man\\". The camera pans over a \\"Mr. Americana\\" poster starring \\"Tyler Swift\\", directed by \\"Larry Wilson\\", and premiering at the 2020 \\"Mandance Festival\\", a wordplay on the 2020 Sundance Festival.

Early life and education He was the son of Col. Peter Atherton and Experience Wright. Atherton attended local schools in Worcester County and was tutored by the clergy. He was brought up to be farmer and was expected to follow his father’s footsteps and enter the lucrative blacksmithing trade. However Atherton was a sickly boy and was not considered suited to heavy labor. Instead he sought an education, he tutored younger children in order to pay towards college, running a local school in order to save for the tuition fees. At the age of 21, Atherton went on to study law under James Putnam at Harvard College, graduating in 1762. Career He opened his first law practice in Petersham, Massachusetts, in 1765. Atherton was also a teacher at the time. Atherton then decided to move to New Hampshire, moving to Litchfield, then settled in Merrimack where he established a law practice from 1765 to 1773. He moved to Amherst, New Hampshire, became a farmer and was elected as the Register of Probate in Hillsborough County in 1773. He spent the remainder of his life in Amherst. Notable events American Revolution New Hampshire was one of the thirteen colonies that rebelled against British rule during the American Revolution. Atherton at first joined the opponents to British rule, but refused to join the local Sons of Liberty, a secret revolutionary organization created to advance the rights of the colonists and fight taxation by the British government. Atherton then tried to remain neutral during the Revolution, believing the colonists could not win a war with England. The community was offended by his stance and had him arrested in 1777, jailing him in nearby Exeter, New Hampshire. As a result, he was fired from his position as register of probate and justice of the peace, and he resumed farming. After taking an oath of allegiance to the new state of New Hampshire in 1779, Atherton started practicing law again. In 1782, he became the leader of the Amherst committee to help draft a state constitution. The next year, as a member of the New Hampshire state constitutional convention, he helped revise state laws, advocated for a bill of rights for citizens, and fought to settle former Loyalist land claims. Major speech at convention In 1787 he was elected as a delegate to the convention in New Hampshire to ratify the federal constitution. He worked hard to defeat its ratification unless certain amendments were adopted. Atherton claimed it was poorly written; he insisted on a bill of rights to protect private beliefs and actions, and also defended the rights of town and state government against a too strong centralized government. In February 1788, Atherton delivered a major speech in opposition to Article 1, Section 9, Clause 1, of the proposed constitution. The focal point of his speech was about the evils of slavery. Atherton asserted that the southern states had made him a \\"partaker in the sin and guilt of this abominable\\" traffic in the buying and selling of slaves, and that the \\"clause has not secured its abolition\\". He argued that \\"we will not lend the aid of our ratification to this cruel and inhumane merchandise, not even for a day\\". Atherton continued on with a vivid description of the conditions of slavery, proclaiming: He voted against its adoption, on instructions from the town. The state finally ratified the constitution on June 21, 1788. Public office In 1791, Atherton was once again elected as justice of the peace, and was a member of the convention in Concord that drafted the new state constitution, revising the previous one of 1783. From 1792 to 1793, he was a member of the state senate, and after his resignation in 1793 from the senate, he was elected state attorney general that same year. In 1798, he was elected commissioner of Hillsborough County. In 1803 he retired because of a heart ailment. Other interests After his retirement, he helped establish the Franklin Society in Amherst, a library dedicated to historical events that changed the state. Personal life He married Abigail Goss, the daughter of a Congregational Minister in 1765. His son Charles Humphrey Atherton, was a lawyer, banker and politician from New Hampshire who served as a United States Representative from New Hampshire and as a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives during the early 1800s. He published his fathers’ memoirs. His daughter Mary Frances Atherton married William Gordon (New Hampshire politician). Family His father, Col. Peter Atherton was a blacksmith by trade, a farmer, magistrate. He also served in the Massachusetts Colonial Militia, then seen as a political position, rising to the rank of Colonel. The law in Massachusetts required all able men to keep a firearm and volunteer in the citizen army known as the militia. However the militia would fight alongside the British soldiers engaging the threats resulting from the French and Indian War during the mid-1700s. He went onto serve for a number of years as a member of the General Court, where he died in Jun 13th, 1764. Atherton’s younger brother Dr. Israel Atherton (b. Nov 20th, 1741, died 1822), studied Medicine in Harvard College. Death He died of heart disease on April 3, 1809. and is buried in Amherst Cemetery. Descendants His grandson Charles Gordon Atherton was a Democratic Representative and Senator from New Hampshire. He was responsible for composing the gag rule of December 1838, known as the “Atherton Gag”, which stifled any petitions relating to slavery. In 1844 the House rescinded this gag rule on a motion made by John Quincy Adams. Whatever his reasons, Joshua Atherton, as an early ardent anti-slavery campaigner would have objected to this rule. Ancestry Atherton was named after his grandfather; Joshua Atherton (b. May 13th, 1656, d. 1721) was a soldier in King Philip's War, under Captain Daniel Henchman (1623-1685) of Boston. He returned to Lancaster in 1687, settling at Still River, Massachusetts, then part of Lancaster, where he was a farmer and tanner. His great-grandfather James Atherton (d. 1710), arrived from England in the 1630s, and went to serve under Captain John Whiting’s Company. He went on to become one of the founders of Lancaster, MA. He died in Sherborn, Massachusetts, and is buried at the Old South Cemetery in Sherborn. He has been incorrectly attributed as a descendant of Humphrey Atherton within certain notable sources. His great-grandfather on his maternal line was Samuel Wardwell, a carpenter, was who was charged with witchcraft in 1692, and was hung at Witch Hill, in Andover, Massachusetts.

It begins at an interchange with I-35 on the northwest corner of Denton and loops around the north, east and southeast sides of the city before ending at another intersection with I-35E adjacent to Denton's shopping mall. The total length is . In recent years, several large retail stores have been built on or near the southeast portion of the loop, and this, coupled with ongoing road expansion projects, has resulted in extreme traffic congestion. Loop 288 is signed as a truck route for traffic traveling east on US 380 towards McKinney. Loop 288 was designated on September 21, 1955 from US 77 north to US 380 (then SH 24).

William Allen also made his telescope available for the use of the girls. In 1827 the varied curriculum available at Newington Academy for Girls was referenced in some doggerel verses by Joseph Pease who commented on the 'astounding variety of stores intellectual imbibed by pupils at the \\"N[ewington] Nunnery\\". Discipline at the school was strict. Deeply conservative in her own religious faith, Corder imposed this view on her school. She herself wore traditional Quaker dress and adopted this as the uniform for the girls in her school who had to wear Quaker bonnets among other items of dress, leading to much mockery from the girls at a nearby school. Nor were the girls’ spiritual needs forgotten as they were obliged to attend regular readings from the Scriptures and attend talks on religion given by William Allen and Sarah Tuke Grubb. School holidays involved visits to the British Museum and other worthy venues. Corder became an elder of her local Meeting house shortly after moving to Stoke Newington. As such in 1836 she was among the co-signatories of a warning letter to John Wilkinson who had caused a schism among the local Quaker community and in which he was entreated to be silent in their meetings.John Wilkinson, Quakerism Examined: In a Reply to the Letter of Samuel Tuke, Thomas Ward & Co. London (1836) – Google Books pg. 428 For 15 years she was on the revising committee of the Morning Meeting. In 1841 Corder published A Brief Outline of the Origin, Principles, and Church Government of the Society of Friends in which she emphasised her commitment to traditional Quaker dress, manners and teachings. Retirement and writing Corder retired sometime between 1840 to 1845 with the closure of Newington Academy for Girls and moved to Chelmsford where she spent her last years. It was at this time that she began writing in earnest; she had already published Memorials of Deceased Members of the Society of Friends which went through at least six revised editions and in which she wrote on the lives of 18th and 19th-century English and American Quakers, commenting on their spiritual lives, their opinions and their religious work – often describing their edifying deaths with some relish. Many of the subjects of the book were little known; one was her own pupil Ann Backhouse, who had died at the age of nineteen. Corder's decision to concentrate on the spiritual lives of her subjects rather than on their careers enabled her to maintain a roughly equal balance of male and female subjects – 27 men and 20 women. Corder wrote an 1853 biography about (and drawing largely on the diaries of) the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry,Life of Elizabeth Fry, W. & F. G. Cash, 1853 – 646 pages whom she knew well enough to accompany when the prison reformer escorted the King of Prussia to see the conditions at Newgate in 1842. Three years later Corder wrote a memoir of Priscilla Gurney, Fry's sister. Susanna Corder also published Christian Instruction in the History, Types, and Prophecies of the Old Testament (1854). She also wrote several pamphlets, including one advocating the exercise of spiritual gifts by women (1839). Susanna Corder died on 28 February 1864 at her home in ChelmsfordEngland & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858–1995 for Susanna Corder – 1864 – Ancestry.com and was buried in the town on 3 March.

She was safely returned home one week later.  Background  Dua Mangi is a law student, who studied in both the United States and in Karachi. She is the niece of the Sindhi poet and columnist Aijaz Mangi, who is outspoken about feminism, politics, and human rights and deeply critical of atrocities in society.  Abduction  Mangi and her male friend Haris Soomro were out in the evening getting food from a restaurant on November 30 around 8 pm. While walking back a car with at least four men pulled up alongside them and threatened them with a gun. Other sources have stated that there were five men in the vehicle, with only one using a mask. When Soomro attempted to fight back and protect Mangi he was shot by at least one of the men in the neck and the bullet traveled into his chest. The car used by the abductors was stolen from the area the previous week.  Release  She was reportedly returned home safely by officials December 7, 2019.  Investigation  The Karachi Police have released a statement in which they believe the abduction occurred because Mangi had met a man in the United States and had been pressuring her to marry him and had threatened her. According to Mangi's father she had a fight with a man shortly before her abduction. At least twenty-two witnesses, mostly of family and friends, spoke with investigators shortly after the abduction. As Mangi's phone fell onto the road, it was being used to help investigate the abduction. Officials used CCTV footage to attempt to identify the attackers, and have impounded the car they believe to be a part of the crime.  Response  News of her abduction was posted on social media by family and friends, creating a heated debate over victim blaming and whether the perpetrators were actually justified over abducting her due to her actions online and her clothing. With the family's influence in civil society and media, a protest was staged at the city's Teen Talwar roundabout.

This results in excessive movement of the vertebrae which can cause neuronal injury and compression of nearby structures including the spinal cord, vertebral artery or vagus nerve, causing a constellation of symptoms. It is frequently co- morbid with atlanto-axial instability, Chiari malformation and tethered cord syndrome. It is more common in people with a connective tissue disease, notably Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta and rheumatoid arthritis. It is often brought on by a trauma, frequently whiplash. Symptoms and signs The impact of craniocervical instability can range from minor symptoms to severe disability, with some patients being bed-bound. The constellation of symptoms caused by craniocervical instability has been labelled the cervico-medullary syndrome.Batzdorf U, Henderson F, Rigamonti D 2015. \\"Consensus statement on Cervico-Medullary Syndrome.\\" In Co-morbidities that complicate the treatment and outcomes of Chiari malformation.

Lying supine can bring short-term relief. Diagnosis Craniocervical instability is usually diagnosed through neuro-anatomical measurement using radiography. Upright magnetic resonance imaging is considered the most accurate method, and supine magnetic resonance imaging, CT scan or digital motion X-ray, or Digital X-ray are also used. The measurements to diagnose craniocervical instability are: * Clivo-Axial Angle equal or less than 135 degrees * Grabb-Oakes measurement equal or greater than 9 mm * Harris measurement greater than 12mm * Spinal subluxation Alternatively, craniocervical instability can be diagnosed if a trial of cervical traction, typically using a halo fixation device, results in a significant alleviation of symptoms. Treatment Conservative treatment of craniocervical instability includes physical therapy and the use of a cervical collar to keep the neck stable. Cervical spinal fusion is performed on patients with more severe symptoms. Prolotherapy, including with stem cells, is another treatment option used but there is limited scientific evidence to date.

First commissioned in 1925, she served in the waters of Japan and Chōsen prior to World War II. During World War II, she operated in the Central Pacific, supported the Japanese invasion of Rabaul, and took part in the Aleutian Islands campaign, then in late 1942 was relegated to a role as a training ship. She was sunk in April 1945. Design and description The submarines of the Type L4 sub-class were copies of the Group 3 subclass of the British L-class class submarine built under license in Japan.Chesneau, Roger, ed., Conway′s All the World′s Fighting Ships 1922–1946, New York: Mayflower Books, 1980, , p. 203. They were slightly larger and had two more torpedo tubes than the preceding submarines of the L3 subclass. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long and had a beam of and a draft of . They had a diving depth of . For surface running, the submarines were powered by two Vickers diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged, each propeller was driven by an electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, they had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . The submarines were armed with six internal torpedo tubes, all in the bow, and carried a total of twelve 6th Year Type torpedoes. They were also armed with a single deck gun and a 6.5 mm machine gun. Construction and commissioning Ro-64 was laid down as Submarine No. 79 on 15 October 1923 by Mitsubishi at Kobe, Japan. Launched on 19 August 1924, She was renamed Ro-64 on 1 November 1924 while fitting out. She was completed and commissioned on 30 April 1925. Service history Pre-World War II Upon commissioning, Ro-64 was attached to the Maizuru Naval District and assigned to Submarine Division 33. On 1 June 1925, she was transferred to the Sasebo Naval District and reassigned to Submarine Division 24, in which she remained until 1939. Submarine Division 24 was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 1 in the 1st Fleet in the Combined Fleet on 1 December 1925. On 1 March 1926, Ro-64 and the submarines , , , , , and departed Sasebo, Japan, bound for Okinawa, which they reached the same day. The eight submarines got underway from Okinawa on 30 March 1926 for a training cruise in Chinese waters off Shanghai and Amoy which concluded with their arrival at Mako off Formosa on 5 April 1926. They departed Mako on 20 April 1926 for the return leg of their training cruise, operating off China near Chusan Island, then returned to Sasebo on 26 April 1926. On 27 March 1927, Ro-60, Ro-61, Ro-62, Ro-63, and Ro-64 departed Saeki Bay, Japan, for a training cruise off Tsingtao, China, which they concluded with their arrival at Sasebo, Japan, on 16 May 1927. On 10 December 1928, Submarine Division 24 was transferred back to the Sasebo Naval District and began service in the Sasebo Defense Division, and Ro-64 was decommissioned that day and placed in reserve. On 30 November 1929, Submarine Division 24 returned to duty in Submarine Squadron 1 in the 1st Fleet, and on 1 December 1929 Ro-64 was recommissioned and returned to service in the division. Submarine Division 24 transferred back to the Sasebo Naval District on 1 December 1930 and began a stint in the Sasebo Defense Division on 1 December 1931. Ro-64 again was decommissioned on 1 December 1932 and placed in reserve. Ro-64 was recommissioned on 25 March 1933, resuming active service in Submarine Division 24 and in the Sasebo Guard Squadron in the Sasebo Naval District. The division′s service in the Sasebo Guard Squadron ended on 15 November 1934, after which it was assigned directly to the Sasebo Naval District until 1 December 1936, when it was assigned to the Sasebo Defense Squadron. Sources differ on Ro-64′s status between 1 December 1936 and 1 May 1939, both implying that she remained active during that time and stating that she was out of commission in the Sasebo Naval District in Fourth Reserve from 1 December 1936 to 1 March 1939 and then in Second Reserve until 1 May 1939. On 1 May 1939, Ro-64 was assigned to the Chinkai Defense Division on the south coast of Chōsen. She returned to Submarine Division 24 and the Sasebo Naval District on 1 July 1939. On 15 November 1939, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 33 in the Kure Naval District for service at the submarine school at Kure, Japan. She was decommissioned on 20 March 1940, but returned to commission on 26 July 1940 and resumed service in Submarine Division 33 at the submarine school. On 15 November 1939, Submarine Division 33 was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 7 in the 4th Fleet in the Combined Fleet. When the Imperial Japanese Navy deployed for the upcoming conflict in the Pacific, Ro-64 was at Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands with the other submarines of Submarine Division 33, Ro-63 and . She received the message \\"Climb Mount Niitaka 1208\\" () from the Combined Fleet on 2 December 1941, indicating that war with the Allies would commence on 8 December 1941 Japan time, which was on 7 December 1941 on the other side of the International Date Line in Hawaii. World War II =Central Pacific= At 16:00 on 4 December 1941, Ro-64 got underway from Kwajalein in company with Ro-68 with orders to conduct a reconnaissance of the Phoenix Islands, patrol off Howland Island, and attack any American forces they encountered after the war began. On 5 December 1941, she paused to reconnoiter Majuro in the Marshall Islands before proceeding to the Phoenix Islands, which she reached on 7 December. She arrived at Howland Island on 8 December and began a periscope reconnaissance of it. With the war underway, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service raided Howland that day, and on 10 December 1941 Ro-64 received orders to destroy whatever facilities on Howland had survived the air attack. After sunset on 10 December 1941, Ro-64 approached Howland Island. Her commanding officer initially intended to send a landing party ashore to destroy the surviving facilities, but decided against the landing at 22:40 Japan Standard Time (JST) out of a concern that defenders ashore had sighted Ro-64 and because of a relatively high sea state. He decided instead to shell Howland with Ro-64′s deck gun, and at 02:00 JST on 11 December 1941 Ro-64 began her bombardment, firing at the island′s wireless and weather station, barracks, and lighthouse. She departed the Howland area at 03:00 JST to rendezvous with Ro-68 off Baker Island, which Ro-68 had bombarded. Between 15:00 and 15:20 JST on 11 December, Ro-64 also bombarded Baker Island. She returned to Kwajalein in company with Ro-68 on 15 December 1941. Ro-64 got underway from Kwajalein on 24 December 1941 to patrol off Wake Island, which had fallen to Japanese forces on 23 December 1941 in the Battle of Wake Island. She arrived off Wake on 27 December and then patrolled east of the atoll from 28 to 30 December 1941, when she made port at Wake. She departed Wake on 1 January 1942 and called at Truk in the Caroline Islands from 6 to 15 January before getting back underway in company with Ro-63 and Ro-68 to conduct a reconnaissance of Rabaul on New Britain in the Admiralty Islands. She then patrolled south of Cape St. George on New Ireland in support of Japanese forces landing at Rabaul before she returned to Truk on 29 January 1942. Ro-63, Ro-64, and Ro-68 left Truk on 18 February 1942, called at Ponape from 23 to 24 February, and then set out for the Marshall Islands area. During their voyage, however, Ro-63′s horizontal rudder failed on 27 February 1942, and Ro-64 accompanied her as she proceeded to Bikini Atoll for repairs. The two submarines arrived at Bikini on 28 February 1942 and got back underway on 1 March, but Ro-63′s jury-rigged rudder quickly broke again, forcing her to turn back to Bikini while Ro-64 proceeded independently. Ro-64 arrived at Kwajalein on 12 March 1942. On 16 March 1942, Ro-64 departed Kwajalein to head for Japan, calling along the way at Ponape from 19 to 20 March 1942, at Truk from 21 to 27 March 1942, and at Saipan in the Mariana Islands from 29 to 30 March 1942 before arriving at Maizuru, Japan, on 7 April 1942. =Aleutian Islands campaign= On 14 July 1942, Submarine Division 33 was reassigned to the 5th Fleet for service in the Aleutian Islands, where the Aleutian Islands campaign had begun in June 1942 with the Japanese occupation of Attu and Kiska. At 16:00 on 24 July 1942, Ro-63, Ro-64, and Ro-68 departed Yokosuka, Japan, on 24 July 1942 bound for Paramushiro in the northern Kurile Islands, but an outbreak of food poisoning forced Ro-64 to turn back. She arrived at Yokosuka on 26 July 1942, and on 27 July again departed for Paramushiro, which she reached on 1 August 1942. She put to sea again on 2 August 1942 to head for Kiska, arriving there on 6 August 1942. Thereafter, she was based there along with the submarines , Ro-61, Ro-62, Ro-63, , , and Ro-68. On 7 August 1942, an American task force bombarded Kiska while I-6, Ro-61, Ro-64, and Ro-68 were anchored in the harbor, and they crash-dived to avoid damage. Between 8 and 10 August 1942, Ro-61, Ro-63, Ro-64, and Ro-68 sought to intercept the American ships, but failed to find them. From 11 to 13 August 1942, Ro-64 participated with Ro-63 in a search for the crew of a ditched reconnaissance plane, and Ro-64 subsequently conducted a patrol off the Aleutians, departing Kiska on 17 August 1942 and returning on 26 August 1942. On 28 August 1942, a Kiska-based Aichi E13A1 (Allied reporting name \\"Jake\\") reconnaissance floatplane sighted the U.S. Navy seaplane tender — which the plane′s crew mistakenly identified as a light cruiser — and a destroyer in Nazan Bay on the coast of Atka. Ro-61, Ro-62, and Ro-64 got underway from Kiska that day to intercept the ships, and all three of them arrived off Atka on 29 August 1942. Ro-64 made no contact with enemy forces and returned to Kiska on 4 September 1942. Ro-64 conducted another patrol off the Aleutians from 5 to 17 September 1942, and while she was at sea Submarine Division 33 was attached directly to the 51st Base Unit at Kiska on 15 September 1942. While Ro-64 was at Kiska on 25 September 1942, Submarine Division 33 was reassigned to the Kure Naval District. Ro-63, Ro-64, and Ro-68 departed Kiska on 26 September 1942 bound for Maizuru, where they arrived on 5 October 1942. =Training duties= Ro-64 departed Maizuru on 6 October 1942 and arrived at Kure on 8 October 1942. Thereafter, Submarine Division 33 was assigned to training duties in the Kure Naval District, and Ro-64 spent the rest of her career as a training submarine. Submarine Division 33 was assigned to the Kure Submarine Squadron on 1 December 1943. =Loss= At 14:28 JST on 12 April 1945, Ro-64 was submerged in Hiroshima Bay during a training cruise when she detonated a magnetic mine laid by an American aircraft. She sank quickly at with the loss of all 81 men on board — her crew of 50, the embarked commander of Submarine Division 33, and 30 trainees. The Japanese struck her from the Navy list on 10 August 1945.

It is situated north-northwest of Stewart, southeast of Mount White-Fraser, and east of Mount Lindeborg, which is its nearest higher peak. Precipitation runoff from the peak and meltwater from the Boundary and Salmon Glaciers that surround the peak drains into the Salmon River. Mount Lindeborg was the name adopted for this feature in 1921, however by 1924 it was renamed Mount Bayard in lieu of Lindeborg. The Mount Lindeborg name was transferred to the peak immediately west. Mount Bayard was named by the International Boundary Commission for Thomas F. Bayard (1828-1898), a diplomat and United States Senator. The mountain's name was officially adopted July 31, 1927, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The mountain is also known as Boundary Peak 15. Weather permitting, the mountain can be seen from the gravel Granduc Mine Road at Hyder, Alaska. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Bayard is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.

She won a silver medal as skip of the Scottish women's team at the 2015 World Junior Curling Championships and has competed in the World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship five times.  Curling career  In back-to-back years, 2014 and 2015, Aitken skipped her team to victory at the Scottish Junior Championships, with teammates Naomi Brown, Rowena Kerr, and Rachel Hannen. At the 2014 World Junior Curling Championships Aitken's team finished the round robin with a 3–6 record, missing the playoffs. Returning to the World Juniors in 2015, they found much more success. Aitken and Team Scotland finished the round robin in second place with a 6–3 record. In the page playoffs, Team Scotland defeated the number one seeded Canada in the 1 vs. 2 game and Sweden in the semifinals, thus setting up a rematch with Team Canada in the final. In the final, Canada, skipped by Kelsey Rocque, got their revenge, defeating Scotland 8–2. Earlier in the 2014–2015 season, Aitken and her juniors team also won bronze at the Scottish Women's Curling Championship, Aitken's best finish at that championship. Aitken has also competed in the Scottish Mixed Curling Championship, playing third for Bruce Mouat in 2015 and 2016. At the 2016 Championship they won the bronze medal. Aitken is also prolific in mixed doubles, where she has won the Scottish Mixed Doubles title five times. The first four championships, Aitken competed with her longtime teammate Bruce Mouat. Each Scottish title earned Aitken the right to represent Scotland at the World Mixed Doubles Championship, with her best finish being 4th at the 2016 Championship where they lost to the United States team of Joe Polo and Tabitha Peterson in the bronze medal match. For the 2018–19 season, Aitken decided to focus on mixed doubles with her new teammate Scott Andrews. Andrews became injured shortly before the Scottish Mixed Doubles Championship, but Duncan Menzies filled in for Andrews and together they won Aitken her fifth Championship. Andrews was healed in time for the 2019 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship, where they finished tied for 9th place, losing to Team Estonia in the first round of the playoffs.

Its objective is to deliver an efficient, performant programming model that eliminates the need for developers to maintain separate code bases, multiple programming languages, and different tools and workflows for each architecture.  The oneAPI Specification  The oneAPI specification extends existing developer programming models to enable multiple hardware architectures through a data-parallel language, a set of library APIs, and a low-level hardware interface to support cross-architecture programming. It builds upon industry standards and provides an open, cross- platform developer stack.  The Language – Data Parallel C++  DPC++ is an open, cross-architecture language built upon the ISO C++ and Khronos Group SYCL standards. DPC++ extends these standards with explicit parallel constructs like sub-groups and unified shared memory offload interfaces to support a broad range of computing architectures and processors, including CPUs and accelerators. Extensions are contributed back to standards bodies. An example of this is the contribution of unified shared memory, group algorithms and sub-groups to SYCL 2020.

The center of diversity appears to be in Central Russia. Its chromosome number is 2n=16. Description The somewhat recumbent A. arenarius has slender branched stems from 10 to 40cm long, and typically reaches30 cm tall. It can be distinguished from its congeners by its having leaflets grouped in 2 to 6 pairs, 2 to 4mm wide by 10 to 20mm long; calyces that are characterized by having mostly strongly asymmetric bifurcate hairs; a standard (the large posterior petal seen in legume flowers) 15 to 17mm long; and legumes that 12 to 20 mmlong. Its petals range in color from light purple to lilac, and rarely can be white. The flowering time is from June to July. Ecology In a typical sandy habitat As the specific name implies it grows in sandy or gravelly areas, in places that have limited competition from grasses, such as sandy open pine woodlands, dunes, river banks, roadsides and railway embankments.

It was created in 2004 by entrepreneur Lee Jin-wook, with consultation from dermatologist Dr. Jung Sung-jae. Their name is an abbreviation of \\"Doctor Joins Art\\", which reflects their positioning philosophy as \\"a fusion of dermatological science and art\\". Their products are described as combining active ingredient-rich formulas with modern packaging. Dr. Jart+'s best-selling products include moisturizers from their Ceramidin and Cicapair lines, \\"rubber\\" face masks and BB creams. The brand is noted as the first to introduce BB creams to the American market in 2011. Dr. Jart's parent company, Have & Be, was acquired by Estée Lauder in 2019.  History  In spring 2003, entrepreneur Lee Jin-wook () was waiting in the lobby of a dermatology clinic in Gangnam, Seoul, as he observed a group of young women enthused by a product on display, which was BB cream. He began to research the product closely, and later left his post at an architectural firm to focus on his venture. Dr. Jung Sung-jae () had been working out of his own Seoul practice since 2001, where he was constantly testing new treatments for his patients with severe skin issues. Lee approached him to invest and consult on Dr. Jart+, with the intent to bring Jung's formulations to a wider audience. The name \\"Jart\\" was initially coined as a portmanteau of \\"Jung\\" and \\"art\\". Jung remains as the brand's chief dermatologist. alt= Dr. Jart+ was in development for three years before being exclusively introduced to dermatology clinics. It was launched in December 2004 with a capital of 50 million won (roughly US$47,000 in 2019). Dr. Jart+ was first sold through e-commerce, which Lee described as a \\"rarity\\" in the cosmetics industry. Its revenue in 2005 only amounted to 500 million won, but began to increase through word-of- mouth on online retailer SkinRx Lab. By 2008, its sales amounted to seven billion won. In its early days, Lee focused extensively on exporting Dr. Jart+ outside of Asia, strategizing that the brand's popularity in Asian territories would follow after pioneering more \\"difficult\\" markets first. The brand partnered with Japanese department store Takashimaya in June 2009 to offer their products at its now-defunct Fifth Avenue location, which effectively made Dr. Jart+ the first Korean brand since Amorepacific to have a presence in New York. It entered the greater American market in early 2011 with cosmetics retailer Sephora, offering two BB creams at ten of its locations at the time, which was a \\"hit\\". The New York Times credited this launch as \\"[paving] the way for a Korean beauty invasion of the United States\\" and spawning iterations from L'Oreál to Dior. The brand has since expanded to selling 50 products at all Sephora outlets.  Products  alt= Dr. Jart+ is composed of nine lines, each focused on a specific ingredient or skin issue: * Cicapair — utilizes tiger grass (centella asiatica) to \\"[calm] redness and [soothe] irritation\\" * Ceramidin — 5-Cera Complex (ceramides) to \\"restore and repair the skin barrier\\" * Water Fuse — AquaMineral Complex (minerals) to impart skin hydration * BB Cream * Dermaclear — Hydrogen Bio Water (micellar solution) to cleanse, exfoliate skin * Water Drop — hyaluronic acid; features a \\"unique emulsion system\\" that \\"bursts into tiny water droplets\\" * Peptidin — 8-Peptide Complex (peptides) * Focuspot — patches composed of \\"micro tips\\" to target specific conditions * V7 — V7 Multi-Vitamin Complex (vitamin B3, C, F, K3, B5, E, and H)  Corporate affairs   Identity  Dr. Jart+ eschews celebrity endorsements in favor of animation to communicate their brand. Dr. Jart+'s branding and packaging was refreshed by design firm Pentagram in 2018, starting with the international roll-out of their newly-created Ceramidin line. Tuesday, March 24, 2020 Dr. Jart+ is considered to be among the forefront of brands leading the Korean beauty wave. In an article for Racked, Ju Rhyu, a business-to-business consultant, believes that Dr. Jart+ is keen to \\"downplay\\" this angle, like competitors Amorepacific and Belif. These companies communicate a \\"very clear brand identity and the K-beauty message is more secondary,\\" in an effort to secure brand loyalty and longevity. In an email by Dr. Jart+'s vice president of marketing, Susan Tsui, they state that the brand is \\"proud of its Korean roots\\", yet \\"Dr. Jart+ is fueled by our commitment to adhere to what we were founded on, art and skincare.\\"  Advertising  Dr. Jart+ has been the exclusive skin care sponsor of designer brand Opening Ceremony at New York Fashion Week since 2015. The brand has stocked their products in their retail stores since 2011.

Evidence of the giant planet was discovered by a team of astronomers from the UK, Chile and Germany. The system was initially identified as a cataclysmic variable on the basis of weak H-alpha emissions in the spectrum by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). After closer inspection the team of astronomers discovered oxygen and sulfur lines in the SDSS spectra. The team then obtained spectroscopic follow-up observations with X-Shooter on ESO's Very Large Telescope. The spectra confirmed the previous observations by SDSS and found additional lines. Dusty and gaseous debris disks around white dwarfs are known, but they are dominated by calcium lines and no previous disk around a white dwarf showed Hα emission. All previous disks around white dwarfs originate from rocky planetary bodies. The size of the disk around WD J0914+1914 was measured with the help of Doppler- broadbanded emission lines. The disk around the white dwarf is too large (~1-10 solar radii) to be formed by a small minor planet, which was tidally disrupted inside the Roche Radius. The team was also able to exclude accretion of material from a companion star or brown dwarf. The most plausible explanation is an evaporating giant planet, orbiting close to the white dwarf. The atmosphere of the planet is evaporated by the strong ultraviolet radiation of the hot white dwarf. The planet is likely located at a distance of 15 solar radii from the white dwarf and orbits the white dwarf in 10 days. The composition of the accreted material show similarity of the deeper layers of the ice giants in the solar system. The team estimated that the planet around WD J0914+1914 will lose about 0.04 Neptune masses and thus this process will not significantly change the structure of the planet.

PNAS, doi:https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1414577112.] The current fossil record has found this genus in only one location, the Doushantuo Formation in Guizhou, China.[Behrensmeyer, A. K., and A. Turner. 2013.“Eocyathispongia.” Fossilworks, http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=taxonInfo&taxon;_no=324165.] It lived in shallow seas as a filter feeder. Description As of yet, only one fossil of the genus has been found, but it was excellently preserved. The specific attributes for this genus have yet to be confirmed until more specimens are found. Eocyathispongia qiania Eocyathispongia qiania is the only species in the Eocyathispongia genus. It is an epifaunal filter feeder that consists of three tubes, with two smaller side tubes that likely filtered in water, and a large, twisting, center tube that likely filtered water out. The cells inside the tubes are flat and porous, as would be expected in a filter feeder. The cells on the bottom of the fossil are less porous to keep the animal grounded, and the calls on the outside of the tube differ from those on the inside. The creature is asymmetrical. The fossil found was only about 1.1 millimeters tall and 1.2 millimeters wide, so it can be assumed that the species as a whole would be about the same size since there is no evidence indicating the fossil found was not a fully grown specimen. Modern resemblance The specimen found is surprisingly similar to sponges alive today. The cellular structure is almost identical to some modern-day sponges, and the less porous basal side is also consistent with modern sponges. However, it does not resemble any one species of sponge, so it is possibly a crown group. Etymology The genus name consists of a combination of the Greek word for dawn, eo, and the greek word for cup-shaped, cyathifer, to describe what the creature looks like. “Spongia” was added to the end to indicate that the genus is that of a sponge. Significance This genus is significant mostly for the time period it was alive is in. Until the discovery of this creature, the existence of sponges, like this one, in the Ediacaran was only theoretical.[Yirka, Bob. “Oldest Known Sponge Found in China.” Phys.org, Phys.org, 10 Mar. 2015, https://phys.org/news/2015-03-oldest-sponge-china.html.] The specimen found also somewhat disproves a theory about early sponges because it was believed that the sponge crown-group would have choanocytes (a specific type of cell on the inner wall of sponges), but there is no significant evidence to show that the specimen had any. However, more specimens would have to be found and examined before any definitive conclusions can be made. Doushantuo Formation This is the location where the specimen was discovered. This formation consists of the shallow waters of the Edacarain and the rocks are made up of six layers of phosphorite and dolomite. The fossil was found in phosphorite rock near the lower layer of the rock formation. The specimen was fossilized through lithification.

Flaviviridae is one of the most well characterized viral families, as it contains many well-known viruses that cause diseases that have become very prevalent in the world, like Chikungunya virus and Dengue virus. The genus Flavivirus is one of the largest viral genera and encompasses over 50 viral species, including tick and mosquito borne viruses like Yellow fever virus and West Nile virus. Sepik virus is much less well known and has not been as well-classified as other viruses because it has not been known of for very long. Sepik virus was first isolated in 1966 from the mosquito Mansonia septempunctata, and it derives its name from the Sepik River area in Papua New Guinea, where it was first found. The geographic range of Sepik virus is limited to Papua New Guinea, due to its isolation. Map of Papua New Guinea, the only place Sepik virus has been found Arboviruses are a continuing threat to public health in Papua New Guinea especially because of lack of surveillance and reporting, so much of the prevalence of disease due to these viruses are unknown in that area. Arboviruses cause outbreaks when the virus that infects an endemic population spreads through a vector like mosquitoes or ticks to humans. While the principal host species for Sepik virus is still unknown, it has been discovered that the primary mosquito species that transmits Sepik virus is Mansonia septempunctata. This differs from other related viruses, as most of the well-classified mosquito borne viruses public health officials focus on are transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti.  Viral classification and evolution  Sepik virus is in the genus Flavivirus, which means it is similar to yellow fever virus, as Yellow Fever Virus is the type virus for the family.. It is also an arbovirus, so the virus is transmitted by an arthropod vector. The genus Flavivirus can further be broken down into clades based on whether the vector that transmits the virus to humans, and what the vector is. If the vector is known, it forms a clade, which is further broken down into type of vector. In the known vector clade, there is a mosquito group and a tick group, which diverged early in the phylogeny and do not have much overlap, ecologically. The mosquito group is further divided into the types of diseases the virus causes, like neurotropic viruses and hemorrhagic disease viruses. Neurotropic viruses like Japanese encephalitis virus cause encephalitic disease and is commonly spread by Culex mosquito species and has a reservoir in birds, while hemorrhagic disease viruses like Yellow Fever are commonly spread by Aedes mosquito species and have primate hosts. Sepik virus is classified as a hemorrhagic disease virus because it is in the Yellow fever group, as it is most closely related to Yellow Fever virus. However, Sepik virus does not have the same pathogenicity or virulence as Yellow Fever virus, as it is not known to cause hemorrhagic fever, but rather a febrile illness.  Viral structure  Similar to other viruses in the genus Flavivirus, Sepik virus is a circular, enveloped virus that displays icosahedral symmetry in the nucleocapsid.. The virion is relatively small, only about 50 nm in diameter. The virus particle contains three major structural proteins; there are two membrane-associated proteins, the envelope protein (E) and membrane protein (M). The virus also has a capsid protein (C) that protects the genome from the environment, which could cause the genome to dry out or become degraded. The capsid is mainly protein, but 17% of the capsid are lipids by weight, which were derived from the host cell membrane; the capsid is also about 9% carbohydrate by weight in the form of glycolipids and glycoproteins.  Viral genome  The genome for Sepik virus is a non-segmented, single stranded, positive sense RNA molecule that is about 10.79 kilobases in length. The genome consists of a short non-coding region at the 5’ end, a single long open reading frame (ORF) that contains the genes for all the genes the virus produces, and a non-coding region at the 3’ end and the genome does not have a poly-A tail typically seen at the end of mRNA molecules. The non-coding regions are useful in determining phylogenetic relationships between viruses within the Flavivirus genus, as well as within groups, like the Yellow Fever virus group. The non-coding regions also contain motifs that are important in viral translation, replication and packaging. The genome serves as both genomic data and as mRNA, encoding 3 structural proteins necessary for the virion and 8 non-structural proteins necessary for replication. The genome also contains a type I cap and a conserved stem loop at the 5’ end, labeled as m7GpppAmp, that is not seen in viruses in other families or genera. The cap serves as an initiation site for transcription, as well as stability to the mRNA.  Replication cycle   Entry  Entry of Sepik virus into the cell is mediated by the envelope protein (E), which is the viral entry protein. The envelope protein binds to the host cell receptor which then signals to the cell to bring the virus inside using endocytosis. The envelope protein then helps the viral envelope fuse to the host cell membrane in order to release the viral capsid into the cell.  Replication and transcription  Once the genome is in the cell, replication occurs along the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Replication usually occurs in membrane invaginations to shield the replicating genome from host defenses like RNA interference, because single stranded positive RNA viruses replicate through a double stranded RNA intermediate.. The genome also functions as mRNA and the virus uses the host cell’s machinery to translate one long polyprotein containing both the structural and non-structural proteins. This one long polyprotein is later cleaved into the capsid, envelope and membrane protein, and also proteins that are not assembled into the virion, which are denoted as non-structural proteins. The non-structural proteins function in viral replication and assembly. These proteins are named NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5, and NS2K, where NS denotes “non-structural”. NS3 has enzymatic activity as a helicase and protease, while NS5 is an RNA dependent RNA polymerase, allowing the virus to replicate a new (+)RNA genome by creating a complementary (-)RNA strand and using that as a template for the genome. The other non-structural proteins function in RNA replication, viral assembly and release, processing the viral polyprotein and inhibiting the host’s innate immunity, like inhibiting interferon signaling.  Assembly and release  There is no known structured nucleocapsid for any viruses in the genus Flavivirus, as no viruses belonging to the genus have been seen using cryo- electron microscopy. Therefore, assembly of the virion likely consists of the capsid protein (C) and the genomic RNA becoming aggregated and condensed, with the capsid protein acting as a charge neutralizer for the RNA, to eventually form a small particle that does not have any contact with the envelope. Virions are released by budding of the capsid protein and the RNA into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to form a lipid envelope that are sporadically ingrained with glycoproteins, like the envelope (E) glycoprotein that is used for entry into the next host cell. The virions are later secreted out of the host cell to infect new, susceptible cells.  Transmission  This diagram shows how Sepik virus gets from the natural host of the virus to humans to make them sick. Sepik virus, like all other arboviruses, is transmitted from a host reservoir to humans through a viral vector. Some arboviruses can be maintained in a population with minimal input from the reservoir, meaning the vector can use infected humans as a source of the virus to spread to new, susceptible people.. However, Sepik virus cannot be maintained in the population and therefore cannot be passed via mosquito vector between humans. This means that the host reservoir is the only known source of Sepik virus, but the host reservoir is unknown at this time.  Associated diseases  Sepik virus causes a fever in humans, much like other viruses in the genus Flavivirus like dengue virus and Yellow fever virus. However, Sepik virus is only known to cause a non-severe febrile fever and not hemorrhagic fever like the more well classified viruses. Fever as a result of Sepik virus infection has only been seen in Papua New Guinea and has remained isolated from the rest of the world. However, reporting and surveillance for this fever is lacking, so spread of the vector and Sepik virus fever may have begun to spread outside its normal range, and no notice has been taken. Arboviruses, mainly highly pathogenic ones like Yellow Fever virus or Dengue virus, are important emerging pathogens in many tropical and developing countries because of the high prevalence of the viral vector and many countries have poor sanitation and do not have vector control methods. It is important to note that the known geographic regions many arboviruses are currently found are not concrete, as changing global temperatures contribute to the widening of vector habitat, as many arboviruses that have been limited to tropical zones are now seen further into the temperate zones as the vector, mainly mosquitoes, moves into new areas and can infect naïve populations.

She received a Jurors Choice award as a participant in the Greater Columbus Arts Council and Capital Crossroads Special Improvement District CAP-UP Artist Grant in 2012. Relatives in the arts Sunami's father-in-law John Sunami has several public art installations in the Columbus area, and was an early pioneer of digital art. His father, Soichi Sunami, was a noted Pictorialist photographer best known for his extended artistic collaboration with modern dance icon Martha Graham. Sunami, John and Soichi were all featured in a 2018 family exhibition at the Cultural Arts Center, that also included art from sister-in- law Jennifer Sunami, son River Sunami, and music composed by husband, Christopher Sunami. Sunami's maternal cousin Yusef Afoxè was also a professional artist. Psycheñwelic art Sunami is best known for having popularized what she calls \\"psycheñwelic\\" art (from the Greek root psyche, meaning mind or soul, as combined with the Swahili word nywele meaning hair), a locally-influential art movement centered in Columbus, Ohio. The style is a synthesis of abstraction and realism, where a more realist face, typically of an African or an African-American woman, is combined with a more abstract depiction of hair or clothing as a way of adding a psychological dimension to the portrait. Sunami has been working almost exclusively in this style since 2006, and in more recent years, has enhanced the abstract portions of her work with mixed-media collages that tie her work back to the earlier Columbus- centered, female African-American mixed-media art movement sparked by Robinson. A large number of other local artists have also produced occasional work in this same style. Collaborations Sunami has contributed to collaborative works by Creative Arts of Women and Mother Artists at Work, and did individual collaborations with visual artists Stephanie Rond, Queen Brooks and Lisa McLymont; and poets Naki Akrobettoe, Caroline Bennett, Dionne Custer Edwards, Barbara Fant and Katerina Harris, among others.

Eventually, this organic matter weathers into some semblance of a soil, and can reach depths of 30 cm in some temperate rainforests. Epiphytes can take root in this thin soil, which accelerates the development of the soil by adding organic material and physically breaking up material with their root system. Common epiphytes in the canopy soils in temperate rainforests include mosses, ferns, and lichens. Epiphytes on trees in the temperate zone are often ubiquitous and can cover entire trees. Some host trees house up to 6.5 tons dry weight of epiphytic biomass, which can equate to more than 4x of its own foliar mass. This massive presence means their dynamics need to be better understood in order to fully understand forest dynamics. The nutrients that become stored within canopy soils can then be utilized by the epiphytes that grow in them, and even the tree that the canopy soil is accumulating in through the growth of canopy roots. This storage allows nutrients to be more closely cycled through an ecosystem, and prevents nutrients from being washed out of the system. Development There are numerous factors involved when evaluating the characteristics of a developing canopy soil. The types of plant material that accumulates on canopy soils can strongly influence the conditions that develop, including pH, moisture content, nutrient content, and nutrient availability for the soil . Additionally, the amount of time is an important factor when considering the development of canopy soils. Older canopies can accumulate more material and create a deeper soil. Within the soil, the organic material will further decompose in an older canopy soil and will have less fibrous material than a younger canopy soil. Perhaps more intuitively, the height at which organic material begins to accumulate can also significantly impact the development of canopy soils. Canopy soils occurring higher in a forest's canopy will be more exposed to the elements, resulting in a higher exposure to sunlight and wind, which could result in extreme shifts in available soil moisture. Most epiphytes have very shallow root systems, which serve primarily as a means of attachment to its host tree. Consequently, the shallow root systems make moisture-dependent epiphytes more sensitive to these changes in moisture content, and at risk of desiccation. In contrast, canopy soils that form lower in the canopy are more likely to be sheltered from more extreme swings in light exposure and moisture content. Additionally, lower canopy soils also have a greater chance of accumulating organic matter that is falling from higher neighboring trees, or from the higher regions of the tree housing the canopy soil. This allows these lower canopy soils to accumulate more organic matter and nutrients, which allows them to be more productive, The organisms that inhabit a soil significantly influence the development and the turnover time of nutrients and the same is true for canopy soils. Macro-organisms such as mites and maggots can consume organic material and break it down via their digestive tracts, aiding in the mixing and formation of soil. Micro-organisms such as bacteria or fungi essentially serve the same purpose, but utilize different degradation pathways. The presence of these organisms is critical in maintaining the nutrient cycles within the soil, and make available the necessary nutrients for the growth of epiphytes and micro-ecosystem. The microorganism community found in canopy soils has been found to be distinct, but similar to the communities found in the soil of the forest floor. Generally, bacterial communities from fallen epiphytic material are quickly replaced by forest floor bacterial communities, although not completely. Additionally, when limbs of a host tree containing canopy soils have been severed from the host, a shift in the bacterial community within the soil can be measured. This indicates that the communities contained in the canopy have some reliance on the host tree. Classification Canopy soils are classified as histosols, which are composed primarily of organic material. Although they vary in depth, canopy soils commonly have a hemic layer at the very top, consisting mostly of undecomposed sphagnum moss. Their nature and history makes the soils somewhat simple, and nearly always lacking in any kind of mineral component. Distribution and Evolution Vascular epiphytes in total represent about 9% of all vascular plants in the world, but are much more common in tropical areas. This under-representation of vascular epiphyte diversity is still being disputed, but likely pertains to a few abiotic factors including cooler temperatures, moisture availability, and glacial history. The distributions of epiphytes when pertaining to the Northern and Southern hemispheres is extremely asymmetric. The temperate zones in the Southern hemisphere has a much greater abundance of vascular epiphytes than the Northern hemisphere and they persist further into more polar latitudes. This suggests that abiotic factors such as temperature are far less influential than the glacial history of the region. During the Last Glacial Maximum, about 27,000 years ago, much of the area that is now occupied by Temperate Rainforests in the Northern hemisphere was covered by extensive ice sheets that removed all life. In contrast, Temperate Rainforests in the Southern Hemisphere remained largely ice-free. This distinction gave a substantial advantage to ecosystems in the Southern hemisphere and allowed many more species of obligate, vascular epiphytes to evolve and occupy a particular niche. The intimate relationship that vascular epiphytes have with the formation of canopy soils means that the distributions of canopy soils follow a parallel distribution pattern, since is the pattern of growth and decay of epiphytic growth that promotes the formation of canopy soils. The presence of certain types of epiphytes could be considered ecosystem engineers, due to their ability to form new canopy soils within an upper story in forest. For example, Fascicularia bicolor is a species of epiphyte in South American temperate rainforests, and belong to a group known as trash basket epiphytes. These individuals form extensive mats that capture falling organic matter and accumulate it, promoting the formation of canopy soils. The presence of these mats regulate the temperature and humidity of the surrounding canopy, and alter the species diversity of epiphytic growth which should classify them as an ecosystem engineer  References  Category:Epiphytes Category:Forestry Category:Rainforests Category:Biology ","title":"Canopy soils"},{"id":"62506188","text":"Star Mega Mall is a shopping mall located in Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia.

Tectonic history developed from isotope dating suggests that the orogeny occurred as the combined North Australia Craton-West Australia Craton collided with the East Antarctic-South Australian Craton. The Kepa Kurl Booya Province, including its component zones, the Fraser Zone, Nornalup Zone and Biranup Zone represents the crystalline basement of the orogen. Numerous theories and hypotheses have been presented about the orogeny. For example, in 2011 geochronology dating of 1.71 to 1.65 billion year old granite and gabbro intrusions in the Biranup Zone suggested craton margin rocks rather than a previously interrupted small terrane wedged against the Yilgarn Craton. In other cases, researchers attempting to reconstruct the supercontinent Rodinia suggested a possible connection between Australia-Antarctica and the proto-North American continent Laurentia (the SWEAT and AUSWUS hypotheses), but in 2003 paleomagnetic data from the Albany-Fraser orogeny suggested that Australia and Laurentia were at different latitudes.

A lynchpin of her class, she was the wife, daughter, granddaughter, sister, daughter-in-law and mother-in-law of Semarang's Majoors der Chinezen. This was the highest rank of the Chinese officership, a branch of the civil bureaucracy through which the Dutch governed their Chinese subjects in the Indies. Tan was born in Semarang, Central Java into what was then the city's most powerful Chinese dynasty, the Tan family of Semarang. Her father, Tan Hong Yan, served as the second Majoor der Chinezen of Semarang from 1836 until 1851 in succession to her grandfather, Tan Tiang Tjhing (1770–1833). In 1811, the latter was appointed the first Majoor der Chinezen of Semarang and, in fact, the whole of the Dutch East Indies.

He joined the RAAF in 1989 and trained as a fighter pilot. He has deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, commanded No. 75 Squadron RAAF (2003–06) and No. 82 Wing RAAF (2010–11), and led Air Task Group 630 on operations against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (2014–15). He served as commander Air Combat Group RAAF from 2015 to 2017, Air Commander Australia from 2017 to 2019, and was appointed Head Force Design within the Vice Chief of Defence Force Group in June 2019. Early life Roberton grew up on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland, where he was an active surfer. He studied a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and Mathematics at the University of Queensland, graduating in 1988. He had originally intended to pursue graduate studies in medicine, but after joining the university glider club he gained a passion for flying and decided to embark on a career in aviation. RAAF career Roberton was accepted into the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a direct entry pilot trainee in 1989. He completed initial officer and flight training at RAAF Point Cook and RAAF Base Pearce, graduating from No. 153 Pilots Course in 1990. He specialised as a fighter pilot, training on the Macchi MB-326, before converting to the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet in 1993. A three-year fighter tour with No. 3 Squadron RAAF followed at RAAF Base Williamtown, before he was posted on exchange with the United States Marine Corps at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina from 1996. He returned to No. 3 Squadron, as commander of A Flight, in 1998. Roberton was posted to the Fighter Requirements division of the Capability Development Group for eighteen months from July 2000. He was then selected to attend the Australian Command and Staff College, where he graduated with a Master of Management in Defence Studies from the affiliated University of Canberra in 2002. Following the course, he was appointed Deputy Director Aircraft Survivability within the Capability Development Group and deployed in support of Operations Slipper and Falconer, Australia's contribution to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Roberton received a Chief of Air Force Commendation for his performance in the Middle East and, following his return to Australia, assumed command of No. 75 Squadron RAAF at RAAF Base Tindal from November 2003. Roberton led the RAAF's transition from the F-111C (left) to the F/A-18F (right) from 2006 to 2010. Towards the end of his three years of squadron command, Roberton thought he may have reached his ceiling in the RAAF and was again contemplating studies in medicine at the University of Queensland. He was instead head-hunted to lead the RAAF's A$6.5 billion transition from the General Dynamics F-111C to the Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet, serving as Head Air Combat Transition Office from November 2006. Roberton was posted to RAAF Base Amberley in command of No. 82 Wing RAAF in April 2010, having overseen the introduction of the Super Hornet into Australian service ahead of schedule and below budget. He was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2012 Australia Day Honours, the award recognising his \\"exceptional capability, capacity and devotion\\" to \\"effective Air Combat Group capability\\" in both his command appointments and during the introduction of the Super Hornet. Roberton next completed the Higher Command and Staff Course in the United Kingdom in early 2012, before returning to Australia in April as Director General Aerospace Development in the Capability Development Group. In September 2014, Roberton was selected as the inaugural commander of Air Task Group 630 on Operation Okra. The air task group deployed to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates as part of the coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. Consisting of 400 RAAF personnel and eight aircraft, it was the largest air task group to deploy from Australia since the Vietnam War. Under Roberton's command, Air Task Group 630 conducted airstrikes, flew in support of Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces, and assisted in freeing Yezidi people trapped in the Sinjar Mountains. Roberton handed over command of the air task group to Air Commodore Glen Braz on 5 January 2015, by which time the Australian aircraft were flying approximately 13 percent of coalition airstrikes in Iraq. In recognition of his \\"tireless devotion and exceptional personal skills\\" in the establishment, deployment and initial operations of Air Task Group 630, Roberton was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in the 2016 Australia Day Honours. Roberton was appointed commander Air Combat Group at RAAF Base Williamtown in January 2015, with responsibility for the administration of the RAAF's fast-jet combat aircraft and command of Australia's air combat operations. Following promotion to air vice marshal, he succeeded Air Vice Marshal Gavin Turnbull as Air Commander Australia—responsible for the operational capability of the RAAF—on 1 May 2017. Roberton became Head Force Design within the Vice Chief of Defence Force Group in June 2019. Personal life Roberton is married to Libby, with whom he has three children.

Sequence of events The Leake Springs Metamorphics are a group of siliclastic metasedimentary rocks covering the northern two-thirds of the Gascoyne Province and grading into low-grade metasedimentary rocks of the Wyloo Group in the north. During the Capricorn orogeny, these rocks were intruded by the tonalite, monzogranite, quartz diorite and syenogranite of the Moorarie Supersuite (including the Minnie Creek batholith). Throughout the orogeny, numerous phases of metamorphism took place, such as the reworking of older Archean granite and gneiss in the Paradise Zone and Mooloo Zone between 1.805 and 1.80 billion years ago. During a second phase, the Yarlarwheelor Gneiss Complex and Errabiddy Shear Zone saw reactivation of faults and the transformation of psammite schist to chlorite-sericite schist.

The Gilde was led by two judges called Deans (French: Doyens)Liste des doyens de la Gilde drapière de 1325 à 1688, published in the revue Les Lignages de Bruxelles, 1992, n° 129-130, pages 25 and following. who were assisted by eight assessors called The Eight (French: les Huit, Dutch: De Acht, ) or the Octovirs. During the Angevin regime, the Deans and The Eight were appointed intendants and aldermen of the chamber of commerce. Until the revolution of 1421 they were all chosen among the Seven Noble Houses of Brussels and after, one Dean and four of The Eight were chosen from among the Guilds. This Court sat three times a week on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. In the fifteenth century the Court named three valets to seal the sheets of the cloths whose quality it controlled, as well as two receivers, five controllers and a cloth sealer on of the ones on sale on the Grand Place at the Halle aux Pains. It also named the weigher of the wool and the measurer of the potash (intended to wash the wools).  Confusion  The Drapery Court, which was a kind of commercial court, should not be confused with the Drapers' Guild.Roger De Peuter, ‘’Brussel in de achttiende eeuw’’, Brussels, 1999, passim. While most of the judges who belonged to this tribunal had nothing to do with the trade of clothiers, they were, indeed, chosen among the Noble Houses, not able to exercise any profession or trade, and among the members of the Guilds belonging to various corporations.

It forms the watershed between the Bang Pakong River basin to its north and several short rivers draining into the Gulf of Thailand. The Chanthaburi Range forms a westward continuation of the Banthat Range (the section of the Cardamom Mountains forming the boundary between Thailand and Cambodia), and part of it is often considered the northwesternmost extension of the Cardamom Range itself. The main Chanthaburi Range forms part of the provincial boundaries between the in-land Chachoengsao and Sa Kaeo provinces to the north and the coastal Chon Buri and Chanthaburi provinces to the south. It is also considered to include three sub-ranges extending southward: the first in Chon Buri Province, including the peaks Khao Khiao and Khao Chomphu; the second forming part of the boundary between Chon Buri and Rayong provinces; and the third forming the boundary between Rayong and Chanthaburi provinces, including the peaks Khao Chamao and Khao Wong. The length of the Chanthaburi Range is reported at about or , depending on the areas included in the measurement.

These are the protoliths of the Pooranoo Metamorphics and span Errabiddy Shear Zone, Limejuice Zone and Mangaroon Zone. During the Mangaroon orogeny, huge volumes of granite belonging to the Durlacher Supersuite intruded rocks in the Mangaroon Zone as high-grade metamorphism and deformation occurred. The Pooranoo Metamorphics reached amphibolite-grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies becoming gneiss. Like the Capricorn orogeny, the Mangaroon orogeny is interpreted as an intracontinental deformation event due to distant collisions at the edges of the continent rather than an ocean-closing event.

Yüksel Şenler was born in Kayseri, May 29, 1938. She later adopted \\"Şule\\" as a first name. When she was young, she emigrated to Istanbul with her family. She left school when in 8th Grade, and started working for an Armenian tailor. This led her to create her own model of a modern headscarf in the future. She started to work as a journalist at the age of 21. In 1965, she began wearing the hijab. Lawsuits were brought against her due to her articles in Yeni İstiklal newspaper, in which she encouraged women to wear the hijab. She grew up during a time when Turkey pushed secularism, where women had to choose between hijab, or official schooling and professional careers . She traveled around Anatolia and started discussions at conferences, and many of her followers started wearing the headscarf . After some girls started to imitate her head covering style, this type of covering became known as le sulebaşı şu. One conference caught the attention of then-president Cevdet Sunay, who said “Those behind [the increasing number of] covered women on the streets, will be punished\\". Senler responded in a letter to Cevdet Sunay and was arrested, serving eight months in prison . Şenler wrote for Hür Söz, Yeni İstiklal, and Babıalide Sabah women's pages.

Preserved in the rocks of New Mexico and Arizona, it is interpreted as the collision of the 1700-1600 Mya age Mazatzal island arc terrane with the proto-North American continent. This was the second in a series of orogenies within a long-lived convergent boundary along southern Laurentia that ended with the ca. 1200–1000 Mya Grenville orogeny during the final assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia, which ended an 800-million-year episode of convergent boundary tectonism. Description Age and isotope data show that southern North America is composed of a series of northeast-trending provinces representing island arc terranes accreted onto the 1800 Mya core of Laurentia. These are the Yavapai province (1800–1700 Mya), the Mazatzal province (1700–1650 Mya), the Granite-Rhyolite province (1500–1300 Mya), and the Llano-Grenville province (1300–1000 Mya). Each is interpreted as juvenile crust of an island arc, together with smaller amounts of reworked older crust, that accreted to Laurentia in an orogenic pulse accompanied by pluton emplacement. The plutons sutured new and existing orogens together and helped convert the juvenile terranes to mature crust. The orogen pulses are identified as the Yavapai orogeny at 1710–1680 Mya, the Mazatzal orogeny at 1650–1600 Ga, the Picuris orogeny at 1450–1300 Mya, and the Grenville orogeny at 1.30–0.95 Mya. Some of the orogens were accompanied by slab rollback. This created short-lived extensional basins at 1700 and 1650 Mya that accumulated sand and high-silica volcanic debris to form Paleoproterozoic quartzite- rhyolite successions. Subsequent convergent tectonics closed the basis and thrust imbricated the successions. The northeast-trending provinces are truncated by Neoproterozoic passive margins that indicate the orogenic system once extended much further. This part of the basis for the AUSWUS reconstruction of Rodinia, which places Australia adjacent to the southwestern US from 1800 to 1000 Mya. Other supporting evidence includes correspondence of 1450 and 1000 Ga paleomagnetic poles between Australia and Laurentia. The northeastern extension of the orogenic belt would then correspond to the Gothian orogeny in Baltica and the southwestern extension to the Albany-Fraser orogeny. The close correspondence of detrital zircon ages and Hf isotope isotopes between the Mazazatl province and Australia supports this reconstruction. However, the placement of Australia has been disputed on the basis of paleomagnetic data. The SWEAT reconstruction places East Antarctica on the southwest extension of the Yavapai Province. The Mazatzal Province was originally described as the \\"Mazatzal Revolution\\" by Wilson in 1939, who had mapped the northern and southern Mazatzal Mountains. The term 'Mazatzal orogeny' was applied to describe the Mazatzal Revolution by Lee Silver in 1965. The province extends from Arizona to Colorado south of a somewhat poorly defined boundary with the Yavapai Province that runs roughly along the Jemez Lineament. From there it continues along the southern margin of the Canadian Shield northeastward to Newfoundland. The southern boundary runs from northern Sonora to Newfoundland roughly parallel to the northern boundary. Individual island arc terranes accreted to Laurentia during the Yavapai Orogeny include the Pinal and lower Manzano Group. The Labradorian orogeny is interpreted as a regional manifestation of the overall Mazatzal orogeny. Deformation from the Mazatzal Orogeny extended into a foreland zone of the Yavapai province. Plutons emplaced by the orobeny may extend as far north as the Cheyenne belt and as far northwest as the Mojave province. Relationship to Picuris Orogeny A number of quartzite-rhyolite successions previously associated with the Mazatal orogeny have been shown to contain both Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic formations, based on detrital zircon geochronology. The younger formations define the Picuris orogeny at 1450–1300 Mya. This has raised the question of whether the Mazatzal origeny was actually distinct from the Picuris orogeny. Silver estimated the timing of the Mazatzal orogeny as between 1715 Mya and 1650 Mya. The end of the event was based on the U-Pb age of a post-tectonic granite located near Young, Arizona and folded rocks of the Alder Group (now recognized as a pre-1700 Ma succession of rock.) In contrast, Livingston's work in the Upper Salt River Canyon utilized Rb-Sr dating techniques to estimated the timing of the Mazatzal orogeny between 1425-1380 +/-100 Mya. Further mapping in the 1970s and 1980s showed that the Mazatzal Group rested entirely an angular unconformity with sheeted dikes of the 1729 Mya Payson ophiolite and pre-1700 Mya Alder Group. Workers were unable to identify any ash layers directly within the Mazatzal Group needed to constrain the actual timing of folding and thrusting attributed to the Mazatzal orogeny. It was ultimately recognized that the granite near Young, Arizona, dated by Silver in 1965 was the best post-tectonic timing relationship between the pre-1700 Ma, deformed Alder Group and granite near Young. Redating of the granite in the late 1980s confirmed its age and the timing relationship between the folded Alder Group and granite. (The best age estimate is now 1664+/-17 Mya.) However, this assumed that the deformation of the pre-1700 Ma Alder Group also included the northwest-directed folding and thrusting in the Mazatzal Group. This discounted the significance of the obvious angular unconformity at the base of the Mazatzal Group. New mapping and utilization of detrital zircon geochronology during the 2010s were able to constrain the age of the youngest sediments above the Mazatzal Group involved in the classic deformation of the Mazatzal orogeny. Detrital zircons from the Hopi Springs Shale in the northern Mazatzal Mountains yielded a maximum depositional age (MDA) of 1571 Mya. Similar sediments collected from a shale folded in the core of the Four Peaks synform yielded a MDA of 1580 Mya. In the Upper Salt River Canyon, overlying the White Ledge Formation (a correlative to the Mazatzal Group), sediments from the conformably overlying Yankee Joe and Blackjack Formations yielded MDA of ca. 1470 Mya. The entire sediment sequence of Redmond (1657 Mya), White Ledge, Yankee Joe, and Blackjack Formations were deformed sometime after 1470 Mya. The event buried the section to 6-10 km deep before it was intruded by the 1450 Ma Ruin Granite. These timings are contemporaneous with the timing of deformation of the Picuris orogeny defined in north-central New Mexico.. However, there are indications of three distinct orogenic episodes at the Black Canyon of the Gunnison, with an exhumation surface separating Yavapai and Mazatzal events. The Sandia, Manzano, and Los Pinos Mountains of central New Mexico contain 1.65-1.66 Ga plutons which are interpreted as a magmatic arc system in which plutons were intruding their own volcanic edifices and were also intruding developing syn-contractional, arc- related sedimentary basins. These are distinct from 1453-1456 plutons emplaced syntectonically during the Picuris orogeny. The orogenies may be distinct but with the Picuris orogeny badly overprinting the earlier Mazatzal orogeny.

The Yavapai Province was named for the Yavapai Series in central Arizona. It extends from Arizona to Colorado south of the Cheyenne belt, then northeastward to the mid-continent region. The southern boundary is somewhat poorly defined, possibly because it corresponds to a shallow relic subduction zone, but runs roughly along the Jemez Lineament. Individual island arc terranes accreted to Laurentia during the Yavapai Orogeny include the Elves Chasm block in the Grand Canyon, Green Mountain, Dubois-Cochetopa, Irving Formation, Moppin-Gold Hill, and Ash Creek- Payson. The latter includes the Payson Ophiolite. Quartzite-rhyolite successions associated with extensional basins include the Vadito Group and Hondo Group in New Mexico and the Mazatzal Group in Arizona, deposited during the transition from the Yavapai to the Mazatzal orogens at 1700 Mya. The extensional basin in which the Mazatzal Group was deposited lasted about 30 Ma, from the Payson Ophiolite at 1730 Mya to the Mazatzal Peak Quartzite sometime after 1700 Mya. A number of regional orogenies fall within the time span of the Yavapai orogeny and are regarded as parts of the overall orogenic system. These include the Ivanpah orogeny (1710–1680 Mya) in the New York Mountains area; the Central Plains orogeny in the mid-continent; the Medicine Bow orogeny at 1708–1750 Mya that produced the Cheyenne belt, the Colorado province or Colorado orogeny at 1780–1700 Mya.

According to the former hypothesis, this was the second in a series of orogenies within a long-lived convergent boundary along southern Laurentia that ended with the ca. 1200–1000 Mya Grenville orogeny during the final assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia, which ended an 800-million-year episode of convergent boundary tectonism. Description Age and isotope data show that southern North America is composed of a series of northeast-trending provinces representing island arc terranes accreted onto the 1800 Mya core of Laurentia. These are the Yavapai province (1800–1700 Mya), the Mazatzal province (1700–1650 Mya), the Granite-Rhyolite province (1500–1300 Mya), and the Llano-Grenville province (1300–1000 Mya). Each is interpreted as juvenile crust of an island arc, together with smaller amounts of reworked older crust, that accreted to Laurentia in an orogenic pulse accompanied by pluton emplacement. The plutons sutured new and existing orogens together and helped convert the juvenile terranes to mature crust. The orogen pulses are identified as the Yavapai orogeny at 1710–1680 Mya, the Mazatzal orogeny at 1650–1600 Ga, the Picuris orogeny at 1450–1300 Mya, and the Grenville orogeny at 1.30–0.95 Mya. Some of the orogens were accompanied by slab rollback. This created short-lived extensional basins that accumulated sand and high-silica volcanic debris to form Proterozoic quartzite-rhyolite successions. Subsequent convergent tectonics closed the basis and thrust imbricated the successions. The northeast-trending provinces are truncated by Neoproterozoic passive margins that indicate the orogenic system once extended much further. This part of the basis for the AUSWUS reconstruction of Rodinia, which places Australia adjacent to the southwestern US from 1800 to 1000 Mya. Other supporting evidence includes correspondence of 1450 and 1000 Ga paleomagnetic poles between Australia and Laurentia. The northeastern extension of the orogenic belt would then correspond to the Gothian orogeny in Baltica and the southwestern extension to the Albany-Fraser orogeny. The close correspondence of detrital zircon ages and Hf isotope isotopes between the Mazazatl province and Australia supports this reconstruction. However, the placement of Australia has been disputed on the basis of paleomagnetic data. The SWEAT reconstruction places East Antarctica on the southwest extension of the Yavapai Province. Early evidence for a major tectonic event at around 1400 Mya was the presence of numerous batholiths of the age in the southwestern United States. These constitute over 20% of the entire exposed Precambrian surface in New Mexico and the Rocky Mountains. Much of the mid-continent from eastern New Mexico to the northeast is underlain by the 1450-1350 Granite-Rhyolite crustal province. However, this was long assumed to be an anorogenic event, possibly due to basaltic underplating. Direct evidence for uplift in the form of sedimentation was lacking until detrital zircon geochronology established that some formations of the Vadito and Hondo Groups, long assumed to be Statherian in age, were actually Calymmian. The Berthoud orogeny of Colorado, which emplaced the Berthoud Plutonic Suite, took place in the same time frame as the Picuris Orogeny. Relationship to Mazatzal Orogeny A number of quartzite- rhyolite successions previously associated with the Mazatal orogeny have been shown to contain both Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic formations, based on detrital zircon geochronology. The younger formations define the Picuris orogeny at 1450–1300 Mya. This has raised the question of whether the Mazatzal origeny was actually distinct from the Picuris orogeny. Silver estimated the timing of the Mazatzal orogeny as between 1715 Mya and 1650 Mya. The end of the event was based on the U-Pb age of a post-tectonic granite located near Young, Arizona and folded rocks of the Alder Group (now recognized as a pre-1700 Ma succession of rock.) In contrast, Livingston's work in the Upper Salt River Canyon utilized Rb-Sr dating techniques to estimated the timing of the Mazatzal orogeny between 1425-1380 +/-100 Mya. Further mapping in the 1970s and 1980s showed that the Mazatzal Group rested entirely an angular unconformity with sheeted dikes of the 1729 Mya Payson ophiolite and pre-1700 Mya Alder Group. Workers were unable to identify any ash layers directly within the Mazatzal Group needed to constrain the actual timing of folding and thrusting attributed to the Mazatzal orogeny. It was ultimately recognized that the granite near Young, Arizona, dated by Silver in 1965 was the best post-tectonic timing relationship between the pre-1700 Ma, deformed Alder Group and granite near Young. Redating of the granite in the late 1980s confirmed its age and the timing relationship between the folded Alder Group and granite. (The best age estimate is now 1664+/-17 Mya.) However, this assumed that the deformation of the pre-1700 Ma Alder Group also included the northwest-directed folding and thrusting in the Mazatzal Group. This discounted the significance of the obvious angular unconformity at the base of the Mazatzal Group. New mapping and utilization of detrital zircon geochronology during the 2010s were able to constrain the age of the youngest sediments above the Mazatzal Group involved in the classic deformation of the Mazatzal orogeny. Detrital zircons from the Hopi Springs Shale in the northern Mazatzal Mountains yielded a maximum depositional age (MDA) of 1571 Mya. Similar sediments collected from a shale folded in the core of the Four Peaks synform yielded a MDA of 1580 Mya. In the Upper Salt River Canyon, overlying the White Ledge Formation (a correlative to the Mazatzal Group), sediments from the conformably overlying Yankee Joe and Blackjack Formations yielded MDA of ca. 1470 Mya. The entire sediment sequence of Redmond (1657 Mya), White Ledge, Yankee Joe, and Blackjack Formations were deformed sometime after 1470 Mya. The event buried the section to 6-10 km deep before it was intruded by the 1450 Ma Ruin Granite. These timings are contemporaneous with the timing of deformation of the Picuris orogeny defined in north-central New Mexico.. However, there are indications of three distinct orogenic episodes at the Black Canyon of the Gunnison, with an exhumation surface separating Yavapai and Mazatzal events. There is evidence from southern New Mexico of a collision between 1675 and 1655 Ma followed by crustal melting. The Sandia, Manzano, and Los Pinos Mountains of central New Mexico contain 1.65-1.66 Ga plutons which are interpreted as a magmatic arc system in which plutons were intruding their own volcanic edifices and were also intruding developing syn-contractional, arc-related sedimentary basins. These are distinct from 1453-1456 plutons emplaced syntectonically during the Picuris orogeny.The orogenies may be distinct but with the Picuris orogeny badly overprinting the earlier Mazatzal orogeny.

He is a Senior Research Fellow at Center for Survey Research at the University of Massachusetts Boston. He is an early contributor to research on patient-reported outcomes after treatment for various conditions including benign prostate disease, benign uterine conditions and prostate cancer. He also led survey projects to understand the causes and consequences of variation in the way medical care is delivered. Fowler was the founding Director of the Center for Survey Research at the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1971, where he served as director for 14 years. He was President of the Foundation for Informed Medical Decision Making from 2002-2009. He is the author of more than 150 publications, including four textbooks. In 2013, he received the AAPOR Award for Exceptionally Distinguished Achievement.  Education  Fowler was born in Akron, Ohio on July 4, 1939. He was raised in Ohio and graduated with a BA in English from Wesleyan University in 1960. He received M.A. in Psychology in 1962 and his Ph.D. in Social Psychology, both from the University of Michigan in 1966. He later settled in Brookline, Massachusetts. While at Michigan, he spent four years at the Survey Research Center working with Charles Cannell on a series of studies of error in the National Health Interview Survey.  Career  In 1965, Fowler came to work with Morris Axelrod, who was creating a survey organization in Boston to carry out a survey of the Greater Boston Jewish community. In 1968, when that study was completed, the new survey organization moved to The Joint Center for Urban Studies of Harvard and MIT. In 1972, the research organization moved again and became the Center for Survey Research at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Fowler was appointed the first director of the new center. The center was funded entirely by grants and contracts to the Center staff and by collaborative projects with researchers from other New England universities. Fowler worked on a wide range of projects, including studies of community crime prevention, gambling law enforcement, race relations and housing. Most of his research was focused on survey methodology and health care. In 2002, he retired from the Center for Survey Research, though he continued to have a part-time relationship there, and became President of the Foundation for Informed Medical Decision Making, which he helped in founding in the late 1980s. While there, in addition to overseeing the Foundation's work in organizing clinical evidence as part of the creation of decision aids with its partner, Health Dialog, he also oversaw the creation of a program of research on how best to communicate health information to patients, how best to support patients making decisions, and how to integrate shared decision making and the use of decision aids into routine medical care. He served as Foundation President until 2009, continuing as a scientific advisor afterwards until 2017. Fowler was interviewed as part of the AAPOR Heritage Interview Series that aims to preserve knowledge about the founding of the public opinion research profession and the development of new ideas that have had a lasting effect on the work done in his field.  Research and work  Survey Research Methods The problem of survey error was at the center of Fowler’s research work starting with his graduate work at Michigan. He continued to focus on that throughout his career. One example is his work on interviewer-related error. A major study of the role of interviewer training and supervision in error reduction led to a 1989 book, with Tom Mangione, Standardized Survey Interviewing. Another major study with Charles Cannell explored the potential of coding the interaction between interviewers and respondents in pretest interviews as a way of evaluating survey questions. This technique was labeled behavior coding. That work was also a major contributor to his next book on the role of question design in survey error, Improving Survey Questions in 1995. The value of randomized experiments to evaluate alternative versions of questions was also the focus of several of Fowler’s studies. Among his most important contributions are two text books on survey methods. He is the author of Survey Research Methods, currently in its 5th edition since original publication in 1984 and a co- author, with Robert Groves, Mick Couper, James Lepkowski, Eleanor Singer and Roger Tourangeau of Survey Methodology. Health-related Studies Fowler's research has also focused on health studies. In graduate school at Michigan, he was a co-author on several reports about the sources of error in the Health Interview Survey. However, one of his most seminal health-related projects in the early 1970s involved working with John Wennberg. Wennberg had observed wide variations in the rates at which medical services were delivered in adjacent communities in Northern New England. Wennberg thought the differences were driven by differences in physician decision making, but critics thought all the differences had to be due to differences in the people living in the communities. Fowler and Wennberg did a survey study of residents of 6 communities that differed widely in the rates at which they received health care. The study showed that the patient characteristics could not account for the differences in care: the populations were all virtually the same with respect to health status, access to care and how well their medical needs were being met. Hence, the only conclusion was that health care providers were practicing medicine very differently from one community to another. Next came a series of studies applying survey methods to the measurement of the effect of medical treatments on patients. The most influential of these was a study of patients in Maine who were surgically treated for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), which causes problems with urination as men age. Fowler and his colleagues applied survey methods in new ways to assess the extent to which men benefitted from surgical treatment. While they found many patients had their symptoms improved, their most important finding was that men differed greatly in the extent to which the same level of symptoms bothered them and how they felt about the side effects of surgery. How they felt about their symptoms was a key factor in how much 'good' they got from surgery. This work lay the foundation for their work on the importance of informing and involving patients in treatment decisions so that they could play a meaningful role in deciding what was best for them as individuals. Among the most enduring and widely used products of the work on BPH was the development of the American Urological Association Symptom Index. Fowler also applied the measurement approaches used in the study of BPH to the treatment of other medical conditions including benign uterine conditions, AIDS and prostate cancer. Among these studies a particularly important result was the finding from a national survey of Medicare patients who had had surgery for prostate cancer with complications, which include urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction, were occurring at much higher rates than had previously been thought. Out of the work on patient preferences and treatment outcomes came a concern about how medical decisions are made. In his work with the Foundation for Informed Medical Decision Making, Fowler initiated three national surveys to take a look at how medical decisions were actually being made by representative samples of patients. The first such survey was conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan; the second was done in collaboration with researchers at Dartmouth Medical School; and the third by researchers at the Foundation for Informed Medical Decision Making. The surveys, taken together, showed the gaps in how well patients understood issues relevant to decisions about their treatments and how little they were involved in making many of those decisions. Other areas  In the late 1960s, the Urban Observatory Program undertook a survey project to collect comparable data about citizen’s views of their city services and functioning of the governments in ten major American cities. Fowler was the leader of the survey effort for that project and wrote a book describing the results. In the late 1970s, there was an experimental effort in the City of Hartford to see if changing the physical environment of an urban neighborhood could help reduce crime and fear. Fowler led the evaluation of that project. The results showed that physical design and community cohesion could reduce crime and fear.  Publications   Books  *Cannell, C.

PaleoArt by Tory Halsey. Temnoxa molluscula (Temnoxa molliuscula) is a small creature approximately 8 mm wide found in the Ediacaran period (558-555 Ma) in Russia. The Temnoxa has a resemblance to a vertically cut penny bun mushroom. Due to the lack of information regarding the fossils of this organism, researchers are unable to place Temnoxa molluscula into any known phylum. The genus was originally discovered by Russian paleontologist Andrey Yu. Ivantsov in 2004. Due to its body lacking metameric (linear series of body segments) appendages, it's highly hypothesized that this creature was closest related to mollusks. However, there are opposing theories regarding the accuracy of this categorization because its unsegmented body and U-shaped head is far too large to be considered a mollusk. It also lacks a single shield-like mantle, although a mantle-like structure appeared to slip away from a dorsal side of the body in the holotype. Temnoxa molluscula also appeared to lack a respiratory and sensory processes. This creature may have had a crawling foot. Its bilateral symmetry suggests motility in Temnoxa. Another reason scientists hypothesize mobility for this organism is because in 2017, researchers from around the world observed the way that water flowed around its shell. It was discovered that they were able to face the direction of the water current using their U-shaped heads, and are most likely the oldest known species to have this capability. They may have been able to attach themselves to substrate using their sticky foot. This organism is compact yet flexible, able to enclose a visceral mass. Nevertheless, no direct fossil evidence exists for internal organs (Ivanstov et. al 2012). Temnoxa shares certain features with other Ediacaran creatures, Kimberella and Parvancorina., who is citing Grazhdankin (2014) .

It was built in the 1870s for LeGrand Morse, a local teacher, clerk, lawyer and legislator. It has some elements of vernacular Greek Revival style. It is an east-facing one-story house with a U-shaped plan, with three gable-roofed segments. The front door is inside the U, under a shed-roofed porch. The house, surrounded by a picket fence, is in a residential area north of the town's commercial center.

Other laws enacted in 1884, 1890, 1897 and 1900 further clarified or expanded these regulations. A final act, dated 1905, introduced decreasing freedom- price caps and age limits, and ended the practice within the few following years. Slavery was explicitly criminalized by the 1908 penal code, section 269 of which prohibited the sale and acquisition of slaves (exempting those which were legal under the 1905 act). Acts from 1911–13 expanded the coverage of previous laws. Slavery finally legally ceased in 1915.

Bishop Conkling presented his proposal to fund and build a chapel complex with a meeting hall and parish house at IIT to bridge the gap between education and religion after World War II. He believed the location of the chapel would spur students to \\"search for virtue while becoming proficient in the search for things.\\" Design and Construction IIT's administrators selected influential modernist architect, Mies, to design the chapel. Before the chapel, Mies had already designed other IIT buildings which often had to be modified to accommodate university budget cuts. The original proposal in 1949 consisted of two buildings: a chapel and a parish house. Mies’ initial designs consisted of a chapel and a parish house. Interestingly, his perspective sketch has a \\"steel superstructure bracketed with opaque sidewalls.\\" After university administrators decreased funding, the design excluded the parish house design, although the steel frame was still in the plan. Once well into the construction phase, administrators still felt that the design would result in exorbitant costs. Mies reduced the chapel to a building with load-bearing bricks, instead of steel, that held steel beams to support a concrete roof. Recovered designs also reveal missing aspects such as companion pieces to the crucifix and white-oak pews.Schulze, Franz, and Edward Windhorst. Mies Van Der Rohe: a Critical Biography (version New and Revised). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 2012. https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/vand/detail.action?docID=1039042. Despite the financial setbacks, Mies completed the chapel in 1952 without elaborate, ornate religious decorations. Memorial Chapel Exterior Spaeth, David. Carr Memorial Chapel.

Intended Purpose and Current Use  Bishop Conkling allegedly wanted to increase the presence of the Episcopal Church on campus by creating a place where students could engage deeper in faith. Despite Conkling's apparent intention and church sponsorship, the final design did not include a parish house for the chaplain. Instead, Mies designed a modest yellow-brick prism whose only decorative features are the white, silk curtain behind the steel cross and the unadorned Roman travertine altar below it. Mies’ simple plan for the small chapel was apparently intended to be conducive to inward contemplation. Interestingly, the university's desire to make a nondenominational structure may have caused the funding cuts. In fact, the administration later ensured that the building was open to students of all faiths. People currently use the chapel for both secular and nonsecular events such as Sunday services and weddings.  Architecture  Carr Chapel in 2015 Lifshitz, Howard. Photograph. Flickr.

Robert F. Carr Memorial Chapel is a simple, unadorned rectangular box-like structure with a horizontally level roof sitting on a steel frame and a concrete layer. Below the black steel cornice, there are several layers of uniform, load-bearing yellow bricks. The front and back of the chapel contain plate glass set in thin, black steel frames. The interior only has two sources of lighting: natural from the front entrance and artificial from the ceilings of the side walls. The dark terrazzo flooring and lack of quintessential religious decorations direct the focus to the thin stainless steel crucifix against Shantung silk curtains. An altar and its platform of solid Roman travertine sit below the cross.  Renovations  During the 1990s, parts of the top and corners of the walls became damaged without repair for many years. Mies van der Rohe Society raised more than $1 million to restore the chapel by the end of the summer in 2013.Kamin, Blair. “Mies Chapel at IIT Gets Winning Renovation.” Chicago Tribune, October 4, 2014. https://www.chicagotribune.com/columns/ct-mies-godbox-iit-kamin- met-20141003-column.html. Dean of Architecture, Donna Robertson, assisted in the restoration project, which began in 2008. Restoration was set for “roof replacement, repairs and replacement of exterior glass and steel, reconstruction of exterior brick corners, refinishing of terrazzo floor, cleaning and repairs to interior brick, upgraded mechanical and electrical components, refinishing of wood doors and benches, cleaning of concrete ceiling panels, lighting replacement, renovation to create ADA-compliant restroom and passageway, and accommodations for air conditioning.” The roof and the rest of the exterior were replaced in the summer of 2009. The restoration project devoted special attention to replacing the drapes behind the cross to ensure that the material and color of the drapes suit the textures and shades of the rest of the chapel while also maintaining Mies’ “clean” style. Gene Summers, Mies' assistant, was consulted to create the new curtains now composed of fire-retardant fibers and pongee silk. The curtain was woven in Italy, and the pleating was done by Cornel Erdbeer, the president of Ludwig Interiors. Chicago's Harboe Architects led the restoration and strove to maintain the “form and function” of the chapel, according to Chicago Tribune. The company restored the roof, bricks, mortar joints, steel frames, flooring, doors, and benches and removed graffiti, shrubs, and water stains. Harboe replaced the drainage system with a concealed rooftop edge for rainwater flow. Further, the bricks to replace the cracked exterior wall came from an auxiliary wall of Bailey Hall, an IIT dorm constructed three years after the chapel.

Boreal woodland caribou are also known as southern mountain caribou, woodland caribou, and forest-dwelling caribou. Mountain caribou are uniquely adapted to live in old-growth forests. The mountain caribou diet consists of tree-dwelling lichens predominantly. They are unique in this aspect as in the far northern regions of their habitat zones, the snowpack is shallow enough that the boreal woodland caribou can paw through the snow to eat the ground-dwelling lichens. In the inland Pacific Northwest Rainforests of eastern British Columbia, where the snowpack can reach upwards of five meters, the mountain caribou rely predominantly on the tree-dwelling lichens such as Wila (lichen) (Bryoria spp.) and witch’s hair (Alectoria (fungus) (Alectoria spp.), hanging above the snowpack.DellaSala, Dominick A.

The land use designations were brought together by a synthesis of groups with significant interests in these inland temperate rainforests. The negotiations between public, industrial, and governmental stakeholders forced trade-offs between these various interest groups. There were many interests, with protection of endangered species and forest conservation only constituting two of many.

Despite the focus on protections and conservation of the mountain caribou, herd numbers since the CORE was established have continued to diminish from approximately 2,450 spread across 17 separate isolated subpopulations to 1,900 animals in 15 subpopulations between 1997 and 2002 (Mountain Caribou Technical Advisory Committee, 2002) as a result of the continued logging of old growth in the Kuskanax, Duncan, Lardeau, and Adams River watersheds. In 2011, following litigation and petitions from multiple environmental conservation organizations, which included the Center for Biological Diversity, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service recommended 375,000 acres for critical habitat protection of the mountain caribou. After opposition from outdoor recreational outfits, mostly snowmobilers who ride on the public lands which would have been set aside for mountain caribou, the US Fish and Wildlife Service scaled back the proposed protected area to 30,000 acres Robbins, Jim. “America's Gray Ghosts: The Disappearing Caribou.” The New York Times, 3 Oct. 2016, https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/science/endangered-caribou-idaho-british- columbia.html?_r=2..

Environmental threats Erratic weather patterns, an effect of climate change, are having an adverse effect on the mountain caribou DellaSala, Dominick A. Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press, 2011. . The trend towards more unpredictable and extreme weather patterns and climactic conditions are forcing caribou periodically to leave their safe winter stronghold of the mountains for more marginal lower elevation habitats. The reason being is the constant changes in snowpack – significant snowfall one year to minimal snow the next. The lack of consistency is forcing the caribou to adapt and change their eating patterns to newer growth forests, which lack the lichens that the older growth forests provide for sustenance Kinley, Trevor A., et al. “The Influence of Variable Snowpacks on Habitat Use by Mountain Caribou.” Rangifer, vol. 27, no. 4, Jan. 2007, p. 93., doi:10.7557/2.27.4.323. .

They are generated by rational design through an approach called RNA architectonics, which make use of RNA structural modules identified in natural (or sometimes artificial) RNA molecules to form pre-defined 3D structures spontaneously. The abilities of RNA which is capable of catalysis and non-canonical base pairing make it an attractive biomolecule for design. By applying the knowledge of computational modeling and biochemical characterization, RNA can be shaped into defined geometries and conduct various functions. As such, tectoRNA can also carry functions to build large functional nanostructures which can be used for synthetic biology and nanotechnology application.  Overview  The RNA tectonics methodology. Nadrian Seeman was the first one who proposed that DNA could be used as material for generating nanoscopic self-assembling structures. This concept was extended to RNA by Jaeger and collaborators in 2000 by taking advantage of the concept of RNA tectonics initially proposed by Jaeger and Westhof and collaborators in 1996. To design a tectoRNA, the deep knowledge of RNA tertiary structure is required. The rational design of tectoRNA is based on known X-ray and NMR structures. TectoRNAs can be seen as analogous to words, and, by using the natural syntax of RNA structural motifs, all kinds of thermodynamically stable shapes can be rationally designed and synthesized. The sequence specifying for stable, recurrent, and modular structural motifs, e.g. GNRA tetraloop, kissing loops, kink turns, A-minor interaction, etc, can be encoded within tectoRNAs to control their geometry and self-assembly into nanostructures. However, tectoRNA can also incorporate flexible junctions and RNA modules (or RNA aptamers) responsive to ligands. Nowadays, extensive databases and powerful algorithms can be useful tools to design sequences of tectoRNAs. The folding of tectoRNAs are optimized by minimizing the free energy and maximizing their thermodynamic stability. The RNA sequences are mainly transcribed in vitro, and the folding condition for RNA is also important. Mg2+ and other salts must be added into solution and the concentration is well controlled to fold RNA properly. Their expected folding and self-assembly properties are characterized by a wide range of biochemical tools. Native poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) is used to test the Kd of self-assembled tectoRNAs. Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) is applied to characterize the thermodynamic stability of nanostructures. Chemical probing, like DMS probing, allows us to indirectly understand the folding of RNA structure. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and cryo-EM are powerful techniques which give us a direct clue how RNA nanostructures look like. By far, delicate structures like squares or hearts have been successfully demonstrated in different research.  RNA architectonics or RNA modular origami  TectoRNAs are the basic self-assembling unit in RNA architectonics. In RNA architectonics, the sequence length of tectoRNA is usually less than 200 nts. TectoRNAs are typically originating from single stranded RNA molecules and once folded, they act like LEGO bricks to build up higher order architectures. They can be synthesized, folded and self-assembled into multimeric nanostructures during transcription in isothermal conditions. As such, the RNA architectonics approach can be seen as RNA modular origami. This approach was extended to the synthesis of larger self-assembling units of more than 400 nts. More recently, RNA origami was extended to the design of long single stranded RNA sequences able to fold into large pre-defined nanostructures. Hence, RNA modular origami (originally called RNA architectonics), RNA origami and RNA single stranded origami are both originating from the same concept where RNA sequences can be design to self-fold and assemble into predefined shapes. Note that conceptually, DNA single stranded origami is more related to RNA origami than DNA origami.  Applications  Though RNA nanotechnology is still a burgeoning field, tectoRNAs and resulting nanostructures have already been shown to be useful in nanomedicine, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology. This includes the development of programmable nano-scaffolds and nano-particles for the delivery of RNA therapeutics. As such, RNA nanoparticles, like hexagonal nanorings, can be used as a delivery vehicle carrying therapeutic RNA to targeting cells. It is also possible to incorporate modified nucleotides within tectoRNAs in order to increase their chemical stability and resistant towards degradation. Yet, the full potential of tectoRNAs and resulting nanostructures for recruiting proteins and ligands still remain largely unexplored.

The purge was supported by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and was led by Teng Haiqing, a lieutenant general (zhong jiang) of the People's Liberation Army. It took place from 1967-1969 during which over a million people were categorized as members of the already-dissolved Inner Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (PRP), while lynching and direct massacre resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands, most of whom were Mongols. According to the official complaint from the Supreme People's Procuratorate in 1980 after the Cultural Revolution, during the purge, 346,000 people were arrested, 16,222 people were persecuted to death or killed directly, and over 81,000 were permanently injured and disabled. Other estimates have put a death toll between 20,000 and 100,000, while hundreds of thousands were arrested and persecuted, and over a million people were affected. After the Cultural Revolution, the purge was regarded as a \\"mistake\\" and its victims were rehabilitated by the Communist Party of China (CPC) during the \\"Boluan Fanzheng\\" period, but the commander of the purge, Teng Haiqing, received no trial or legal punishment at all because the Central Committee of CPC thought he had made achievements during the wars in the past., May 1987 On the other hand, some of Teng's affiliates received various terms of imprisonment, with a main Mongol affiliate sentenced to 15 years in prison.  Historical background  Ulanhu, the founding Chairman of China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, was persecuted. On May 16, 1966, the Cultural Revolution was officially launched. From June 7 to July 20, Ulanhu, then the Chairman of China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, was widely criticized as an \\"anti-Party activist\\" and persecuted. He was also criticized by central leaders like Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, whom themselves were soon persecuted in the Revolution. On August 16, Ulanhu was dismissed from his positions and was house-arrested in Beijing. In May, 1967, Teng Haiqing became the leader of the Inner Mongolia Military Region. On July 27, 1967, the northern branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China announced that Ulanhu had conducted five crimes, including anti-Maoism, anti- socialism, separatism, and so on. Supported by Lin Biao, Jiang Qing and Kang Sheng, Teng launched a massive purge which intended to \\"dig out\\" the \\"poison of Ulanhu\\" in Inner Mongolia. During the movement, the already-dissolved Inner Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (PRP) was claimed to have re- established itself and grown into power since 1960. Ulanhu was accused of being the leader of such party. At least hundreds of thousands of people were categorized as the members of the PRP, whom were regarded as separatists and were persecuted. During the purge, the Mongolian language was banned from publications and Mongols were accused of being “the sons and heirs of Genghis Khan”.  Lynching and massacre   Methods of torturing and killing  Lieutenant general Teng Haiqing was the commander of the Inner Mongolia purge. The methods used in lynching and killing during the purge included branding with hot irons, feeding furnace wastes, removing livers, hanging, cutting tongues and noses, piercing nails, piercing vaginas, pouring hot saline water into wounds, and more.  Death toll  According to the official complaint from the Supreme People's Procuratorate in 1980 after the Cultural Revolution, during the purge, 346,000 people were arrested (75 percent were Mongols), over 16,000 were persecuted to death, and over 81,000 were permanently injured and disabled. Other estimates include: * According to scholar Ba He (): close to 100 thousand people were killed, 700-800 thousand were arrested and persecuted, and over a million were affected. *According to historian Song Yongyi () of the California State University, Los Angeles: an unofficial source points out that the death toll was at least 40,000; 140,000 reached the point of permanent deformity, and nearly 700,000 were persecuted. * According to historian Lhamjab A. Borjigin (), who were arrested and prosecuted by the Chinese government in 2019 for conducting relevant researches: at least 27,900 were killed and 346,000 were imprisoned and tortured.  Notable figures killed  * Ji Yatai, 1st Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to Mongolia (1950–1953) and Vice-chairman of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. *Ha Fenge, Vice-chairman of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. * Darijaya, Vice-chairman of the Government of Inner Mongolia.  Rehabilitation  After the Cultural Revolution, China's new paramount leader Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1978 and directed, together with Hu Yaobang and others, a large-scale rehabilitation of mistaken cases and false cases made during the Revolution. The Inner Mongolia incident was regarded as a \\"mistake\\" and its victims were rehabilitated by the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1979 during the \\"Boluan Fanzheng\\" period, blaming the entire purge on “the Gang of Four and the Lin Biao Clique”. Trials for the Gang of Four started in 1980. In the 1980s, there were calls for trial of Teng Haiqing, the commander of the purge, but the Central Committee of CPC thought Teng had made achievements during the wars in the past and he would not have to take responsibility for the purge. On the other hand, some of Teng's affiliates received various terms of imprisonment, with a main Mongol affiliate, Wu'er Bagan (), sentenced to 15 years in prison.

Owned by Richard Eaton's United Broadcasting, the station was known for its programming for the African American community in the Washington metropolitan area; prior to that, in the 1940s, it was an independent station owned for several years by the Washington Post. WOOK, which spawned an FM station (WFAN) and a TV station (WOOK-TV channel 14, later WFAN-TV), had its license revoked by the Federal Communications Commission in 1975 for an illegal numbers racket. In 1976, with the station's fate nearly sealed, WOOK became Spanish- language WFAN, in a format swap that allowed the Black-formatted WOOK intellectual unit to stay alive. WFAN ceased operating on April 22, 1978; on August 15, WYCB began broadcasting on its frequency. History WINX William P. Gottlieb at the WINX microphone in 1940 WINX went on the air in 1940 at 1310 kHz as Washington's fifth radio station. The Federal Communications Commission had previously approved the granting of a construction permit to attorney Lawrence J. Heller on February 13, including a 50-watt synchronous amplifier to give the station full metropolitan coverage. The amplifier was located at American University. The station relocated the next year to 1340 when NARBA came into effect. In 1942, Heller sold minority stakes in WINX to Richard K. Lyon and Herbert M. Bratter. The Washington Post acquired WINX in 1944 for $500,000; it was the highest price ever paid for a \\"local\\" radio station like WINX that broadcast with 250 watts. The Post also got into the early days of FM radio when it acquired station W3XO, later WINX- FM, from Jansky and Bailey in 1945. The Post owned the station until 1948, when it contracted to buy a majority share in WTOP (1500 AM) from CBS; the deal would require the newspaper to sell WINX and its two boosters but allowed CBS to gain full ownership of an outlet in San Francisco. William Banks, owner of Philadelphia station WHAT, bought WINX AM for $130,000 in 1949; the Post retained WINX-FM. From WINX to WOOK In 1951, Richard Eaton, whose United Broadcasting Company owned radio station WOOK (1590 kHz) in Silver Spring, Maryland, and newly signed on Washington FM outlet WFAN (100.3 FM), bought WINX from the Banks Independent Broadcasting Company for $115,000. WOOK, established in 1947, was Eaton's first radio station; Eaton had previously been a commentator with WINX and then with the Mutual Broadcasting System. In order to retain both stations and meet multiple ownership rules, the Silver Spring station license was relocated to Rockville, Maryland—which under pre-1950 Census Bureau guidelines was not part of the Washington metropolitan area—on 1600 kHz. Additionally, Eaton switched the two stations' call letters, resulting in WOOK as the new 1340 in Washington, D.C., and WINX as the station at 1600 in Rockville. The local of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers asked the FCC to reconsider approving the WINX-WOOK swap because the former WINX's union technicians had been replaced by United's non-union staff. WOOK, both on 1590 prior to 1951 and on 1340 thereafter, broke ground in Washington radio. While Eaton had originally intended to make WOOK a talk outlet, the African-American printer of Eaton's suburban newspapers suggested that he cover Washington's growing Black population. It was just the second such station aimed at a Black audience, after WDIA in Memphis, Tennessee, which then had an all-white air staff. Hal Jackson, who had started his career at WINX with a show titled \\"The Bronze Review\\" and was laughed at when he proposed to the Post that it cover Homestead Grays Negro League baseball, launched the first regular African American-hosted program in Washington over WOOK (when it was at 1590). In 1956, WOOK relocated its transmitter to several lots purchased by Eaton in the Chillum Castle Manor subdivision, at 1st Place, NE. Television The success of WOOK as the radio station for black Washington led Eaton to expand into television. In 1962, WOOK moved into a new, purpose-built radio and television studio at 5321 1st Place NE, and WOOK- TV channel 14 took to the air on March 5, 1963. Channel 14 was, like WOOK radio, primarily oriented at an African American audience; it became WFAN-TV in 1968. The station ceased broadcasting on February 12, 1972, as United faced mounting legal challenges to its various licenses and consequent financial reverses. United asked the FCC to keep the WFAN-TV license active while it tried to sell it, but because United itself had no intention of restoring service, the stations' licenses were deleted in 1974 after United was ordered to return them to air itself. License challenge Early in 1966, the FCC renewed WOOK's license but assessed a $7,500 fine for various technical violations. However, United's troubles deepened when, on August 31, a competing application was filed for the 1340 frequency by Washington Community Broadcasting. In 1969, the Federal Communications Commission designated Washington Community's challenges alongside WOOK's and WFAN-TV's license renewals for hearing. For WOOK radio, the FCC's questions revolved around the broadcast of false advertisements; the group also charged that WOOK was used in a numbers racket using fake Bible citations read over the air by ministers who bought air time on the station. In one program, broadcast over WOOK on June 8, 1969, a preacher was cited as saying, \\"I know the Lord blessed through the 82nd Psalm and the 7th verse\\", when 782 had been the winning number in the local undercover lottery on May 26. That same minister had previously promised to send listeners a \\"Bible scripture that is a sure blessing\\" in exchange for $2. Hearings for WOOK stretched until September 1975, when the FCC denied its license renewal but did not resolve the status of the Washington Community Broadcasting application, so that the group could cure financial deficiencies in its application. Eaton defended WOOK, saying the FCC's principal witness was a disgruntled former employee and a convicted felon. It would not be until August 24, 1976, that Washington Community Broadcasting Company's ten-year-old competing application for the 1340 frequency was granted. Change to WFAN and closure When it became clear that 1340's license was doomed, Eaton opted to sacrifice the Spanish-language programming that had been airing at 100.3 FM to move WOOK's intellectual unit there. On December 24, 1976, WOOK became WFAN and the FM station became WOOK. Attorneys for Washington Community Broadcasting, the group set to take over the 1340 frequency, called the switch a \\"flimflam\\" and rued it was out of their control. However, as April 22, 1978—the final day of broadcasting for the WFAN license—loomed, Hispanic leaders in metropolitan Washington were left to evaluate their options; they attempted to purchase WGTB, which Georgetown University was selling at the time, but the University of the District of Columbia acquired the station, rendering the backup offer from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington—which would have run the station as a Spanish-language outlet—moot. After WFAN left the air, the new 1340 station, WYCB, began operations on August 15. The WFAN call letters are now taken by a Sports Radio Station in New York City.

A first version was premiered for the carnival in 1757 in the Palace of Ajuda in Lisbon. The revised version of 1768 performed for the birthday of Mariana Victoria of Spain is however much more widely known. Action A previous work entitled Solimano (1753) by Johann Adolph Hasse based on the libretto by Giovanni Ambrogio Migliavacca told the tale of two pairs of Turkish and Persian lovers. Perez's version has two Turkish-Turkish couples instead. The Turkish sultan Solimano (Suleiman the Magnificent) has sent his eldest son Selimo (Selim II) and his half-brother Zanghire (Şehzade Cihangir) into the war against the Shah of Persia, Tamasse (Tahmasp I). As a result of the campaign, Selimo is to marry the daughter of the Shah, Persane, and become ruler of Turkey and Persia. The current sultana Roselane (Hürrem Sultan), mother of Zanghire and stepmother of Selimo, together with Grand Vizier Rustano (Rüstem Pasha) intrigue to eliminate Selimo and to make Zanghire sultan. Solimano goes to Babylon with Osmino and his sister Barsina, who is engaged to Zanghire. There Zanghire proves to be loyal to his brother, reveals the intrigue and kills Rustano. Selimo and his father are reconciled and both original lovers (Selimo and Persane, Zanghire and Barsina) are allowed to marry. Second version The second version was noteworthy in moving forward the reforms taking place in opera style in the mid-18th century. It contains elements of baroque-style opera seria but mixes them with elements of opera buffa. Compared with traditional Metastasian operatic aesthetics, the libretto for Solimano allowed greater fluency and emotional sensitivity. Many typical features of baroque opera are attenuated in this version. The ritornelli in each aria are much briefer, and exit arias are often absent. The recitative is mostly orchestrated throughout rather than \\"secco\\", and many ensembles are through-composed, combining aria, recitative and chorus in an integrated whole. The vocal lines were generally written to be delivered in a smooth cantabile style, while the orchestral parts supporting them called for a more detached execution. Premiere cast The cast of the first performance of the second version were: Luigi Torriani (Solimano), (Selimo), Giovanni Battista Vazques (Persane), Giuseppe Orsi (Barsina), Lorenzo Maruzzi (Zanghire), Lorenzo Giorgetti (Osmino). Modern revival Modern performances of the 1768 version took place in 2010 and again in 2011 under Juan Bautista Otero, with the Real Compañía Ópera de Cámara as part of the Granada Music Festival.

Today the regiment is administratively assigned to the army's Engineer Command and the army's sole pioneer unit, whose focus, unlike the army's other engineer units, is on rear area construction tasks.  History  During November 1926 the Royal Italian Army raised a series of engineer regiments, among them the 6th Engineer Regiment in Bologna with the functions of a depot; i.e. the regiment only raised units for other formations. One of the units the depot raised was the 54th Craftsmen Company for the 21st Infantry Division \\"Granatieri di Sardegna\\". During World War II the 54th company was deployed to Slovenia and Croatia, until Italy changed sides with the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943 and the regiment and company were disbanded. On 1 May 1952 the Engineer Battalion \\"Granatieri di Sardegna\\" was raised in Rome as the engineer unit of the Infantry Division \\"Granatieri di Sardegna\\". The battalion was given the traditions of the 54th Craftsmen Company.  6th Pioneer Battalion \\"Trasimeno\\"  During the 1975 army reform the Engineer Battalion \\"Granatieri di Sardegna\\" was reorganized as a support battalion for the Central Military Region, which received the war flag and traditions of the 6th Engineer Regiment. Engineer battalions, formed or reorganized during the 1975 army reform, were named for a lake if they supported a corps or military region, or named for a river if they supported a division or brigade: the 6th Pioneer Battalion was named \\"Trasimeno\\" after Lake Trasimeno.  Recent Times  On 4 September 1993 the battalions was elevated to regiment without changing its size or composition and on 1 December 1997 the regiment passed from the Central Military Region to the army's Engineer Grouping. After the 1997 Umbria and Marche earthquake the regiment was deployed to the affected areas, where it remained until May 1998, earning a Bronze Medal of Civil Valour for its service. On 24 January 2005 the regiment activated a second pioneer battalion, which was named \\"Nemi\\" after Lake Nemi near Rome. After the August 2016 earthquake in Central Italy the regiment was deployed to the disaster area and remained there until April 2017, building shelters and clearing debris, and providing engineering services to the affected communities.

He had also served as the Member of Perak State Executive Council (Exco) for Housing and Local Government, Public Transport, Non-Muslim Affairs and New Villages from 2018 until the collapse of the state and federal governments of Pakatan Harapan (PH) due to the political crisis in 2020. Yong who was a member of the Democratic Action Party (DAP) in PH coalition had turned independent to support the Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition in aftermath of the crisis. Personal life Paul Yong Choo Kiong was born in Sitiawan, Perak. His family were settlers of New Village Program introduced during the British rule of Malaya. Education and professional career Yong received his education from SJKC Pei Min Ayer Tawar, and subsequently from SMK Ambrose, Ayer Tawar as well as Nan Hua High School of Ayer Tawar. He also obtained a Masters in Business Administration from a correspondence University name Akamai, although pronounced by opposition politician Wee Ka Siong that the degree obtained by Yong is a part of a degree mill. Political career Entering politics in 2004, Yong quickly became the Political Secretary to Ngeh Koo Ham in the Sitiawan Branch of DAP Yong stood as the State Assemblyman candidate in the 2013 Malaysian General Election and won in the state seat of Tronoh in Perak. As the incumbent, Yong retained the seat in the 2018 Malaysian General Election (GE14) beating his closest rival from MCA Yuen Chan How by a majority of 10,501 votes. With his win in the GE14, he was appointed an Perak state Exco member serving in the PH state government under Menteri Besar, Ahmad Faizal Azumu. Controversies Accused of rape In August, 2019 it was arraigned in Ipoh Sessions Court under Section 376 of the indictment on the charge of Yong raping his maid in a room on the top floor of Meru Road 2, Meru Village Park, near here, between 8.15 and 9.15pm on 7 July 2019. Allegations first arose around early July and despite having police investigations returned, the it was resubmitted to the Attorney General Chambers for charges, resulting in Yong being charged in the Ipoh Sessions Court for rape of his househelper. It then emerged that there was 'third party' involvement and Ngeh Koo Ham publicly saying that he had met the person who was paid to make the police report along with the househelper. Despite an official request from the legal defense team to expedite the case and have it transferred to the high court for a faster hearing, the high court denied the transfer, requesting it be heard in the sessions court instead. The victim was kept under the witness protection act at the Indonesian Embassy of Kuala Lumpur, and despite pleas from the mother of the victim, was denied visitation rights while during case management, the defense had also appealed to the prosecution to withdraw the case, citing the chemist report that indicated no traces of his DNA was ever found in clothing items as well as in bodily fluids of the swab from the alleged victim  Third Party Involvement  Yong opted to go on leave when pressure was stepped up calling for him to take leave-of- absence despite earlier rejecting the advise of the Menteri Besar Although he did proceed with the leave-of-absence, Yong returned to duty at the Perak State Legislative Assembly seating between 16–22 November. It was then alleged that Perak DAP Chairman Nga Kor Ming was overheard in a recording chiding Yong for his initiative to return to work, further compounding the rumour that 'black hands' were behind the accusation. Allegations emerged during Yong's appearance in court when a few hundred of his supporters emerged to call for the resignation of Nga.  Urges of calm and support  Despite his defense claim and emergence of third party involvement, Yong released a press statement urging his supporters to continue their support of the party and its leaders. Other developments relating to this include the earlier resignation of two state assemblymen for Malim Nawar, Leong Cheok Keng and Pokok Assam, Leow Thye Yih in protest to Nga's statement of Party's decision on Yong's fate rather than the Party's state committee. However both then relented and returned to the state committee on Yong's continued appeal. Both were then denied reinstatement with Nga publicly rebutting 'members who fail to toe party's line'  House broken into  On 5 November 2019, Yong reported that his house was broken into while he was away on business, resulting in the loss of important documents as well as personal property. Oddly, the room in which his former househelper stayed in was left locked and untouched. The police confirmed that there was indeed a break in at Yong's house, and while two safeboxes containing documents and valuables were taken, neither his high powered motorcycle, 60 inch TV nor other expensive items were taken Election results {  style=\\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\\" + Perak State Legislative Assembly: N33 Tronoh, P66 Batu Gajah.

Description Antitrichia curtipendula has dark red stems and green “leaves” that give the overall matt of intertwined steams and roots a rusty yellow looking color. This color varies in intensity depending on the level of moisture being held within the organism.Montana Field Guides. An Antitrichia Moss- Antitrichia Curtipendula.

Biogeography Antitrichia curtipendula is native to North America, spanning the western coastline from southern Alaska down to northern California. In California particularly, this moss’ distribution is almost entirely similar to that of the coastal redwoods. This moss likes a moderate coastal climate that renders its habitat seasonally moist. Some other locations that this particular species has been found are Denmark, the Eastern coast of Norway near Stockholm, Austria, the Western coast of France, and the Western coast of Spain. The locations in Western Europe where Hanging Moss has been found are much smaller areas than those in Western North America, where the moss’ habitat is more extensive.C.C. Newberry. (Accessed 2019). Antitricia Curtipendula, Flora of North America, vol 28, p591-593. Retrieved from http://dev.semanticfna.org/Antitrichia_curtipendula This moss prefers a temperate climate with moderate temperatures and moderate to high amounts of precipitation. This moss is found in low to high elevation forests, ranging from around 0-2100 meters in elevation that are predominantly coniferous type trees. They can be found in the forest canopy growing on limbs, branches, stumps and sometimes rocks.C.C. Newberry. (Accessed 2019). Antitricia Curtipendula, Flora of North America, vol 28, p591-593. Retrieved from http://dev.semanticfna.org/Antitrichia_curtipendula. Ecology While not being parasites, Epiphytes need a host to grow on. Unlike parasites, they do not cause any damage to the host they call home. Their host plant only provides support and a vantage point at which to reach the nutrients needed to grow. Hanging Moss does not grow roots into the ground, instead growing complex root systems upon their host plant, that weave themselves into a tight matt and provide structure and support to the overall moss community. Living up off the forest floor allows these epiphytes to gain access to the precipitation that may or may not reach them through the forest canopy. Epiphytes engage in photosynthesis, gaining their energy from the incoming solar radiation. Living in the canopy and/or not on the forest floor also gives these organisms access to more sunshine than they would get otherwise. With their roots they pull nutrients and water from the air, eliminating the need for roots that occupy the soil. R.Welch.(2007). Epiphytes: An ecosystem contained within an ecosystem.

Unlike Antitrichia curtipendula, this epiphyte will sometimes grow on the ground, climbing upwards with long creeping branches. Unlike the Antitrichia curtipendula, which has three midribs on its leaf, Rhytidiadelphus Loreus has a double midrib leaf. Like Antitrichia curtipendula, Rhytidiadelphus loreus and other Rhytudiadelphus species thrive in coastal maritime environments with high potential evapotranspiration. K. Fretwell, B. Starzomski.

Retrieved from https://www.centralcoastbiodiversity.org/lanky-moss-bull- rhytidiadelphus-loreus.html Also related to Antitrichia curtipendula is Rhytidiadelphus squarrousus or bent-leaf moss. As its name implies, Rhytidiadelphus squarrous has a characteristically bent-leaf and prefers to grow in open shady areas where persistent moisture is present and other vegetation is minimal, instead of in the forest canopy. H. Warnst. (Accessed 2019). Introduction to Bryophytes, The Public Face of Biology. Retrieved from http://blogs.ubc.ca/biology321/?page_id=983 Reproductive needs While still needing sunlight to reproduce, mosses and epiphytes appreciate a shady environment that allows for a consistently moist environment. Being a small flowerless and seedless plant, Antitrichia curtipendula reproduces through the use of spores. After germination and when first developing, moss will develop a thin, felt like structure on damp soil, rocks, tree bark, or rocks. This transitional stage in the life cycle of moss leads to the growth of gametophore which then develops into stems and leaves. Wind is an important distributor of moss spores. Since these mosses do not want to grow on the forest floor, they cannot simply fall to the ground and take root. Wind distribution allows for the moss spores to reach a greater distance than they otherwise would and allows for the spores to attach to surfaces within the canopy. Along with wind, insects and birds play a role in helping the reproduction of epiphytes like the Hanging Moss. When birds and insects land on or brush against moss, they can retain spores on their bodies, carrying them through the forest to where ever they land next. This process has the ability to spread moss spores even farther than the wind might. Current threats As with species like this one, Antitrichia curtipendula is susceptible to anything that threatens the hosts on which they grow. Since these mosses generally grow on trees, factors that threaten tree growth and health also threaten the growth of these epiphytes. Threats like deforestation, for agricultural needs, or logging for lumber, alter the habitat in which these mosses grow. After this habitat is altered, they need to wait for the tree canopy to grow back before they are able to then inhabit the area once again. These mosses tend to inhabit mid to old growth forests for the particular reason that these forests are already established enough to provide good structural support for these epiphytes. Also, because these mosses are slow growing, which means to get a structurally sound community in one spot, they need to develop over time. Bibliography * C.C. Newberry. (Accessed 2019).

Today the regiment is administratively assigned to the army's Engineer Command and the army's sole unit focusing on operational level river crossings.  History  On 1 January 1883 the Royal Italian Army raised the 4th Engineer Regiment (Bridges) in Piacenza with the functions of a depot; i.e. the regiment only raised units for other formations. Initially the regiment controlled two railway engineer and four bridge engineer companies, and the 14th Lagunari Company in Venice. One of the four bridge engineer companies, the 1st Bridge Engineer Company, had distinguished itself at the Siege of Peschiera in May 1848 during the First Italian War of Independence and arrived with a Bronze Medal of Military Valour, which was affixed to the flag of the newly raised regiment.  World War I  During World War I the regiment raised an additional twelve bridge engineer and three lagunari companies. The regiment's companies were employed repeatedly during the first eleven battles on the Isonzo river. After the Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo the regiment's companies built emergency bridges over the Torre and Tagliamento rivers to allow the Third Army to escape. During the battles along the Piave river the engineers helped the Italian Army cross the river during the decisive Battle of Vittorio Veneto. After the war the 4th Engineer Regiment (Bridges) was renamed Bridge Engineer and Lagunari Regiment, to honor the conduct of the Lagunari units during the war. On 15 May 1933 the regiment was split into the 1st Bridge Engineer Regiment in Verona and the 2nd Bridge Engineer Regiment in Piacenza.  World War II  During World War II the regiment acted once again as depot, raising bridge engineer battalions for other formations. The I and IX bridge battalions distinguished themselves in September 1941 as part of the Italian Expeditionary Corps in Russia, when they repaired a long enemy pontoon bridge over the Dnieper river at Dnipro in Southern Ukraine under enemy fire. When Italy changed sides with the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943 and the regiment was disbanded. For its service of its battalions on the Eastern Front the regiment was awarded a Bronze Medal of Military Valour.  Cold War  On 15 December 1949 the regiment was reformed in Piacenza with the following structure: * 2nd Bridge Engineer Regiment, in Piacenza ** Command Platoon ** I Bridge Engineer Battalion *** 1st Bridge Engineer Company *** 2nd Bridge Engineer Company ** I Railway Engineer Battalion *** 1st Dismountable Metal Bridges Company *** 2nd Dismountable Metal Bridges Company ** Railway Operations Company ** Field Park Company In 1950 the regiment also raised an Bridge Engineer Recruits Training Company. The same year the regiment began to build the bridge for the yearly Festa del Redentore in Venice - a tradition that continued until the end of obligatory military service in 2000. For its quick and tireless intervention after the Polesine floods in November 1951 the regiment was awarded a Silver Medal of Civil Valour. On 1 March 1953 the regiment raised a second and third bridge engineer battalion, with the former being based in Legnano. On 1 January 1954 the I Railway Battalion left the regiment to form the Railway Engineer Regiment, followed on 1 October 1957 by the II Engineer Battalion. On 1 February 1964 the II Bridge Engineer Battalion returned to the 2nd Bridge Engineer Regiment. On 6 September 1974 the I Bridge Engineer Battalion was put into reserve status and switched then numbers with the II Bridge Engineer Battalion. * 30px 2nd Bridge Engineer Regiment, in Piacenza ** Command and Services Platoon, in Piacenza ** 1st Bridge Engineer Battalion, in Legnago ** 2nd Bridge Engineer Battalion (Reserve), in Piacenza ** 3rd Bridge Engineer Battalion, in Piacenza  Recent times  On 22 September 1992 the 1st Bridge Engineer Battalion became an autonomous battalion under the Northeastern Military Region. The battalion was elevated to 1st Bridge Engineer Regiment and assigned the war flag of the 1st Engineer Regiment in 1993, but was disbanded in 1997. On 1 December 1997 the regiment passed from the Tuscan-Emilian Military Region to the army's Engineer Grouping, which on 10 September 2010 became the Engineer Command. After the August 2016 earthquake in Central Italy the regiment was deployed to the disaster area and remained there until April 2017, rebuilding roads and bridges, and providing engineering services to the affected communities. For its service the regiment was awarded Gold Cross of Army Merit.

Life and work He received his initial artistic training at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp with Nicaise De Keyser. His first solo exhibition came in 1846, and he gained immediately popularity with his mildly humorous scenes from daily life. His early works show the strong influence of Jean-Baptiste Madou and, especially, Ferdinand de Braekeleer. He often collaborated with other artists, such as Constant Boon (1830-1882), who also did genre scenes, , who painted farm animals (primarily chickens) and Henriëtte Ronner-Knip, who specialized in cats. His works may be seen in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp and the Groeningemuseum in Bruges, as well as at various museums in Brussels, Chicago, Cincinnati, Montreal and Rostock. His paintings are still regularly sold at auction.

The song's pirate-themed music video originated from a trip to Disneyland with co- director Matt Copson. The nautical themes would go on to inspire other art for the project, including the cover art for Pang.

Her films, which are experimental in nature, have been presented in a variety of festivals, solo and group exhibitions at diverse international venues. Since 2009, she has been a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Braunschweig, Germany. Her 2003 film, Living a Beautiful Life, has been recognized with a German Film Critic's Award in 2005 and an award from the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen in 2004.  Biography  Corinna Schnitt was born in Duisburg, Germany in 1964. Before adopting film as her primary medium, she trained as a wood-carver from 1986 to 1989, when she held an apprenticeship in Michelstadt, Germany. She also studied at the Hochschule für Gestaltung Offenbach am Main, and the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, receiving her Master's degree from there in 1995. In June 1997, she founded Schnittraum, an independent storefront gallery and community art space in Cologne, Germany. She has received a number of awards for her experimental films. She has been a professor of Film and Video at the Academy of Fine Arts in Braunschweig since 2009.  Work   Style  Schnitt's films depict a range of subjects, often following a narrative form with human protagonists. She experiments with a variety of narrative and technical techniques. Many of her works start with a focus on the banal activities in daily life before pushing them to \\"a point of absurdity\\" or humour through a variety of film techniques. A few examples of the diverse themes included in Schnitt's films range from \\"the listless banality of suburbia,\\" unspoken social norms, the human body and the natural environment. She has shared in interviews that some of her work comes from her interest in how public spaces are activated by civilians. If speaking, characters in her films communicate in English or German.  Notable films  = Whispering to Flowers or, Zu Blumen flüstern (2015) = Whispering to Flowers (also referenced as Zu Blumen flüstern, in German) is a recent body of work which continues in Schnitt's exploration into nature and social conventions. This series of films each follow the same general format. In these works, which take place indoors, a floral bouquet is placed in the center of the frame and is repetitively \\"caressed\\" and spoken to softly by a young protagonist (most of them are women). The series demonstrates a few of the conventions commonly used in ASMR video content. = Living a Beautiful Life (2003) = Living a Beautiful Life explores themes of idealism, good fortune, and the optimism of youth. The film opens upon a utopian garden scene with nude infants and young animals enjoying the idyllic surroundings. Following the title sequence, the film introduces an attractive well-to-do couple, who describe their life and goals in various locations of a large domestic property. The film's script is derived from interviews conducted by Schnitt with teenagers living in California. Schnitt asked her young subjects what constitutes a good life to them. As Kay von Keitz put it, \\"the ideal world is a fiction that stems from the teenagers' ideas of professional success, family happiness and perfect society, which in turn is fostered by fictions and clichés: fiction reflects fiction. The perfect happiness has oppressive features.\\" The film has won several award and prizes. =Get out of his Clothes or, Raus aus seinen Kleidern (1998–1999) = Get out of his Clothes (translated from: Raus aus seinen Kleidern) was shot on 16mm film. The film opens with a woman shaking off her clothing on an outdoor apartment balcony and slowly zooms out revealing the neighbouring buildings. As the camera zooms out even further, the woman becomes smaller in the frame until she is nearly invisible. A woman's voice is heard throughout, speaking in German. It may appear that the narration is the inner monologue of the woman who is on the balcony. Towards the end of the film, the zoom out passes through a window which reveals a domestic interior of another apartment, where the camera is revealed to be located. From within this final interior setting, a seated woman is revealed to the left of a large window. It becomes evident that it has been her voice speaking for the duration of the video. According to the artist Siebren de Haan, \\"Schnitt's camera travels through architectonic barriers between private and public space,\\" highlighting the themes of domesticity, public space and everyday urban dwelling in the video.\\" The film also references the 1967 film Wavelength by Canadian artist Michael Snow through its minimal structure and use of a slow zoom technique. Unlike in Wavelength, where the camera zooms in from one end of a room to another, Raus aus seinen Kleidern features a zoom out which passes through different architectural structures.  Career  Schnitt's work has been recognized by a number of public and private institutions.  Exhibitions  Since the 1990s, Schnitt has extensively exhibited her work at a variety of solo and group exhibitions held at galleries and museums. She has been included in over one hundred group exhibitions, internationally. She has also held solo exhibitions internationally, including at the Philipp von Rosen Gallery in 2019 and 2016, Sprengel Museum in 2015, Wilhelm-Hack-Museum in 2012, Kunstverein Wolfenbüttel in 2012, Museum Ludwig in 2007, and The Chinati Foundation in 2004.  Collections  Schnitt's work is included in several public and private art collections, including that of Kunsthalle Hamburg, MUSAC, ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe, Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany, Museum für Moderne Kunst in Arnhem, Netherlands, and Neuer Berliner Kunstverein (NBK) in Berlin, Germany.

He was a long-standing ensemble member of the Vienna State Opera and performed regularly at the Salzburg Festival from 1922 to 1950, in roles such as Pedrillo in Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail and Valzacchi in Der Rosenkavalier by Richard Strauss.  Life and career  Born in Vienna, Gallos first studied law at the University of Vienna, and then voice at the Vienna Music Academy. He sang predominantly buffo roles and was often heard in important tenor secondary roles. In 1922, the first year in which operas were performed at the Salzburg Festival, he appeared in Mozart operas, as Pedrillo in Die Entführung aus dem Serail and Don Curzio in Le nozze di Figaro, both conducted by Franz Schalk. He appeared at the festival until 1950. He was involved in several new productions after the reconstruction of the Kleines Festspielhaus: in 1927 and 1936 as Jaquino in Beethoven's Fidelio, from 1936 to 1938 as Augustin Moser in Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg and often as Valzacchi in Der Rosenkavalier by Richard Strauss, between 1929 and 1946. Gallos was for decades a member of the Vienna State Opera. He appeared as Scaramuccio in the first performance of the revised version of Ariadne auf Naxos on 4 October 1916, singing 112 performances in the role. He toured with the ensemble to the Paris Opera in 1928. Grave of Hermann Gallos Gallos also taught at the Vienna Music Academy. He was a teacher of Hans Braun and Walter Berry, among others. Gallos died in Vienna at age 71. He is buried in the Wiener Zentralfriedhof (group 33F, row 12, number 8).

They have been working together since 2001 making mostly video-art and video- art installations using various mediums such as photography, video and animation. Central to their artworks is the relationship between individuals and their environments, both nature and society, and how this is influenced by the current, media based society. Their works have been part of numerous exhibitions but have also been shown on festivals, for example IFFR and Lowlands festival. Several of their works can also be found in the collection of the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam and the Akzo Nobel Art Foundation. They are represented by Akinci, based in Amsterdam.  Education and Residencies  Both Broersen and Lukács started their artistic education at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam, where they studied graphic design from 1994 to 1998. They continued studying Fine Arts and Design at the Sandberg Institute from 1998 to 2001. After residencies at the Chinese European Art Center (Xiamen, China) in 2002 and Iaspis (Stockholm, Sweden) in 2006 they enrolled in a two-year residency at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam from 2007 to 2008. They returned to the Chinese European Art Centre in 2010 after which they came back to Europe residing in the Atelier Holsboer (Paris, France) between 2011 and 2012. In 2017, they were residents at the Künstlerhaus Bethanien (Berlin, Germany).  Selected Works   Crossing the Rainbow Bridge (2003)  Crossing the Rainbow Bridge' is a two-channel video showing two young people who appear to be a couple, played by Broersen and Lukács themselves. The two are shown in separate environments expressing their thoughts, sometimes coming together in song or though. The video was described by Lex ter Braak as \\"making things visible and tangible\\" because of the visualization of connections that seem incomprehensible. The sentimental feel of the video is enhanced by the accompanying music by indie-pop band Bauer.  The Broersen Family (2006) and Raise High the Roof Beam (2007)  For these video's Broersen and Lukács delved into their own family's history. They can be displayed separately or as a combined installation. The Broersen Family is set in the small town of Nieuw Niedorp, where Pepijn Broersen is originally from, and shows the lives of the Broersen family in a four-channel video. Though fictional, the shots are made to look like documentary footage of a town that is slowly influenced by consequences of globalization. Complementing but also responding to this is the work Raise High the Roof Beam, focused around the Jewish-Hungarian roots of Margit Lukács' family. Contrary to the story of Broersen, her family has spread around the world, having no clear origins. With these works, they question to what extent identities are formed by previous generations and family history.  Manifest Destiny (2008/2009)  Manifest Destiny was made during Broersen and Lukács' final year at the Rijksakademie and tells the story of a scientist on the lookout for life on other planets. The video shows the barren landscape of an imaginary planet while hearing the scientist speak about his ongoing investigations. Slowly, it becomes clear that the scientist is a somewhat lonely soul, in need of social contact in his direct environment while at the same time longing for the unknown world on other planets. The story is based on interviews conducted by Broersen and Lukács with researchers and scholars on the topic of extraterrestrial space. The shots used in the video are inspired by the representation of space in both documentaries and science-fiction, showing \\"the proximity of reality and fiction that are inevitably found when the explorer is led by a longing for a new reality\\".  Mastering Bambi (2010)  Instead of a human or animal as protagonist, nature plays the leading role in Mastering Bambi. Broersen and Lukács built on the idea that the Disney film Bambi can also be interpreted as a metaphor for human society as the sole thread of nature. The spectator is taken through scenes of an empty forest that the artist have created by layering real photographs. Because of the movement and focus of the 'camera' the work has been interpreted as being intimate and private. The video is accompanied by a soundtrack created by Berend Dubbe and Gwendolyn Thomas, who have distorted the original movie soundtrack.  Ruins in Reverse (2014)  Ruins in Reverse is a 56 meter print made for the escalator area at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam and was part of the exhibition 'On the Move'. When standing on the escalator, the visitor is transported past a landscape full of buildings and cities. The image was built up using different scenes from sci-fi movies that depict the future. By exploring these past depictions of the future, the artists wanted to show how the idea of the future in popular media can change with time and can be linked to certain ideologies. The soundtrack was made by Natalia Domínguez Rangel.  Establishing Eden (2016)  Set to a soundtrack by Berend Dubbe and Gwendolyn Thomas, the single-channel video Establishing Eden is based around the so-called 'establishing shot' used to set a scene in movies. The video is made by layering photographs, the same technique as used to make Mastering Bambi, creating scenes that can be seen as a whole or, when the 'camera' moves, are split apart. The photographs in the video are of the landscapes used as filming locations for The Lord of the Rings series in New- Zealand. With these shots, Broersen and Lukács want to show how nature can inspire movies, but also how these movies in return have changed the way the landscapes are viewed (for example the renaming of various sites).  Forest on Location (2018)  Broersen and Lukács continue using their layered photographs to form the video Forest on Location, this time introducing an animated figure to the scenes. The scenes are made using 3D-photo's from the old growth forest of Białowieża in Poland. A slight difference in technique causes the photo's to produce 3D scenes of the forest that aren't screen filling but rather appear to be floating in space. An animated avatar of the Iranian opera singer Shahram Yazdani can be seen walking through the woods, singing a Persian version of Nat King Cole's Nature Boy. The song is chosen because of its relation to Herman Yablokoff, a songwriter who claims to have written it and lived close to the forest. The work was part of a three piece installation called 'Point Cloud Old Growth' in foam Amsterdam and was described by curator Mirjam Kooiman as follows: \\"Broersen and Lukács take nature as a phenomenon from which mankind is perhaps more alienated than anything else today, and investigate the visual framework that we repeatedly project onto it as a means to capture it, to give it meaning, or as a vain attempt to understand it.\\".

The Cat Stones of Scotland (or, in Scots Gaelic, the Clach a'Chath) are natural prominent rock features or standing stones around Scotland that are often linked to battles or burials. The English term cat applied to such stones derives from the Gaelic cath (). Clach a'Chait would be the Gaelic for \\"Stone of the Cat\\". The name has a variety of spellings in English, including Catstone, Cat Stone, Catstane, Cat's Stone and Cat Stane. Associations The Cat Stones are mainly linked with battles or burials whilst a few may have primary or secondary connections with Scottish Wildcats (Felis silvestris).Watson, W.J. (2004). Celtic Place-Names in Scotland. Edinburgh:Birlinn. p.138. Many hills also have 'Cat' as a part of their name such as Cat Castle, Cat Law, Cath Law, Cat Hill, Cade Hill, Cat Cairn, Hill of Cat, etc. The 'Cat' element origin is one of the more disputed of the place- names. The Scots Gaelic 'caid' means summit and 'cath' means battle. Cairns were once referred to as 'cat-heaps'.McKenzie, W.C. (1931). Scottish Place- Names. London:Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co. Ltd. p.66 Cairns or tumuli are often associated with battles or burial sites, such as the supposed burial place of Somerled at Knock in Renfrewshire where Thomas Pennant in 1772 was shown \\"a mount or tumulus, with a foss round the base, and a single stone on the top, which he was told indicated the spot where Somerled was slain.\\"Metcalfe, W.M. (1905). A History of the County of Renfrew from the Earliest Times. Paisley : Alexander Gardner. p.30. Cat Stone sites The Catstane, City of Edinburgh The Catstane at Edinburgh Airport in its original location. The Catstane, a monolith, formed the focus for a cemetery of long-cist burials and once bore an inscription, translated as \\"In this tomb lies Vetta, daughter of Victricus\\"' written in a 5th or 6th century AD script. The stone is a rounded boulder with a circumference at the base of 3.65m with a height of 1.3m. It is not known whether it was artificially shaped or selected because of its shape. In 1699 it stood on the perimeter of a low cairn with a border of large horizontal kerbstones. The long cists of an Early Christian cemetery were established in a Bronze Age site consisting of a standing stone and kerb-cairn dating from the second millennium BC, the standing stone then being re-used for an Early Christian inscription.Canmore - The Cat StaneWickham-Jones, C. R. (2009), The Landscape of Scotland. Stroud : The History Press. . pp. 23 - 24. The Catstane has been excavated and removed from its location at Edinburgh Airport due to development works. The Catstane stood in what had been an arable field on the farm of Brigs and tradition has it that it commemorates either a battle fought between the forces of Malcolm II and those of the usurper Constantine, or the spot where the latter was killed. The name is supposed to be a corruption of Constantine. The battle itself is traditionally said to have been fought about 2 miles west of the Catstane at the Hamlet of Newbridge.Scotlands Places - Catstane The Cat's Stone beneath a rowan tree on the south bank of Loch Doon. The Cat Stone, Perth and Kinross This standing stone, one of a pair, stands at NGR NN711478 and is also known as Coille Dhubh or Clach Taghairm nan Cat. The nearest village is Fortingall. The associated legend is that at Halloween Scottish wildcats formed a circle around it to dignify a huge black cat that sat atop the stone. The Stone of the Demon stands opposite.Canmore - Coille Dhubh The Cat Craig, North Ayrshire In the Barony of Ladyland the Cat Craig is located beside the lane running up to Cockston Farm and is one of two drystone wall enclosed crags.Hall, T.

Page 59 The Cat Stane, North Ayrshire On the lands of Blackstone near Giffordland in North Ayrshire stands the prominent rock feature known as the Cat Stane. No local details of its history survive and John Smith the antiquarian associates it with the site of a battle.Smith, John (1895). Prehistoric Man in Ayrshire. London : Elliot Stock. p.72 As an easily identified and prominent landscape feature that would serve as an ideal rallying point for the vassals of the laird prior to battle as was the borestone at Giffen Castle and Greenhills near Beith, also in North Ayrshire. The Battle of Largs was fought in 1263 and nearby Camphill is said to have been a rallying point for the Scottish army. The Catstone on the lands of Blackstone. The Cat Stone or Clach a'Chath, Isle of Arran The story associated with the Cat Stone is that circa 1652 a skirmish took place between garrison troops from Brodick Castle and a group of locals at Allt-a-Chlaideimh (Sword Burn) with the last soldier killed at Clach-a-Chath, the Battle Stone (NR918488).Canmore - Arran, Catacol Battle Site The Cat's Stone, Dumfries and Galloway This stone overlooks the original site of Loch Doon Castle in Dumfries and Galloway.

Known for his invention of superjunction power semiconductor devices, he was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a life fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). He was inducted into IEEE's ISPSD Hall of Fame in 2019.  Early life and education  Chen was born on 28 January 1931 in Shanghai, Republic of China, with his ancestral home in Pujiang County, Zhejiang. His father, Chen Dezheng (), was a Kuomintang politician who was dismissed for offending Chiang Kai- shek. His mother, Xu Hemei (), studied literature at Shanghai University. Chen entered primary school at the age of only three. When he was six, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out and the Japanese attacked Shanghai. Chen's family fled the city for Chongqing, China's wartime capital. As a result of the Japanese bombing of Chongqing, the family fled again to the countryside in Hechuan, where he completed his primary and middle school education under harsh conditions. After the end of the Second World War, Chen's family returned to Shanghai, where he studied at and was admitted to the Department of Electrical Engineering of Tongji University with a scholarship.  Career  Upon graduation from Tongji University in 1952, Chen was assigned to teach at the Department of Electrical Engineering of Xiamen University. A year later, he was transferred to the faculty of radio electronics at Nanjing Institute of Technology (now Southeast University). In 1956, Chen furthered his studies at the Institute of Applied Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he researched semiconductors for two and half years. He joined the faculty of the newly established University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in Chengdu in 1959. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), Chen was persecuted because of his family's Kuomintang background and performed manual labour at a May Seventh Cadre School. After the end of the period he went to the United States in 1980 as a visiting scholar at Ohio State University and the University of California, Berkeley. Upon returning to China in 1983, Chen was appointed a department chair at UESTC. He soon established the Institute of Microelectronics at the university and focused his research on MOSFET and power semiconductor devices. He also taught as a visiting professor at the University of Toronto in Canada and the University of Wales Swansea. Chen died on 4 December 2019 in Chengdu, aged 88.  Contributions and honours  Chen was a leading expert on power semiconductor devices in China, known for his invention of superjunction, for which he was granted a US patent in 1993 (No. 5,216,275). He also developed China's first VDMOS, LDMOS, insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), and other semiconductor devices. He published more than 200 research papers and held over 40 patents in China, the United States, and other countries. He was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1999 and a life fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2019. In 2015, he won the Pioneer Award from IEEE's International Symposium on Power Semiconductor Devices and ICs (ISPSD), the first awardee from the Asia- Pacific region. In May 2019, he was inducted into the ISPSD Hall of Fame \\"for contributions to superjunction power semiconductor devices\\".

It was founded in 1966 as a youth choir for the broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk by Alois Ickstadt, who conducted it for 45 years. From 1977 to the 1990s, the choir was known as Figuralchor des Hessischen Rundfunks. It performs in concerts, radio productions and recordings, with a focus on a cappella music, but has also participated in joint symphonic productions such as Mahler's Symphony of a Thousand for the opening of the Alte Oper concert hall in 1981. The choir has been conducted by Paul Leonard Schäffer since 2016.  History  The choral conductor and pedagogue Alois Ickstadt, who had founded the children's choir for the broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk (hr) in 1961, founded a youth choir, which would become the Figuralchor, for the station in 1966, according to his concept to educate choral singers from childhood to adulthood in both vocal training and background information. The name Figuralchor was derived from , mostly polyphonic music of the 17th and 18th century. Ickstadt conducted the Figuralchor in concerts, radio productions and recordings. The first Figuralchor performances, beginning in 1966, were broadcasts. The ensemble sang its first concert for a live audience In 1970, performing motets at St. Leonhard. The choir's repertoire is focused on sacred and secular a cappella motets, but it also performs symphonic works and oratorios, such as Mahler's Eighth Symphony in the opening concert of the Alte Oper on 28 August 1981, conducted by Michael Gielen. In the 1990s, the choir no longer received funding from the broadcaster and changed its name to Figuralchor Frankfurt, but it still has appeared in broadcasts. When Ickstadt retired in 2011, Martin Lücker succeeded him. Paul Leonard Schäffer became conductor in 2016, the year of the choir's 50th anniversary, after having assisted Lücker for three years. Schäffer conducted the choir in a festive concert at the Clara Schumann Saal of Dr. Hoch's Konservatorium on 16 September 2016 in a performance of Schubert's Mass in E-flat major. The choir performed Bach's Christmas Oratorio at the Alte Oper in 2017.

A recurring theme in his artworks is the relations between humans, technology and nature.  Education  Van Nuenen studied audio-visual design at the art academy St. Joost in Breda where he graduated in 2002. He graduated in 2002 with the 12-minute long animation film Optimizer Customizer, which shows the “eventual downfall of civilized society” caused by consumerism. Optimizer Customizer was nominated for the René Coulhoprijs in the same year but did not win.  Career  Van Nuenen has said to be fascinated by “trivial” imagery, which are images that were not made with an artistic purpose in mind. These images are often what jumpstarts his artworks; there is no scenario or narrative prior. Van Nuenen usually does not work with his own imagery but salvages the images that fascinate him and builds his computer animations with these. These animations are built and shown on Van Nuenen’s own hardware and software. Even though Van Nuenen does not work with a preexisting narrative, the narration often unfolds itself in the same direction, though, which often focuses on society’s rigid and mechanic components that keep the gears of this machinal society turning. The perfect way to resist this rigid system is to make art, according to Van Nuenen. Due to his skilful salvaging of images, he has been named the “master of recycling” by Dutch art journalist Sandra Smallenburg.  Works  Some of Van Nuenen's works include: * Optimizer Customizer (2002), a 12-minute long 2D animation video made with pre-existing images and sounds that are composed to show a feminine machine that runs on money. Inside her is a factory that endlessly repeats its tasks. When one task within this system malfunctions, a chain-reaction which rapidly destroys the system follows. This is Van Nuenen's first video animation. * Seeing Bush Through the Trees (2003), a 2-minute long video in which logos of multinational companies are collaged to create a distorted portrait of George W. Bush. * Lame Yard (2003), a 2-minute two- channel video installation. Each channel shows a 2D computer animation of symmetric landscapes that become more and more chaotic until an almost abstract world is all that remains. * SET-4 (2003), a 4-minute long video using footage from various sports competitions, including table tennis, volleyball and springboard diving. The footage and accompanying sounds are digitally manipulated by Van Nuenen to create a noisy composition. * Warning, Petroleum Pipeline (2004), a 4-minute long animated video in which a desert landscape slowly transforms into a futuristic industrialized world in which neither a landscape nor a machine can be recognized anymore. * Aux Raus - Rasthof Deutschland (2007), a 3-minute long music video for the Dutch gabber- punk band Aux Raus. *Battle of the Plants (2007), an 8-minute long video installation shown in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. A system of skeletons and plants slowly take over the building they are projected upon. *Evolizer (2007), an 11-minute long animated video showing figures moving around in a black and white city, one of these figures carries a box. This box opens up and reveals a colourful world in which organisms seem to struggle for survival. Van Nuenen received support from Ruveanne Gerrissen for the animations. The sound for this video is created by Aux Raus, Sanne Groeneveld, Studio Gnocci and Roderick Hietbrink. *Physics Distorter (2009), a real-time computer simulation of falling and colliding objects projected on a building. The audience could control the direction of these objects through a wireless globe. *Deep Sea Paradiso (2010), an 8-minute video installation shown in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The video shows the rise and fall of the tides. The fall of the tides causes the creatures in the sea to disappear. New creatures are created when the tide rises again. *nAnOnAnD (2011), a hand- made, cheap and patchable sound synthesizer. The building instructions for this synthesizer are available for free on the artist's website. *Hit Others (2013), a free video game created by Van Nuenen, musician Bastiaan Bosma and the Dutch band Bullerslug. The game is no longer available online. *The Origin of Creepers (2017), a real-time computer simulation of a fictional ecosystem projected on a forest on Vlieland. The ecosystem is made up by hoards of creatures who battle each other for food and habitat. These creatures are becoming better at adapting to their surroundings and reproduce quickly. The public can stop creatures from taking over the ecosystem by producing loud noise.

It is situated north-northwest of Stewart, and northwest of Mount Bayard. Precipitation runoff from the peak and meltwater from the surrounding Salmon Glacier drains into the Salmon River. The mountain was named by the International Boundary Survey for one of its own members, George White-Fraser (1872-1920), who also served with the Canadian Infantry in France during World War I. The mountain's name was officially adopted March 31, 1924. Weather permitting, the mountain can be seen from the gravel Granduc Mine Road near Hyder, Alaska, which is seasonally open in summer. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount White-Fraser is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.

The Paradise Theatre is a movie theatre located at 1006 Bloor Street West in the Bloorcourt Village neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It first opened in 1937, closed in 2006, and was to be turned into a pharmacy. However, it was restored and re-opened on December 5, 2019. The renovations include luxury features, including an attached restaurant, bar, and table service to the premium patrons in the balcony. Architect Benjamin Brown designed the theatre in the art Deco style. As originally built, the theatre provided 643 seats, 177 of them in a small balcony. It also had a small stage, and two dressing rooms, for live acts. According to local historian Doug Taylor, the theatre had multiple owners. It showed erotic films in the 1980s that Taylor described as so mild they could be shown on broadcast television today. In the 1990s, until its 2006 closure, it was one of small network of Toronto Repertory Cinemas. In 2007, the building was given a heritage designation, which, in theory, would prevent it being demolished. However, Taylor noted that Toronto's heritage designation bylaws were weak, and its designation was not a guarantee it would not be torn down. Moray Tawse bought the building in 2013. In a profile celebrating its re-opening, Toronto Star movie critic Peter Howell wrote that Tawse was motivated to restore it by his love of a cinema of similar vintage where his mother worked, when he was a child. After Tawse's renovations, the theatre seats 186 patrons on the ground floor, while the balcony has just 22 seats. His renovations include provision for live acts. Tawse's renovations also included turning the small Italian grocery store next door into a restaurant, and adding a second storey to hold a bar - both to open in 2020. On December 5, 2019, the night of the re-opening, the theatre hosted an instance of the Basement Revue, an ongoing series of live performances.

These were created for the firm he founded with his partners in 1861, Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Company, and later for Morris and Company. He created fifty different block-printed wallpapers, all with intricate, stylised patterns based on nature, particularly upon the native flowers and plants of Britain. His wallpapers and textile designs had a major effect on British interior designs, and then upon the subsequent Art Nouveau movement in Europe and the United States. The 1860s - experiments and early designs His partners in the company were members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a group of painters who rejected the art and design of the Victorian era, and sought to revive earlier themes and techniques of art and craftsmanship. The first wallpaper pattern he designed for his company was the Trellis wallpaper in 1864. It was inspired by the roses he grew on the trellis at his residence, the Red House. However, two years passed between the time he designed the paper and the time he was able to print it to his satisfaction. His primary objective was to make the wallpaper by hand, with transparent oil colours on zinc plates, rather than However, when he could not make this work to his satisfaction, he gave the task to an established wallpaper firm, Jeffrey and company, which printed it with wood blocks and distemper colours. Since Morris was a perfectionist, this also was a long process. He was dissatisfied by the early versions, and at one point threw away the entire set of printing blocks. The final versions were printed in different colours. For the bedroom of his own residence Kelmscott House, which he decorated in 1879, he used the trellis design with a blue background.

All three were created in a variety of different colours. The multitude of colours used and the careful work involved made these wallpapers particularly expensive. since he was running a business, he had to adapt to the wishes of the market. At the end of the 1860s, in order to bring in more orders, he created an entirely different group of four papers based on a new design, called the Indian. Since they had only two colours, they were less expensive. In 1868, though he disliked the Victorian idea of using several different designs of wallpaper in the same room, intended especially for the ceilings of rooms.  The early 1870s - mastery of technique  In the 1870s, through practice and continual refinement, he achieved a mastery of the technique and a more sophisticated and subtle style, with a finer balance between color, variety, and structure. He wrote later in his 1881 lecture, Some hints on pattern designing, of the necessity \\"to mask the construction of our pattern enough to prevent people from counting the repeats of our pattern, while we manage to lull their curiosity to trace it out.\\" The purpose of a good pattern, he wrote, \\"was a look of satisfying mystery, which is essential in all patterned goods, and which must be done by the designer.\\" He added that \\"colour above all should be modest\\", since the wallpaper was part of the household, meant to be lived with and seen only in passing, not meant to attract attention to itself. During this period he created some of this most famous designs, creating an illusion of three dimension, with lavish flowers interwoven with a complex and lush background. His designs in this period included 'Larkspur' (1872), 'Jasmine' (1872), 'Willow' (1874), 'Marigold' (1875), 'Wreath' and 'Chrysanthemum' (both 1876). The Morris wallpapers were expensive to produce. A typical Morris wallpaper in the 1870s required as much as four weeks to manufacture, using thirty different printing blocks and fifteen separate colours. The celebrated acanthus design used The wallpapers of Morris were regarded as strange and excessive for most wealthy Victorians, who preferred the more geometric and traditional French styles The early clients of Morris his wallpapers were mostly his avant-garde artist friends His early designs were purchased by his close friend painter Edward Burne-Jones, and Punch cartoonist Edward Linley Sambourne. He also had as few avant-garde aristocratic clients, including the Earl and Countess of Carlisle, who used the 'Bird and Anemone' and two sunflower designs in their home at Castle Howard in Yorkshire.

In his wallpapers of this period, he reverted to more naturalistic themes, somewhat less three- dimensional than his earlier work, but with an exceptional harmony and rhythm, as in his designs Poppy (1885) and Acorn. In the 1880s, his work finally received royal attention: In 1880 he was asked to redecorate rooms St. James's Palace in London. He created a particularly complex design, named 'St. James's', which used sixty-eight separate printing blocks to make a section of two wallpaper widths, with a height 127 centimeters. In 1887 Queen Victoria again commissioned Morris & Company, this time to another special design for wallpaper at Balmoral Castle, based on the 'VRI' initials of the Queen. During this time, however, Morris was devoting more and more of his time to literary and political work. He also became increasingly involved in other media, especially textile and tapestry weaving. He relocated the workshops of his company to Merton Abbey in the 1880s to focus on these. He also began to create wallpapers with a single color, such as Acorn and Sunflower, which were much simpler and much less expsnsive to produce. Among his final wallpapers was the Red Poppy design.

He turned to a commercial company, Barrett of Bethnal Green, which made the first blocks for him in the traditional way from pearwood. For the printing, he turned to the firm of M.M. Jeffrey & Company of Islington, which eventually produced all of his papers. The technique used by Morris for making wallpaper was described in some detail in Arts and Crafts Essays by Members of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, including William Morris and his friend and collaborator Walter Crane published in 1893. The Chapter on wallpaper was written by Crane. According to Crane's description, the wallpapers of Morris were made using pieces of paper thirty-feet long and twenty-one inches wide. (French wallpaper was eighteen inches wide). The design therefore could not exceed twenty-one inches square, unless a double block was used. This was the greatest width for which the craftsman could comfortably handle and print the paper with a block. The block itself was made of wood. twenty-one inches wide. The design was first outlined on the block, and carved in wood, cutting sway everything except for the part of there design to be printed in one colour. Details and fine lines were reproduced with flat brass wires that were driven edgewise into the block. The pigments, made with natural ingredients, were mixed with sizing or a binder, and then put into shallow trays, called wells. The long papers were passed over on wooden rods overhead, with the section of paper to be printed placed flat on a table in front of the craftsman. One block was used for each colour. The typical Morris design used as many as twenty different colours, but some were more complex. The Saint James design (1881) required sixty-eight different blocks. The printer painted a pad with the first colour, then pressed the block down onto the pad to put the paint onto its surfaces. Then he moved the block to the paper and used a hand press to print the color onto the paper. The location of the block was marked precisely with pins, so all the colours would align. This process was repeated time after time for the length of the first paper. When the colour on the first sheet was dry, he took another block and printed the next colour over the first and so on, colour after colour, until the design was complete. Arts and Crafts Essays, by William Morris, Walter Crane, et al. (1893). Published on-line by Project Gutenberg Producing a single set of a wallpaper design with this process could often take as long as four weeks.  The Morris Style  in the 1850s, during the Victorian era Prior to Morris, most English wallpaper was inspired by the geometric and historical designs of Augustus Welby Pugin, who had created the neo-Gothic interiors of Westminster Palace, and Owen Jones, notable for his abstract geometric patterns. in s different direction, it was also strongly influenced by imitations of the colorful and highly ornate French wallpaper of the Napoleon III style. Morris's friend Walter Crane wrote, \\"...Mr William Morris has shown what beauty and character in pattern, and good and delicate choice of tint can do for us, giving in short a new impulse to design, a great amount of ingenuity and enterprise has been spent on wallpapers in England, and in the better minds a very distinct advance has been made upon the patterns of inconceivable hideousness, often of French origin, of the period of the Second Empire - a period which perhaps represents the most degraded level of taste in decoration generally.\\"Arts and Crafts Essays, by William Morris, Walter Crane, et al. (1893). Published on-line by Project Gutenberg Morris wrote that his object was to find the balance between color and variety on the one hand and structure. He declared in an 1881 essay, Some Hints on Pattern Designing of the need to \\"mask the construction of our pattern enough to prevent people from counting the repeats of our pattern, while we manage to lull their curiosity to trace it out.\\" The goal, he wrote, was \\"to attain a satisfying mystery, which is essential in all patterned goods, and which must be done by the designer.\\" He also declared that \\"colours of all things should be modest, designed to be seen only in passing, and not drawing attention to themselves.\\" Morris sought to depict nature, particularly the plants and flowers of England, without excessive naturalism. He placed his flowers and plants in series which were carefully created to be rhythmic and balanced, giving a sense of order and harmony. He did not want his wallpapers to be The Center of attention in a room. In the 1870s and 1880s his designs became denser, richer and more complex, but they preserved the sense of and harmony and equilibrium which he sought.  Associated artists  In later years the Morris style influenced and was adapted by the other designers who worked for Morris and Company. The most prominent were John Henry Dearle, who collaborated closely with Morris on many of his projects, and issued them under the name of Morris. He replaced Morris as chief designer of the company after the death of Morris. The sisters and designers Kate Faulkner and Lucy Faulkner Orrinsmith also collaborated with Morris, and adapted elements of his philosophy and style in their own work.

Bob Buck with a walrus moustache. Buck was the bushman who led the expedition to find Harold Lasseter in the Petermann Ranges.  Early life  Buck was born on 2 July 1881 in Alberton in South Australia and he is the son of Robert and Sarah Ann Buck. Buck was primarily self-educated and, until 1905, worked in and around Wallaroo until he joined his uncle Joseph Breaden to work in the Northern Territory.  Life in the Northern Territory  Buck's uncle owned Todmorden, Henbury and Idracowra stations in the Northern Territory and his brother Allan, also Buck's uncle, managed Idracowra Station. Working between these stations Buck learned bushmanship and worked as a stockman and saddler. In 1907 Buck overlanded 800 head of cattle from Brunette Downs Station to Henbury Station, a journey which due to severe drought took 10 months, where he became the manager. Around this period Buck partnered with Molly Tjalameinta, an Arrernte woman, and they had a daughter Ettie. Buck was well respected and fondly regarded by the Aboriginal people living nearby Henbury Station and it is said he treated them well and was generous with rations compared to his contemporaries. During this period Buck frequently made lengthy visits to Hermannsburg, which was a Lutheran Mission being run by Carl Strehlow, as his daughter Ettie was living, alongside Elsie Butler, there with missionaries Emil and Clara Munchenburg so that they could receive private tuition. Both girls where childhood friends of Ted Strehlow and Buck gifted Strehlow with a donkey called \\"possum\\" that would soon become a favourite pet. Buck always made his visits to Hermannsburg with Molly and many expected that the often puritanical Carl Strehlow would not approve of the pair as they were not legally married, however, he always welcomed them. Strehlow approved that Buck was faithful to Molly and looked after Ettie \\"like any other family man\\". In 1927 Buck left Henbury, and his uncles, and, in partnership with his long term friend Alf Butler (father of Elsie), leased Middleton Ponds Station which there two would manage together until 1939. During this period Buck was also contracted to assist explorer Donald Mackay complete aerial surveys of the Northern Territory and Western Australia by assisting on the ground and working with a team of Aboriginal men and camels; Buck and his team cleared aerodromes, left supplies, guided aeroplanes with smoke-signals and many other tasks. In February 1931 Buck, alongside Johnson Breaden, Lion and Billy Button and several other men, were commissioned to search for Lewis Harold Bell Lasseter and they found and buried his body. They completed their 1000 miles journey on camel. There was suspicion at the time that Buck had not actually found the body and this brought Buck to national attention and was even travelled to Sydney to be interviewed by the media.  Later life  In 1939 the Buck and Butler dissolved their partnership and Buck began managing Renner's Rock Station until he retired to Alice Springs in 1953. In Alice Springs Buck became an 'identity' at the Stuart Arms Hotel and he became a notorious yarn-spinner who told many tall stories. Buck died on 9 August 1960 and is buried at the Memorial Cemetery in Alice Springs.  Legacy  Buck Road in Ilparpa in Alice Springs and Lake Buck in the Tanami Desert are named for him. Buck also donated a photograph collection to the Northern Territory Archives Service (Libraries and Archives NT) containing photographic negatives and prints of the Hermannsburg and Finke regions (NTRS 1248).

Racing career 1995-2015: Early years and local success Bonafede began racing karts aged 5. He achieved early success, winning the 1997 Cadet Class Championship at only 7 years old. He took a one year hiatus from racing in 1998, but returned in 1999 to achieve a 4th place finish in the WTP South African Championship. He moved to the United Kingdom after this, competing in British karting events for the following two years. During the 2006 ROK World Karting Championships, Bonafede was the youngest competitor to take part. He was set to win the 2007 SA Karting Championship, but suffered a broken chain during the final round of the season. 2007 saw Bonafede move to saloon racing, joining the South African Volkswagen Polo Cup, achieving mild success with a podium finish and a pole position in his first season. He was also invited to partake in a round of the European Polo Cup and achieved a 9th place finish. Focusing on his matric examinations in 2008, he had to settle for a second place finish in the Polo Cup season that year, with 4 wins and 2 pole positions. He achieved another second place finish in the 2009 championship, with 3 wins and 4 pole positions. Bonafede joined the Bridgestone Production Car Championship in 2010, and raced in the series until it folded in 2015. He achieved relative success, with a third place finish in the 2012 and 2014 championships being the highlights of his stay. 2016-present: Sasol GTC and European debut After the Production Car Championship folded in 2015, Bonafede joined BMW for the inaugural season of the Sasol GTC Championship in 2016. He ended the season second in the championship, 111 points behind champion Michael Stephen. The 2017 season saw Bonafede start off strongly, leading the championship for over half the season, before falling short at the final round at Zwartkops Raceway, once again to Stephen. He ended the 2018 championship in third place, crashing out in the season finale and losing second in the standings to Simon Moss. 2019 would see Bonafede move on from Sasol GTC, finally pursuing a European career. He joined Boutsen Ginion Racing for two rounds of the 2019 Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup, finishing 46th overall and 8th in the Am-class at the 24 Hours of Spa. He finished 5th in the Pro Am-class (32nd overall) at the 3 Hours of Barcelona, ending the season 21st in the Pro Am-standings and 28th in the Am-standings. He also took part in two rounds of the 2019 Intercontinental GT Challenge, with the 24 Hours of Spa overlapping between the two championships. He secured a win in the Am- class at his home race at the 2019 Kyalami 9 Hours.

Winterstein has been heavily criticised in several South Pacific, and Australasian countries for her anti-vaccination rhetoric and her seminars have been called \\"irresponsible\\" by the Australian Medical Association and a \\"public health threat\\" by the Samoan Ministry of Health. She claims she has not encouraged non-vaccination, rather, \\"informed consent\\" and \\"freedom of choice\\".  Personal life  Winterstein was born in Samoa, and her hometown is Campbelltown, a suburb of Sydney, Australia. She is perhaps best known for being the partner of Australian rugby league player Frank Winterstein, who she married in 2013. The couple have two children and in late 2019 the family moved to Toulouse, France for two years. Her relationship with this prominent NRL star has allowed her to gain a substantial following as a social media influencer. She states there is a \\"strong core group\\" of anti-vaxxers in the NRL, but during the 2020 NRL season the Gold Coast Bulletin reported this wasn't the case as \\"most of the anti-vax players said they weren't really anti-vax but were still getting around to it\\".  Online influencer  Winterstein brands her website and internet influence business as the \\"Tay's Way Movement\\". As of December 2019, she had over 22,000 Instagram followers. Winterstein claims: \\"I know for a FACT there are MANY high profile, 'influencers' on social media among the sport and wellness industry, who do not vaccinate their children but won't publicly share their beliefs.\\" Online, Winterstein offers opinions on nutrition, medicine, home births, and the alleged dangers of 5G radiation and of vaccinating children. In one of her online programs (\\"An Hour of Power with Tay\\"), she asks her followers to \\"explore different options on how to build your child's immune system naturally\\". In March 2019, Instagram placed restrictions on her account and her social media accounts were restricted by Facebook in a crackdown to prevent dangerous and misinformed anti-vaccination messages. Winterstein's online group of followers have a history of online abuse toward journalists who report unfavourably on her. In 2019, The Australian newspaper suggested that Winterstein is getting traction with her health messages \\"because she's a WAG - the wife of an NRL player\\". Her current business 'Tay's Way Moment' was established in 2017, before this Winterstein operated a business called 'Taylor'd Tans'. Anti-vaccination activism Winterstein says that the \\"mainstream media constantly slander, dehumanise and degrade\\" anti-vaccine \\"footy wags\\" such as her. Despite having no degree or qualifications, she claims she has done her \\"own research on vaccines\\" on the internet, and that she had \\"vaccinated\\" her son \\"at least six times a day with breastmilk\\". Due to her belief that vaccinations cause allergies, Winterstein prefers to call herself an \\"ex-vaxxer,\\" and has chosen not to vaccinate her two boys, aged 10-months and 3-years old. In 2018, Winterstein was selected as the \\"Australian face\\" and ambassador of the second tour of the anti- vaccination film Vaxxed. British anti-vaccination campaigner Polly Tommey, one of the producers of the film, announced Winterstein and her twin sister Stevie Nupier would be the \\"glamorous, young, intelligent women to take on and lead the people of Australia\\". Winterstein said: \\"I've dedicated years into my own vaccine research, meeting with politicians, connecting with practitioners and listening to parents\\". Winterstein urges parents to question the safety of childhood vaccinations and says parents are being bullied and pressured by GPs to give their children vaccinations. She says she is a \\"big believer that you do not need a qualification to know how to critically think for yourself\\". Melbourne surgeon John Cunningham, who was awarded an Order of Australia for his work promoting vaccinations, said Winterstein represented the \\"sinister version of the modern mumtrepreneur\\". He said her efforts to hitch onto the anti-vaccination crowd were morally corrupt. Brad McKay, a Sydney GP, accuses her of propagating rumours and anti-science information. Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president Harry Nespolon suggested asking parents who they should turn to for health advice: \\"I would be asking people, who would they trust more with their child, their local doctor or a WAG\\". He also welcomed Twitter's plans to limit the impacts of misleading health information such as that disseminated by Winterstein. The treatments Winterstein recommends for curing measles showed an \\"utter absence of understanding of virology, pharmacology and biochemistry\\" according to UQ virologist Ian Mackay. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic Winterstein said the outbreak was a \\"planned scam\\", adding that the government was using the outbreak as a pretext to force vaccinations on adults, saying \\"they're already socially programming us to accept mass vaccination for when the time comes\\". She also believes that receiving the flu vaccine increases the risk of contracting coronavirus by 36 per cent, a coronavirus conspiracy theory that has been proven to be false.  Involvement in 2019 measles epidemic in Samoa  Samoan health officials and the World Health Organisation (WHO) blame unqualified figures such as Winterstein and the anti-vaccination movement for a decline in immunisation rates, which in turn caused the 2019 measles epidemic to be more severe and deadly. Winterstein blamed the Samoan government for the epidemic as she claims it did not distribute Vitamin A tablets to those who contracted the illness. At the time Samoa had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the world. During the vaccination crisis in June 2019, just months before the measles outbreak, Winterstein met with fellow anti-vaxxer Robert Kennedy Jr. in Samoa. Winterstein hails Kennedy as a hero, and of him has said: \\"I am deeply honoured to have been in the presence of a man I believe is, can and will change the course of history\\". US vaccine specialist and paediatrician Peter Hotez criticised the anti-vax movement targeting the small country saying: \\"We're going to see them continue this predatory behaviour, identifying communities, Island nations even whole countries in order to drive down vaccination coverage, so it's a very serious threat now to global public health.\\" Nikki Turner, director of the Immunisation Advisory Centre at the University of Auckland accused the anti- vaccine movement of ramping up their activity in Samoa when the vaccination rates had dropped, particularly on social media. She said: \\"Anti-vaxxers arrive in big numbers when there's concerns and lack of trust and the core of the problem that is happening in Samoa is lack of trust, lack of trust in vaccines in health service delivery.\\" Australian Medical Association New South Wales president Kean-Seng Lim criticised Winterstein's planned anti-vax workshop tour to Samoa saying: \\"To go to a third world country, to spread this in third world countries, is just irresponsible\\". \\"When you have a country which is full of small villages, it's actually hard to get out there and vaccinate people, and if you have someone who is making it even harder still, that makes it harder\\", he said. Samoan Ministry of Health Director-General Take Naseri described Winterstein's planned anti-vaccination seminar \\"Making Informed Choices\\" in Apia as a \\"public health threat\\". It was cancelled after the government backlash, but she continued to campaign online. Winterstein claimed she was not encouraging non-vaccination, but rather, \\"informed consent, freedom of choice and vaccine injury awareness\\". Medical experts warned that the deadly measles outbreak in Samoa is a sign of the expansion of an increasingly predatory anti-vaccination movement. A measles outbreak was declared on 16 October and led to the Samoan government declaring a state of emergency on 15 November 2019 and to the introduction of an emergency mandatory vaccination strategy. Under the emergency measures children and adults were obliged to vaccinate, while kindergartens, schools and the university were closed, and unvaccinated pregnant women were barred from attending work. With assistance from overseas, the government began a mass vaccination campaign. To assist in the mass vaccination measures, Samoa's prime minister decreed that citizens \\"tie a red cloth or red flag in front of their houses and near the road to indicate that family members have not been vaccinated\\". After the outbreak, the anti-vax activists doubled-down on social media, and the Samoan government met resistance from anti-vaxxers to its emergency strategy, notably from Winterstein. Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccinologist at the University of Auckland, condemned those anti-vaxxers involved saying: \\"In a sense it's a pro-death movement\\", adding that \\"We've got children dying and people are actively trying to stop people becoming vaccinated, and that vaccination is what's going to prevent more deaths.\\" Winterstein likened the emergency mandatory vaccination strategy introduced after the outbreak to Nazi Germany, saying Samoa is \\"in violation of the Nuremberg Code\\" by enforcing mandatory immunisation, and posted a #NaziSamoa hashtag on social media. On social media she also said: \\"Facism [sic] is well and truly alive in Samoa\\", also noting \\"ambulances doing drive-bys to find children who are unvaccinated\\". Winterstein claimed Samoan children infected with measles were making a full recovery after using \\"simple and effective protocols\\" adding that \\"the media are still trying to rubbish and debunk\\". She was critical of the current medical treatment of antibiotics and acetaminophen being given, recommending vitamin A tablets for those with measles instead. Immunologist Nikki Turner said vitamin A could be used as part of treatment, but it is no cure. The Samoan Government ordered anti-vaccination advocates such as Winterstein to stop discouraging people from seeking vaccination, with the Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi suggesting imprisonment for anti-vaccination advocates. Samoa's Attorney-General Lemalu Hermann Retzlaff also warned against discouraging the vaccinations. He said \\"Samoan Law enforcement is open to receiving notice, complaints, or evidence of any person... discouraging or going as far as preventing our community from vaccination\\". On 6 December, Samoan anti-vaxxer, Edwin Tamasese, was charged with \\"incitement against a government order\\". Winterstein supports the traditional healer as a \\"true hero\\" calling him the \\"hero on the ground\\". As of late December, there were 83 deaths and 5,700 confirmed cases of measles out of a Samoan population of 201,000. Almost three per cent of the population had been infected. The majority of those who had died were children under the age of five and infants.  Workshops and life-coaching programs  Winterstein is a self-proclaimed \\"Integrative Nutrition Health Coach\\", and runs workshops such as \\"Making Informed Choices\\" which costs A$200 per person. She promotes scepticism about vaccinating children while raising fears about so-called \\"vaccine injuries\\". In an attempt to counter the Australian state and federal no-jab, no-play laws, the workshops also canvass anti-vaxxer parents' options for daycare and preschool. Winterstein has been critical of those who say they cannot afford the workshop entry fee, suggesting to followers; \\"if a money block is coming up for you, I invite you to explore that a little deeper and reflect on those limiting beliefs.\\" Winterstein also presented at the 2019 Canberra Vaccination Conference, an anti-vaccination event, alongside other renowned anti-vaxxers such as Judy Wilyman and Michael O'Neill from IMOP, an Australian anti-vax/anti-fluoride political party. In 2019, Winterstein had planned tours of Samoa, New Zealand and Australia,, but the Samoan and New Zealand legs of the tour were cancelled with Winterstein blaming \\"organised groups ... working hard to sabotage\\" her. An online petition was organised to stop Winterstein's tour of New Zealand.  Alfa PXP Royale  Winterstein used her website to sell Alfa PXP Royale (PXP), ground- up purple rice grown in Thailand. The website for the company that produces PXP, Enzacta, claims several health benefits for their product, including that it can help with pain, migraines, autism, improve eyesight and wrinkles. Other unsubstantiated medical claims have been made regarding PXP, including that it neutralises free radicals, incorrectly claimed to be the root of cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, stroke and diabetes. Melbourne surgeon John Cunningham said PXP was essentially ground-up rice that might as well come from a kitchen pantry, saying: \\"I don't think giving people like that false hope and making money from it is acceptable.\\" Winterstein sold PXP for up to $1000 a kilogram, whereas purple rice, which is the same as black rice, can be purchased from supermarkets for around $10 a kilogram. Customers could get a discount on PXP if they signed up to sell the product, also giving them the prospect of bonuses and luxury rewards. Enzacta, the company behind PXP, lists its office as a postbox in Wyoming, USA which is also a depot for hundreds of other businesses. An Enzacta salesperson in New Zealand stated it was a multi-level marketing company. In March 2019, Winterstein announced that she was no longer selling PXP to focus on her workshops. Following a report on Winterstein by the Australian television program A Current Affair, the product was removed from sale from her website.

Brief history In 1959, with Sukarno's guided democracy policies now in force, the National Armed Forces considered making a historic decision to finally enlist women to serve in its ranks. For many years before, during and after the Indonesian National Revolution, many women fought as either individual rebels or as part of rebel formations that fought for Indonesia's independence from the rule of the Dutch and many women had even made societal advances for various causes, including feminism and the economic and social scene. The rights of women were one of the many rights fought for by the pioneer generations of Indonesian nationalists. For these reasons and others, Colonel Dr. Sumarno, then assistant chief of staff of personnel of the Indonesian Army, conveyed his ideas of the service of women for certain fields of assignment that required precision, perseverance, patience, and maternal qualities that became the nature of women to better achieve organizational affiliation within the ranks of the regular Army and in the reserves. On 21 December 1960, by virtue of General Orders No.1056/12/1960 by the Commander of the National Armed Forces and Minister of Defense, General Abdul Haris Nasution, who was also then concurrently the chief of staff of the Army, the Women's Army Corps was officially created as a specialty arm of the Army for the volunteer service of women in military service as officers, warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and enlisted servicewomen, making Indonesia one of the first Southeast Asian countries to admit women for volunteer military service in the military.https://pewarta.co/news/medan/peringati-hut-ke-58-korps-kowad-kodam- i-bb-gelar-donor-darah Because December 22, 1938, the date now held as Mother's Day, was the day of the First Women's Congress that was held in Indonesian territory (then the Netherlands East Indies) in 1938, it was later designated as the official Corps Day, honoring the military mothers and women who through their works and actions not just ensured the independence and sovereignty of the Republic against foreign aggression, but also contributed to her defense, stability, progress and prosperity in all works of endeavor regardless of their religion, ethnic origin and way of life, including as servicewomen in the ranks of the Army. On October 5, 1963, the KOWAD made its first public appearance as part of the Indonesian National Armed Forces Day celebrations held at the Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex grounds. Many of the first ever women to march past in a national parade were veterans of the recently concluded Operation Trikora, wherein personnel of the Corps were deployed as part of the combat and service support units forward deployed to West Papua to fight against the Armed forces of the Netherlands. To this day, the presence of the Women's Army Corps in major ceremonies of the armed forces, including on Army Day, December 15, has indeed been positive among the general public, given the government's efforts to ensure that the Indonesian woman's role in national defense will be always maintained.

First commissioned in 1924, she served in the waters of Japan prior to World War II. During World War II, she operated in the Central Pacific and took part in the Aleutian Islands campaign, then in late 1942 was relegated to a role as a training ship and tender for midget submarines. After the war ended in 1945, she surrendered to the Allies, who scuttled her in 1946. Design and description The submarines of the Type L4 sub-class were copies of the Group 3 subclass of the British L-class class submarine built under license in Japan.Chesneau, Roger, ed., Conway′s All the World′s Fighting Ships 1922–1946, New York: Mayflower Books, 1980, , p. 203. They were slightly larger and had two more torpedo tubes than the preceding submarines of the L3 subclass. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long and had a beam of and a draft of . They had a diving depth of . For surface running, the submarines were powered by two Vickers diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged, each propeller was driven by an electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, they had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . The submarines were armed with six internal torpedo tubes, all in the bow, and carried a total of twelve 6th Year Type torpedoes. They were also armed with a single deck gun and a 6.5 mm machine gun. Construction and commissioning Ro-63 was laid down as Submarine No. 84 on 2 April 1923 by Mitsubishi at Kobe, Japan. Launched on 24 January 1924, she was renamed Ro-63 on 1 November 1924 while fitting out. She was completed and commissioned on 20 December 1924. Service history Pre-World War II Upon commissioning, Ro-63 was attached to the Maizuru Naval District and assigned to Submarine Division 33. On 1 June 1925, she was transferred to the Sasebo Naval District and reassigned to Submarine Division 24, in which she remained until 1939. Submarine Division 24 was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 1 in the 1st Fleet in the Combined Fleet on 1 December 1925. On 1 March 1926, Ro-63 and the submarines , , , , , and departed Sasebo, Japan, bound for Okinawa, which they reached the same day. The eight submarines got underway from Okinawa on 30 March 1926 for a training cruise in Chinese waters off Shanghai and Amoy which concluded with their arrival at Mako off Formosa on 5 April 1926. They departed Mako on 20 April 1926 for the return leg of their training cruise, operating off China near Chusan Island, then returned to Sasebo on 26 April 1926. On 27 March 1927, Ro-60, Ro-61, Ro-62, Ro-63, and Ro-64 departed Saeki Bay, Japan, for a training cruise off Tsingtao, China, which they concluded with their arrival at Sasebo, Japan, on 16 May 1927. On 10 December 1928, Submarine Division 24 was transferred back to the Sasebo Naval District and began service in the Sasebo Defense Division. Ro-63 was decommissioned on 10 March 1929 and placed in reserve at Maizuru, but was recommissioned on 29 June 1929. While proceeding to Sasebo, Japan, on 13 November 1929 after conducting diving exercises with Ro-64, Ro-63 collided off Sasebo with the small Japanese motor vessel , suffering minor damage to her starboard bow. Submarine Division 24 returned to duty in Submarine Squadron 1 in the 1st Fleet on 30 November 1929. It transferred back to the Sasebo Naval District on 1 December 1930 and began a stint in the Sasebo Defense Division on 1 December 1931. Ro-63 again was decommissioned on 1 December 1932 and placed in reserve at Maizuru. Ro-63 was recommissioned on 20 March 1934, resuming active service in Submarine Division 24, which by then was assigned to the Sasebo Guard Squadron in the Sasebo Naval District. The division′s service in the Sasebo Guard Squadron ended on 15 November 1934, after which it was assigned directly to the Sasebo Naval District until 1 December 1936, when it was assigned to the Sasebo Defense Squadron. It resumed its direct assignment to the Sasebo Naval District on 1 January 1938. Ro-63 was transferred to Submarine Division 33 on either 1 September or 15 November 1938, according to different sources, for service at the submarine school at Kure, Japan. On 15 November 1939, Submarine Division 33 was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 7 in the 4th Fleet in the Combined Fleet. When the Imperial Japanese Navy deployed for the upcoming conflict in the Pacific, Ro-63 was at Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands. She received the message \\"Climb Mount Niitaka 1208\\" () from the Combined Fleet on 2 December 1941, indicating that war with the Allies would commence on 8 December 1941 Japan time, which was on 7 December 1941 on the other side of the International Date Line in Hawaii. World War II =Central Pacific= Ro-63 was with the other submarines of Submarine Division 33 — Ro-64 and — at Kwajalein when Japan entered World War II on 8 December 1941, Kwajalein time. That day, she got underway to conduct a reconnaissance of Howland Island. She sighted an enemy plane northwest of Howland on 12 December, reconnoitered Howland on 14 and 15 December, and returned to Kwajalein on 19 December 1941. Ro-63 departed Kwajalein on 7 January 1942 and called at Truk in the Caroline Islands from 11 to 15 January before getting back underway in company with Ro-64 and Ro-68 to conduct a reconnaissance of Rabaul on New Britain in the Admiralty Islands. She then patrolled south of Cape St. George on New Ireland before returning to Truk on 29 January 1942. Ro-63, Ro-64, and Ro-68 left Truk on 18 February 1942, called at Ponape from 23 to 24 February, and then set out for the Marshall Islands area. During their voyage, however, Ro-63′s horizontal rudder failed on 27 February 1942, and she proceeded to Bikini Atoll for repairs in company with Ro-64. The two submarines reached Bikini on 28 February 1942. They got back underway on 1 March 1942, but Ro-63′s jury-rigged rudder quickly broke again and she turned back to Bikini while Ro-64 proceeded independently. On 2 March 1942, she departed Bikini to head for Japan for repairs, calling along the way at Ponape from 5 to 7 March 1942, at Truk from 9 to 19 March 1942, and at Saipan in the Mariana Islands from 22 to 26 March 1942 before arriving at Maizuru on 3 April 1942. After her repairs were completed, Ro-63 departed Maizuru on 5 June 1942, arrived at Saipan on 13 June, and then made for Truk. Recalled to Japan, she departed Truk on 27 June 1942 bound for Yokosuka, Japan, which she reached on 4 July 1942. =Aleutian Islands campaign= On 14 July 1942, Submarine Division 33 was reassigned to the 5th Fleet for service in the Aleutian Islands, where the Aleutian Islands campaign had begun in June 1942 with the Japanese occupation of Attu and Kiska. At 16:00 on 24 July 1942, Ro-63, Ro-64, and Ro-68 departed Yokosuka bound for Paramushiro in the northern Kurile Islands. Ro-64 was forced to return to Yokosuka when food poisoning broke out among her crew, but Ro-63 and Ro-68 pressed on and arrived at Paramushiro on 29 July 1942. Ro-63 and Ro-68 put to sea again on 31 July 1942 to head for Kiska, which they reached on 4 August 1942. Thereafter, they were based there along with the submarines , Ro-61, Ro-62, Ro-64, , and . On 7 August 1942, an American task force bombarded Kiska while I-6, Ro-61, Ro-64, and Ro-68 were anchored in the harbor, and they crash-dived to avoid damage. Between 8 and 10 August 1942, Ro-61, Ro-63, Ro-64, and Ro-68 sought to intercept the American ships, but failed to find them. From 11 to 13 August 1942, Ro-63 participated with Ro-64 in a search for the crew of a ditched reconnaissance plane, and Ro-63 subsequently conducted patrols off the Aleutians from her base at Kiska from 17 to 20 August, 28 to 30 August, 3 to 5 September, and 6 to 11 September 1942. On 14 September 1942, Ro-63 was anchored at Kiska when American aircraft raided the base. She submerged to avoid attack, but a bomb a United States Army Air Forces Eleventh Air Force B-24 Liberator dropped nonetheless damaged one of her periscopes while she was underwater. Submarine Division 33 was attached directly to the 51st Base Unit at Kiska on 15 September 1942, and Ro-63 carried out another Aleutians patrol from 22 to 24 September 1942. While Ro-63 was at Kiska on 25 September 1942, Submarine Division 33 was reassigned to the Kure Naval District. Ro-63, Ro-64, and Ro-68 departed Kiska on 26 September 1942 bound for Maizuru, where they arrived on 5 October 1942. =Training and tender duties= Ro-63 departed Maizuru on 6 November 1942 and arrived at Kure on 8 November 1942. Thereafter, Submarine Division 33 was assigned to training duties in the Kure Naval District. It was assigned to the Kure Submarine Squadron on 1 December 1943. On 28 March 1945, Ro-63 was selected for conversion to a tender for Type D (Kōryū) midget submarines based on Amami Ōshima in the Amami Islands. After completion of a makeshift conversion at the Kure Naval Arsenal that included the installation of a Type 96 25 mm anti-aircraft gun and a radar detector, Ro-63 departed Kure on 8 April 1945, stopped at Sasebo, and then got underway from Sasebo on 10 April 1945 bound for Amami Ōshima. She arrived at Koniya on Amami Ōshima on 13 April 1945 and unloaded her cargo of torpedoes and spare parts. Continual Allied air attacks forced her to remain submerged on the harbor bottom at Koniya by day and surface only at night to perform her tender duties during darkness. On 29 April 1945, she received orders to return to Sasebo. After loading a cargo of sugar at Kasari Bay on Amami Ōshima on 30 April, Ro-63 headed for Sasebo, which she reached on 3 May 1945. After her arrival at Sasebo, Ro-63 was drydocked until mid-May 1945, when she proceeded to Ōtake, Japan, to resume her training activities at the submarine school there. She was at Maizuru when hostilities between Japan and the Allies ended on 15 August 1945. She subsequently surrendered to Allied forces. Disposal The Japanese struck Ro-63 from the Navy list on 20 November 1945. Allied forces scuttled her in the Iyo Nada in the Seto Inland Sea in May 1946.

(TT) is an East Timorese telecommunications company, based in the national capital Dili. The company originally had a state monopoly on telecommunications in East Timor. The monopoly was lifted by the government in 2010 in response to overwhelming public opinion in favour of liberalisation. Shareholdings , the largest shareholder of the company (54.01%) was Telecomunicações Públicas de Timor, S.A. (TPT), which was controlled by Investel Communications, a Brazilian company owned by Timorese businessman , with partners and capital from the Middle East and China. The shareholders of TPT were Investel (76%), the Harii Foundation – Sociedade para o Desenvolvimento de Timor-Leste (linked to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Baucau) (18%), and Fundação Oriente (6%). Investel held a further 3.05% of TT via another company, PT Participações SGPS, S.A. The remaining shareholders in TT were the State of Timor-Leste (20.59%), VDT Holding Limited, a Macau-based company (17.86%) and East Timorese businessman Júlio Alfaro (4.49%). History In September 1999, the telecommunications infrastructure in East Timor was destroyed during the crisis following the East Timorese independence referendum. In 2001, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) launched an international tender for the construction of a replacement telecommunications system. The new network was to be operated according to a concession agreement as a BOT (Build–operate–transfer) arrangement. In July 2002, the Timor Telecom consortium (led by Portugal Telecom) was awarded the tender. On 17 October 2002, the Timor Telecom consortium was transformed into Timor Telecom, S.A., the first corporation to be formed in the newly independent East Timor. Under the concession agreement, TT was granted a monopoly on telecommunications in East Timor for a term of 15 years. By 1 March 2003, the company had created East Timor's first national telecommunications network, and set up its country code, +670. On that day, the company began operating the network in Dili, Lospalos, Baucau and Oecusse. By the end of 2003, landline, mobile and internet services were available on the network, and the company had opened its first store in Dili. The following year, the company started operating a telecommunications station on Atauro, and opened stores in Baucau and Gleno. In 2005, further stores followed in Maliana, Suai and Pante Macassar. In 2006, independent East Timor's first phone book appeared. The following year, 2007, the first yellow pages were published (also online) and voice mail was first offered. By 2008, the company had 125,000 mobile customers. In 2009, it engaged ZTE, a Chinese equipment supplier, to expand its mobile telecommunications system and establish Wideband CDMA. In March 2010, the East Timorese government approved a new telecommunications policy, under which telecommunications would be liberalised. TT's monopoly was to be ended in response to overwhelming public opinion in favour of liberalisation, and in line with developments in the European Union and other countries in the Pacific such as South Korea. In 2012, the government and the company signed an agreement for the early end of the monopoly. On 2 October 2013, Portugal Telecom and Oi, S.A., a Brazilian telecommunications company, announced that they would combine operations to form a new Brazil-based business. In 2015, the merged company's assets in Portugal were sold to Altice[ISIN: LU1014539529] to reduce debt; the merged company retained its interests in TT. In June 2016, Oi filed for a 19 billion (65 billion) bankruptcy protection, the largest on record for Brazil. In December 2016, Oi sought approval from a Rio de Janeiro district court to sell its stake in TT to Investec, and in March 2017 the court gave its approval, subject to an assessment that the amount Investec had offered was appropriate. Meanwhile, TT, now operating under the new liberalised telecommunications policy, expanded its range of services and steeply reduced its prices. In 2013, it introduced three new customer plans, completed the renovation of all of its existing stores, and opened a new call centre at .

The DGVG is headed by a Delegate of the Government, a civil servant with the rank of director- general appointed by the Monarch with the advice of the Minister of the Equality. The Government Delegation is structured through a central organization integrated by two deputy directorates-general and a decentralized network of gender violence units. The Delegation of the Government manages the national registers of gender violence victims; the women register was created in 2003 and the childs register in 2013. Since its creation, it has recorded more than 1,030 women and 34 minors murdered in this kind of violence.  History  The Government Delegation for Gender Violence was first devised in 2004 during the first term of prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. During this term, Zapatero's government proposed and the parliament approved the Organic Act 1/2004, of 28 December, on Integral Protection Measures Against Gender Violence, a law that in its section 29 foresaw a Special Government Delegation against Violence against Women integrated in the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. The Delegation was officially created on March 4, 2005. The organ was granted the rank of directorate-general and its first holder was Encarnación Orozco, a Labour Law expert and Socialist Parliamentary Group's Legal Cabinet advisor. As such, she took part in the drafting of the Act against Gender Violence. In the second term of Zapatero's premiership, in 2008, the unit was renamed Government Delegation for Gender Violence and it was transferred to the Ministry of Equality. It was endowed with two deputy directorates-general, one for Planning and Inter-institutional Coordination and other for Preventing and Managing of Gender Violence Knowledge. However, in 2010, due to the economic crisis, the Equality Ministry was dismantled and its responsibilities were assumed by the newly created Secretariat of State for Equality, a component of the Ministry of Health, Social Policy and Equality. In 2018, the Secretariat of State and its units were transferred to the Ministry of the Presidency, Relations with the Cortes and Equality due to the great importance that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Presidency, Carmen Calvo, gives to equality policies since she, within the Socialist Party, was the maximum person in charge of these responsibilities.  Government Delegates  In accordance with the Organic Act on Integral Protection Measures Against Gender Violence which creates this organ, its holder is entitled before the courts of justice to intervene in defense of the rights and interests protected in said law in collaboration and coordination with the Administrations with competence in the field. Since 2005, this has been the holders of the office: * Encarnación Orozco (2005–2008) * Miguel Lorente Acosta (2008–2011) * Blanca Hernández (2011–2017) * María José Ordóñez (2017–2018) * Pilar Llop (2018–2019) * Rebeca Palomo Díaz (2019–2020) * Victoria Rosell (2020–)  Organization chart  The following units depend on the Government Delegation: * The Deputy Directorate-General for Sensitization, Prevention and Knowledge of Gender Violence, to which corresponds the exercise of the functions of social awareness and the prevention of all forms of violence against women. It also administers the gender violence data provided by the different administrations as well as manages the national registers of victims.When a woman is murdered in Spain for gender violence, it is normal to see official buildings with half-mast flags, 2017. * The Deputy Directorate General for Inter-Institutional Coordination in Gender Violence, to which corresponds the exercise of the functions of impulse of the application of the principle of transversality of the measures destined to fight against the different forms of violence against women, ensuring that, in its application, the specific needs and demands of the victims are taken into account.

Today the regiment is administratively assigned to the army's Engineer Command and NATO's only unit capable of railway construction and operation.  History   Formation  During the American Civil War Union railway troops built of railroad and of railroad bridges. The usefulness of these troops was noted in the Kingdom of Italy and on 30 September 1873 the Italian defense minister Cesare Ricotti-Magnani ordered that each of the two engineer regiments of the Royal Italian Army was to form two railway construction companies and three railroad operations companies. On 2 July 1895 these railway companies were combined in the battalion-sized Railway Brigade, which consisted of four railway construction companies and two railroad operations companies. In October 1910 the brigade was elevated to regiment with the following structure: * Railway Engineer Regiment , in Turin ** I Railway Engineer Battalion ** II Railway Engineer Battalion ** Transport Battalion ** Railway Operations Section ** Turin Depot ** Rome Depot One of the companies assigned to the new regiment, the 6th Diggers Company of the 2nd Engineer Regiment, had distinguished itself during crossing of the Macerone pass on 20 October 1860 during the Third Italian War of Independence and arrived with a Bronze Medal of Military Valour, which was affixed to the flag of the newly raised regiment.  World War I  During World War I the regiment mobilized two more railway engineer battalions, twelve railway construction companies, one railway operations battalion, four decauville companies, and 177 photoelectric sections, which operated searchlights along the Italian Front. During the conflict the regiment's units built of railway, of decauville trench railways and 144 bridges. The regiment began to operate the Chivasso–Ivrea–Aosta railway in 1915 and after World War I it also began to operate the Bolzano- Meran-Mals railway in the newly annexed province of South Tyrol.  World War II  During World War II the regiment mobilized 13 railway engineer battalions and three railroad operation battalions. The battalions saw service in Libya and Tunisia during the Western Desert Campaign and Tunisian Campaign, in Southern Ukraine as part of the Italian Expeditionary Corps in Russia, in Yugoslavia, Albania, Greece and France. In 1941 the 9th Company of the IV Railway Engineer Battalion built a combined road and rail bridge over the Corinth Canal, using an Austrian Roth-Waagner-Brückengerät. The same battalion repaired the bridge over the Gorgopotamos river after the British-Greek Operation Harling had successfully destroyed the bridge on 25 November 1942. Another bridge repaired by the regiment's troops was the Stampetta Bridge in Slovenia. The regiment's I Railway Engineer Battalion served in Ukraine and Russia, where during the Battle of Arbuzovka the battalion fought in the frontline as infantry, earning a War Cross of Military Valour. After Italy changed sides with the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943 and the regiment and its battalions were disbanded by the Germans.  Cold War  On 15 December 1949 the I Railway Engineer Battalion was reformed as part of the 2nd Bridge Engineer Regiment. On 1 January 1954 the I Railway Battalion became an autonomous unit and the process of reforming the Railway Engineer Regiment began. On 1 October 1957 the regiment was officially reformed with the following structure: * Railway Engineer Regiment , in Turin ** Command Company ** I Railway Engineer Battalion, in Castel Maggiore ** II Bridge Engineer Battalion, in Legnago ** Railway Operations Company On 1 January 1962 the regiment received the VI Army Corps Engineer Battalion in Bologna and on 1 February 1964 the II Bridge Engineer Battalion returned to the 2nd Bridge Engineer Regiment. On 1 July 1965 the Railway Operations Company was elevated to II Railway Engineer Battalion (Operations). The battalion returned to operate the Chivasso–Ivrea–Aosta railway in 1949. With the 1975 army reform the VI Army Corps Engineer Battalion was disbanded on 31 October 1975. On 8 October 1977 floodwaters of the Toce river swept the railway bridge of the Domodossola–Milan railway between Fondotoce and Feriolo away and the Railway Engineer Regiment was called up to rebuild the bridge. On 27 May 1978 the new bridge was opened and traffic between Milan and the Simplon Railway could resume. For its work the regiment was awarded a Bronze Cross of Army Merit.  Recent times  After the Bosnian War the regiment was deployed from 1996 to 1998 to Bosnia-Herzegovina to repair the long Novi Grad–Bosanska Otoka–Martin Brod–Strmica railway in Northern Bosnia, which was heavily damaged during the war. For its service in Bosnia-Herzegovina the regiment was awarded a Silver Medal of Army Valour. On 1 December 1997 the regiment passed from the Tuscan-Emilian Military Region to the army's Engineer Grouping, which on 10 September 2010 became the Engineer Command. In July 1999 after the Kosovo War the regiment was deployed to Kosovo, where the regiment operated the Skopje–Kosovo Polje–Pristina railway, and repaired/operated the Kosovo Polje–Peć and Klina–Prizren railways. The regiment returned to Italy in December 1999. For its service in Kosovo the regiment was awarded a Gold Cross of Army Merit. In 2001 the regiment ceded the operation of the Chivasso–Ivrea–Aosta railway to the Ferrovie dello Stato and on 1 February 2002 the regiment activated the Operations Battalion in Ozzano Emilia, which received some of the troops and equipment of the 2nd Railway Engineer Battalion (Operations) in Turin, before the latter disbanded on 31 August of the same year and reformed as 32nd Engineer Battalion the next day. The new Operations Battalion was disbanded on 31 October 2017 and its functions and personnel merged into the 1st Railway Engineer Battalion.

He was the chief librarian of the Prague Jewish community in the inter-war period, and the professional manager of the Jewish Museum in Prague during the Nazi Occupation. He was deported to the Auschwitz death camp in the fall of 1944 and exterminated there along with his wife. His nephew (the son of his oldest brother – Joel Julius Jakobovits), Lord Dr. Israel Immanuel Jakobovits (8 February 1921 – 31 October 1999) became the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth between 1967 and 1991.  Biography  alt= Tobias Jakobovits was born on 23 November 1887 in Lakompak, in what was then western Hungary and today is known as Lackenbach in Austria. He was one of the children of the Rabbi Shlomo (Solomon) Jakobovits and his wife Amalia (née Schwartz). Tobias was privileged to receive both a religious and secular education simultaneously in accordance with the cultural state of central Europe at that time. He studied first in the Bratislava Yeshiva (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, today the capital of Slovakia) and completed his rabbinical studies at the Berlin Seminar. In 1912 he settled in Prague and was employed as the assistant to the head librarian of the Jewish community. In 1917 he served as the chief rabbi of the Michle Quarter that was then known as Quarter 4 in the city. Concurrently, he continued his studies. He studied Semitic philology at the Charles University (German University) in Prague (named after Archduke Karl Ferdinand of Austria) and completed his doctoral thesis about the subject \\"The Messianic Concept in the Talmud\\" in 1920. The year 1922 was a watershed year in the life of Tobias Jakobovits for a few reasons. He was granted Czechoslovakian citizenship, was promoted to the position of head librarian of the Jewish community in Prague and also got married. He married Bertha Petuchowski, the daughter of the Rabbi Petuchowski, who was the instructor of Tobias at the Berlin Seminar. In 1924 their firstborn son, Yoseph Jakobovits was born. Two years later their second son, Moshe (Manfred) Jakobovits, was born. At the same time, Tobias was active in the Council of Rabbis of Bohemia and also worked as an instructor for religious studies at German Jewish schools. In the year 1928 he discontinued his position as the rabbi in Prague but for the next two years he fulfilled the position of rabbi, cantor and religious school teacher in the small town of Uhlířské Janovice, in proximity to Prague. During this period, he published many research articles about the genealogy and history of Czech Jews. Under his leadership, the library engaged in collecting rare holy books and manuscripts dealing with subjects pertaining to Judaism and the history of Czech Jews. He was the first to manually catalogue all the books and manuscripts that were found in the library. In this endeavor of extensive revising his comprehensive knowledge of the general history of the Jews and his mastery of additional foreign languages and literature is quite apparent. During the second half of the 1930s the shadow of the approaching war began to affect the family of Tobias Jakobovits. In the middle of 1939, Jakobovits sent his firstborn son, Joseph, to the Land of Israel (Mandatory Palestine) and then a few months later also sent his younger son, Moshe. He fulfilled his position as the head librarian of the Jewish community until 1939. After the conquest and occupation of the city by the Nazis in March 1939 the library was closed, but Jakobovits continued to be employed by the Jewish community as the archiver and researcher. Despite the fact that he was offered a position as an historian in the United States, Jakobovits preferred to stay in Prague and contribute his knowledge in the occupied city. In 1942 Jakobovits was added to the team of the Jewish Museum in Prague under the Nazi occupation as an expert in history and ancient manuscripts. He became the professional manager of the museum, and despite the fact that Joseph Polak created the concept of the museum, the official responsibility for the running of the museum was predicated on Jakobovits. The Nazis planned on turning the museum into \\"The Central Museum for the Exterminated Jewish Race\\"https://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%201880.pdf and to present it before the Aryan race. To execute this purpose, they concentrated in the museum a variety of many Jewish treasures that were plundered by them from all around Nazi-occupied Europe. Jakobovits and his colleagues engaged in sorting out hundreds of thousands of Jewish items – holy items, books, handwritten documents and manuscripts –- that arrived from all over Europe. Jakobovits was the curator of the first exhibition that took place under Nazi occupation in the Great Synagogue of Prague in October 1942. The exhibition was based upon the project which he himself instituted in 1927 and included rare Jewish and Hebrew books and manuscripts. It is important to mention that Hans Günther, the head of the \\"Central Office for Jewish Emigration\\" (German: Zentralstelle für judische Auswanderung), who was the supervisor of the activity of the museum, refused to include in the exhibition articles that were presented before the war that reflected the sedate life and cooperation between the Jews and the German nation. In the years 1942 to 1944 Jakobovits participated in a discussion regarding the renovation of the Old New Synagogue (Czech: Staronová synagoga; German: Altneu-Synagoge), also called the Altneuschul, situated in Josefov, Prague, which was Europe's oldest active synagogue and transforming it to be part of the museum. He demanded that anything that was connected to the synagogue had to be removed. In 1943, he participated in the writing of a guidebook to the central Jewish museum and in this work he described the history of the synagogues in which was located the Jewish museum. Jakobovits maintained an optimistic attitude regarding the fate of the Jews who were deported by the Nazis to camps in the east and expressed his hope that the purpose of the museum would be to preserve the Jewish items during the war and until these items would be returned to their rightful owners and the Jewish communities throughout Europe.

It is located in the Tuaran District of the West Coast Division of Sabah, Malaysia. The Tenghilan area is centered around a small town of the same name located near the road that connects Kota Kinabalu and Kota Belud. In 2010, its population was estimated at 203 inhabitants, mostly of Kadazan-Dusun origin. The town, which covers about 400 hectares of land, is located about 17 km northeast of Tuaran, and 25 km southwest of Kota Belud. Tenghilan hosts a commercial district established in 1930 by British colonial authorities. Businesses in this area were developed by the Chinese and Kadazan-Dusun communities. Currently, the majority of the town’s businesses are located on 8 rows of shops and are Chinese-owned. Recently, several two- story units have been built for commercial use.  Etymology  Tenghilan's trade and economic centralization began in Kampong Pengalan, as the Pengalan river was the heart of transportation. Most of the residents there are from Kadazan-Dusun origin, a people who carry out agricultural activities as the main activity of the village. According to community sources living in the village of Tenghilan, the first settlement of Tenghilan was established in Pengkalan (Pengalan) near Kampong Bunga, happening before the founding of Tenghilan itself. At that time, most of the population of Tenghilan was Christian. As a result, during colonial rule, many British missionaries traveled to Tenghilan to assist the poor community. The village of Tenghilan is situated on relatively flat, forested terrain. The Tenghilan community has therefore made the area around the Manggilan tree a place for daily activities such as making fishing gear (Bubu, Gagan, Siud, and Gapas), Nurod (baskets for paddy fields), and twisting the buffalo rope made from Timbangan tree. The community making plowing tools is known as Raradu (made from wood) and Surud (made from bamboo). They also make Binidang and Kobog by twisting the yarn (Costume jewelry used during the Kaamatan Festival or the ceremony of marriage) to be sheaths, making pants from plants known as Lamba, Parangi, and Gapas, weaving Rindiog and dye Rindang from the wooden Penuhu skin. The community activity also pounded the rice around the Manggilan tree. Tangkob is paddy storage called in Dusun language and, Tangkob is a high the same as an adult and large waist, placed under the tree of Manggilan. According to the story, before the villagers begin their journey to Mindahu (to the garden or orchard), they will take the paddy from this paddy storage and return the grain of paddy (they must be peel first) to paddy storage when they return from the garden. Thus, since the Manggilan tree is very familiar with the people's life there, Kampung Tenghilan was created in the name of the tree. The plants still exist today, but unfortunately, it is just a stump where most of the stumps are located in the river and heaped up by sand and soil.  Administration  Before the Japanese occupation during the Second World War, Tenghilan was a small sub-district in Kota Belud District. After the war, Tenghilan became a mukim in Tuaran District  Buildings structure  Tenghilan Town OldShoplot Originally, Tenghilan town had only one series of wooden shop-houses built-in 1930 by the British.

This timber shop house also has a spacious living area to accommodate other items for business as well as pedestrian areas. The first structure of the building was made of wood with a contiguous structure and the floor surface was cemented. In 1955, a series of shophouses were erected to replace the old shop building. But the old store is still intact and strong enough to carry on the business to this day. There is also a new building being built near Tamu (Weekly market). In 2014, the small town of Tenghilan had a new shop building with a two-story concrete building structure that provided greater convenience to the community there.

Hammerstone is the inaugural and current National Openweight Champion in his first reign while MJF and Holliday are former World Tag Team Champions. The group was formed at MLW's television taping on February 2, 2019, when Holliday attacked Hart Foundation member Teddy Hart after MJF lost a match to Hart. The duo of MJF and Holliday embarked on a lengthy feud with the Hart Foundation, during which Hammerstone joined the group and the trio gained championship success during the feud as Hammerstone was crowned the inaugural National Openweight Champion by defeating Brian Pillman Jr., while MJF and Holliday defeated Hart Foundation to win the World Tag Team Championship. Gino Medina joined the group on the December 5 television taping. History MJF MJF was scheduled to defend the World Middleweight Championship in a five-way ladder match on the first-ever live episode of Fusion on December 14, 2018, but an elbow injury forced him to vacate the title. Hart Foundation member Teddy Hart would go on to win the vacant title. MJF's recovery time was expected to be four to six weeks. He returned to MLW in early 2019 and challenged Hart for the title on the February 16 episode of Fusion, which Hart retained. However, after the match, Richard Holliday joined MJF in attacking Hart during a post-match interview. Consequently, MJF and Holliday formed a team called \\"The Dynasty\\", which was first mentioned in an article on MLW.com on February 18. Dynasty began feuding with the Hart Foundation, which led to them challenging Hart and Davey Boy Smith Jr. to a match for the World Tag Team Championship on the March 16 episode of Fusion. MLW newcomer Alexander Hammerstone interfered in the match by attacking Hart and Smith, which led to a disqualification loss for Dynasty and therefore Hammerstone joined the Dynasty, making it a trio. On the April 27 episode of Fusion, Dynasty defeated Hart Foundation in a six-man tables match to hand Hart Foundation, their first loss as a team in MLW. Dynasty continued its success against the Hart Foundation as Hammerstone defeated Brian Pillman Jr. in the finals of a tournament to become the inaugural National Openweight Champion at Fury Road. Hammerstone issued an open Star Sprangled Hammer Challenge for his title at Kings of Colosseum, which Kotto Brazil answered and Hammerstone retained the title. Immediately after the match, MJF and Holliday challenged Hart Foundation to a match for the World Tag Team Championship. On the July 13 episode of Fusion, MJF and Holliday defeated Pillman and Hart in a ladder match to capture the World Tag Team Championship. On the September 21 episode of Fusion, Dynasty retained the World Tag Team Championship against Hart and Smith in a two out of three falls match after Austin Aries interfered by attacking Hart, thus ending the feud between the two trios. On the October 12 episode of Fusion, Hammerstone defended the National Openweight Championship against the Crash Heavyweight Champion Rey Horus in a winner takes all match, with Horus' title also on the line. Hammerstone retained the title by getting disqualified after MJF and Holliday attacked Horus and prevented him from beating Hammerstone. Later that night, Dynasty successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship against the Los Parks (LA Park and El Hijo de LA Park) in the main event. At MLW's first-ever pay-per-view event Saturday Night SuperFight, Hammerstone retained the National Openweight Championship against Hart Foundation member Davey Boy Smith Jr. while MJF and Holliday lost the World Tag Team Championship to The Von Erichs (Ross and Marshall) in a Texas Tornado match. Alexander Hammerstone On November 14, it was announced that Dynasty members MJF and Alexander Hammerstone would compete against each other in the opening round of the Opera Cup tournament despite protests by Richard Holliday. The duo met in the opening round on December 5, where Hammerstone defeated MJF to advance to the semi-final, where he lost to the eventual winner Davey Boy Smith Jr. Holliday also entered the tournament, losing to Timothy Thatcher in the opening round. During the same set of tapings, Gino Medina joined Dynasty by attacking Konnan while Konnan, Salina de la Renta and Dynasty all tried to recruit him. Dynasty would then help Medina defeat Savio Vega in a New York City Street Fight. On October 13, 2020, it was announced on MLW's website that Gino Medina has left The Dynasty.

The four were held overnight, and their trial eventually lasted five weeks. They were all found guilty of assaulting police officers and attempted theft in November 1972 and received sentences of two years in prison. Following an appeal led by John Platts-Mills, QC, their sentences were later reduced to eight months, although the convictions themselves were upheld, and Lord Justice Haymes commented that the reduction did not ameliorate the seriousness of their crimes. Christie was also convicted of stealing a female police officer's handbag. All four men subsequently appealed, which failed. The officer responsible for their arrest, who was also the chief prosecution witness at their subsequent trial—Detective Sergeant Derek Ridgewell—was later tried and convicted for conspiracy of theft from the Royal Mail in 1980, where he received a seven-year sentence but died in Ford Prison two years later. The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) argues that Ridgewell—in charge of a group of undercover officers known as the Northern Line \\"Mugging Squad\\"— was known to confront young black men at tube stations, accuse them of theft, and then arrest them for resisting arrest, which he would back up with fictional, incriminatory remarks from the prisoner. If they resisted, a charge of assaulting a police officer was added to the charge sheet. This led to a number of \\"high-profile\\" cases, which began attracting attention after a judge threw out Ridgewell's case against two Jesuit students studying at Oxford University. The judge, Gwynn Morris summed up: \\"I find it terrible that, here in London, people using public transport should be pounced upon by police officers without a word.\\" Following the case's collapse, Ridgwell was transferred to a unit investigating the theft of mail bags; however, he took the opportunity while there to take join forces with thieves who would steal the bags and with whom Ridgewell would split the profits. The following decades saw a campaign develop for the men's convictions to be examined, which included demonstrations and public meetings at Lambeth Town Hall. As a result of Ridgewell's corruption the four men's case was returned to the Court of Appeal in October 2019, which indicated that the case would review Ridgewell's \\"integrity\\". A number of Ridgewell's other cases had recently come before the appeal court, such as that of businessman Stephen Simmons who was also found to have been framed. Their convictions were quashed on 5 December 2019 by Lord Chief Justice, Lord Burnett, in a judgement given alongside Mrs Justice McGowan and Sir Roderick Evans. Burnett stated that the appeal court recognised \\"an accumulating body of evidence that points to the fundamental unreliability of evidence given by DS Ridgewell...and others of this specialist group\\". The four men were all aged between 19 and 23 when they were arrested by police investigating crime on London Underground; Trew later claimed that they were all \\"given a good hiding there to confess to things we didn't do\\". The CCRC supported Trew's and Christie's appeal, although noted that they had not been able to discover the whereabouts of Griffiths or Boucher, whom they believed to have emigrated later that decade. Their cases will remain available to prosecute should they request it, said the CCRC, who made the referral, they said, because \\"the commission considers there is a real possibility that the court will quash the conviction on the basis of new evidence and arguments concerning the integrity of DS Ridgewell.\\" They also suggested that the appeal had \\"potential significance\\" for others convicted following Ridgewell's investigation or testimony.

Le Mans Hypercar regulations were created jointly by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) and the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile as a successor class to the Le Mans Prototype LMP1 class from the 2021 season onwards. Unlike its predecessor class, where the rules only allowed bespoke prototypes to be created to race in the category, cars entered in the Le Mans Hypercar class can either be race-ready versions of existing hypercars, or specially designed prototypes, with hybrid power being optional for manufacturers.  History  Following the successive exits of Audi and Porsche from the FIA World Endurance Championship at the end of the 2016 and 2017 seasons due to the fallout of the Volkswagen emissions scandal affecting the parent company of both automobile manufacturers, as well as spiralling costs in the LMP1 Hybrid sub-category, the ACO began a series of discussions aimed at reducing the costs of competition for the next generation LMP1 rules. Initially, a single, low-power hybrid system had been planned for the new-generation LMP1 rules, with plans for a shared platform with the IMSA. Representatives from the three organizations, as well as current and prospective manufacturers, were involved in talks for the proposed regulations, which would debut in the 2020-21 World Endurance Championship season. At the time, there had been an option for a customer hybrid powertrain for small-volume manufacturers and privateers, which could then replace the Daytona Prototype International regulations in the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship in 2022, allowing for the unification of top level sportscar racing, with teams and manufacturers being able to compete with the same car in the \\"triple crown\\" of endurance racing. These initial plans targeted significant cost reductions while maintaining the performance levels of the LMP1 prototypes. A renaming of the category was later suggested by FIA President Jean Todt. In June 2018, ahead of the 2018 24 Hours of Le Mans, the FIA first confirmed that the new set of top-level prototype regulations would feature design concepts based on hypercars when implemented, with a summary of the new technical regulations being presented to the FIA World Motor Sport Council in Manila. At the time, Toyota, Ford, McLaren, Aston Martin and Ferrari were revealed to have been in roundtable meetings with the championship organisers for the new regulations, with a significantly reduced targeted full-season budget in the region of 25 million euros, which would be 75% lower than existing budgets used by manufacturer teams. At the 2018 24 Hours of Le Mans, the initial details of the new top class for the FIA World Endurance Championship were announced at the ACO's annual press conference, with the regulations set to be active for 5 seasons. Numerous aspects of the design for the new class would be kept open, with a free engine architecture and the freedom to run any number of cylinders with the choice of a turbocharged or naturally-aspirated design. The cars would have an overall weight of 980kg with a controlled weight distribution, alongside a defined maximum fuel flow, with controlled efficiency and other regulations to control developmental costs. Hybrid systems would feature an electric motor mounted on the front axle with a fixed performance of 200 kW, giving the cars a four-wheel drive layout, while the engine's maximum performance target would be set at . Each car will have two seats, a bigger cockpit than current LMP1 cars, a wider windscreen, and a roofline more consistent with road cars. Manufacturers are required to make their hybrid systems available for privateer teams to lease at a cost cap, while any manufacturer or company would be able to design and build its own hybrid system, which would undergo homologation by the FIA and ACO. The cars would also be set to be slower than its predecessors, with a 3:20 target lap time. On 25 July 2018, Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus became the first manufacturer to officially indicate its participation in the new rules, with the manufacturer releasing images of a prototype that it planned to race in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The manufacturer would offer a limited run of 25 road-legal versions and one race version to fund its Le Mans program. By the end of the 2018 year, apart from Glickenhaus, no other manufacturer had committed to the new regulations, with concerns being raised by several manufacturers about the tight timelines involved, which would leave manufacturers intending to commit from the first season of competition with less than two years to design and build new cars, upon gaining company board approval. On 21 October 2018, McLaren announced that it would not participate in the first year of the category due to the tight timelines involved, and the relatively fluid state of the regulations at the point in time. On 5 December 2018, the FIA published the technical rulebook for the class, with the regulations mandating production-based powertrains. It was also decided that a minimum of 25 road cars fitted with the combustion engine and energy recovery system (ERS) of the race car would have to be produced by the end of a manufacturer's first season, with that amount rising to 100 by the end of its second season. This would mean that non-OEM racecar constructors, such as Oreca, Onroak Automotive and Dallara, would not be permitted to build hypercars, while the previously proposed \\"off-the-shelf\\" hybrid solution was absent from the regulations. The regulations called for a total maximum power output of roughly 950 hp (708 kW) drawn from the combustion and electric hybrid system, lower than the initial figure presented in June, with the maximum output of the combustion engine now at 508 kW rather than 520, although the 200 kW electric unit power output remains the same. In addition, Diesel power would be banned, with a 3 million euro ($3.4 million US) cost cap on the supply of ERS systems from manufacturers to customer teams was announced, while it was also announced that an ERS manufacturer would be prohibited from supplying a system to more than three competitors without the formal approval of the FIA. The minimum weight of the new-generation cars will be raised from the initially-stated to , with maximum length being , while maximum cockpit width would also increase to . On 7 March 2019, it was announced that the FIA World Endurance Championship would adjust its criteria for the new prototype regulations, with manufacturers now being permitted to enter race cars derived from road-going hypercars. This was done after several manufacturers expressed interest in a closer alignment between their production and race activities, citing both budgetary and platform availability concerns. Subsequently, the target lap time of the new cars was increased from 3:20 to 3:30 and movable aerodynamic devices, originally planned to be allowed under the new regulations, were removed due to cost concerns. On 19 February 2020, Aston Martin announced that they would be postponing their Le Mans Hypercar project, as the announcement of the joint ACO-IMSA Le Mans Daytona h class led to the company to reconsider their plans on the project. In addition, the company plans to re-join Formula 1 in 2021 for the first time since the 1960s as a factory-backed team. On 11 May 2020, the FIA announced it had approved proposed changes to the LMH technical regulations, which would see a decrease in maximum power output from to , and minimum weight of the cars from to .  Technical regulations  The frontal surface area of the car may not be below 1.6 m², while \\"as viewed from above, from the side, and from the front, the bodywork must not allow mechanical components to be seen, unless explicitly authorised by the present regulations, or if respecting the original car design.\\" Movable aerodynamic elements are prohibited.  Powertrain  Engine design is free, with only four-stroke petrol engines being permitted for use. For production-based engines, the block and head castings must come from the base engine (but can be slightly altered via machining or addition of material), and the crankshaft may only be a maximum of 10% lighter, while valve angles, number of camshafts, and location of camshafts must also remain as they are fitted on the original engine. For cars utilising an energy recovery hybrid system, the electrical DC power of the MGU-K must not exceed 200 kW, and with the exception of the pit lane, the MGU-K may only apply positive torque to the front wheels should the following conditions be met: * If the speed of the car is 120 km/h or higher, when fitted with dry weather slick tyres; * If the speed of the car is between 140-160 km/h or higher, when not fitted with dry weather slick tyres; * If the speed of the car is below 120 km/h and stays below 120 km/h until the car comes to the pits.

She was in commission from 1923 to 1934 and from 1940 to 1941. Before World War II, she served in the waters of Japan. During World War II, she took part in the Battle of Wake Island before she was wrecked three weeks after the war broke out. Design and description The submarines of the Type L4 sub-class were copies of the Group 3 subclass of the British L-class class submarine built under license in Japan.Chesneau, Roger, ed., Conway′s All the World′s Fighting Ships 1922–1946, New York: Mayflower Books, 1980, , p. 203. They were slightly larger and had two more torpedo tubes than the preceding submarines of the L3 subclass. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long and had a beam of and a draft of . They had a diving depth of . For surface running, the submarines were powered by two Vickers diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged, each propeller was driven by an electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, they had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . The submarines were armed with six internal torpedo tubes, all in the bow, and carried a total of twelve 6th Year Type torpedoes. They were also armed with a single deck gun and a 6.5 mm machine gun. Construction and commissioning Ro-60 was laid down as Submarine No. 59 on 5 December 1921 by Mitsubishi at Kobe, Japan. Launched on 22 December 1922, she was completed and commissioned on 17 September 1923. Service history Pre-World War II Upon commissioning, Submarine No. 59 was assigned to the Sasebo Naval District. On 9 February 1924, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 26 — in which she spent the remainder of her career — and to the Sasebo Defense Division. On 1 April 1924, Submarine Division 26 was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 1 in the 1st Fleet. Submarine No. 59 was renamed Ro-60 on 1 November 1924. On 1 December 1925, Submarine Division 26 was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 2 in the 2nd Fleet in the Combined Fleet. On 1 March 1926, Ro-60 and the submarines , , , , , , and departed Sasebo, Japan, bound for Okinawa, which they reached the same day. The eight submarines got underway from Okinawa on 30 March 1926 for a training cruise in Chinese waters off Shanghai and Amoy which concluded with their arrival at Mako off Formosa on 5 April 1926. They departed Mako on 20 April 1926 for the return leg of their training cruise, operating off China near Chusan Island, then returned to Sasebo on 26 April 1926. On 15 December 1926, the Submarine Division 26 returned to the Sasebo Naval District and the Sasebo Defense Division. On 27 March 1927, Ro-60, Ro-61, Ro-62, Ro-63, and Ro-64 departed Saeki Bay, Japan, for a training cruise off Tsingtao, China, which they concluded with her arrival at Sasebo, Japan, on 16 May 1927. Ro-60 was decommissioned on 10 February 1928 and placed in Third Reserve at Sasebo. Ro-60 was recommissioned on 20 September 1928 and resumed active service in Submarine Division 26 in the Sasebo Defense Division in the Sasebo Naval District. On 10 December 1928, the division again was assigned to Submarine Squadron 1 in the 1st Fleet. On 1 December 1930, it returned to the Sasebo Naval District, and served in the Sasebo Defense Division again from that date until 15 November 1933. On 1 June 1934, Ro-60 was decommissioned and placed in Second Reserve at Sasebo, and while in Second Reserve was assigned to the Sasebo Guard Squadron from 15 November 1934 to 15 November 1935. She moved to Third Reserve on 15 December 1938 and to Fourth Reserve on 15 November 1939. Ro-60 again was recommissioned on 15 October 1940, and on 15 November 1940 Submarine Division 26 was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 7 in the 4th Fleet in the Combined Fleet. When the Imperial Japanese Navy deployed for the upcoming conflict in the Pacific, Ro-60 was at Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands. She received the message \\"Climb Mount Niitaka 1208\\" () from the Combined Fleet on 2 December 1941, indicating that war with the Allies would commence on 8 December 1941 Japan time, which was on 7 December 1941 on the other side of the International Date Line in Hawaii. World War II =Battle of Wake Island= Ro-60 was with the other submarines of Submarine Division 26 — and — at Kwajalein when Japan entered World War II on 8 December 1941, Kwajalein time. The three submarines were placed on \\"standby alert\\" that day as United States Marine Corps forces on Wake Island threw back the first Japanese attempt to invade the atoll. On 12 December 1941, Ro-60 and Ro-61 got underway from Kwajalein to support a second, heavily reinforced Japanese attempt to invade Wake Island; Ro-62 followed on 14 December 1941. Ro-60 was on the surface southwest of Wake at around 16:00 local time on 21 December 1941 when a U.S. Marine Corps F4F Wildcat fighter of Marine Fighter Squadron 211 (VMF-211) attacked her, strafing her and dropping two bombs. Ro-60 crash- dived, but the attack damaged her periscopes and several of her diving tanks. After she resurfaced that night and her crew inspected her damage, her commanding officer decided that she no longer could dive safely. The Battle of Wake Island ended as Wake Island fell to the Japanese on 23 December 1941, and that day Ro-60 and Ro-62 received orders to return to Kwajalein. =Loss= As she was approaching Kwajalein Atoll in bad weather in the predawn darkness of 29 December 1941, Ro-60 went off course and ran hard aground on a reef north of the atoll at 02:00 at , damaging her pressure hull and splitting her starboard diving tanks open. At about 13:00, the commander of Submarine Squadron 7 arrived on the scene from Kwajalein aboard his flagship, the submarine tender , to supervise rescue and salvage operations personally. Pounded by high surf, Ro-60 incurred additional damage and took on such a heavy list that her crew destroyed her secret documents and abandoned ship. Jingei rescued all 66 members of her crew. The Japanese struck Ro-60 from the Navy list on 15 February 1942. At some point later in World War II, an unidentified aircraft strafed her wreck, detonating Ro-60′s torpedoes and blowing the wreck apart. Divers who later visited the site found her wreckage strewn all over the reef, with her aft section lying against the reef, her forward section lying ahead of her stern, her conning tower from the forward section, and her deck gun beyond that.

Sold in 1956 to J. Lauritzen and renamed Noona Dan. Noona Dan circumnavigated the world in 1961/1962 on the Danish research cruise known as the Noona Dan expedition to the Western Pacific Ocean. After the expedition the ship was sold to Germany as a training ship, first owned and operated by Deutsche Schulschiff-Verein and 1973 by the German Clipper association. She continues to sail with young people on training cruises in the Baltic Sea. In winter the ship is moored at Hamburg-Harburg.  1939–1963: Danish years  The ship was built and named Havet in 1939 at the J. Ring- Andersen shipyard in Svendborg, Denmark, for Captain Karl M. Lorenzen. It was designed according to his instructions, which were based on his experience with fishing from schooners in the waters off Alaska. The design was very successful and the hull design was used for several later ships from the shipyard. Havet sailed the next 16 years in coastal merchant trade. The ship was sold in 1957 to the Danish company D/S Ocean, part of the Lauritzen Group, Copenhagen, and renamed Noona Dan. The ship was refitted with a new engine, a , 3-cylinder B&W; Alpha. In 1958 Noona Dan was sent to Greenland together with to conduct oceanographic and bathymetric measurements along the Liverpool Coast and Mestersvig, East Greenland. Lauritzen at the time had seven ships occupied with shipping ore from the newly opened lead and zinc mine in Mestersvig. Noona Dan arrived at Kap Tobin on 25 July 1958, but was surprised by the pack ice and had to seek shelter in Scoresbysund/Ittoqqortoormiit. The ship was trapped by the ice for the entire summer and forced to overwinter with only three crew members on board. The remaining crew and scientists were taken to Copenhagen by the ship Kista Dan.  Noona Dan Expedition  After the return to Copenhagen Lauritzen offered the ship at the disposal of University of Copenhagen for an expedition to the tropical western Pacific Ocean. Noona Dan and the expedition left Copenhagen on 10 April 1961 under command of captain Jørgen Kaas Narup. The goal of the expedition was the western Pacific Ocean, more specifically the many islands in the Solomon Sea and Bismarck Sea. The route went west, through the Panama Canal and across the Pacific Ocean. A large number of scientist were on board the ship and exchanged along the route. Four researchers shared the role as expedition leader consecutively: Børge Petersen, Mogens Køie, Finn Salomonsen and Torben Wolff. In October 1961 the expedition suffered a loss on Tawitawi, as the ornithologist and taxidermist Erik Petersen died from an allergic reaction to an insect bite. This caused concern among the remaining participants of the expedition and several members announced that they would leave, unless the expedition was joined by a medical doctor. Lorenz Ferdinand was chosen — not only was he a medical doctor with experience from the Galathea expedition, but also a highly esteemed ornithologist. The return voyage went through the Suez Canal, which meant that upon arrival in Copenhagen on 9 December 1962, Noona Dan had circumnavigated the world, as the fourth Danish research vessel (the others being Galathea I, and Galathea II).  1963–present: German training ship  Segelschiff SEUTE DEERN (Kiel 66.768).jpg  Seute Deern in Kiel, 1975 Segelschiff SEUTE DEERN (Kiel 68.203).jpg  Seute Deern in Kiel, 1975 The Tall Ships' Races - 02-05 07 2009, Gdynia - 05-07-2009 - 139 cropped.jpgSeute Deern off Gdynia during 2009 Tall Ships' Races Seute Deern Baltic Tall Ships Races 2009 St. Petersburg.jpgSeute Deern in St. Petersburg, Russia, during 2009 Tall Ships' Races File: SS Seute Deern - Ystad-2020.jpgthumbSS Seute Deern in the port of Ystad July 24, 2020. In the early 1960s the German Training Ship Association were looking for a training ship and the interest fell on Noona Dan, as she had established herself as a very reliable and seaworthy ship. The ship was purchased in 1963 for a price of 14,000 Pound Sterling. The ship was renamed Seute Deern (sometimes Seute Deern II) after an earlier bark of the same name and entered as training ship under command of Captain Günter Ulrichs on the 30 April 1964. With some smaller breaks, the ship continued to serve as a training ship under different forms and ownership. In 2000 it was bought by Verein Clipper, which continues to operate the ship as training ship for young people on cruises mainly in the Baltic Sea.

World War II =Central Pacific= Ro-62 was with the other submarines of Submarine Division 26 — Ro-60 and Ro-61 — at Kwajalein when Japan entered World War II on 8 December 1941, Kwajalein time. The three submarines were placed on \\"standby alert\\" that day as United States Marine Corps forces on Wake Island threw back the first Japanese attempt to invade the atoll. On 12 December 1941, Ro-60, Ro-61, and Ro-62 were assigned to support a second, heavily reinforced Japanese attempt to invade Wake Island, and Ro-60 and Ro-61 got underway from Kwajalein for the Wake Island area that day. Ro-62 followed on 14 December 1941. Ro-62 was on the surface southwest of Wake Island to recharge her batteries in a heavy squall in the predawn darkness of 17 December 1941 when her lookouts suddenly sighted her sister ship, the submarine , also on the surface and recharging batteries. Both submarines attempted to back off, but it was too late to avoid a collision, and Ro-62 rammed Ro-66 at 20:20 Japan Standard Time. Ro-66 sank with the loss of 63 lives. Ro-62 rescued her three survivors, who had been thrown overboard by the collision. The Battle of Wake Island ended as Wake Island fell to the Japanese on 23 December 1941. Ro-62 returned to Kwajalein on 28 December 1941. She and Ro-61 were reassigned to the Marshalls Area Guard Unit on 5 January 1942 and patrolled off Kwajalein thereafter. Carrier aircraft of United States Navy Task Force 8 raided Kwajalein on 1 February 1942. Two hours later, the Japanese 6th Fleet ordered the submarines of Submarine Squadron 1 — Ro-61, Ro-62, , , , , , , and — to intercept the American task force, but none of the submarines made contact with it. In March 1942, Ro-61 and Ro-62 made their way to Japan, calling at Truk in the Caroline Islands from 9 to 19 March and pausing briefly at Saipan in the Mariana Islands on 22–23 March before arriving at Sasebo on 30 March 1942. The two submarines departed Sasebo on 31 May 1942, called at Saipan from 6 to 7 June 1942, and arrived at Truk on 10 June 1942. Recalled to Japan, they got underway from Truk on 27 June 1942 bound for Yokosuka, Japan, which they reached on 5 July 1942. =Aleutian Islands campaign= On 14 July 1942, Submarine Division 26 was reassigned to the 5th Fleet for service in the Aleutian Islands, where the Aleutian Islands campaign had begun in June 1942 with the Japanese occupation of Attu and Kiska. Ro-61 and Ro-62 departed Yokosuka on 24 July 1942 bound for Paramushiro in the northern Kurile Islands, where they arrived on 30 July 1942. They put to sea again on 1 August 1942 to head for Kiska, which they reached on 5 August 1942. Thereafter, they were based there along with the submarines , Ro-63, Ro-64, , , and . On 7 August 1942, an American task force bombarded Kiska while I-6, Ro-61, Ro-64, and Ro-68 were anchored in the harbor, and they crash-dived to avoid damage. On 8 August 1942, Ro-62 sortied to intercept the American ships, but failed to find them. On 28 August 1942, a Kiska-based Aichi E13A1 (Allied reporting name \\"Jake\\") reconnaissance floatplane sighted the U.S. Navy seaplane tender — which the plane′s crew mistakenly identified as a light cruiser — and a destroyer in Nazan Bay on the coast of Atka. Ro-61, Ro-62, and Ro-64 received orders that day to intercept the ships, and all three of them were off Atka on 29 August 1942. On 30 August 1942, the submarines received orders to attack an American task force that was occupying Adak, but Ro-62 found no targets and returned to Kiska on 5 September 1942. On 14 September 1942, aircraft of the United States Army Air Forces Eleventh Air Force raided Kiska. They strafed Ro-68, but Ro-62 escaped damage. During the remainder of September 1942, Ro-62 made two patrols in the vicinity of Kiska, one from 19 to 21 September and other from 29 to 30 September, but both patrols were uneventful. On 1 October 1942 she departed Kiska to patrol off Crook Bay on the northern coast of Adak. She operated in her patrol area from 3 to 5 October 1942 without finding any targets and returned to Kiska on 8 October 1942. Ro-62 made several short sorties from Kiska between 10 and 17 October 1942, apparently to test equipment. After an air pump failed, she departed Kiska on 18 October 1942 bound for Paramushiro, which she reached on 23 October 1942. She later got back underway, called at Ōminato, Japan, from 29 October to 1 November 1942, and proceeded to Yokosuka, where she arrived on 5 November 1942. She later moved to Kure, Japan. =Training duties= On 15 November 1942, Submarine Division 26 was reassigned to the training department of the Kure Guard Unit and Ro-62 began duty as a training submarine. On 1 December 1942, Submarine Division 26 was disbanded and its submarines were reassigned to Submarine Division 33. Ro-62 was transferred to the Kure Submarine Squadron on 10 October 1944. On 12 April 1945 she was reassigned to Submarine Division 33 to operate as a training submarine at the submarine school at Ōtake, Japan. =End of war= Ro-62 was at Maizuru, Japan, when hostilities between Japan and the Allies ended on 15 August 1945. She departed Maizuru on 21 August 1945 and proceeded to Kure, where on 26 August 1945 her manning was reduced to a skeleton crew. On 28 August 1945, her remaining crew ceremonially lowered her battle flag and also left her. She surrendered to the Allies in September 1945. Disposal The Japanese struck Ro-62 from the Navy list on 20 November 1945. Allied forces scuttled her in the Iyo Nada in the Seto Inland Sea in May 1946.

When sick, the colony declines gradually with little or no replacement troops, costing 20-80% of honey production. Reasons SBV is caused by the M. aetatulas virus. Transmission is due to bees taking care of larvae, other bees entering the colony to steal, bees entering the wrong nest through a source of flowers, or through beekeepers' activities (changing bridges, importing herds, etc). The disease spreads and flares up when the operation of importing bee breeds is not controlled. According to Borchert, when studying the disease in 1966, one diseased larva could infect 3,000 healthy larvae. Bailey in 1981 claimed that the liquid in a killed larva containing 1 mg of virus can infect all worker larvae of 1,000 healthy bees. Symptoms When sick bees go to work, particularly heavy herds noticed that bees take dead larvae out of the nest. The screw cap on the pupil surface is sunken, and a few small pinholes are present. The larvae die at the new stage screw cap (pupa). At the pointed tip of the diseased larva protruding between the nest holes, the tip of the larvae tilts towards the abdomen. At the larvae's end is a small transparent water bag. Dead larvae have no odor. Prevention and treatment  The best preventative measures are hygiene of means, transporting tools and beekeeping tools when trading, importing, and transporting bees and products, as well as inspecting and interacting with bees; when importing the breeds, choose healthy, clean and clear herds. Antibiotics do not affect this disease. Biological techniques such as replacing the sick lord with a royal cap or silk thread, confining the herd for 8-10 days, removing bridges so that the bees thicken the remaining bridges, feeding 5-6 nights in a row to transfer to a new and better source of flowers and isolation from other bee farms and merging the weakening herd.

A Proth prime is a Proth number that is prime. They are named after the French mathematician François Proth. The first few Proth primes are : 3, 5, 13, 17, 41, 97, 113, 193, 241, 257, 353, 449, 577, 641, 673, 769, 929, 1153, 1217, 1409, 1601, 2113, 2689, 2753, 3137, 3329, 3457, 4481, 4993, 6529, 7297, 7681, 7937, 9473, 9601, 9857 (). The primality of Proth numbers can be tested more easily than many other numbers of similar magnitude.  Definition  A Proth number takes the form N=k 2^n +1 where k and n are positive integers, k is odd and 2^n>k. A Proth prime is a Proth number that is prime. Without the condition that 2^n > k, all odd integers larger than 1 would be Proth numbers.  Primality testing  The primality of a Proth number can be tested with Proth's theorem, which states that a Proth number p is prime if and only if there exists an integer a for which :a^{\\\\frac{p-1}{2}}\\\\equiv -1 \\\\pmod{p} . This theorem can be used as a probabilistic test of primality, by checking for many random choices of a whether a^{\\\\frac{p-1}{2}}\\\\equiv -1 \\\\pmod{p}. If this fails to hold for several random a, then it is very likely that the number p is composite. This test is a Las Vegas algorithm: it never returns a false positive but can return a false negative; in other words, it never reports a composite number as \\"probably prime\\" but can report a prime number as \\"possibly composite\\". In 2008, Sze created a deterministic algorithm that runs in at most \\\\tilde{O}((k\\\\log k+\\\\log N)(\\\\log N)^2) time, where Õ is the soft-O notation. For typical searches for Proth primes, usually k is either fixed (e.g. 321 Prime Search or Sierpinski Problem) or of order O(\\\\log N) (e.g. Cullen prime search). In these cases algorithm runs in at most \\\\tilde{O}((\\\\log N)^3), or O((\\\\log N)^{3+\\\\epsilon}) time for all \\\\epsilon>0. There is also an algorithm that runs in \\\\tilde{O}((\\\\log N)^{24/7}) time.  Large primes  , the largest known Proth prime is 10223 \\\\cdot 2^{31172165} + 1. It is 9,383,761 digits long. It was found by Szabolcs Peter in the PrimeGrid distributed computing project which announced it on 6 November 2016. It is also the largest known non-Mersenne prime. The project Seventeen or Bust, searching for Proth primes with a certain t to prove that 78557 is the smallest Sierpinski number (Sierpinski problem), has found 11 large Proth primes by 2007, of which 5 are megaprimes. Similar resolutions to the prime Sierpiński problem and extended Sierpiński problem have yielded several more numbers. As of December 2019, PrimeGrid is the leading computing project for searching for Proth primes. Its main projects include: * general Proth prime search * 321 Prime Search (searching for primes of the form 3\\\\times2^n+1, also called Thabit primes of the second kind) * 27121 Prime Search (searching for primes of the form 27\\\\times2^n+1 and 121\\\\times2^n+1) * Cullen prime search (searching for primes of the form n\\\\times2^n+1) *Sierpinski problem (and their prime and extended generalizations) - searching for primes of the form k\\\\times2^n+1 where k is in this list: > k ∈ {21181, 22699, 24737, 55459, 67607, 79309, 79817, 91549, 99739, 131179, > 152267, 156511, 163187, 200749, 202705, 209611, 222113, 225931, 227723, > 229673, 237019, 238411} As of December 2019, the largest Proth primes discovered are: {  !rank !prime !digits !when !Cullen prime? !Discoverer (Project) !References - 1 10223 · 231172165 \\\\+ 1 9383761 31 Oct 2016  Szabolcs Péter (Sierpinski Problem)  - 2 168451 · 219375200 \\\\+ 1 5832522 17 Sep 2017  Ben Maloney (Prime Sierpinski Problem)  - 3 19249 · 213018586 \\\\+ 1 3918990 26 Mar 2007  Konstantin Agafonov (Seventeen or Bust)  - 4 193997 · 211452891 \\\\+ 1 3447670 3 Apr 2018  Tom Greer (Extended Sierpinski Problem)  - 5 3 · 210829346 \\\\+ 1 3259959 14 Jan 2014  Sai Yik Tang (321 Prime Search)  - 6 27653 · 29167433 \\\\+ 1 2759677 8 Jun 2005  Derek Gordon (Seventeen or Bust)  - 7 90527 · 29162167 \\\\+ 1 2758093 30 Jun 2010  Unknown (Prime Sierpinski Problem)  - 8 28433 · 27830457 \\\\+ 1 2357207 30 Dec 2004  Team Prime Rib (Seventeen or Bust)  - 9 161041 · 27107964 \\\\+ 1 2139716 6 Jan 2015  Martin Vanc (Extended Sierpinski Problem)  - 10 27 · 27046834 \\\\+ 1 2121310 11 Oct 2018  Andrew M.

Such ladders have been used to empirically verify prime-related conjectures. For example, Goldbach's weak conjecture was verified in 2008 up to 8.875·1030 using prime ladders constructed from Proth primes. (The conjecture was later proved by Harald Helfgott.) Also, Proth primes can optimize den Boer reduction between the Diffie-Hellman problem and the Discrete logarithm problem. The prime number has been used in this way. As Proth primes have simple binary representations, they have also been used in fast modular reduction without the need for pre-computation, for example by Microsoft.

Biography Born in London, Sanders began his career in photography in the mid-1960s, where he often recorded the faces of well-known musicians including Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison and The Rolling Stones. In the 1970s, his attention shifted, which led him to the traditional and spiritual universe of Islam. He converted to Islam in 1971. The same year, Sanders was given a unique opportunity to record the warmth of the world's largest worship gathering in Mecca during the Hajj season. These pictures have appeared in major UK and European magazines such as The Sunday Times, The Observer and Paris Match. Sanders travelled around the world to meet and capture the images of saints and sages of Islam which he has later published in a book titled 'Meetings with Mountains'.

World events Regional politics Africa =Burundi= On April 25, 2015, the incumbent President of Burundi, Pierre Nkurunziza, announced he would run for a third term in the 2015 presidential election. The announcement sparked protests by those opposed to Nkurunziza seeking a third term in office.Burundi: Crackdown on Protesters Human Rights Watch, April 27, 2015 Widespread demonstrations in the then-capital, Bujumbura, lasted for over three weeks. As a result of the protests, the government also shut down the country's Internet and telephone network, closed all of the country's universities, and publicly referred to the protesters as \\"terrorists\\". Tens of thousands of people fled the country, hundreds of people were arrested, and several protesters and police were killed. On May 13, 2015, a coup d'etat was announced, led by Major General Godefroid Niyombare, while President Nkurunziza was in Tanzania attending an emergency conference about the situation in the country. By the next day the coup collapsed and government forces reasserted control. At least 240 people were killed over the next few months, and on December 11, 87 people were killed in attacks on state targets. The violence has raised fears of a return to worsening ethnic tension between Hutus and Tutsis. Nkurunziza had led a Hutu rebel group against the then Tutsi-dominated army during the civil war that followed the killing of Hutu President Melchior Ndadaye in 1993. Violence continued through 2017.Three killed in Burundi grenade attacks at bars Al Jazeera, August 18, 2017 Cameroon The Anglophone Crisis (French: Crise anglophone), is a conflict in the Southern Cameroons region of Cameroon, part of the long- standing Anglophone problem pitting English-speakers against French-speakers; English-speakers make up about one-fifth of the population. In September 2017, separatists in the Anglophone territories of Northwest Region and Southwest Region declared the independence of Ambazonia and began fighting against the Government of Cameroon. Starting as a low-scale insurgency, the conflict spread to most parts of the Anglophone regions within a year. As of the summer of 2019, the government controls the major cities and parts of the countryside, while the separatists hold parts of the countryside and regularly appear in the major cities. The war has killed approximately 2,000 people and forced more than half a million people to flee their homes. Although 2019 has seen the first known instance of dialogue between Cameroon and the separatists, as well as a major national dialogue, the war continues to escalate.Why has violence increased since Cameroon’s National Dialogue?

It is an ongoing rebellion instigated by the Kamwina Nsapu militia in the provinces of Kasaï-Central, Kasaï, Kasai- Oriental, Lomami, and Sankuru. The fighting began in August 2016. Egypt The Egyptian revolution of 2011 started on 25 January 25, 2011 and spread across Egypt. Millions of protesters from a range of socio-economic and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Violent clashes between security forces and protesters resulted in at least 846 people killed and over 6,000 injured. Protesters retaliated by burning over 90 police stations across the country. The protesters' grievances focused on legal and political issues, including police brutality, state-of- emergency laws, lack of political freedom, civil liberty, freedom of speech, corruption, high unemployment, food-price inflation, and low wages. The protesters' primary demands were the end of the Mubarak regime and emergency law. Strikes by labour unions added to the pressure on government officials. In February 2011 Vice President Omar Suleiman announced that had Mubarak resigned as president, turning power over to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF). The military junta, headed by Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, announced on February 13 that the constitution was suspended, both houses of parliament dissolved, and the military would govern until elections could be held. The Muslim Brotherhood took power in Egypt through a series of popular elections, with Egyptians electing Islamist Mohamed Morsi to the presidency in June 2012. However, the Morsi government encountered fierce opposition after his attempt to pass an Islamic-leaning constitution, and mass protests broke out against his rule in late June 2013, and on July 3, 2013, Morsi was deposed by a coup d'état led by the minister of defense, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. El-Sisi went on to become Egypt's president by popular election in 2014. Eritrea Guinea Libya Mali The Mali War, refers to armed conflicts that started from January 2012 between the northern and southern parts of Mali. On January 16, 2012, several insurgent groups began fighting a campaign against the Malian government for independence or greater autonomy for northern Mali, an area of northern Mali they called Azawad. The National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), an organization fighting to make this area of Mali an independent homeland for the Tuareg people, had taken control of the region by April 2012. The MNLA were initially backed by the Islamist group Ansar Dine. After the Malian military was driven from northern Mali, Ansar Dine and a number of smaller Islamist groups began imposing strict Sharia law, and the Tuareg group broke away from them. French Armed Forces and members of the African Union helped the government regain control of the area, and a peace agreement was signed in February 2015.Deploring ongoing violence, UN rights expert urges Malian parties to work together towards lasting peace U.N.

The insurgency is widely considered to be an aftershock of the Mozambican Civil War; it resulted in renewed tensions between RENAMO and Mozambique's ruling FRELIMO coalition over charges of state corruption and the disputed results of 2014 general elections. A ceasefire was announced between the government and the rebels in September 2014. However, renewed tensions sparked violence in mid-2015. A peace agreement was signed on August 6, 2019. Nigeria Republic of the Congo Somalia South Sudan The South Sudanese Civil War broke out in 2013 after a disputed elected and an alleged coup d’etat attempt. An estimated 300,000 people have been killed in the fighting, and over 4 million have been displaced. One hundred thousand people face starvation, and nearly 5 million face severe food shortages; the government declared a famine in 2017. Several fruitless efforts to agree to a settlement were made in 2014. Fighting continued until a compromise peace agreement was signed in 2015, but fighting broke out again in 2016. The African Union deployed a 12,000 member peace force including soldiers from Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, and Uganda, over the objections of President Salva Kiir. However, fighting continued through 2017. Sudan The War in Darfur, (Sudan) began in 2003, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths, genocide, and ethnic cleansing. An International Criminal Court investigation resulted in two warrants against President Omar al-Bashir and his eventual arrest. The Doha Agreement was signed in 2011, but little real progress was made a year later. The war continued through 2016, including with allegations that the government had used mustard gas. = Piracy = Piracy in the Gulf of Guinea affects a number of countries in West Africa, including Benin, Togo, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as the wider international community. By 2011, it had become an issue of global concern. Pirates are often part of heavily armed criminal enterprises, who employ violent methods to steal oil cargo. In 2012, the International Maritime Bureau and other agencies reported that the number of vessels attacks by West African pirates had reached a world high, with 966 seafarers attacked and five killed during the year.West African Piracy Exceeds Somali Attacks, Report Says Alan Cowell, The New York Times, June 18, 2013 Piracy off the coast of Somalia occurs in the Gulf of Aden, Guardafui Channel, Somali Sea, in Somali territorial waters and other areas. It was initially a threat to international fishing vessels, expanding to international shipping since the second phase of the Somali Civil War, around 2000. By December 2013, the US Office of Naval Intelligence reported that only nine vessels had been attacked during the year by the pirates, with no successful hijackings.Somali piracy was reduced to zero this year David Yanofsky in Somalia, Quartz, December 27, 2013 In March 2017, it was reported that pirates had seized an oil tanker that had set sail from Djibouti and was headed to Mogadishu. The ship and its crew were released with no ransom given after the pirate crew learned that the ship had been hired by Somali businessmen.Somali pirates release oil tanker and crew after first hijack for five years The Guardian World News, March 16, 2017 War on Terror The most prominent terrorist groups that are creating a terror impact in Africa include Boko Haram of Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, and Niger, and Al-Shabaab of Somalia. Boko Haram has carried out more than 3,416 terror events since 2009, leading to more than 36,000 fatalities. One of the better- known examples of Boko Haram's terror tactics was the 2014 Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls in Borno State, Nigeria. Boko Haram is believed to have links to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb dating back to at least 2010. In 2015 the group expressed its allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which ISIL accepted. Somalia's al-Shabaab and its Islamic extremism can be traced back to the mid-1970s when the group began as an underground movement opposing the repressive and corrupt regime of Siad Barre. Armed conflict between al-Shabaab and the Somali army – including associated human rights violations – has resulted in slightly over 68 million human displacements. Al-Shabaab is hostile to Sufi traditions and has often clashed with the militant Sufi group Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a. The group has also been suspected of having links with Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram. Among their best-known attacks are the Westgate shopping mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya, in September 2013 (resulting in 71 deaths and 200 injured) and the 14 October 2017 Mogadishu bombings that killed 587 and injured 316.Committee: 587 dead in Oct 14 terror attack Hiiraan Online, March 5, 2018 On September 1, 2014, a U.S. drone strike carried out as part of the broader mission killed al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane. The Insurgency in the Maghreb refers to Islamist militant and terrorist activity in northern Africa since 2002, including Algeria, Mauritania, Tunisia, Morocco, Niger, Mali, Ivory Coast, Libya, Western Sahara, and Burkina Faso, as well as having ties to Boko Haram in Nigeria. The conflict followed the conclusion of the Algerian Civil War as a militant group became al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Their tactics have included bombings; shootings; and kidnappings, particularly of foreign tourists. In addition to African units, the fight against the insurgency has been led primarily by the French Foreign Legion, although the U.S. also has over 1,300 troops in the region.

Poor health care, malnutrition, and Ebola are also serious problems. Over 25.5 million individuals infected with HIV/AIDS in 2015 were Africans. Most of these victims are middle-income or lower, and they depend on public health sources for treatment, but many medicines are unavailable due to cost, availability, and/or other factors such as transportation. South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia have made progress in local pharmaceutical productions; Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania are currently developing production capacity. 85% to 90% of malaria victims worldwide occur in Sub- Saharan Africa. Asia =China= Xi Jinping succeeded Hu Jintao as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and became the paramount leader of China in 15 November 2012. He immediately began an anti-corruption campaign, in which more than 100,000 individuals were indicted, including senior leader Zhou Yongkang. There have been claims of political motives behind the campaign. In 2018, he was effectively made a president for life. In Xi's foreign policy, China became more aggressive with its actions in the South China Sea dispute, by building artificial islands and militarizing existing reefs, beginning in 2012. Another key part of its foreign policy has been the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a strategy adopted by China involving infrastructure development and investments in countries and organizations in Asia, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-14/china-attempts-global- dominance-with-one-belt-one/8522974 China has signed cooperational documents on the belt and road initiative with 126 countries and 29 international organisations, where various efforts then went ahead on infrastructure. In the end of the decade, concerns started to grow about the future of the Chinese economy. These concerns included whether the United States and China could positively resolve their disputes over trade.Mood Shifts in U.S.-China Trade Talks Infect Markets Far and Wide, by Liz Capo McCormick December 6, 2019.Trump’s tricky decision: Hit Chinese goods with new tariffs or hold off? by Kayla Tausche, December 6, 2019. Hong Kong The 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, also known as the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill (Anti-ELAB) movement, is an ongoing series of demonstrations in Hong Kong triggered by the introduction of the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill by the Hong Kong government.The Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words, bbc.com, November 28, 2019. If enacted, the bill would have empowered local authorities to detain and extradite criminal fugitives who are wanted in territories with which Hong Kong does not currently have extradition agreements, including Taiwan and mainland China. This led to concerns that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jursidiction and legal system of mainland China, which would undermine the region's autonomy and Hong Kong people's civil liberties. As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, which were the withdrawal of the bill, investigation into alleged police brutality and misconduct, the release of arrested protesters, a complete retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \\"riots\\", and Chief Executive Carrie Lam's resignation along with the introduction of universal suffrage for election of the Legislative Council and the Chief Executive. =India= The decade started off with the Congress led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) in power. UPA had won a majority in 2009 for a second term which was marred by corruption allegations. Taking advantage of the UPA's growing unpopularity, The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) led by former Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi swept the polls in the 2014 general elections. Riding high on the wave of nationalism in the wake of attacks claimed by Indian authorities to have been orchestrated by Pakistan the Modi government relied heavily on anti-Pakistan rhetoric in successive elections. In 2016, a hard line Hindu monk associated with the BJP was elected chief minister of India's largest state who in turn pursued a policy of changing names of places with Muslim names to Hindu ones. The Indian government, during this time also massively increased its defense budget and enhanced defense ties with the United States and Israel. The relationship with Israel continued to bloom as Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit the Jewish state. Critics of the Modi government continued to level criticism at him for polarizing minorities, especially Muslims and changing the fabric of the Indian state by relentlessly pursuing the Hindutva ideology. In its second term in power, the BJP led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) became even more ideological in its pursuit of the Hindutva agenda. On August 5, 2019, the newly elected Indian government under a presidential order revoked Article 370 of the Indian constitution, thereby terminating the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and placed it under curfew. This move triggered widespread international condemnation and further aggravated relations with neighboring Pakistan. Later that year, the Supreme Court also delivered a verdict on the controversial Ram janam bhoomi case which called for a temple to be built on the disputed site while granting land to the Sunni Waqf Board for the establishment of a mosque elsewhere. Middle East Starting in 2010, Arab Spring led to major political upheaval across the region, leading to the violent repression of the Arab Winter. A Second Arab Spring started in the later part of the decade. =Iran= The 2019 Iranian protests are a series of civil protests occurring in multiple cities across Iran, initially from the 200% increase in fuel prices but later extended to an outcry against the current government in Iran and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.At least 7,000 people reportedly arrested in Iran protests, says UN, Agence France-Presse, Fri December 6, 2019. The protests commenced in the evening of November 15 and within hours spread to 21 cities as videos of the protest began to circulate online. Images of the violent protests were shared on the internet with protests reaching international levels. Although the protests began as peaceful gatherings, government crackdowns prompted a revolt against the entire Iranian government. The Iranian government employed lethal tactics in order to shut down the protests including a nationwide internet shutdown, shooting protesters dead from rooftops, helicopters, and at close range with machine gun fire. Although there is currently no conclusive casualty count current estimates suspect the government killed well over 1,000 Iranian citizens.U.S. says Iran may have killed up to 1,000 protesters The government crack down prompted a violent reaction from protesters who destroyed 731 government banks including Iran's central bank, nine Islamic religious centers, tore down anti-American billboards, and posters and statues of the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. 50 government military bases were also attacked by protesters. This series of protests have been categorized as the most violent and severe since the rise of Iran's Islamic Republic in 1979. To block the sharing of information regarding the protests and the deaths of hundreds of protesters on social media platforms, the government blocked the Internet nationwide, resulting in a near-total internet blackout of around six days.https://netblocks.org/reports/internet-disrupted-in-iran-amid-fuel- protests-in-multiple-cities-pA25L18b{Internet access is being restored in #Iran after a weeklong internet shutdown amid widespread protests; real-time network data show national connectivity now up to 64% of normal levels as of shutdown hour 163 #IranProtests #Internet4Iran https://netblocks.org/reports/internet-restored-in-iran-after-protest-shutdown last=NetBlocks.orgdate=November 23, 2019website=@netblocksaccess- date=November 24, 2019}}Iranian officials 'stealing bodies' from morgues to hide true scale of government crackdownMysterious Disappearances: Is Iran Stealing Bodies From Morgues to Disguise Crackdown on Protesters? =Iraq= The 2019 Iraqi protests, also nicknamed the Tishreen Revolution and 2019 Iraqi Intifada, are an ongoing series of protests that consisted of demonstrations, marches, sit-ins and civil disobedience. They started on 1October 2019, a date which was set by civil activists on social media, spreading over the central and southern provinces of Iraq, to protest 16 years of corruption, unemployment and inefficient public services, before they escalated into calls to overthrow the administration and to stop Iranian intervention in Iraq. The Iraqi government has been accused of using bullets, snipers, hot water and tear gas against protesters. Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi announced on November 29 that he would resign. According to the BBC, they call for the end of the political system which has existed since the US-led invasion ousted Saddam Hussein and has been marked by sectarian divides. It is the largest unrest since the Saddam Hussein government concluded. The UN Envoy for Iraq, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, called for renewed efforts to restore civil balance and protections for free speech.Protests and civil unrest show ‘renewed sense of patriotism’ in Iraq, UN envoy tells Security Council, United Nations., December 3, 2019.Denouncing attacks against Baghdad protesters, UN warns ‘violence risks placing Iraq on dangerous trajectory, December 7, 2019. =Israel= Benjamin Netanyahu remained in the office of the Prime Minister throughout the decade, becoming the longest holder of the office. Under his watch, the Jewish settlement movement has grown and gained influence, with at least 2,000 new homes built on the Palestinian territories each year, leading to a declining possibility for a two-state solution in the Arab–Israeli conflict. In 2014, there was a war in Gaza over Hamas rocket firings into Israeli cities, with a final death toll of 2,100 Palestinians and 73 Israeli citizens. The 2018–19 Gaza border protests demanded a right of return for those displaced from their homes during Israel's founding. Israeli security forces responded by firing at the protesters, killing 60 in a single day. In foreign policy, Israel continued the proxy conflict against Iran, with Israeli involvement in the Syrian Civil War and 2019 Israeli airstrikes in Iraq. In 2019, the country entered a political crisis following two hung parliaments and corruption charges against Netanyehu. Both the April and September 2019 elections failed to produce a majority in the Knesset for either Netanyehu, or his challenger, Benny Gantz, a former general. In November, Netanyehu became the first sitting Israeli leader to be criminally prosecuted, with charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust spanning several cases. =Syria= The 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria is a cross-border military operation conducted by the Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) and the Syrian National Army (SNA) against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and later the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) in northeastern Syria. On October 6, 2019, the Trump administration ordered American troops to withdraw from northeastern Syria, where the United States had been supporting its Kurdish allies. The military operation began on October 9, 2019 when the Turkish Air Force launched airstrikes on border towns. The conflict resulted in the displacement of over 300,000 people and has caused the death of more than 70 civilians in Syria and 20 civilians in Turkey. According to the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the operation is intended to expel the SDF—viewed as a terrorist organization by Turkey due to its ties with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), but considered an ally against ISIL by the United States and its allies—from the border region as well as to create a 30 km-deep (20 mi) \\"safe zone\\" in Northern Syria where some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey would resettle. As the proposed settlement zone is heavily Kurdish demographically, this intention has been criticized as an attempt to force drastic demographic change, a criticism denied by Turkey by saying that it only intended to \\"correct\\" the demographics that Turkish officials stated were changed by the SDF. The Syrian government initially criticized the Kurdish forces for the Turkish offensive, for their separatism and not reconciling with the government, while at the same time also condemning the foreign invasion in Syrian territory. However, a few days later, the SDF reached an agreement with the Syrian government, in which it would allow the Syrian Army to enter the SDF-held towns of Manbij and Kobanî in an attempt to defend the towns from the Turkish offensive. Shortly thereafter, Syrian state broadcaster SANA announced that Syrian Army troops had started to deploy to the country's north. Turkey and the SNA launched an offensive to capture Manbij on the same day. On October 22, 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan reached a deal to extend the ceasefire by 150 additional hours for SDF to move 30 kilometers away from the border area as well as from Tal Rifaat and Manbij. The terms of the deal also included joint Russian–Turkish patrols 10 kilometers into Syria from the border except in the city of Qamishli. The new ceasefire started at 12 pm local time on October 23. Although the main combat phase did end, post ceasefire operations are still ongoing.Turkey not resuming military operation in northeast Syria: security source Reuters, November 2019 As announced by Russia's Ministry of Defense on October 15, Russian forces have started to patrol the region along the line of contact between Turkish and Syrian forces, indicating that Russia is filling the security vacuum from the sudden US withdrawal. Alexander Lavrentiev, Russia's special envoy on Syria, warned that the Turkish offensive into Syria is unacceptable and stated that Russia is seeking to prevent conflict between Turkish and Syrian troops. The Turkish operation received mixed responses by the international community. Including condemnations as well as support for the operation for the settlement of refugees in Northern Syria. While originally acknowledging Turkey's \\"right to defend itself\\", on October 15, Russia hardened its position against the operation and deployed troops. Ten European nations and Canada imposed an arms embargo on Turkey, while the U.S. imposed sanctions on Turkish ministries and senior government officials in response to the offensive in Syria. Likewise, Trump's sudden pullout of US forces in Syria was also criticized by journalists as a \\"serious betrayal to the Kurds\\" as well as a \\"catastrophic blow to US credibility as an ally and Washington's standing on the world stage\\". On November 19, the Defense Department inspector general released a report finding that the American withdrawal and subsequent Turkish incursion allowed ISIL to \\"reconstitute capabilities and resources within Syria and strengthen its ability to plan attacks abroad\\". Changes in Syria diplomatic situation As a result of the Turkish incursion, multiple Kurdish groups that were once rivals have begun to seek greater unity.

Under his leadership, Turkey engaged in a more active foreign policy, including military intervention in the Syrian Civil War. In 2016, a coup attempt was launched against Erdogan, which failed. This led to extensive purges within the Turkish state in an effort to remove anti-Erdogan elements, claimed by the government to be connected to the preacher Fethullah Gülen and his Gülen movement. Over 150,000 civil servants have lost their jobs as a result. Erdogan has been criticized for undermining Turkish democracy, and for neo-Ottomanism. =Yemen= The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, is an intervention launched by Saudi Arabia in 2015, leading a coalition of nine countries from West Asia and Africa, in response to calls from the internationally recognized pro-Saudi president of Yemen Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi for military support after he was ousted by the Houthi movement due to economic and political grievances, and fled to Saudi Arabia. Code-named Operation Decisive Storm, the intervention is said to be in compliance with Article 2(4) of the UN Charter by the international community; but this has been contested by some academics. The intervention initially consisted of a bombing campaign on Houthi rebels and later saw a naval blockade and the deployment of ground forces into Yemen.Gatten, Emma. Saudi blockade starves Yemen of vital supplies, as bombing raids continue. The Independent. September 19, 2016. Retrieved October 23, 2016. The Saudi-led coalition has attacked the positions of the Houthi militia, and loyalists of the former President of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, allegedly supported by Iran (see Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict). Fighter jets and ground forces from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Academi (formerly Blackwater) took part in the operation. Djibouti, Eritrea, and Somalia made their airspace, territorial waters, and military bases available to the coalition. The United States provided intelligence and logistical support, including aerial refueling and search- and-rescue for downed coalition pilots. It also accelerated the sale of weapons to coalition states and continued strikes against AQAP. The US and Britain have deployed their military personnel in the command and control centre responsible for Saudi-led air strikes on Yemen, having access to lists of targets. The war has received widespread criticism and had a dramatic worsening effect on Yemen's humanitarian situation, that reached the level of a \\"humanitarian disaster\\" or \\"humanitarian catastrophe\\".; Original source: In 2019, the conflict's status was described as a \\"military stalemate for years\\". In April 2019, Trump vetoed a bipartisan bill which would have ended US support for the Saudi-led military intervention. With 53 votes instead of the 67 needed, the United States Senate failed to override the veto. The legal arguments and policies of the Obama administration were cited as justification for the veto. The US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy stated that US support was limited to side-by-side coaching to mitigate civilian casualties and if the measure had passed it would do nothing to help the people of Yemen and may only increase civilian deaths. Mulroy supported the United Nation's peace talks and he pushed the international community to come together and chart a comprehensive way ahead for Yemen. Writing in The Nation, Mohamad Bazzi argued that Mulroy's defence of US support as necessary to limit civilian casualties was false, and that \\"Saudi leaders and their allies have ignored American entreaties to minimize civilian casualties since the war's early days\\".

The EU was concerned about high rates of debt in France, Italy and Spain.EU concerned over France, Italy and Spain debts By Beatriz Rios  EURACTIV.com November 21, 2019. = France = The 2017 French presidential election caused a radical shift in French politics, as the prevailing parties of The Republicans and Socialists failed to make it to the second round of voting, with far-right Marine Le Pen and political newcomer Emmanuel Macron instead facing each other. Macron ended up winning both the presidency, as well as a legislative majority with his newfound party La République En Marche! In 2018–19, his leadership was challenged by the populist Yellow vests movement, which also rejected traditional parties. = Italy = The 2013 Italian general election led to a major change in the country's political landscape, as the traditional center-right and center-left parties were challenged by the new Five Star Movement, a populist party led by comedian Beppe Grillo. After the 2018 Italian general election, a coalition government was formed between the Lega Nord and Five Star Movement, becoming the first fully populist government in Western Europe. =Russia= Russia re-elected Vladimir Putin as the president in 2012 Russian presidential election. The election was marred by claims of fraud, contributing to the 2011–2013 Russian protests. Under Putin, Russia engaged in a more aggressive foreign policy, with the 2014 Annexation of Crimea and intervention in Ukraine following the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, the 2015 intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and interference in the 2016 United States elections. =United Kingdom= Following a hung parliament in the 2010 United Kingdom general election, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats formed the first coalition government in the country's history since World War II. A referendum on Scottish independence was held on 2014, returning a negative result. After the Conservatives were returned to power with a majority in the 2015 general election, a referendum was called on leaving the European Union, which led to the beginning of the process of UK withdrawal from the EU. In 2015, the Labour Party elected as its leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was considered the most left-wing leader of the party since Michael Foot (1980–83). The 2017 general election left the Conservatives with a minority government under Theresa May. In 2019, the Conservatives under Boris Johnson won the largest majority in the House of Commons since the 1987 election.  North America  Following pressure from the US President Donald Trump, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was superseded by the new United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). =Mexico= Felipe Calderón Hinojosa became the 56th president of Mexico (and the second from the conservative National Action Party) after a controversial election in 2006. He quickly declared a War on Drugs that ended up costing about 200,000 lives over the next ten years.Mexico's war on drugs: what has it achieved and how is the US involved?

Wilson, Brookings, November 19, 2009 In addition to the drug war, Calderon emphasized infrastructure development, foreign investment, and health care.

Mexico signed trade agreements with 46 different countries.Mexico's Economy Facts, Opportunities, and Challenges Kimberly Amadeo, The Balance, November 6, 2019 Calderon's drug war, which cost 47,000 lives during the last two years of his presidency (the balance), became the most important issue during the 2012 Mexican general election. The election was won by the former Governor of the State of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the political party that had dominated Mexican politics during most of the 20th century. Peña Nieto continued the drug war with no better success than Calderon had had.

Retrieved December 8, 2019 and the 2015 prison escape of notorious drug-dealer Joaquín \\"El Chapo\\" Guzmán. Peña Nieto was also personally wrapped up in a corruption scandal involving a US$7 million (MXN $100 million) house known as La Casa Blanca (\\"The White House\\") purchased by his showcase wife, actress Angélica Rivera. This was just one of many scandals that rocked his administration. Enrique Peña Nieto and Angélica Rivera were divorced months after he left office. Peña Nieto encouraged foreign investment, particularly in the automotive industry, and for the first time since President Lazaro Cardenas nationalized the oil industry in 1938, in the energy industry. He also tried to reform the country's educational system.Mexico's Pena Nieto enacts major education reform BBC World News, February 26, 2013 and began construction of a new airport for Mexico City.New airport plan for Mexico City eyes six runways: sources Reuters World News, June 19, 2014 President Peña was elected with by a slim plurality in 2012 with just under 39% of the vote, but by the time he left office in 2018 he had an 18% approval and a 77% disapproval rating, making him one of the least popular presidents in Mexican history. Andrés Manuel López Obrador (commonly called \\"AMLO\\") was a candidate for president for the third time in the 2018 Mexican general election, representing the Juntos Haremos Historia (\\"Together we will make history\\"), coalition. He won in a landslide victory, taking 53% of the vote. His platform called for: democratic rule of law (no more electoral fraud or vote-buying), self-determination in foreign policy, an end to corruption, decentralization of the government, agricultural revitalization, reversal of privatization of the energy sector, economic development (including increased aid for victims of the 2017 Puebla earthquake), increased pensions for the elderly, a reversal of Peña Nieto's educational reforms, and increased public safety by ending the drug war, granting amnesty to minor drug offenders, and reorganizing the police. Even before his inauguration in December 2018, Lopez Obrador held a referendum on canceling construction of the US$13 billion airport in Texcoco, State of Mexico and instead building one at the Santa Lucia Air Force base in Zumpango, State of Mexico. Nearly 70% of the voters who participated voted in favor of the Santa Lucia site, although it represented only 1% of eligible voters. Construction of the new airport at the Santa Lucia site began in October 2019 and is scheduled to open in March 2022. Controversy over the airport has shaken investor confidence, and the economy has stagnated or entered a slight recession. On December 27, 2018, AMLO initiated a crackdown on fuel theft by huachicoleros. This set off gasoline shortages in several states, and the Tlahuelilpan pipeline explosion of January 18, 2019, killed 137 in the state of Hidalgo. AMLO ended the drug war and established a National Guard, but violence continues to plague the nation: the government was forced to call off the arrest and extradition of Ovidio Guzmán López, son of notorious drug lord \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman, after the city of Culiacan, Sinaloa, was laid siege to by members of the Sinaloa Cartel; and three women and six children, all Mexican-American citizens and members of the LeBarón family were killed by presumed drug dealers in Sonora near the Mexico–United States border on November 4, 2019.9 members of American family, including babies, killed in Mexico ABC7 Eyewitness News, Chicago, November 5, 2019 It was reported that 2019 was the most violent year in Mexican history, with 29,574 homicides and femicides registered during the first ten months of the year. AMLO has run an austere government, cracking down on corruption, reducing government salaries (including his own), and selling off properties seized during drug raids as well as government vehicles, including the presidential plane. In foreign policy, Mexican-American relations have been strained by the immigration, tariffs, and the failure of the U.S. Congress to ratify the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement. President Donald Trump briefly threatened to label Mexican drug cartels terrorist organizations and even to send the U.S. military to fight them.Mexico Is Infuriated by Trump's Pledge to Designate Drug Cartels as Terrorist Organizations Time, November 28, 2019 In another foreign policy move, Mexico granted former Bolivian president Evo Morales political asylum after the coup d’etat in that country.Mexico offers former Bolivia president Evo Morales asylum The Independent, November 12, 2019 AMLO's approval rating dropped by 10% to 58.7% during the first ten months of 2019. =United States of America (USA)= = Obama Presidency = The most important action of Obama's first 100 days was the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to address the Great Recession. After much debate, ARRA was passed by both the House and Senate on February 13, 2009. Originally intended to be a bipartisan bill, Congressional passage of the bill relied largely on Democratic votes, though three Republican Senators did vote for it. The lack of Republican support for the bill, and the inability of Democrats to win that support, foreshadowed the gridlock and partisanship that continued throughout Obama's presidency. The $787 billion bill combined tax breaks with spending on infrastructure projects, extension of welfare benefits, and education. Wall Street reform Risky practices among the major financial institutions on Wall Street were widely seen as contributing to the subprime mortgage crisis, the financial crisis of 2007–08, and the subsequent Great Recession, so Obama made Wall Street reform a priority in his first term. On July 21, 2010, Obama signed the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the largest financial regulatory overhaul since the New Deal. The act increased regulation and reporting requirements on derivatives (particularly credit default swaps), and took steps to limit systemic risks to the US economy with policies such as higher capital requirements, the creation of the Orderly Liquidation Authority to help wind down large, failing financial institutions, and the creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to monitor systemic risks. Dodd- Frank also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was charged with protecting consumers against abusive financial practices. On signing the bill, Obama stated that the bill would \\"empower consumers and investors,\\" \\"bring the shadowy deals that caused the crisis to the light of day,\\" and \\"put a stop to taxpayer bailouts once and for all.\\" Some liberals were disappointed that the law did not break up the country's largest banks or reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act, while many conservatives criticized the bill as a government overreach that could make the country less competitive. Under the bill, the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies were required to propose and implement several new regulatory rules, and battles over these rules continued throughout Obama's presidency. Obama called for further Wall Street reform after the passage of Dodd-Frank, saying that banks should have a smaller role in the economy and less incentive to make risky trades. Obama also signed the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which created new rules for credit card companies. Technology The introduction of new 5G wireless technology caused major public discussion about possible security risks and safety risks. Many experts said 5G would require new methods to insure security of data.141 Cybersecurity Predictions For 2020 By Gil Press. The US Congress passed legislation regarding security concerns about 5G networks.House panel moves 5G protection bills, By Mark Rockwell, November 18, 2019.

The US government imposed strict controls on US companies as to their ability to do business with Huawei, thus disrupting sales of Huawei phones overseas.Huawei: Trouble overseas but boom time in China By Danny Vincent, BBC News, Hong Kong, November 26, 2019. Chinese vendors and the Chinese government have denied these claims. The development of the technology has elicited various responses and concerns that 5G radiation could have adverse health effects. An editorial in the scientific magazine Scientific American emphasized that complete scientific research regarding its effects have not been conducted and that there could be health risks.Moskowitz, Joel M., We Have No Reason to Believe 5G Is Safe , Scientific American, October 12, 2019 Wired characterized fears that the technology could cause cancer, infertility, autism, Alzheimer's, and mysterious bird deaths as \\"conspiracy theory\\".

Trump Presidency Donald Trump was elected the president in 2016, losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, but winning through the electoral college. An impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump was initiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on September 24, 2019, after a whistleblower alleged that President Donald Trump had abused the power of the presidency by withholding both military aid and a White House meeting as a means of pressuring newly-elected President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky to publicly announce investigations which would be damaging to Trump's political rival Joe Biden in the 2020 election. In October, three full Congressional committees (Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs) deposed witnesses including Ukraine ambassador Bill Taylor, Laura Cooper (the top Pentagon official overseeing Ukraine-related U.S. policy), former White House official Fiona Hill, and at least six additional White House officials. Witnesses testified that Trump wanted Zelensky to publicly announce investigations into the Bidens and Burisma and that Ukraine was pressured to release evidence that its government had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. On October 8, in a letter from Counsel Pat Cipollone to Speaker Pelosi, the White House officially responded that it would not cooperate with the investigation due to concerns including that there had not yet been a vote of the full House and that interviews of witnesses were being conducted behind closed doors. On October 17, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said, in response to a reporter's allegation of quid pro quo: \\"We do that all the time with foreign policy. Get over it.\\" He walked back his comments later in the day, asserting that there had been \\"absolutely no quid pro quo\\" and that Trump had withheld military aid to Ukraine over concerns of the country's corruption. On October 31, the House voted 232–196 to establish procedures for public hearings, which started on November 13. Private and public congressional testimony by twelve government witnesses in November 2019 presented a significant body of evidence indicating Trump demanded a quid pro quo of political favors in exchange for official action. The House Judiciary Committee hosted hearings on December 4 with more scheduled for December 9. On December 5, Pelosi announced that the House Judiciary Committee would begin drafting articles of impeachment. Once these are decided on, they are expected to be presented to the Senate for a trial and vote.

In Argentina the Peronist president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was replaced by the conservative-liberal Mauricio Macri in 2015; in Brazil, Dilma Rousseff's impeachment resulted in the rise of her Vice President Michel Temer to power in 2016; in Chile the conservative Sebastián Piñera followed the socialist Michelle Bachelet in 2017; and in 2018 the far-right congressman Jair Bolsonaro became 38th President of Brazil. =Bolivia= Starting on October 21, 2019, protests and marches have been occurring in Bolivia in response to claims of electoral fraud in the 2019 general election of October 20, 2019 and, subsequently, to Jeanine Áñez declaring herself the acting president of Bolivia. The claims of fraud were made after the suspension of the preliminary vote count, in which incumbent Evo Morales was not leading by a large enough margin (10%) to avoid a runoff, and the subsequent publication of the official count, in which Morales won by over 10%. Some international observers have expressed concern over these developments. While many of the demonstrations have been peaceful, there have been numerous acts of violence. Senior members of the Movement for Socialism (MAS) and their families were victims of attacks, including house burnings. Morales denied the allegations and invited foreign governments to audit the electoral processes, promising to hold a runoff if any fraud was found. Subsequently, an audit team from the Organization of American States, with access provided by Bolivian authorities, worked to verify the integrity and reliability of the results. Their preliminary report questioned the integrity of the election results and recommended another \\"electoral process\\". Morales announced the government would hold another election; however, the police and army demanded Morales's resignation on November 10, which he offered shortly thereafter. Following his resignation and the resignation of other senior MAS politicians, some citing fears for the safety of their families, Jeanine Áñez declared herself interim president and formed an interim government. Protests have continued, and several human right organizations expressed concerns over the excess use of force by the new government. = Brazil = President Dilma Rousseff was impeached and removed from office in 2016 following revelations from Operation Car Wash, a corruption investigation. Former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was also imprisoned. In 2018, far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro won the presidential election, partly owing to the fallout from the corruption scandal. =Chile= The 2019 Chilean protests are ongoing civil protests throughout Chile in response to a raise in the Santiago Metro's subway fare, the increased cost of living, privatisation and inequality prevalent in the country. The protests began in Chile's capital, Santiago, as a coordinated fare evasion campaign by secondary school students which led to spontaneous takeovers of the city's main train stations and open confrontations with the Carabineros de Chile (the national militarized police force). On October 18, the situation escalated as organized bands of protesters began vandalizing city's infrastructure; seizing, vandalizing, and burning down many stations of the Santiago Metro network and disabling them with extensive infrastructure damage, and for a time causing the cessation the network in its entirety. All in all 81 stations sustained major damage, includng 17 burned down. On the same day, President of Chile Sebastián Piñera announced a state of emergency, authorizing the deployment of Chilean Army forces across the main regions to enforce order and prevent the destruction of public property, and invoked before the courts the Ley de Seguridad del Estado (\\"State Security Law\\") against dozens of detainees. A curfew was declared on October 19 in the Greater Santiago area. Protests and riots have expanded to other cities, including Concepción, San Antonio, and Valparaíso. The state of emergency was extended to the Concepción Province, all Valparaíso Region (except Easter Island and Juan Fernández Archipelago) and the cities of Antofagasta, Coquimbo, Iquique, La Serena, Rancagua, Valdivia, Osorno, and Puerto Montt. The protests have been considered the \\"worst civil unrest\\" having occurred in Chile since the end of Augusto Pinochet's military dictatorship due to the scale of damage to public infrastructure, the number of protesters, and the measures taken by the government. On October 25, over a million people took to the streets throughout Chile to protest against President Piñera, demanding his resignation. As of October 26, 19 people have died, nearly 2,500 have been injured, and 2,840 have been arrested. On October 28, President Piñera changed eight ministries of his cabinet in response to the unrest, dismissing his Interior Minister Andrés Chadwick. On November 15, most of the political parties represented in the National Congress signed an agreement to call a national referendum in April 2020 regarding the creation of a new constitution. = Colombia = In 2016, the world's longest running war was brought to an end when the Government of Colombia and the rebel group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia signed a peace deal officially ending the Colombian conflict. =Venezuela= A crisis concerning who is the legitimate President of Venezuela has been underway since January 10, 2019, with the nation and the world divided in support for Nicolás Maduro or Juan Guaidó. Guaidó has been recognized as the acting President of Venezuela by 54 countries. Internationally, support has followed traditional geopolitical lines, with allies China, Cuba, Iran, Russia, Syria, and Turkey supporting Maduro; and the US, Canada, and most of Western Europe supporting Guaidó as acting President. As of late 2019, efforts led by Guaidó to create a transitional government have been described as unsuccessful by various analysts and media networks, with Maduro still controlling Venezuela's state functions.

The song was released on December 6, 2019 through Columbia Records. The song is a downbeat objection to the Christmas and holiday season, lyrically examining the passage of time and a disintegrating relationship. It was written by bassist Mark Hoppus, guitarist Matt Skiba, drummer Travis Barker, who also produced the song. Additional songwriting was handled by Matt Malpass, Aaron Puckett, JP Clark, and Mike Skwark. Critics were largely positive regarding the song, which did not chart commercially but peaked within Billboard national rock and holiday digital charts. Its music video was produced in claymation, and pictures the band performing for elves at the North Pole. Background The song was developed at Barker's studio space, Opra Studios, located in North Hollywood, California. Matt Malpass engineered the sessions. The track was composed by the band themselves, with additional songwriting from Malpass, Aaron Puckett (Lil Aaron), JP Clark, and Mike Skwark. Zakk Cervini, who had previously mixed the bulk of Blink's 2016 comeback record California, served as mix engineer. The song is not the first by the band to focus on the holiday season, but it is the first with Skiba. The group recorded \\"I Won't Be Home for Christmas\\" in 1997 with former drummer Scott Raynor and guitarist Tom DeLonge, which was released as a single in 2001. That same year, with Barker, the band included \\"Happy Holidays, You Bastard\\" in the track listing of their fourth LP, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. Lastly, in 2012, the band issued \\"Boxing Day\\"—the celebration taking place after Christmas—as a single to promote their Dogs Eating Dogs extended play. Lyrically, the narrative takes the typically high-spirited holiday celebrations into a metaphor for the passage of time, as well as a relationship falling apart. In the song, Hoppus laments that \\"depression's such a lonely business,\\" describing a pairing in which one partner is consistently angry and the other is often apologizing. He then has an idea for his perfect Christmas gift: \\"Why can’t we get divorced for Christmas?\\" Skiba provides backing vocals, singing \\"fa la la\\" in the chorus over a chorus of sleigh bells. Music video The music video for the song was directed by Johnny McHone, with its animation handled by production company dreambear. The video utilizes claymation stylistically, depicting Blink members Hoppus, Barker, and Skiba performing for a group of elves in the North Pole. A series of mishaps begin, resulting in the violent, bloody death of the elves. Reception Drummer Travis Barker, pictured here in 2019, produced the song. Barker first hinted at the song's development in a November interview. The group first teased the song on December 4, 2019, posting its single cover art on their social media accounts, followed by a proper announcement the next day. The single cover is a photograph of the clay versions of themselves from the music video, with the band name written in blood. The song was offered for download and streaming on December 6, with its music video premiering that day as well. On that date, the band also issued joint singles with DJ duo the Chainsmokers—the upbeat \\"P.S. I Hope You're Happy\\"—and a collaboration with the posthumous rapper XXXTentacion—\\"It's All Fading to Black\\". Commercially, the song failed to chart. \\"Not Another Christmas Song\\" did not enter the Alternative Songs chart compiled by Billboard, but it did peak at number 16 on the Rock Digital Song Sales chart. Likewise, it made an appearance at number 37 on the publication's Holiday Digital Song Sales chart in the week preceding Christmas. Jon Blistein at Rolling Stone complimented the tune as \\"mostly vintage Blink, with chugging pop-punk riffs during the verse opening up into a full-throated chorus — although there are some expertly placed sleigh bells in the mix as well.\\" Chris DeVille at Stereogum called it a \\"pretty good Blink-182 song,\\" while Nina Corcoran, writing for online magazine Consequence of Sound, concurred: \\"It's a pretty good song. Apart from the oversized production, it sounds like it could have been on Take Off Your Pants and Jacket — meaning it’s all jittery guitar, quick storytelling, and lyrics that mix remorse mix with youth.\\" Track listing * Digital download # \\"Not Another Christmas Song\\" – 2:39 Personnel Credits adapted from the official YouTube audio.

Born in Fürth, Carl completed an apprenticeship as a carpenter, and joined both the Social Democratic Party and the Building and Construction Union (IG BSE). With the encouragement of the union, he studied at the Dortmund Social Academy, and then became the union's full-time managing director for the Regensburg district. In 1961, Carl was elected as chair of the union's Bavarian region, and in 1968 he was elected to the union's national executive taking the lead on human resources and legal matters. The following year, he became vice president of the union, working under Rudolf Sperner. In 1982, Carl was elected as president of IG BSE, winning 319 out of 354 delegate votes. As leader of the union, he was regarded as a moderate figure, but a strong negotiator. Under his leadership, the union achieved a national standardisation of construction workers' wages, and the implementation of an early retirement scheme. He also introduced the first ecological initiatives, and oversaw the integration of the East German Building, Construction and Wood Union into IG BSE. Carl was involved in founding the European Federation of Building and Woodworkers in 1974. In 1985, he was elected as president of the International Federation of Building and Wood Workers, the first German to hold the role.

The seventh most senior daughter of the second Qajar ruler of Iran, Fath-ʿAli Shah, she served as private secretary to her father. The name usually used for her, Ziaʾ al-Saltaneh, meaning \\"Light of the Realm\\", was given to her by her father, and is an indication of his great love and respect for her.  Family  Ziaʾ al- Saltaneh's mother was Maryam Khanum, 39th wife of Fath-ʿAli Shah. From a Jewish family from Mazandaran, she was first married to Agha Muhammad Khan, uncle of Fath-ʿAli Shah and first of the Qajar rulers. Ziaʾ al-Saltaneh had four full brothers, Mahmud Mirza, Homayun Mirza, Ahmad-ʿAli Mirza, and Jahanshah Mirza, and one full sister, Sultan Begum. Late in life, she married Mirza Masʿud Garmrudi, then Minister of Foreign Affairs to Fath-ʿAli Shah's successor, Muhammad Shah. She was not raised by her own mother, but by the Shah's mother, the Mahd-i ʿOlya ('the Lofty Cradle'), Asiyeh Khanum. On the death of her grandmother, she inherited all of her jewels and other precious items. Ziaʾ al-Saltaneh would have four children of her own: Shahanshah Begum (b. ca. 1836; also known as Agha Jan), a second daughter, Mirza Hasan Khan (b.1839), and Mirza Husayn Khan (b.1843). She lived outside of the harem in her own apartments, a situation indicative of her high status. She also had her own minister, Shaʿban-ʿAli Khan.  Position at court  Ziaʾ al-Saltaneh was involved in many significant aspects of the running of her father's court. It is clear that she was particularly involved in the economic life of the court. For example, it is reported that when the Shah wanted to bestow a gift upon one of his harem, Ziaʾ al-Saltaneh would write to the Khazen al-Dowleh (State Treasurer), then Golbadan Baji, one of the wives of Fath-ʿAli, to report the gift, so that it could be properly recorded in the documentation of the treasury. There are records of anecdotes indicating that she shared the responsibility for the funds of the harem. For example, she was responsible for controlling the gambling funds of the princes - she would give them sums which they would have to pay back with interest. In addition to these responsibilities, as her father's favourite, she would organise his birthday celebrations, and every year on the occasion Fath-ʿAli would gift her a set of jewels. We know that she owned property, which is suggestive of her personal wealth.Qazi-ha, Fatima, “Shah Baygum Zia’ al-Saltana, dukhtar-i sha‘ir u hunarmand-i Fath-‘Ali Shah,” Ganjina-yi Asnad 56 (2005): 8–28 Perhaps most significantly, she acted as scribe for her father, with the title Munshi al- Mamalek-i Andarun, writing his personal letters for him. She also had control over the royal decrees issued from the harem. She was a highly skilled calligrapher, and produced a number of copies of the Qur'an, as well as other works such as collections of poetry, prayers, and pilgrimage texts.One of the Qur'ans copied by her is now housed in the museum of the shrine of Fatima Maʿsumeh in Qom, Iran. She was taught initially by her brother Maḥmud Mirza, but was later tutored by Mirza ʿAbbas Nuri (d.1839). In addition to her scribal duties, she would recite the poems sent to her father in his praise. She also seems to have been a patron of poetry, as the poet Rashha (b. circa 1783) composed poems in her praise. Her brothers are reported to have had as much respect for her as her father did. Her half-brother ʿAbbas Mirza, Crown Prince until his death in 1833, wrote of her: 'My soul to yours, beloved Ziaʾ al-Saltaneh,/ I have torn a hundred garments from grief/ At the thought of separation from you.' Her father also wrote verses in her honour, such as: 'Oh light of my eyes, Ziaʾ al-Saltaneh,/ One day away from you/ Is like unto a year for me.' Fath-ʿAli Khan Saba, the chief court poet, also wrote lines in her praise: 'Your moon, Shāh Baygum, from whose face and hair/ The morn of dominion is perfumed, and the king of the realm illumined.' It is clear that her brothers and other members of the court were aware of her influence with the Shah, and she would often be called upon to intercede for other members of the court. During the reign of Muhammad Shah, she continued some of her duties associated with the fiscal running of the court, and was one of the few relatives of the new Shah allowed to sit in his presence.  Poetry  As well as reciting the poetry of others, writing down that composed by her father, and acting as a patron, Ziaʾ al-Saltaneh also composed her own verses. Her poetry was recorded by her brother Mahmud Mirza in his anthology of women poets, compiled in 1825, at the behest of Ziaʾ al-Saltaneh herself.Tazkireh-ye Noql-e Majles; Brookshaw, D., 'Women in Praise of Women: Female Poets and Female Patrons in Qajar Iran', Iranian Studies, 46:1 (2013) For example: > 'Even though I am the daughter of the Shah/ And my crown reaches to the moon > from pride/ And all that I wish for is provided /In the way of carpets and > clothes, jewels and gold/ Horses and camels; female and male servants/ As > well as flocks, herds, and livestock,/ And I have abundant jewelry/ So much > that it cannot be counted,/ I have not bound my heart to any of these > things,/ For it is very difficult to detach one’s heart!' The 'bold, didactic tone' of these verses has been described as 'indicative of the princess's confident self-perception, erudition, and her political and economic power.'  Marriage  Ziaʾ al-Saltaneh did not marry during her father's lifetime. It is said that she refused all suitors. It has been suggested that she married Mirza ʿAbbas Nuri, only to divorce him soon after. This was said to have been a plot formed with Ḥaji Mirza ʿAbbas Aqasi to ruin Mirza ʿAbbas Nuri financially, but it has been noted that there is not sufficient evidence to support this claim. She was engaged briefly to her paternal cousin, Ḥosaynqoli Khan, son of Fatḥ-ʿAli Shah's brother of the same name. The author of the Qisas al-ʿUlama reports that Fath-ʿAli attempted to give her in marriage to a number of significant members of the clergy who all refused. Following the death of her father, she asked the new Shah, her nephew, Muhammad, to allow her to remain unmarried. However, she is also reported to have travelled to the shrine cities of Iraq (al-ʿAtabat al- ʿAliyat) shortly after Fath-ʿAli's death. While there she corresponded with a number of clerics, including Aqa Seyyed Mehdi, the son of Aqa Seyyed ʿAli Tabatabai, and Shaykh Muhammad Husayn Saheb-e Fosul, with proposals of marriage, but she was refused a number of times. At the age of 37, in 1835, Muhammad Shah insisted, on pain of execution, that she agree to marry Mirza Masʿud (1790-1848), then Minister of Foreign Affairs.  Death and burial  Later in her life, Ziaʾ al-Saltaneh moved to the city of Najaf in Iraq. She died in the nearby shrine city of Karbalaʾ where she also owned property. She was buried in one of the rooms of her house there, which is now incorporated into the shrine of Imam Husayn.

He played college basketball for the TCU Horned Frogs. Early life After he was born, Bane, his mother, Marissa, and his sister often moved around, living with relatives because his mother was young and not prepared for the demands of parenting. When he was two years old, he started living with his great- grandparents, who raised him in Richmond, Indiana for the rest of his childhood. At age 13, Bane discovered that his father, Etieno Ekiko, lived in Nigeria. Growing up, he found more success in baseball than in basketball but preferred the latter sport. Bane focused on baseball until eighth grade, with his great-grandfather coaching at the youth level, and also played football and soccer. High school career Bane played basketball for Seton Catholic High School, a small private school in Richmond, Indiana. He was drawn to the school because it appointed Josh Jurgens, who coached him in third grade, as head basketball coach during his eighth-grade season. As a senior, Bane averaged a state-high 30 points, 11.5 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 3.2 blocks per game. He scored a school-record 62 points and nine three-pointers in a win over Lincoln Senior High School. He was named MVP of the Wettig Memorial Holiday Tournament. Bane scored 1,991 points over his four-year career, surpassing 1988 Indiana Mr. Basketball winner Woody Austin for the most in Wayne County history. He did not receive an NCAA Division I offer until his senior season, when Furman offered him at the end of November early signing period. On May 12, 2016, Bane committed to play college basketball for TCU. He was not rated by major recruiting services 247Sports, ESPN, or Rivals. College career Bane earned Big 12 Newcomer of the Week honors after scoring 18 points and pulling down seven rebounds against Bradley. He had 16 points including three free throws with two seconds remaining to help TCU defeat first-ranked Kansas, 85–82, in the quarterfinals of the Phillips 66 Big 12 Championship. Bane helped TCU win the NIT as a freshman, contributing nine points in the title game against Georgia Tech. He averaged 7.1 points and 2.9 rebounds per game and making 13 starts. In an 89–83 victory over Iowa State, Bane scored a season-high 27 points. As a sophomore, Bane averaged 12.5 points and 4.1 rebounds per game and his 47.2% 3-point percentage led the Big 12. In the NCAA Tournament, Bane had five points, four rebounds, four assists, a steal, and a block in the first-round loss to Syracuse. As a junior, Bane was named to the Second Team All-Big 12. He had a career-high 34 points in the team's regular-season finale against Texas and scored 30 points versus Nebraska in the second round of the NIT. Bane averaged 15.2 points per game to lead the team, 5.7 rebounds per game and shot 42.5% from behind the arc. After the season, he \\"tested the waters\\" of the NBA draft but returned to TCU.

It chronicles the life of the late Chris Bell and his band, Big Star, from his childhood in 1950s Memphis through his posthumous releases of 2017 and 2018. The book's narrative is told through verbatim quotes in an oral-history format. In September 2020, the book was published as a traditional paperback by Post Hill Press, which is distributed by Simon & Schuster. The first, limited-edition version of the book was published in December 2018 by HoZac Books. About the book The 469-page book details the life of Chris Bell, best known as the founder of Big Star, the legendary and influential power pop band. The book weaves together memories from Bell's family, friends, bandmates, fans and associates. The book, which has received favorable reviews, was released in conjunction with a series of album releases from Omnivore Recordings, including The Complete Chris Bell box set, and a series of other 2017 and 2018 Chris Bell and Big Star releases. Aside from Bell's close friends, There Was a Light features memories and thoughts from notable Bell fans like Mike Mills of R.E.M., Chris Stamey and Mitch Easter of the dBs, Pete Yorn, Ivo Watts-Russell, Matthew Sweet and Rick Nielson of Cheap Trick, among others.The Big Takeover, Oct. 6, 2019 Reception The Chicago Tribune gave the book a positive review, stating: \\"Chris Bell, who with Alex Chilton co-founded the ahead-of-its-time Memphis band Big Star, died 40 years ago, before his accomplishments as a singer, songwriter and musical visionary could be widely acknowledged. Rich Tupica sets the record straight in There Was a Light: The Cosmic History of Chris Bell and the Rise of Big Star.\\" Meanwhile, Under the Radar said: \\"Rich Tupica's There Was A Light is the holy grail of information on Big Star and the late Chris Bell. An oral history spanning 400 pages, There Was a Light is exhaustive in its detail and entrancing in its storytelling. It is everything the obsessive Chris Bell/Big Star fan could dream.\\" The Memphis Flyer, a weekly publication that's covered Big Star's hometown legacy for years, said: \\"Tupica, a Michigan-based entertainment writer who's contributed to Record Collector, Uncut Magazine, and American Songwriter, has done his homework — and his legwork. Though he writes very little as an author, except a few explanatory notes to create the context, his five years of labor on this volume yielded interviews and archival quotes from dozens of people, requiring four pages to list them all at the end. The final product is an encyclopedic compendium of sorts, illuminating Bell's life from a thousand angles.\\" References External links * Simon & Schuster page for \\"There Was A Light *Billboard, May 2017 Category:2018 non-fiction books Category:Books about musicians Category:2020 non-fiction books ","title":"There Was a Light"},{"id":"62509260","text":"The 2019 Baltic Futsal Cup was held on 2-4 December 2019 in Raasiku, Estonia.

Born in Hanover, Hauenschild left school early due to economic hardship. He refused to join the Hitler Youth, and so was barred from his planned career in financial administration, instead becoming a clerk at a chemical company. In 1940, he was conscripted into the Wehrmacht and fought on the Eastern Front. He was wounded, and then later captured by American troops, becoming a prisoner of war. In May 1945, Hauenschild was released and returned to his job at the chemical company. He also joined the Social Democratic Party and a local forerunner of the Chemical, Paper and Ceramic Union (IG Chemie). From 1947, he worked full-time as a union organiser in Hanover, which also happened to be the headquarters to the co-ordination of the various zonal unions in the chemical industry. As a result, his skills were noticed, and he was given a leading role in organisation education within the union. Later, he was elected to the union's executive committee, with responsibility for organisation and administration. In 1969, Hauenschild was elected as president of IG Chemie, in which role he took the union to the right-wing of the union movement. A strong supporter of social partnership, he was criticised for conducting secretive negotiations with employers, and leading a top-down style of organisation. In 1970, he was additionally elected as president of the International Federation of Chemical, Energy and General Workers' Unions. From 1979 to 1980, Hauenschild served as a member of the European Parliament. He retired from his union positions in 1982.

Incumbent Benjamin Netanyahu defeated Gideon Sa'ar by a large majority.  Background  After the April 2019 Israeli legislative election, Netanyahu was unable to form a coalition by the deadline of 29 May. Instead of letting Benny Gantz attempt to form a coalition of his own, the majority of the Knesset dissolved itself, and a snap election was held on 17 September 2019. The second election was inconclusive, prompting warnings of a third election. The threat was deemed unacceptable by the opposition and the general public, and Netanyahu called on Gantz to form a national unity government, even offering to cede the top job some time in the future. Gantz rejected this offer, noting that Netanyahu's proposed unity government would include all of Netanyahu's right-wing allies, but none of Gantz's centre-left allies. Gantz also refused to sit with Likud as long as Netanyahu was its leader, due to the criminal cases against Netanyahu. In October 2019, amid coalition talks, Netanyahu indicated that he was considering holding snap primaries for party leadership. Gideon Sa'ar said in a tweet, \\"I'm ready.\\" After Netanyahu decided against holding a leadership election, Sa'ar said that he would run in the next election and would support Netanyahu until then. On 21 November 2019, Netanyahu was officially indicted for breach of trust, accepting bribes, and fraud. As a result of the indictment, some in Likud began to support Sa'ar in his bid for the chairmanship of the party. On 24 November 2019, Sa'ar asked the Likud Central Committee to schedule a party leadership race within two weeks. On 25 December 2019, Netanyahu said that if he won, there would be no elections for the party list in March.

He said, his main priorities within his first 30 days was to be a \\"very active, aggressive bridge builder, and public engager\\". On January 30 of next year, Cella met with Joseph Lengyel, who at the time, was a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to \\"emphasize the importance of Fiji’s State Partnership Program with the Nevada National Guard\\". Cella was also able to help the Fiji Red Cross Society set up a blood drive. He was their first ever blood donor. = COVID-19 pandemic = During the COVID-19 pandemic, Cella received an additional US$27.7 million for his ambassadorial countries, from the United States Agency for International Development. Cella obtained 1,400 liters of hand sanitizer, 1,000 boxes of sanitizing wipes, 9,000 face masks, 500 surgical gowns, and 50,000 pairs of latex gloves, and power generators from relief supplies, too. He also got Fiji's leading alcohol beverages manufacturer, Paradise Beverages Limited, to donate another 1,400 liters of manufactured hand sanitizers. General Manager of Paradise Beverages, Mike Spencer, said that \\"they were fortunate that the U.S. Embassy has come on board and contribute to this because if they did this themselves, they could not do it for long\\". Cella has been involved in on the ground charity work, helping the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission, during the pandemic. Cella's embassy has made donations to food banks that help people, and families impacted by COVID-19. In May 2020, Cella's Embassy requested grant proposals to \\"support economic resilience\\" in Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Tonga, and Tuvalu at the \\"grassroots level\\" during the COVID-19 pandemic. The grants were accepted on August 27, 2020. In July 2020, Cella joined Government of Fiji officials to launch “Health Care on Air\\", a radio program that \\"boosted the capacity of health workers to protect themselves and deliver quality health services to communities\\" during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Reforming the pensions was one of President Macron's promises and there are three primary proposals of the pension reform plan. The first is to create a universal state retirement plan, which would replace the 42 individual retirement plans that exist in France. The second is a \\"points system\\", to give a pension in proportion to the contributions paid. The third is to \\"improve the pensions of the most disadvantaged.\\" The result of the system would increase the retirement age of many jobs in France. The 2019 French pension reform plan follows the prior pension reforms in 1993, 2003, 2010, and 2013, but is far more comprehensive in that rather than adjusting the system. In September 2017, Jean-Paul Delevoye was appointed as High Commissioner for Pension Reforms, and was ordered to review the pensions system. In July 2019, he delivered a report of his recommendations, outlining the basics of a bill to be proposed to the National Assembly for pension reform. He resigned on 16 December after the press revealed he forgot to disclose 13 volunteer activities including a remunerated one for the French Federation of Insurances. Jean-Paul Delevoye was replaced by Laurent Pietraszewski, former employee of the French multinational retail group Auchan. If the bill becomes law, it will only come into force in 2025. Government ministers have claimed that the pension reforms will simplify a complex system, as well as making it fairer. Unions claim that the system will increase inequality between pensions and decrease the general level of the pensions. This is the longest strike in modern French history. After a month of protest, polling reported in Jan 2020 a 61% support in favour of the strikes in the French population. Background The strikes, led in part by the CGT but also by the UNSA, the FSU and Solidaires unions, began prior to the disclosure of the details of President Emmanuel Macron's plan to merge France's current 42 different pension schemes into one state-managed system. The French government maintains that merging the variety of profession dependent schemes is crucial. Unions say introducing a single system will mean millions of workers will end up working beyond the legal retirement age of 62 or receiving a far lower pension. Project The project itself was officially announced on 11 December. The mandatory impact study of the reform is to be released on 24 January with the submission of the project to the ministers. The government opted for an accelerated procedure with a submission to the House on 17 February. The new system will essentially work in the following way: * Workers will buy points and the number of points earned by year will depend on their salaries; * The amount of money devoted to buying the points will corresponds to 28% of the salary, 17% being paid by the employer and 9% by the employee; * The part of the salary above €10,000 (equivalent to US$11,148 and £8,569) per month will not give points but still 2.3% of it will contribute to the pension fund; * The buying value of a point may vary and will be decided by the State; * Once the legal age reached, points will be converted into pensions; * The value of a point upon conversion in pension may vary and will be decided by the State; * Additional points can be earned for years of maternity/paternity leave. The new system is criticised because of its differences with the current system: * it is impossible to predict the amount of a pension because it depends on the value of the point, which can vary over time; * because the pensions are calculated over the whole career and not only the best years, it will create more heterogeneity between pensions as is currently the case in Germany; * decreasing the maximum salary threshold from €29,000 (equivalent to US$32,329 and £24,858) to €10,000 will decrease the income of the pension fund by 4.9 billion euros (equivalent to 5.5 billion dollars and 4.2 billion pounds) per year; * imposing that the pension fund represents more than 14% of the NGP will decrease pensions. Initially designed to create a unique pension funds system in France, following the protest of the unions, the project has introduced 8 special plans for policemen, aeroplane pilots and stewards, train drivers, firemen, jailmen, truck drivers, fishermen and teachers. These plans were introduced to avoid strikes in critical sectors (police, air traffic) or to try to end ongoing strikes. French information website France 24 reported that women may be the \\"biggest losers\\" with the pension reform. Actions Strikes began on 5 December as more than 30 unions launched strike actions with the intention to shut down the country and force President Emmanuel Macron to reevaluate his plans for pension reform. Actions resulted in the Eiffel Tower being shut down along with most of the light rail lines in Paris. 6000 police were deployed in Paris alone in anticipation of the protests, particularly around the Élysée Palace which was barricaded. The protests became violent in the east of Paris where protesters were seen lighting fires and smashing windows. The police reported 65,000 people had demonstrated in Paris, while the CGT labour union suggested 250,000 people had turned out. While across the country the Interior Ministry said more than 800,000 people were protesting the CGT said the figure was 1.5 million. Strikes and protests continued on 6 December as unions said there would be no let-up. While some schools reopened, almost all high-speed train services were cancelled, most of the Paris metro remained shut down, and hundreds of flights were cancelled. Transport across the country remained paralysed on 8 December as strikes by state rail company SNCF and Parisian public transport group RATP continued into their fourth day. Unions announced they were planning another large demonstration on 10 December. On 12 December French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe unveiled the government's proposal for raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 and harmonizing the 42 different retirement schedules. The next day, the CFDT announced that it would be calling for its members to join the demonstrations on 17 December. To protest against the loss of their special regime, ballerinas from the Paris Opera performed Swan Lake in frontcourt of Palais Garnier on 23 December. Union workers from the electricity company EDF conducted operations to cut power of symbolic companies such as Amazon or deputies from Emmanuel Macron's party LREM, while also performing \\"Robin Hood\\" operations to put electricity back on to homes unable to pay their bills. In Caen, on 8 January 2020, dozens of lawyers threw their robes in front of the ministry of justice Nicole Belloubet as a sign of protest. Lawyers are also on strike protesting against the destruction of their profitable pension regime. During union demonstrations, the level of violence exhibited by the police, as already condemned by the United Nations during the yellow vests demonstrations, was extremely high with videos allegedly reporting a police officer firing point-blank at the protesters with a riot control gun on 9 January. On 25 January, French firefighters joined the protests. People rally on the street with Hong Kong anarchist flags, Antifa and Palestinian flags while together sang \\"L'Internationale\\" then shouted \\"Overthrow Capitalism!\\"; \\"Revolution now!\\" and there were several violent clashes with the police.  Conflicts of interests  Jean-Paul Delevoye, the High Commissioner for Pension Reforms, was revealed to be funded by the French Federation of Insurances, which has a direct interest in the pension reform. Moreover, being funded by a private company while being a member of the government is illegal according to the French constitution. Articles have also pointed out the proximity between Emmanuel Macron and BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset management funds, which is interested in having the billions of euros of the French pension fund enter the financial market. Multiple meetings between the French government and the firm's representatives have been reported. The promotion of the head of BlackRock's French branch, Jean-Francois Cirelli, to rank of officer of the Légion d'honneur also contributed to highlight this proximity. Reactions French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe stated that the nationwide strikes would not weaken his resolve to reform the pension system. The workers and most unions are not backing off either. Polling indicated a strong support of the population in favour of the strikes. According to the conservative newspaper Le Figaro, on 19 December 55% of French people found the movement against the pension reform justified. Two weeks later, in what had become the longest French strike over the last 50 years, 61% still found the movement justified. Crowdfunding initiatives to support the strikes have flourished with a national one collecting more than 2 million euros.

This subdivision allows the company to define the optimal purchasing strategies for each of the four types of purchases or suppliers. It is named after Peter Kraljic, who first formulated the model in an article published in the Harvard Business Review in 1983. Overview The Kraljic matrix defines the following types of articles: * Non-critical items: components that have a low impact on the company and that are found in abundance and / or in low-risk markets (e.g., office stationery). For such items, the goal should be to maximize efficiency of the procurement process to reduce the administrative burden, for example by delegating purchasing to local managers, or using catalogs. * Leverage items: components that are important for the company but sourced from low-risk markets with an abundant supply. As the name suggests, the optimal management of these purchase categories is essential to ensure a satisfactory business result. For this type of component, the company tends to make the most of its bargaining power and the abundance of the offer with frequent negotiations. * Bottleneck items: components with a low business impact in economic terms but where supply continuity is at risk. The management of these components should be aimed at creating relationships of collaboration in the medium-long term between customer and supplier to guarantee the supply, with less emphasis on the cost. * Strategic items: components that are important for the company both in terms of economic impact and for supply conditions from complex and / or risky markets. In this field, the horizon is medium-long term with a continuous monitoring of the economic situation of the market, technical evolution, evaluation of \\"make-or-buy\\", creation of alternatives and development of stable relationships and maximum collaboration with the suppliers. In its original form, Kralijic's matrix is used for the mapping of purchases, not suppliers. However, the matrix works equally well to distinguish different categories of suppliers.

Description The border starts in the north at the tripoint with Niger in the Niger River and then proceeds in a roughly south- to-southwesterly direction overland, before reaching the Okpara River just east of Waria. The border then proceeds to the south, utilising the Okpara for circa 100 miles, various small streams, and several overland sections, before terminating at the Bight of Benin. History During the second half of the 19th century France began creating small trading settlements on the West African coast. In 1851 a treaty of friendship was signed between France and the Kingdom of Dahomey in what is now southern Benin, followed by the creation of a protectorate in Porto Novo in 1863. The colony of Dahomey (the former name of Benin) was declared in 1894 and was later included within the much larger federal colony of French West Africa (Afrique occidentale française, abbreviated AOF) in 1899. Meanwhile Britain had (via the Royal Niger Company) administered the area around Lagos since 1861 and the Oil River Protectorate (Calabar are the surrounding area) since 1884. As Britain expanded into the interior, two colonies were created - the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and the Northern Nigeria Protectorate. In 1900 the administration of these areas was transferred to the British government, with the Northern and Southern (including Lagos and Calabar) protectorates united as the colony of Nigeria in 1914. A rough delimitation between the two territories as far north as the 9th parallel had been negotiated on 10 August 1889; this was further clarified in more detail via an agreement of 12 October 1896. An Anglo-French treaty of 14 June 1898 confirmed this border, and extended it northwards up to the river Niger. This border was confirmed by a treaty of 19 October 1906, with some minor changes made in 1912 following on-the-ground demarcation which were later finalised officially via an exchange of notes in 1914. The section between the Atlantic and the Okpara river was marked on the ground by 142 concrete beacons, the boundary being formed by a straight line between them. As the movement for decolonisation grew in the post-Second World War era, Britain and France gradually granted more political rights and representation for their African colonies. Dahomey declared full independence on 1 August 1960, followed by Nigeria on 1 October 1960, and their mutual frontier became an international one between two states. By 2004-05 many of the boundary markers from the original demarcation were missing, prompting Benin and Nigeria to re-demarcate some sections of the border.

Sasol has been the series' title sponsor and sole fuel supplier since its inaugural season. It has dubbed itself South Africa's \\"premier motorsport championship\\". The series is divided of two classes, namely GTC (which runs silhouette racing cars) and GTC2 (which runs production racing cars). History Following the folding of the National Production Car Championship in late 2015, South Africa lacked a premier touring car racing series. The Sasol GTC Championship (which had been in development for nearly four years), spearheaded by Vic Maharaj and Gary Formato, was given the green light by Motorsport South Africa in March 2015. The new series was set to be attractive due to its lower costs (reportedly R200,000 less for a season than the NPCC). All the cars would run identical six-speed Albins sequential gearboxes (identical to those used in the Supercars Championship), shock absorbers, suspension and brakes in order to aid cost-saving. The car regulations would be frozen for the series's first five seasons, and car development was banned. Originally slated to consist of four manufacturers (Audi, Ford, Nissan and Jaguar) fielding 12 cars between them, there were only 10 cars fielded in the inaugural race at Zwartkops Raceway. With Nissan and Jaguar completely pulling out before the championship even began, the series attracted Volkswagen and BMW to also enter two and four cars respectively. The inaugural season calendar consisted of seven rounds with two races each, except for the rounds at Killarney Race Track and Aldo Scribante, of which each had three races. It kicked off at Zwartkops Raceway on the 9th of August, seeing South African racing veteran Michael Stephen take the series's first ever victory. The season finale was staged at Prince George Circuit in East London, with Stephen being crowned the first Sasol GTC champion. Gennaro Bonafede finished as championship runner-up with five victories to his name. Cars GTC The cars consist of a single-specification tubular chassis with metal bodywork, supplied by the manufacturer. Each manufacturer also provides a turbocharged 2-litre petrol engine which produces a maximum of 436 bhp and 600 nm of torque. All cars are rear-wheel drive. The gearboxes are standardised Albins six-speed sequential gearboxes, the same gearboxes used in the Australian Supercars Championship. Suspension parts, dampers and brakes are also standard across all cars, and all cars run slick tyres provided by Dunlop. Traction control and Anti-lock braking systems are banned. Sasol provides fuel to all cars. The cars were anticipated to reach up to 280 km/h prior to the first season. Following a series of engine issues during the first round of the 2017 season, changes had to be introduced to lessen stress on the engines. This included setting an RPM-limit of 7200, as well as decreasing the absolute boost pressure of the turbochargers to 2100 millibar. GTC2 The GTC2 class allows for production racing cars only, also with 2-litre turbocharged petrol engines, but instead capped to 281 bhp. The cars have to be front-wheel drive and must keep their factory engines, gearboxes and dashboards. Limited- slip differentials are permitted in order to aid traction. They use steel tube roll cages built by South African ex-racing driver Etienne van der Linde. Unlike in the GTC Class, aftermarket shock absorbers are permitted, but are cost-capped at R50 000 per set. Each car is given one set of Dunlop slick tyres at the beginning of a season, and then two fresh tyres at each race. Champions Drivers { style=\\"font-size:100% - !Season!!GTC !!

On December 4, 2019, less than two months after the October celebration of the International Day for Disaster Reduction (IDDR), heavy rains precipitated the deadly series of landslides that followed later that night into the next day, affecting a total of 9,935 people in Nyempundu, Gikomero and Rukombe of the northwestern provinces of Cibitoke, bordering Rwanda, and Bubanza as well as the northeastern province of Cankuzo. At least 27 people died and 10 remain missing as of the December 11 human toll which is still expected to rise in the foreseeable future. 7 injured persons were admitted into Cibitoke referral hospital, 6 of whom have been discharged, and the seventh has been transferred to the Kigobe hospital, managed by Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders-Burundi (MSF-B). Significant property damage was incurred as well, leaving 1,081 people (551 females and 530 males) of 206 households (with approximately 5 persons per household on average) displaced. Another flood event happened on December 22 affecting 787 people in the northern neighbourhoods in Bujumbura. As per the Burundi Red Cross Society (BRCS) Rapid Assessment, the December 22 floods disaster affected 787 people (219 households), completely destroyed 47 households, partially destroyed 40 households and submerged 132 households. 33 people were reported injured and 14 people dead.  Background  Since January 2019, heavy rainfall has triggered flash floods, mudslides and landslides in various provinces, especially Bujumbura (Mairie and Rural), Cibitoke, Bubanza, Muyinga, Cankuzo, and Muramvya provinces. Resultingly, almost 13,000 people have been displaced, and 45 people have died. Furthermore, these natural disasters have caused extensive damage to infrastructure, and hampered access to essential sources of food, water, education and healthcare. There is also now an heightened risk of the transmission of the infectious disease due to the resulting proliferation of mosquitoes as vectors. As of September 2019, there are 103,412 Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Burundi, of which roughly 79,600 or 77% are displaced due to natural disasters (including over 8,400 displaced since January 2019), mainly in the regions bordering Lake Tanganyika, and the north-western and central provinces, according to the International Organization for Migration's (IOM) Displacement Tracking Matrix. According to the European Union's Directorate-General for European Civil- protection and Humanitarian-aid Operations (DG ECHO) the risk of natural disaster continue to increase day-by-day with the early onset of the Burundian September 2019 rainy season and above-average rainfall forecasted by the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (US NOAA). The US Agency for International Development's (USAID's) Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET) has reported that the greater horn of Africa region received up to 300 per cent above average rainfall from October to mid- November 2019. UNOCHA now considers Burundi to be among the twenty most vulnerable countries to climate change and natural hazards. East Africa currently experiences unseasonably heavy rains caused by the higher-than- average temperatures of the Indian Ocean, potentially due to cyclical dipole weather phenomenons and global warming. The heavy rains and previous floods which inflict Burundi appear to be the resulting manifestations of these factors. According to a Save the Children count based on United Nations and government figures, more than 1,200 deaths across East and Southern Africa have been caused by floods, landslides, and a cyclone this year. In addition, the UN has found that floods have displaced nearly half a million people in southern Sudan, 200,000 in Ethiopia and at least 370,000 in Somalia this year. In addition, soil erosion as a result of overgrazing and the expansion of agriculture into marginal lands, may have contributed to the Burundian susceptibility and vulnerability to devastating landslides. The recently launched Global Humanitarian Overview (GHO) indicates that Natural disasters pose substantial risks to the approximately 80 per cent of Burundians depend on subsistence farming, and that 1.74 million people will be in need in 2020.  Disaster  Since December 4, at least a dozen hills around Nyempundu, in Mugina commune in Cibitoke, were collapsed by severely damaging landslides, precipitated by torrential rains. An anonymous local Cibitoke provincial government official, reported to Reuters that victims were living on a hillside which gave way after the heavy rains of the day before. \\"They are still digging up dead bodies,\\" the official said. In an official Twitter post, the Ministry of Public Security has confirmed that much property was damaged in the disaster at least 26 people have died and 10 are missing. According to another ministry spokesperson, Pierre Nkurikiye, other provisional police reports indicate the deaths of at least some 38 people (three in Gikomero, 13 in Rukombe and 22 died in Nyempundu), though these reports are still provisional, and as of now, excavation and search-and-rescue (SAR) operations are still ongoing. Destruction and damage of key infrastructure – including homes, roads, and bridges – has been reported. Over 80 houses, 6 brides and roads, and 9 water access points have been destroyed, and crops continued to be destroyed in the immediate aftermath.  Response  On December 5th, the provincial Cibitoke Governor Joseph Iteriteka addressed victims of the disaster, thanking everyone involved in the management of the disaster. UNOCHA led an intersectoral team to gain access to these hard-to-reach affected areas to evaluate the destruction. The international community's willingness to help the affected people was communicated in a December 6 meeting with the Government's Provincial Platform, led by the Governor's Counsellor in charge of social affairs. The Government of Burundi's Civil Protection and Disaster Management Unit, the public provincial and communal administration, the (BRCS), the police, the army, the surrounding population, and the Cibitoke and Mugina Health Districts, have all deployed local emergency relief services. BRCS teams specifically have deployed 18 members many of which are trained in first aid, and Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) in emergencies. The UNOCHA intersectoral team concluded that the most pressing necessities in order of priority are: food and water, shelter and other non-food items (NFIs such as household kits, WASH kits, female dignity kits, school kits and monetary funds for such have been provided by IOM, World Vision, BRCS, UNICEF, UNFPA, the USAID OFDA, Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, and NGOs Help a Child, War Child Holland, Concern Worldwide & We World-GVC), psychosocial support, and access between hills and villages. Landslides washed away fields that were exploited by these populations, as well as their crops and food reserves, notably those by the Mubarazi river in Muramvya, and similarly much livestock. Water access points and sanitary facilities were washed away and what remains of them is under considerable strain due to high demand. There is also an increased risk of waterborne diseases. The mission noted that physical access to schools in the Nyempundu area is hampered by landslides that have cut off some roads, and that many schoolchildren in general have lost their school materials. On December 7, the National Platform for Disaster Management set up an Ad-hoc crisis management committee to manage the emergency headed by the Director of Humanitarian Action of the Ministry of Human Rights, Social Affairs and Gender. On the same day, 1,900 affected households received 28.5 tonnes of rice granted by the Ministry-led committee. This aid was deposited in the commune of Mugina, over 25 kilometres from the disaster site and to which the beneficiaries will have to travel to access. As of now, no provision has been made for people with special needs, and the relocation site identified in the village of Rusagara, not far from the shopping centre of the municipality of Mugina, was rejected for the second time by the BRCS. On December 8, the ad-hoc committee, noting that the response to needs would continue as sectors refine their data for a more consistent assistance, requested that the World Food Programme (WFP) carry out the food assistance, which began to distribute 15-day rations of beans, corn, oil and salt on December 16, that the visit to the relocation site be conducted quickly and that support be provided to all victims of the rainy season. UNOCHA concluded its December 8 \\"Flash Update No. 2\\" saying \\"The humanitarian community will continue to work with the Government's National Platform to reinforce this emergency response, as well as with local municipalities that are willing to support these relief efforts.\\" A week after the landslide, the burial of the recovered bodies, arranged by the BRCS in cooperation with the various Partner National Societies (PNSs) of the ICRC (Finnish Red Cross, Belgian Red Cross and East Africa Country Cluster Support Team), took place on December 12 in the Nyamakarabo area, but issues were still faced in the lack of assistance to the efforts of the authorities in conducting SAR operations, the extraction of corpses, and the evacuation of the wounded to nearby hospitals. In addition, access to the area remained hampered by landslides that damaged the roads and wooden bridges crossing the area that remained not allowing heavy machinery to pass through. On December 16, the IOM began requesting support from the BRCS to both arrange the procurement and distribution of half of the household kits each and other NFIs to accommodate for the displaced households who, in the meantime, were temporarily relocated to various communal spaces (i.e churches and schools) or hosted by community members. In addition Burundi and the UNOCHA intersectoral team announced their intention to begin the rehabilitation of a collapsed dam and reorienting the river to its initial direction. The IFRC concluded their operation 4 months following its beginning (December 23, 2019 - April 23, 2020), having allocated 82,628 Swiss Francs (~90,000 USD) to the disaster relief emergency fund (DREF).  Aftermath  As of December 31st, the UNHCR estimated there to be 209,179 Burundian people of concern in Tanzania. The rate of return of 2000 refugees per week planned by the Tanzanian and Burundian governments appear to have been strongly affected by the environmental situation. In November 2019 only one of the three transit centres was functioning, allowing only 409 Burundian refugees to return, the lowest rate since January. The UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) have both stated that the phenomenally heavy rains have contributed to a \\"serious and widespread desert locust outbreak\\". The Desert Locust Control Organization for Eastern Africa (the DLCO-EA which Burundi is not member to) noted the necessity for urgent and decisive action from all partners, as well as the resources to support large-scale ground surveys, aerial spraying services, provision of chemicals, information dissemination, and further capacity building for control operations. Forecasted heavy rains accompanied by flash flooding continued into approximately January 9. Since then only moderately light rainfall has been predicted and observed.

They work to count and monitor the registered charities operating in Canada in the fairest way possible. As of December 2014, there were 86 193 charities registered in the directorate. The Directorate is located in Ottawa, in the Canadian Revenue Agency offices.  Charity status   Definition  To gain charity status, organizations must first register with the federal Canadian Revenue Agency under the Income Tax Act. To be eligible for charitable tax status, charities need to provide a public benefit, such as poverty relief or education, and they are limited in their business and political activities, including making profit or engaging in partisan behavior. These limitations are to ensure charities keep to their primary goals and don't abuse their special status.  Benefits  Charitable status grants organizations exemption from income tax and provides the power to issue donation receipts, eligibility to receive gifts from fellow registered charities, and exempts goods and services provided by the charity from sales tax.  Special donor status  Certain donees have the ability to issue their own donation receipts like the Registered Canadian Amateur athletic association (RCAAA), foreign charities accepting gifts from her Majesty the Queen, universities outside of Canada and the United Nations.  Obligations  Registered charities have obligations linked to the status: they must devote and maintain control and direction of all of their resources while keeping them aligned with their purpose, they must file their T3010 Registered Charity Information Return annually, keep reliable records and books of activities, and they must maintain their status as a Canadian legal entity. = Political action = There are limitations as to how registered charities can intervene in political affairs. Political activities must be coordinated or subordinate to the charity's purpose, in no way partisan, and they must provide records of expenses related to such activities in their T3010 forms. The Directorate defines political activities as encouraging and mobilizing the public to try to change specific public policy, law or government decisions, or to engage in partisan activities. Public awareness and education are considered acceptable by the Canada Revenue Agency, as long as the information is sound and the content is not overly emotive. Public policy dialogue and development activities by charities (PPDDAs) by poverty relief, education, or religious organizations reinforce the charity's purpose if they are related to its stated purpose and provide a benefit to the public (see Policy statement CPS-024, Guidelines for registering a charity: Meeting the public benefit test)”.  Legislation   Establishing Law  The Charities Directorate of the Canadian Revenue Agency is delegated authority by the Minister of National Revenue to enforce provisions on registered charities and qualified donees under the Canadian Income Tax Act.  Activities of the Directorate  Ensuring Compliance The Charities Directorate is responsible for federal regulations on registered charities in Canada under the Income Tax Act, particularly compliance with information reporting requirements to maintain transparency and public accountability accountability (Prime Minister mandate letter to relevant minister:. To enable compliance with the Income Tax Act, registered charities must issue donation receipts for individual and corporate donations and are required to file annual tax returns. Compliance measures include education letters; compliance agreements, sanctions, including financial penalties; suspension of charities’ tax- receipting privileges as well as their status as qualified donees; and ultimately the revocation of charitable registration. The Directorate has the power to revoke the status of registered charities if they fail to file annual information returns, fail to spend their resources primarily on public benefit purposes, engage in partisan political activities, issue false gift receipts, or make gifts to other registered charities conditional on gifts in kind. The Charities Directorate auditing program is intended to maintain public confidence in registered charities. Beginning in the 2000s, the Charities Directorate has increased its unofficial mandate to include education of charities on regulatory compliance although this is still minimal. Information Collection The main activity of the CRA is the collection of the T3010 annual information return which describes the activities of all registered charities over the year. The T3010 form also provides information to the public about registered charities' activities. The T1236 form, Qualified Donees Worksheet, provides detailed information about the money given from one registered charity to another. Information Publishing As of 2019, the Canadian Revenue Agency website provides a search function to the public to check the status Canadian charities in order to help individuals' donation decision making. The contact information, activities, and financial information of all registered charities are available. There has also been a wave of modernization through the use of open data as a means of accountability, published in 2018 in the report \\"OPENING CANADA’S T3010 CHARITY INFORMATION RETURN DATA\\". As of 2013, the CRA has made efforts to be more transparent by making a data portal (https://open.canada.ca/en) available to Canadians, as a means for researchers to gather information on Canadian charities.  History  In 1967, the first registration of charities with the government occurred through the Canadian Revenue Agency, this led to the creation of the branch that would later deal with the eligibility and regulation of registered charities. Legislation On December 13, 2018, Bill C-86 received Royal Assent, which allows charities in the directorate to pursue political activities and policy-making as long as it is in line with the charities' purpose; except for direct or indirect action concerning political parties or public office candidates. Recent developments In 2013, the Director General released a statement giving an overview of how the Directorate works and recent statistics of efficiency. In 2014, the second update of the kind was released, covering new initiatives by the Directorate, along with an updated list of tools and statistics. In 2015, the last of these updates was posted. It presents an overview of legislative updates, auditing guidelines, specific limitations and staff changes. In 2019, the CRA amended its definition of political activities; now only requesting if the organization had any public policy dialogue and development activities (PPDAs) and to explain them. Recent controversy over the ability of U.S. donors to give to Canadian organizations could influence important crossborder issues, in particular oil pipelines, and has raised accusations of foreign intervention into Canadian affairs. Canadian federal tax legislation differentiates between Canadian nonprofit organizations and registered charities; Canadian nonprofit organizations (but not registered charities) can seek funding from US donors.

Similar to LAM-PCR, it employs multiple PCRs to amplify regions of interest that contain a specific insert that preferentially integrates into double-stranded breaks. As gene therapy is an emerging field, GUIDE-Seq has gained traction as a cheap method to detect the off-target effects of potential therapeutics without needing whole genome sequencing. __TOC__ Principles Conceived to work in concert with next-gen sequencing platforms such as Illumina dye sequencing, GUIDE-Seq relies on the integration of a blunt, double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (dsODN) that has been phosphothiorated on two of the phosphate linkages on the 5' end of both strands. The dsODN cassette integrates into any site in the genome that contains a double-stranded break (DSB). This means that along with the target and off-target sites that may exist as a result of the activity of a nuclease, the dsODN cassette will also integrate into any spurious sites in the genome that have a DSB. This makes it critical to have a dsODN only condition that controls for errant and naturally occurring DSBs, and is required to use the GUIDE-seq bioinformatic pipeline. After integration of the dsODN cassette, genomic DNA (gDNA) is extracted from the cell culture and sheared to 500bp fragments via sonication. The resulting sheared gDNA undergoes end-repair and adapter ligation. From here, DNA specifically containing the dsODN insert is amplified via two rounds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that proceeds in a unidirectional manner starting from the primers that are complementary to the dsODN. This process allows for the reading of the adjacent sequences, both the sense and anti-sense strands, flanking the insert. The final product is a panoply of amplicons, describing the DSB distribution, containing indices for sample differentiation, p5 and p7 Illumina flow-cell adapters, and the sequences flanking the dsODN cassette. GUIDE-Seq is able to achieve detection of rare DSBs that occur with a 0.1% frequency, however this may be as a result of the limitations of next- generation sequencing platforms. The greater the depth of reads an instrument is able to achieve, the better it can detect rarer events. Additionally, GUIDE-Seq is able to detect sites not predicted by the \\"in silico\\" methods which often will predict sites based on sequence similarity and percent mismatch. There have been cases of GUIDE-Seq not detecting any off-targets for certain guide RNAs, suggesting that some RNA-guided nucleases may have no associated off-targets. GUIDE-Seq has been used to show that engineered variants of Cas9 can have reduced off-target effects. Caveats GUIDE-Seq has been shown to miss some off-targets, when compared to the genome-wide sequencing DIGENOME-Seq method, due to the nature of its targeting. Another caveat is that GUIDE-Seq has been observed to generate slightly different off- target sites depending on the cell line. This could be due to cell lines having different parental genetic origins, cell line specific mutations, or, in the case of some immortal cell lines such as K562s, having aneuploidy. This suggests that it would pertinent for researchers to test multiple cell lines to validate efficacy and accuracy.

Scientific activity  Usmanov successfully defended his Ph.D. thesis: «Some boundary value problems for systems of differential equations with singular coefficients and their applications to bendings of surfaces with a singular point» / Tajik State National University, (1966) / and doctoral dissertation: \\"Study of the equations of the theory of infinitesimal bendings of surfaces with positive curvature with a flattening point \\", Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics, / Moscow State University M.V. Lomonosova, (1973) /. The scientific interests of the scientist: * Generalized Cauchy-Riemann systems with singularities at isolated points and on a closed line; * Deformation of surfaces with an isolated flattening point, a conical point, and a parabolic boundary; * Modeling the proper time of an arbitrary process; * Modeling of environmental, economic, industrial and technological processes; * Automation of information processing in Tajik.  In the field of theoretical mathematics  The theory of generalized Cauchy-Riemann systems with a singular point of the 1st and above 1st order in the coefficients, as well as with the 1st order singularity in the coefficients on the boundary circle, which was a natural generalization of the classical analytical apparatus of I. N. Vekua, developed to study generalized analytic functions. Based on the fundamental achievements in the development of the theory of generalized Cauchy-Riemann systems with singularities, in-depth studies have been carried out on the effect of an isolated flattening point on infinitesimal and exact bends of surfaces of positive curvature. Some progress has been made in solving the generalized Christoffel problem of determining convex surfaces from a predetermined sum of conditional radii of curvature defined on a convex surface with an isolated flattening point (together with A. Khakimov). For a wide class of natural processes described by ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations, natural metrics such as spatio-temporal Minkowski metrics are constructed, based on which a definition of the concept of the intrinsic time of a process and constructive methods for measuring it are proposed. Computational experiments have established the promise of using the new concept to increase the effectiveness of the prognostic properties of mathematical models.  In the field of applied mathematics  A mathematical model has been developed for the evolution of collection material of an arbitrary nature (together with T. I. Khaitov); a mathematical model for describing the evolution of spiral shells by the example of gastropods (together with M.R. Dzhalilov and O.P. Sapov); a mathematical model for determining the gradations of liver failure (together with H. Kh. Mansurov and others); mathematical model of the dynamics of the desert community of the Tigrovaya Balka nature reserve (together with G. N. Sapozhnikov et al.) Some of these results were noted in the reports of the Chief Scientific Secretary of the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences among the most important achievements of the USSR Academy of Sciences in the field of theoretical mathematics in the 70s years and twice in the field of computer science in the 80s. http://www.tajpers.narod.ru/cv_usmanov.htm  In the field of informatization of the Tajik language  Created a scientific school in computer linguistics in Tajikistan. He prepared 5 candidates of sciences in mathematical and statistical linguistics. As a leader and direct executor of works, together with his students, he carried out extensive research on the automation of information processing in the Tajik language.

When she reached age 14, her parents separated, and she moved with her mother to Ladbroke Grove. In April 2013, Crookes uploaded a cover of \\"Hit the Road Jack\\" by Ray Charles to YouTube at the age of 15. The video gained attention of over 600 000 viewers as well as her current manager.  Career   2016–2017: Influence  At the age of 17, Crookes released her debut single \\"New Manhattan\\" in February 2016, as well as \\"Sinatra\\" in August 2016, and \\"Bad Feeling\\" in June 2017. \\"New Manhattan\\" is a love song that was named after the area in Brussels. M Magazine wrote about Crookes at the start of her career, stating, \\"[She] may not be out of school yet, but what she lacks in experience she certainly makes up for in sonic dexterity.\\" When describing the aesthetic in Crookes' debut music video for \\"Sinatra\\", Pip Williams from Line of Best Fit wrote, \\"much like [her] sound, [the video] blurs the classic with the contemporary, blanketing the listener in nostalgia whilst teasing them with hints of something brand new.\\" Crookes released her debut EP, Influence, with Speakerbox and Insanity Records in July 2017. The five-track EP lasts less than 20 minutes and features \\"Sinatra\\", \\"Bad Feeling\\", \\"New Manhattan\\", \\"Mother May I Sleep With Danger?\\" and \\"Power\\". Crookes performed \\"Mother May I Sleep With Danger?\\" along with her guitar player Charles J Monneraud on the global music platform, COLORS, in December 2017. As of November 2019, the video gained over eight million views on YouTube. She told BBC that she wrote the song by herself on New Year's Day of 2017 and began playing the song on tour, stating \\"When you tour a song you get to know it - you stay over at its house, you meet its mum, you get to know the sibling it doesn't like. So by the time we did Colors, it was a walk in the park. The video really changed everything. For about six months after that, everywhere I went people would say, 'Are you Joy from Colors?'\\"  2018–2019: Reminiscence and Perception  Crookes released the single \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" with an accompanying music video in November 2018, before releasing her second EP, Reminiscence, in January 2019.

In September 2019, Crookes self-produced released \\"Yah / Element\\" a medley of \\"Yah\\" and \\"Element\\" by Kendrick Lamar, before announcing her sold-out headlining tour of Europe for October 2019. She released the single \\"Early\\" with Irish hip-hop artist Jafaris in early October, which later went on to reach No. 1 on the UK Asian chart. Crookes made her debut television appearance when she performed \\"Early\\" with Jafaris on Later... with Jools Holland in November 2019. Crookes made an appearance on the Irish music TV series Other Voices in November 2019. Crookes was shortlisted for Rising Star Award at the 2020 Brit Awards. She was placed fourth in Sound of 2020, an annual BBC poll of 170 music critics who predict breakthrough acts for the coming year. Crookes was praised her for her \\"South London stories filled with wit and romance\\".  2020–present: Debut album  In April 2020, Crookes released her first single of 2020, \\"Anyone But Me\\", which debuted atop the UK Asian Top 40. The song is about her battles with mental health and how she feels that \\"there's another person living in [her] head.\\" In September 2020, Crookes released a cover version of The Wannadies' 1994 single \\"You & Me Song\\", which was featured in an O2 TV advertisement, consequently entering both the UK Singles Downloads and the UK Singles Sales charts. Crookes told BBC that she would be releasing her debut album before her \\"self-imposed deadline\\" of May 2020.  Personal life and artistry  Crookes currently voices her anger at certain injustices and topics such as gentrification, racism, xenophobia, Brexit and feminism through Twitter. As of December 2019, Crookes has over 130 thousand followers on her Instagram account. Crookes tattooed the name of her Irish grandfather, Frankie Crookes, onto her arm before he passed away in 2018. In 2019, Crookes signed to the talent board of London modelling agency, Models1 Crookes has cited Black Uhuru, Marvin Gaye, The Pogues, Sinead O'Connor, Kendrick Lamar, Gregory Isaacs and Kate Nash as some of the names incorporated with her first experiences with music.

He was born in Kishinev, Russian Empire (now Chișinău, Republic of Moldova), to a Jewish family. His father was cantor in a synagogue, and also worked as an itinerant dentist; his mother was a midwife. He started playing the piano at the age of four, and showed such precocity that he was entered into the Kiev Conservatory when he was nine; but his professor there, Włodzimierz Puchalski, soon sent him to Moscow to study with Vasily Safonov at the Moscow Conservatory. Here he also studied composition, under Sergei Taneyev. He graduated at the age of sixteen, winning the gold medal of the Conservatory.Rachel Isserlis, Notes accompanying Julius Isserlis: Piano Music, Sam Haywood (piano), Hyperion Records, CDA68025, 2014. In 1907 Isserlis travelled to Paris to take lessons from Charles-Marie Widor. He made a brief trip to the United States, playing a concert in the Carnegie Hall, New York (having been recommended as a soloist by Alexander Scriabin). Returning to Russia, he was appointed as a professor at the College of the Imperial Philharmonic Society. In 1916 he met, and soon afterwards married, Rita Rauchwerger, a pianist from a wealthy family in Odessa. Their son George was born in 1917, the year of the Russian Revolution. In 1919 they attempted, unsuccessfully, to escape from Odessa on a British ship. Submitting to the new Communist regime, Isserlis was put work playing the piano for workers in factories and other institutions, often in harsh conditions.Peter Aspden, Cellist Steven Isserlis on his pianist grandfather and his compositions, Financial Times, 10 January 2014 In 1922 Isserlis was one of twelve musicians chosen by Lenin, who would be permitted to travel abroad as musical ambassadors for the newly-formed Soviet Union; none of the twelve returned to Russia.Steven Isserlis, What is it like to come from an intensely musical family?, New Statesman, 6 February 2014 Isserlis arrived in Vienna in 1923 with his wife and son, never to return to Russia again. Vienna had a very active musical scene, and he was able to build a career there as pianist, composer and teacher. He was in touch with other Russian emigrés; Nathan Milstein and Josef Lhévinne are among those known to have visited him during this time.Steven Isserlis, George Isserlis obituary, The Guardian, 24 July 2012 At the Anschluss in 1938, Isserlis, fortuitously, was on tour in Britain. He was granted British residency, and was soon joined there by his wife and son. Now in his fifties, he worked hard to rebuild his career as a pianist once more; he frequently featured on the BBC Third Programme,Steven Isserlis, How music saved the Isserlis family, The Jewish Chronicle, January 9, 2014 and he toured the country with the Wessex Philharmonic. In 1963 he developed Parkinson's disease, and he died in 1968 in London, at the age of 79. He is buried in Bushey Jewish Cemetery.Grave of Julius Isserlis Isserlis recorded very little; his one commercial recording, of Scriabin's 24 Preludes, Op. 11, was made after the effects of Parkinson's disease had started to affect his pianism. However, some recordings made in Poland before the War survive, as do several BBC tapes. His compositional output is small, and consists mainly of short piano pieces. One exception is the Ballade in A minor for cello and piano; this was dedicated to Pablo Casals, who corresponded with the composer suggesting various changes. Isserlis's most important influence was Chopin, and he was also inspired by Rachmaninoff, Ravel and Debussy. A recording of his music, played by pianist Sam Haywood (joined by cellist Steven Isserlis for the Ballade in A minor), has been issued by Hyperion Records. Isserlis's three grandchildren, Annette, Rachel and Steven, are all professional musicians. He is commemorated in Britain by the biennial award of the Julius Isserlis Scholarship by the Royal Philharmonic Society; the Scholarship was first awarded in 1980 following a bequest of Cecilia Helen Northcote.

Personal life In 1939, Leopold met his future wife, Helen, at a big-band dance at UC Berkeley where Helen was enrolled. He enlisted in the US Army in September 1940 while residing in Berkeley, California. Later that year Leopold and Helen married and moved to Carmel. They had four children: Mark, Laurel, Eric (d 1963) and David. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor his regiment transferred to Alaska. Following the war, the family relocated to Big Sur and again to Cambria. In the late 1960s as Leopold's attentions turned toward his increasing project workload, he suffered, according to his daughter Laurel, a mid-life crisis which lead to his marriage to Helen ending in divorce. Leopold stood trial in Washington for keeping his children out of public school. Albert Einstein submitted a letter in his defense. Leopold was reputed to have lived on 21 dollars a day, receiving financial assistance from friends including Henry Miller. During his final decade, he could be found holding court on a bench near the Cambria post office. Work Early career Taking Temperatures, 1943, painted during Leopold's service in the WWII War Art UnitLeopold studied with Maurice Logan at California College of Arts and Crafts. After enlisting in September 1940 for service in the US Army during World War II, he became the first officially designated US Army Combat artist, holding this role from 1940 to 1943. He also painted portraits of WWII combat generals. During WWII, while stationed by the US Army in Alaska to head the North War Art Unit, he met writer Dashiell Hammett and together financed a whorehouse there. Their friendship influenced Leopold's artistic philosophy, leading to a greater interest in the natural world and to a greater desire to lead a simplified life. He retired from the Army in 1948 and subsequently moved to Big Sur in the hope of meeting Henry Miller, whose books he had read while stationed in Alaska. Miller, after meeting Leopold, commissioned him along with sculptor Gordon Newell to build a studio addition to his home--work that was interspersed with \\"erudite Miller monologues, so we were educated while we worked.\\" Following completion, Leopold occupied the studio for a year in exchange for performing domestic duties for the Miller household. Architectural career Leopold designed his first residential structure in the late 1940s, building it on the Garcia River. While living in Big Sur, Leopold befriended modernist architect Rowan Maiden (1913-1957), who from 1939-1941 studied at Taliesin West under Frank Lloyd Wright, and who went on to design the landmark Nepenthe restaurant in the Organic tradition. His progressive philosophy influenced Leopold's burgeoning architectural vision. During 1947–1948, Leopold built his most notable structure, known as 'Crazy House', an artist's retreat located in Cambria that was conceived without right angles in its design. In the early 1960s, he left Big Sur to relocate to Cambria where he created designs for over 100 clients in Cambria, and Carmel, and Big Sur. From the late 1960s through the 1970s, his work enjoyed a devoted following among California Polytechnic State University architecture students. He discontinued his work as an architect during the final 15 years of his life due to his dissatisfaction with the increasing complexity of local building regulations. Leopold lamented, \\"Bureaucracy is killing the creativity in this country. All the forms you have to fill out now don't leave any room for imagination.\\" Leopold notably never obtained an architect's license, signing his drawings \\"Warren Leopold N.A.L.A.\\", the initials standing for \\"Not a Licensed Architect\\". The signature stood not only as a disclosure but an indication of his outsider philosophical posture.

It was first described from the West Indies but may have originated in northern South America. It has spread to other parts of the world and now has a near pan-tropical distribution, occurring in North, Central, and South America, Africa, southern Asia, and Australasia. Description The adult female redbanded thrip is about in length; the male is slightly smaller, but is seldom observed. The colour of both is black or dark brown with a reddish tinge, especially in the first three abdominal segments and the anal segments. The wings are dark. The nymphs and pupae are distinctively coloured being yellow or pale orange, with the first three abdominal segments and the tip of the abdomen being vivid red. Life cycle Adult female redbanded thrips live for about a month, during which time they lay up to fifty eggs which are produced by parthenogenesis. Each egg is deposited into the underside of a leaf, and covered by a drop of fluid which hardens into a protective black disc. After about four days, the eggs hatch into nymphs which have two instars. The nymphal period lasts for about nine days and is followed by two non-feeding stages, a pre-pupal and a pupal stage. The whole life cycle takes about three weeks, and there are several generations of the insect each year. Damage A large number of fruiting and ornamental trees act as hosts to this thrips. It is a significant pest of cacao and mango in the West Indies. The adults and nymphs insert their mouthparts into the epidermis of young leaves, killing the cells as they suck sap and causing leaf silvering or browning. The leaf margins crinkle and the leaves become distorted and covered with dark faecal pellets. In heavy infestations the leaves drop off the tree, which may become denuded. Fruit may also be attacked, developing a russet appearance with cracks developing and decay setting in.

Description The Arabian scad has an elongate and slightly compressed body with the upper and lower profiles being roughly equal. The eye is moderately large and has a well-developed adipose eyelid which normally covers almost all of the eye apart from a vertical oval with the pupil in the centre. It has a reasonably wide upper jaw which extends to underneath the forward anterior edge of the eye. The mouth is equipped with small teeth, having a single row in each jaw. It has two separate dorsal fins, the first having 8 spines with the second having a single spine and 28 to 35 soft rays. The anal fin has 2 detached spines to its front followed by a single spine and 24 to 30 soft rays. The pectoral fins are as long or longer than the length of the head. The scales in the lateral line and large and form scutes. It has a black spot on the upper margin of the operculum and the upper part of the body is dark dusky to almost black or greenish to bluish while the flanks and belly are silvery to white. The fins are not coloured It grows to a maximum total length of . Distribution The Arabian scad is found in the western Indian Ocean from the Red Sea and Somalia through the Persian Gulf east as far as Pakistan and south to the Saya de Malha Bank. It was recorded in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time off Turkey in the 2000s, probably having come through the Suez Canal as a Lessepsian migrant from the Red Sea. Habitat and biology The Arabian scad is semi-pelagic, demersal fish which forms schools in nearshore waters at depths between , but mostly frequently recorded in waters of less tha depth. It apparently is not recorded where the water temperature is below or where the saturation level of oxygen is less than 30%. Sexual maturity is reached in the fish's first year of life when it attains a length of . In the seas off Oman, however, sexual maturity was attained at about in total length for males and for females. spawning takes place in the Gulf of Oman from August to November, peaking during September and October. They reach is at least seven years of age and the estimated generation length is three and a half years. Its diet consists largely of fish fry and small crustaceans. Fisheries The Arabian scad is caught as bycatch in some fisheries and is often discarded due to its low market value. It, and two congeneric species, are targeted by purse seine fisheries in the Gulf of Suez, while in Somalia it is targeted by subsistence and artisanal fisheries. Taxonomy Trachurus indicus was described in 1966 by the Soviet ichthyologist V.V. Nekrasov as the subspecies indicus of Trachurus mediterraneus with the type locality given as the Gulf of Aden. It is now considered a valid species.

Synopsis During a trip to their cabin in the woods so that the father Dan can work on his paintings, the Papadakis family experiences supernatural phenomenon that prompts them to seek out someone who can rid their house of ghosts. The first person they hire, the laid back Joey, confirms that their house is haunted by two ghosts but tells them that there is no need to get rid of them, as the ghosts are benign and the phenomenon was only them trying to make contact. Unhappy with this, Dan chooses to hire demonologist Os on the recommendation of his friend George, who claims that Os can effectively exorcise ghosts. Dan chooses to remain in the cabin with Os, who proves to be a very eccentric person prone to over-imbibing and periodic rages fueled in part by his impending divorce. His actions periodically make Dan uncomfortable, however the two bond one night after Os captures one of the two ghosts. Os tells Dan a story about how he caught gonorrhea from the Devil, who appeared to him as a beautiful woman, and Dan confesses that his paintings, which depict a black circle in the middle of a canvas, have no deep meaning to them despite the public claims stating otherwise. Eventually Os's actions become too much and Dan deliberately lies that the remaining ghost left the home due to Os's actions. The two celebrate by drinking aged canned wine, however the following day Os claims that the second ghost has returned. Dan admits that he lied due to Os's strange actions and states that the two are not really friends, which hurts the other man. Shortly thereafter Os comes to the conclusion that Dan accidentally opened up a portal to another realm, bringing over a demon that possessed Dan's son Jazz. Unconvinced, Dan demands that Os leave the cabin, only to be knocked out and tied up. While he is unconscious Dan's wife Mary and son Jazz arrive at the cabin and are also captured and handcuffed. Os makes several attempts to exorcise Jazz using wind-up toys and cards featuring naked women, which bewilders Jazz, who claims that he is not possessed. Upset that he is not making any headway, Os calls a priest for advice and is advised to kill the demon inside Jazz. He chooses to do so by burying Jazz alive as he had several other items during the course of the film to supposedly rid them of their power. Left alone in the cabin, Mary and Dan witness the supposedly captured ghost wander into the room and drop the handcuff key, implying that Os is not actually able to get rid of ghosts. Now free, Dan manages to overpower Os and free his son just as the police arrive. The film ends with Dan and his family going to the hospital for care and Os in jail.

This was followed by a home video release on Blu- ray and DVD on July 18, 2017 through Dark Sky Films. Reception Critical reception for Another Evil has been mixed and the film holds a rating of 65% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 23 reviews. Common criticism for the film centered upon the mixture of horror and comedy, which Trace Thurman of Bloody Disgusting has stated is \\"one of the most difficult sub-genres to pull off\\" and that Another Evil did not do successfully. The performances of Zissis and Proksch were more favorably received by reviewers for outlets such as Collider and RogerEbert.com. Gareth Jones of Dread Central gave Another Evil 3 1/2 stars, noting that it wasn't as successful as the movie Creep as \\"the threat doesn’t quite feel as prevalent here, with the film definitely erring more often on the funny side – but it remains a highly entertaining, subtly tense jaunt through genre-tinged territory and is more than deserving of your attention.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety was also critical, writing that \\"It doesn’t bore, but at 90 minutes it lacks the kind of heft, hilarity or other assertive quality that render its pleasant-enough progress memorable.\\" References External links * Category:2016 films Category:2016 comedy horror films Category:2016 comedy films ","title":"Another Evil"},{"id":"62510982","text":"Gerald Mills Hendrie, (born 28 October 1935; at Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex), is an English scholar, composer, organist, pianist and harpsichordist.

Descending from the Barha Dynasty,best known for being de facto rulers over much of South Asia at the start of the 18th Century, the dynasty ruled Imperial viceroyalty of Punjab an area comparable in size to Germany, Denmark and Austria. With their borders reaching the edge of Delhi the dynasty had almost complete control over the affairs of the Indian Emperors.  History  The dynasty rose to prominence with the first Nawab of Rohilkhand, Nawab Ali Mohammad Khan. It is a branch of one of the influential Barha Dynasties best known as de facto rulers of South Asia in the early 18th Century and agnates of the 15th Century Emperors of India. The dynasty descends in the male line from the fourth Rashidun Caliph, Ali, through his younger son Hussain who married Shahrbanu, herself a daughter of the Sassanian Emperor of Persia, Yazdegard III. Due to Ali's status as an Adnanite, the dynasty can trace its ancestry to the Biblical Prophet Abraham through his eldest son Ishmael. As a boy, Ali Muhammad Khan was adopted by the chief of the Barech Tribe, Sardar Daud Khan Rohilla. The term Rohilla refers to Pashtun settlers of India and was adopted by the family in consequence to their election as chiefs of the Rohilla. He was a member of the Barha Dynasty by birth. The Barha dynasty arrived from Arabia, where constant rebellions against various Caliphs had led to heavy persecution. Barha dynasty founder Abul Farah al Wasti and his four sons entered the military service of Sultan Muhammad of Ghor and received twelve fiefdoms in Punjab, then a part of the Ghor Empire, as a reward. Thus the dynasty became quickly established as Nobles of the Sword in ancient India, a status they held under several different empires. They held a particularly high status under the Sultanate of Delhi. The Chief of the Barha, who was also the Diwan of the empire, was granted the fiefdom of Saharanpur due to his relationship with the imperial family. They also enjoyed prominent positions under the reign of the Sur. They eventually defected during the last days in the reign of Sikander Sur of the Sur Empire, to Emperor Akbar of the Mughal Empire in the course of the siege of Mankot. The Barha dynasty, with the Rohilla branch, maintains a unique status as the only dynasty to participate in all three Battles of Panipat, seminal battles that shaped Indian History. They fought under the Lodi in the First Battle. In the Second Battle they gained victory under Bairam Khan, and finally in the Third Battle, the sons of Nawab Ali Muhammad Khan Rohilla fought with Ahmed Shah Abidali against the Maratha. By the time of Emperor Aurangzeb, the Barha dynasty was firmly regarded as \\"Old Nobility\\" and held the premier realms of Ajmer and Dakhin, which were usually reserved for members of the Imperial Family.  Formation  Ali Mohammed Khan attracted many Afghan adventurers by virtue of his great reputation and became the most powerful man in Katehir. Conscious of his own power and the failing state of the Mughal Empire, he neglected Imperial mandates and irregularly paid tax to the central government. Using the income from his lands to raise troops, purchase artillery and military stores and curry favour with political persons of interest. He used the same tactic to gain favour with the lower rungs of society. By his invasion of Nadir Shah in 1739 he strengthened his position with many Afghans joining him. By 1740 he was officially recognised by the Emperor Muhammad Shah as governor. For the subsequent five years, his authority was unchallenged. In 1745 a quarrel arose between Ali Mohammed and Safdar Jang the Subedar of Oudh. Ali's retainers seized the property of servants belonging to Safdar. Safdar was already jealous at Ali's growing power. He went to Emperor Muhammad Shah, and through him ordered the return of the confiscated property as well as the arrest of the Rohillas in charge of the confiscation. After Ali's refusal, Safdar led an Imperial expedition together with the Emperor. Ali's men deserted and he was captured and taken to Delhi. He was treated respectfully by the Emperor, in large part due to his influence among his many adherents. Ali was propitiated by an appointment as Governor of Sirhind (the area between Jummuna and Sutlej). In 1748 an invasion by Ahmed Shah Abidali allowed Ali the opportunity to return to Katehir and re- establish his rule. Upon his return, he was rejoined by most of his men and became virtually independent in his control of Rohilkhand. To ensure loyalty almost all positions of power were given to Afghan and several including Najib-ad-daula received land grants.  Second generation  On his deathbed, Ali Mohammad anointed his foster uncle Rehmat Khan as \\"Hafiz\\" (protector) of Rohilkhand and Dundi Khan as Chief of Army. He had already planned the division of his realm among his sons and received Rehmat Khan and Dundi Khan's solemn oaths that they would execute his will and protect the interests of his children. A council was created of the Rohilla Chiefs in part to keep a check on Rehmat Khan and Dundi Khan and to provide a government that would safeguard Rohilkhand from invasion. All carried out solemn promises to carry out their duty, but they all reneged and sought to establish their own autonomy. This led to a confederation-like structure of government with the Nawab of Rohilkhand at its head and the Rohilla Chiefs in charge of individual Rohilla States answering to him especially in regards to military engagements. Ali's realm was divided in such a way so as to create discord. Nawab Abdullah Khan and Nawab Murtaza Khan were given shared rule over Badaun. Nawab Alah Yar Khan and Nawab Saadullah Khan were given shared rule over Moradabad, Nawab Faizullah Khan was given rule over Rampur and Nawab Muhammad Yar Khan was given rule over Barielly. In 1754 Hafiz Rehmat Khan orchestrated an argument within the royal family and used it as a pretext to usurp the power and wealth of the orphans. Disgusted, Muhammad Yar Khan along with his older brother Abdullah Khan and younger brother Allah Yar Khan left for Oojanee.. Nawab Alah Yar Khan died of consumption, Nawab Murtaza Khan left for Secunderabad where he passed away. Nawab Saadullah Khan was appointed Nawab of Rohilkhand. Later, Nawab Abdullah Khan and Nawab Muhammad Yar Khan were granted land again. Nawab Muhammad Yar Khan was given rule over Aonla and his court at Tandah was famed for poets such as Qaim and Mushafi.  Relations with the British  The dynasty was highly regarded by the British for their \\"determined bravery\\". The Rohilla Wars were the most costly for the British against any Indian Kingdom. The ensuing guerrilla war forced the British to grant the Rohillas a Princely State wheresoever they willed, leading to the creation of Rampur. Their bravery, tolerance and progressive rule gained them admiration. They were called upon by the British for aid in the Anglo-French Wars. Burke described the Rohillas as \\"the bravest, the most honourable and generous\\" and the Nawab of Rampur became the first Indian Sovereign to meet Queen Victoria along with several other European Monarchs..

Biography Jacques Morgantini was born in Montbéliard, eastern France in 1924. He became a jazz fan after hearing his father's records, and while studying chemistry in Toulouse organised a conference on jazz music addressed by Hugues Panassié, the influential critic who was the president of the Hot Club de France. Panassié invited Morgantini to become vice-president of the Hot Club, and in 1945 Morgantini set up the Hot Club de Pau. He started developing a network of contacts in the U.S., which provided a basis for him to invite American jazz and blues performers to perform in France. In 1951, with the support of the Hot Club of France, he invited Big Bill Broonzy to perform in the country.

Retrieved 5 December 2019 He worked as a salesman for an electrical company, and met Marcelle Chailleux at a conference he organised in Pau to discuss blues music. Marcelle, born in Sarthe, had been a fan of classical music but was drawn by the emotional power of the blues. They married in 1963. Through Jean-Marie Monastier, the owner of a record store in Bordeaux and later the founder of the Black & Blue record label, they invited further groups of blues musicians to play in France, including the Chicago Blues Festival tours managed by Monastier which featured such musicians as Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, T-Bone Walker, Memphis Slim and Koko Taylor . Some of the musicians, including John Lee Hooker and Memphis Slim, were recorded by the Morgantinis, either in their studio at their home in Gan, or in live performance, and their albums were released by Black & Blue. The Morgantinis became friends with many of the performers, notably Jimmy Dawkins and Fred Below, who told them that several leading blues performers in Chicago had never been recorded. With their son Luc, Jacques and Marcelle Morgantini travelled to Chicago in the early 1970s, where they were guided around clubs by Dawkins, Below and Andrew \\"Big Voice\\" Odom. In 1975, Marcelle and Luc, together with Monastier, returned to Chicago determined to record struggling performers. She set up her own label, MCM Records, the name deriving from her initials, and on two trips in 1975 recorded club performances by Willie Kent, Willie James Lyons, The Aces, Jimmy Johnson, Luther Johnson, and Bobby King. The following year, she recorded Dawkins, Odom, Eddy Clearwater, Magic Slim, John Littlejohn, Hip Linkchain, and Andrew \\"Blueblood\\" McMahon. Her final visit to Chicago clubs in 1977 resulted in recordings by Jimmy Johnson and Robert \\"Big Mojo\\" Elem, but in 1978 financial difficulties led to the closure of the MCM label. \\"Disparition de Marcelle Morgantini\\", Soul Bag, 1 November 2007.

The blues was in transit at the time these recordings were made. In the work of Jimmy Dawkins, Magic Slim and Willie James Lyons, you can hear the seeds of blues-rock being sown.

He wrote articles on the music, and liner notes, and helped launch the RCA France \\"Black and White\\" blues series, many drawing on his own record collection. He produced the Jazz Forever and Blues Forever series of CDs in the 1980s, before creating a series of compilation CDs for the EPM label and for Frémeaux & Associés as well as the Riverboat series of albums of jump blues musicians.

He dropped out of FIT in 1956 before graduating after he was told there were no jobs for black designers and the Dean suggested he start looking for jobs as a presser.  Career  He spoke openly about being treated poorly in design offices in the early years and being assumed to not be the fashion designer, even when he was dressed in designer clothing, because he was black. In his early jobs he was allowed to create the fashion designs and build the clothing for the firm, but he was not allowed to use his own name. He opened up a small space in Greenwich Village and sold clothing to a few celebrities one weekend, and from then he had work from Broadway shows needing costumes.

He was most active in design between the 1960s until the 1980s. His designs were sold at larger department stores, and in many cases these were the first time the stores carried any African American fashion designers work, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale’s, Henri Bendel, and Bergdorf Goodman. Some of his clients included Lena Horne, Sybil Burton, Cicely Tyson, and Stevie Wonder. He designed musician Dexter Gordon's custom suit he wore to the 1987 Academy Awards when he was nominated for an Oscar for the film Round Midnight.  Death and legacy  McGee died July 1, 2019 at the age of 86, in a nursing home in New York City after a long battle with illness. McGee was a mentor to fashion designer, Willi Smith. And McGee influenced many younger designers of the 1970s including, Stephen Burrows, Scott Barrie, B. Michael, Jeffrey Banks, and James Daugherty. His work is included in various public museum collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, National Museum of African American History and Culture, among others.

Federally, Bill C-337 was introduced by Rona Ambrose, former interim Conservative leader, in 2017 as a response to national outrage against Robin Camp, an Alberta judge who resigned from the Federal Court in 2018 after allegations of mishandling a sexual assault case heard in his court. Certain Canadian provinces, like Prince Edward Island have also adopted legislative initiatives to introduce mandatory sexual assault training for provincial judges. There have also been non-governmental efforts to spread the prevalence sexual assault education to Canadian judges.  History  Canadian studies conducted on sexual assault allegations found that incidences of sexual assault are consistently under-reported, under-investigated, and under- convicted. Data reported that one in five sexual assault allegations in Canada are dismissed by Canadian law enforcement as unfounded. Findings from the 2014 General Social Survey on Victimization find that 83% of sexual assaults remain unreported, and that those participating in the survey cited distrust of the police, the court, and the criminal justice system as barriers to reporting. In 2014/2015, less than half of all sexual assault trials resulted in a conviction, and of those convictions, 57% resulted in a custodial sentence, and 18% resulted in probation. In Canada, criticisms that judges re-victimize complainants by relying on stereotypes and rape myths during criminal proceedings and decisions have led to calls for judges to become more thoroughly informed and trained on how to proceed in such trials.  Current policies   Canadian Federal Government  Bill C-337, An Act to amend the Judges Act and the Criminal Code, also known as the Judicial Accountability through Sexual Assault Law Training Act or the JUST Act, was proposed in February 2017 by Ambrose as an attempt to improve public confidence in the Canadian criminal justice system. Although the bill passed unanimously in the House of Commons in 2017, it died on the floor of the Senate in 2019 as the Senate retired before the 2019 federal election. As Bill C-337 was a private members bill, other governmental bills took precedent. Bill C-337 intended to amend the Judges Act in order to ensure those judges selected for judicial appointment had previously completed sexual assault law and social context education. Furthermore, it ensured that judges would be held accountable for their actions, mandating that the Canadian Judicial Council regularly reported on education seminars and that judges provided rational for their decisions on sexual assault cases. Although the bill did not pass in 2019, the Liberal, Conservative, NDP and Green parties have all committed to supporting the re-introduction of the bill as a government bill in the new Senate session.  Prince Edward Island  In Prince Edward Island, Bill 110, the Mandatory Sexual Assault Law Education Act, was introduced and subsequently passed. This amendment prohibits judges who have not completed recent and comprehensive sexual assault education from appointment as lawyers. In an effort to increase transparency, this law also mandated that plans for this sexual assault education are available to the public. This bill was introduced by Conservative MLA Jamie Fox. It received Royal Assent on December 5, 2018. = Non-Governmental Efforts = The National Judicial Institute has introduced a week-long course, provided to all Supreme Court justices who have begun placements within the last five years. This course is meant to deal with the social and legal aspects of a criminal trial focusing on sexual assault allegations.

History The synagogue was the main religious building of Slonim's then numerous and influential Jewish community. The building was erected in 1642 and was initially part of the town's fortifications system. In 1881 the synagogue was heavily damaged in a fire. During the Second World War, almost the entire Jewish population of Slonim was murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. The building was left untouched by the German Luftwaffe during World War II, but has subsequently deteriorated. After the war, the Communist administration used the building as a furniture warehouse.slonimsynagogue.org - History In 2001, after the restoration of the independence of Belarus, the building was returned to the Belarusian Jewish community. Current state The synagogue is standing but in a dilapidated condition. It is listed by the private World Monuments Fund as their top priority site of Jewish interest in Eastern Europe that requires restoration. British TV personality Natasha Kaplinsky was the subject of one of a series of BBC television programmes, Who Do You Think You Are?. Kaplinsky visited the synagogue, it having been the place of worship of her great-grandparents. Her cousin sang a lament in Hebrew in the synagogue. Restoration project Under Kaplinsky's initiative, a steering group has been established under the auspices of the Foundation for Jewish Heritage to restore the Slonim Synagogue and to make it a “major educational facility, cross-cultural meeting place, memorial, place of worship, and a cultural centre ensuring that the Great Synagogue has a sustainable future”.slonimsynagogue.org - Vision The steering group includes Britons and Americans with family links to the Jewish community of Slonim and the architect Tszwai So.slonimsynagogue.org - People Gallery File:Synagogue in Slonim by Valery Sliunchanka 1.09.1975 Watercolor.JPGSlonim Synagogue, 1975 painting by Valery Sliunchanka File:Słonimskaja synagoga.

He also studied humanities and philosophy under Père de Merville, professor of Mathematics at the Collège des Jésuites. At 17, he joined the First Musketeer Company. After three years of service in the Musketeers of the Guard, the King granted him the position of Captain-Colonel of the Hundred Swiss, his father resigning in his favour. He was commissioned on 28 November 1754 and, the next day, promoted to Colonel, so as to be able to serve in the Army when the Swiss could not, as they were obliged to always stay with the King himself. In 1757, Montmirail's uncle Marshal d'Estrées joined the Army and Montmirail was appointed his aide-de-camp. He took part on the Battle of Hastenbeck.

She enjoyed her time in Europe, and has said that whilst in Germany and Switzerland she experienced less racial bias than she did during her time in America. On returning to the States Bryant-Friedrich first worked at Wayne State University, but when it became obvious that she would not be awarded a tenure- track position, she looked for other options. Byrant-Friedrich joined Oakland University as an Assistant Professor in 2000. She was awarded an National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2003, which allowed her to study the chemical processes that damage DNA and RNA. She moved to the University of Toledo in 2007. She studies the mechanisms by which small molecules interact with nucleic acid. Her research involves the synthesis of modified nucleosides and nucleotides, monitoring the intercalation of small aromatic systems into DNA via the design of novel chromophores and the creation of probes that contain nucleic acids to study events that occur around DNA. She has studied the protection of small nuclear RNA (snRNAs) from oxidative damage, which typically damages cells. As snRNA is essential for the function of spliceosome, this type of damage can impact the structure and function of the spliceosome.  Academic service  In 2020, Bryant-Friedrich was named the Dean of the Graduate School at Wayne State University. Additionally, she was hired to teach at Wayne State's College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, where she would run a laboratory to conduct research. In 2016 it was announced that Byrant-Friedrich would become the Dean of the College of Graduate Studies at the University of Toledo.She holds various honorary positions, including commissioner for the Lake ErieCommission. She has simultaneously held leadership roles in the American Chemical Society Division of Toxicology and Medicinal Chemistry. Alongside her research and administrative duties, Byrant- Friedrich works to support women and minority scientists.  Awards and honours  Her awards and honours include: * 2015 University of Toledo University Women’s Commission * 2018 Elected a Fellow of the American Chemical Society * 2019 Girl Scouts of Wesern Ohio Women of Distinction * 2019 Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science *2020 YWCA Northwest Ohio Milestone Award for science  Personal life  Byrant- Friedrich was profiled in She is married to Klaus Freidrich with whom she has two children.

Dickson flew 68 mission in World War II before he was forced to eject from his aircraft over Austria in 1944. Dickson was declared missing in action. On July 27, 2018, Dickson's remains were identified by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. Military service The Tuskegee Airmen's aircraft had distinctive markings that led to the name, \\"Red Tails.\\" Dickson graduated from Tuskegee in Alabama March 25, 1943. He was sent to Italy and assigned to the 100th Fighter Squadron, 332d Fighter Group. On December 23, 1944, Dickson was on his 68th mission piloting his aircraft as part of a mission to Praha, Czechoslovakia. On the return flight he ejected from his P-51 aircraft over Austria. The aircraft was flipped upside down and Dickson was declared missing in action. Early in the mission Dickson reported engine trouble and notified his base in Ramitelli, Italy that he needed to return. Dickson broke from the mission and two wingmen escorted Dickson's sputtering plane. The trio gradually lost altitude, and Dickson looked for a spot to land or bail out. One of Dickson's wingmen (Martin) thought they were near the town of Tarvisio, in a mountainous area of northeastern Italy. Dickson's two wingmen followed but they were forced to take evasive action when Dickson's plane sputtered and dove: Dickson's engine trouble was catastrophic and he was forced to eject over Hohenthurn, Austria. One of Dickson's wingmen insisted that he saw Dickson eject but the December snowfall complicated the search for Dickson's white parachute. Dickson was declared missing in action. After the war it was revealed that German records had reported that a P-51 plane crashed at that site the day that Dickson disappeared. During World War II the United States Army was segregated and black pilots had different rules. The black pilots of the Tuskegee Airmen could not qualify for R&R; until they completed 70 missions. White pilots could take R&R; after 50 missions. Dickson was on his 68th mission when he went missing over Austria. Recovery and burial On July 27, 2018, Dickson's remains were identified by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. A local researcher named Roland Domanig discovered the crash site and the human remains. The researcher said he visited the site in the 1950s as a child, but had not discovered the remains until 2002. An archeological crew was sent to the site in 2017 and they recovered bone fragments which matched Lawrence Dickson's daughter's DNA. Also recovered at the crash site was a 14-karat ring with an inscription that was inscribed: “P.D.,” with a heart with an arrow through it. The ring also was inscribed “L.E.D. 5-31-43.” P.D. were the initials of his mother Phyllis Dickson. L.E.D. Lawrence E Dickson and May 31, 1943, was his 23rd birthday. The Army also recovered a remnant of a harmonica and a small cross. On March 22, 2019 Lawrence E. Dickson was laid to rest in a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. Four Air Force jets flew overhead while his daughter and grandchildren attended. His daughter Marla accepted the folded American flag from a kneeling Army General.

He was the author of several influential books on religious themes, and a memoir. History Hussey was born in Wimborne, Dorsetshire or Kennington, London, the second son of George Edward Hussey of Poole, Dorset, who claimed Norman descent, and Catherine Hussey, née Burt. Hussey was educated at a dame school in a house once occupied by the poet William Cowper, and was first employed as office boy for a firm of brewers. In March 1839 George and Catherine Hussey and four of their children left for South Australia aboard Asia, arriving at Holdfast Bay on 16 July. The two eldest children, George Edward and Mary Ann, if surviving, do not appear on the ship's passenger list. The family, with hundreds of others, camped at \\"Emigration Square\\" on the parklands west of Hindley Street, Adelaide, later found accommodation on Hindley and Rundle streets. Business Hussey found work selling bread door-to-door, as an office boy, on coastal shipping and other endeavours. In 1840 he moved with his father to Port Adelaide, and in August 1841 found employment as a compositor with the printer George Dehane, working on his short-lived newspaper The Adelaide Independent and Cabinet of Amusement. He tried country life for a while, but returned to Dehane's printery, where he was involved in production of the first number of John Stephens' The Adelaide Observer (1 July 1843). His father ran a \\"bazaar\\" selling small luxuries, coupled with a land agency, on Hindley Street, at that time Adelaide's premier shopping strip, sharing the premises with his wife Catherine, who started a millinery business. He had plans to move his place of business to the newly developing Port Adelaide, but died in September of the following year. Mrs Hussey's business flourished, and she built new premises on King William Street, between Rundle and Grenfell, in August 1844. By 1844 Hussey was an ardent church-goer, attending the (Anglican) Trinity Church, adjacent to Dehane's printery. He left Dehane and joined the staff of the General Post Office, delivering letters to the east side of the city, but after a few months returned again to the print shop. In 1850 he was able to branch out on his own, and in January 1851 printed the first issue of The Church Intelligencer and Christian Gleaner, a subscription monthly edited by Archdeacon Hale and the Revs. W. J. Woodcock and W. H. Coombs. This publication ceased in April 1852, at a time of recession brought about by the rush to the goldfields of Victoria. Hussey took over printing and publication of The Register, up to that time handled by William Kyffin Thomas, commencing with the issue of 11 February 1852. Kyffin Thomas returned to the newspaper early in the new year (he had been at the goldfields). Hussey returned to job printing in July 1853 from premises on King William Street, opposite the Southern Cross Hotel. In 1854 he took on J. T. Shawyer as partner David Gall was admitted to the partnership in July 1855, trading as Hussey, Shawyer and Gall on King William Street, \\"near Green's Exchange\\", which may have been the same premises at 47 King William Street later described as \\"adjacent Green's Auction Mart\\", \\"at the end of a long passage\\". Shawyer left in 1856 to open his own printery on Gawler Place, and Hussey and Gall continued to March 1857. In December 1853 his mother sold her premises on King William Street to F. H. Faulding for £1,000 and reopened on O'Connell Street, North Adelaide. She apportioned her windfall gains to her children; Henry used his share to purchase further blocks of land: one on Victoria Square, one on Wellington Square, one at Goolwa, and one at Port Elliot. From January to December 1854 Hussey (or Hussey & Shawyer) published The South Australian Sunday School Magazine In July 1858 he published the first number of the monthly quarto The Christian Advocate and Southern Observer. At some stage Gall took over publication and the quarter beginning July 1859 may have been its last. Rather than retire from business altogether, Hussey accepted a position in the Government Printing Office. In 1866 George Fife Angas, a wealthy pastoralist and member of Hussey's church, offered him a position as his private secretary, succeeding William Ramage Lawson, who had embarked on a career in journalism. Among his duties was the selection and collection of personal papers for a biography of the great man. He also assisted him in founding the Bushman's Home, opened on the south-east corner of Whitmore Square, a building previously the city residence of Judge Cooper, in May 1870/ Religion Although already a regular churchgoer, Hussey's interest in religion quickened around the time he started at Dehane's printery on Morphett Street and became involved with the nearby Trinity Church. From 1844, at age 18, to 1851 he conducted Bible classes for children of the church. He was at Holy Trinity during the incumbency of Colonial Chaplain C. B. Howard and James Farrell, a pre-millenarian, who may have ignited his preoccupation with the Second Coming and Scriptural prophesies. He moved to North Adelaide, and started a Sunday School at Christ Church on 23 December 1849. In March 1853 he was licensed as a lay reader by Bishop Short. He was invited to a preliminary meeting held 8 February 1853 to start a local chapter of the Young Men's Christian Association (now YMCA) by Charles Henry Goode. (Goode was one of its first members in London, and a close acquaintance of founder George Williams.) The formation meeting, held four months later, was addressed by W. Roby Fletcher. In April 1854 Hussey left the printing business in the hands of his partner, John Thomas Shawyer (1825–1895), and left on a trip to the United States, visiting Tahiti and Panama on the way. He had previously had misgivings about the baptism of children, and while in the United States he came under the influence of the \\"Disciples of Christ\\", whose tenets included adult baptism by total immersion. He was baptised by its founder Alexander Campbell (1788–1866) at Bethany, Virginia on 6 August 1854. He continued to England, where he prepared his book The Australian Colonies for publication. On his return to South Australia after more than a year's absence, he lectured at the Bible Christian Church, whose views on baptism were similar to his own, at their chapel in Franklin Street (later known as Maughan Church). He attracted some followers in the districts south of Adelaide such as McLaren Vale, and baptised them in local rivers. He frequently preached at the \\"Christian Church\\" (closely allied with the \\"Disciples of Christ\\" or \\"Christian Disciples Church\\"), which had a chapel in Bentham Street, founded October 1848, whose pastor was Thomas Playford. They built another church in Grote Street around 1857, greatly enlarged in 1873. A dispute arose in the church, and Hussey and others broke away, and for a time met in J. L. Young's schoolroom on Gawler Place. The nature of the controversy is not known, but a common source of disagreement was the use of certain musical instruments in church: some arguing that only activities mentioned in Scripture were allowed, others that what is not forbidden may be permissible. He was one of many Protestant leaders who decried the failure of the Marriage Bill before the House in December 1866, its failure being applauded by the Catholic hierarchy. He was secretary to the committee formed for drafting the second Marriage Bill, which passed both houses in December 1867. Hussey was involved in the elections of 1871, when he helped return John Pickering to the seat of West Torrens. He once declared himself a candidate for public office (Encounter Bay in 1875) but dropped out after faring poorly at a public debate. It has been asserted that he withdrew following criticism from some fellow-religionists. Hussey was a regular contributor to The Protestant Advocate, an anti-Catholic weekly which ran from 1870 to 1879, edited by John Griffiths and published by the proprietor James Heath Lewis (c. 1816 – 6 December 1890) In 1871 Griffiths resigned his position on principle, but later returned to the paper. In 1872 the Protestant Advocate published a series of libels on the Sisters of St Joseph, for which Lewis was jailed for six months. Hussey acted as editor for six months, and it could have been during either of those disruptions. Then in March 1877 the paper published a report that the wife of Rev. Samuel Green had turned Catholic, a falsehood that again landed the publisher in court. Lewis blamed Griffiths. Green (died 1904) was an Anglican minister with high church leanings. His wife, the former Ellen Elizabeth Bayfield, was a daughter of (Anglican) Rev. Edward Bayfield (c. 1815–1857). Both men having had charge of St Paul's Church, Port Adelaide. In January 1867, with the health of pastor Thomas Playford failing, Hussey accepted the position of his assistant at the Bentham Street Church. In 1873, following the death of Playford, Hussey took over the pulpit, which he managed without financial reward until 27 January 1891, when he retired, although he did make a brief comeback in 1893 following some dissension in the congregation. He started a monthly Gospel of the Kingdom in July 1878, which became the Australian Quarterly Journal of Prophecy in July 1879 last issue January 1895. This publication had no connection to Horatius Bonar's Journal of Prophecy. In 1884 he founded the \\"Adelaide Bible Hall\\", a commercial outlet for Bibles, hymn books, etc., at the corner of Flinders and Freeman streets, still operating in 1891.

He is the younger brother of boxer Ilunga Makabu. Professional career Bakole made his professional debut on 25 March 2014, scoring a second-round technical knockout (TKO) victory over Cecil Smith at the Emperors Palace in Kempton Park, Gauteng, South Africa. After compiling a record of 9–0 (6 KO), he faced undefeated Ali Baghouz (10–0–1) on 11 November 2017 at the Royal Highland Centre in Edinburgh, with the vacant IBO Continental heavyweight title on the line. Bakole captured the vacant title via first-round knockout (KO). He successfully defended the title in his next fight with a first-round TKO against DL Jones (8–1–1) on 23 June 2018 at The SSE Hydro in Glasgow. He next fought former Olympian and cruiserweight world title challenger Michael Hunter (14–1) for the vacant IBO Inter-Continental heavyweight title on 13 October 2018 at the York Hall, London. Bakole lost the fight via tenth-round TKO. The first few rounds were evenly contested with Bakole walking his American opponent down while Hunter remained on the back foot, utilising movement and picking his moments to throw combinations. From round four and onwards, Hunter began to make an impression with his ring movement and speedy combinations. Towards the end of the seventh, Bakole landed a powerful right hand that stunned Hunter, causing the former cruiserweight to hold in the clinch. Hunter, now looking fatigued and suffering a cut to the right eye, had his mouth piece knocked out in the eighth by a clean right hand. After injuring his right shoulder in the eighth, Bakole was reluctant to throw the right hand in the ninth, instead choosing to work behind the jab. The end came in the tenth and final round; with Hunter landing powerful shots with more frequency, a left hook sent Bakole stumbling – not for the first time during the round – towards the corner. After a barrage of unanswered punches, referee Phil Edwards waved off the fight with 41 seconds of the round remaining, handing Bakole the first defeat of his professional career. Following his loss to Hunter, Bakole fought former heavyweight world title challenger Mariusz Wach (33–4) on 6 April 2019 at the Spodek Arena in Katowice, Poland, with the vacant Republic of Poland International heavyweight title up for grabs. Bakole won the fight via eighth-round TKO in a scheduled ten-round bout. The first- round saw Wach boxing in a defensive manner, staying at range behind the jab and looking to counter-punch. The next few rounds saw Bakole take the lead. Throwing heavy combination punches to the head of his Polish opponent. Towards the end of the fifth, Bakole landed several punches to his opponent's head, leaving Wach on unsteady legs as he walked back to his corner. Wach attempted to rally back in the sixth-round, having success as Bakole's pace slowed. Bakole came back in the seventh to repeat his performance of previous rounds, putting together combinations and landing punches to the head of Wach. The end came in the eighth when referee Robert Gortat waved off the fight after Wach was on the receiving end of a flurry of twelve unanswered punches. Following a first-round TKO win over Ytalo Perea (11–4–2) in August, Bakole was scheduled to face Gabriel Enguema on 19 October 2019 at the Utilita Arena, Newcastle. Days before the fight, Enguema withdrew from the bout due to an injury. Former world title challenger Kevin Johnson (34–15–1) stepped in at short notice. In what was a one-sided affair, Bakole won by fifth-round TKO in a scheduled eight-round bout after referee Ron Kearney waved off the fight following Johnson being on the receiving end of several unanswered punches, handing the durable veteran boxer the third stoppage defeat of his career.

His grandfather and namesake was the first \\"guinea pig\\" for surgeon Crawford Long, one of the pioneers of anesthesia. The elder Venable later purchased land in the city of Marthasville which was later renamed Atlanta. His name was given to Venable Street, near Georgia Tech. In 1870s, Venable's ancestors purchased Pine Mountain, Arabia Mountain, and Stone Mountain, a large rock inselberg, in order quarry to native granite. The Venable quarry operations produced, at one time, all of the curbstones for the city of Atlanta and outlying communities. Stone from the quarries was also used to build structures such as the Cuban Capitol Building and the Brooklyn Bridge. Legal and political career Venable received his law degree in 1930. He worked as a lawyer in Georgia and in several other states. Most notably, he defended the bombers of the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple bombing, which he described as \\"perhaps one of the hardest cases because the Jewish people spent many thousands of dollars.\\" Venable also defended Communist Homer Chase in Atlanta. Half of the time he represented Black clients. He won acquittal for a Black client accused of murder and later won an appeal for two Black Muslims in Louisiana convicted on charges stemming from a police raid on their mosque. The $25,000 he won from that suit were funneled into his Klan. Despite never going on vacation, Venable was able to go to 44 states by practicing law. From 1946 to 1949 he served as the Mayor of Stone Mountain. He described Sen. Tom Watson as \\"perhaps the greatest [politician] during our century.\\" Ku Klux Klan At the age of 13, Venable attended the 1915 revival of the KKK on top of Stone Mountain, alongside his uncle. In 1963, Venable organized the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, which competed with other rival national KKK factions. He would served for 25 years as its Imperial Wizard. Venable often burned crosses on the land he owned at Stone Mountain. Although, he claimed \\"I hold no ill will against any race, color, or creed.\\" Personal life Venable was married to Dorothy Venable, who he had two daughters with. He was a Presbyterian, attending North Avenue Presbyterian Church, and a member of the Free Masons. Death Towards the end of his life, Venable became afflicted with various conditions, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and pneumonia. He died on January 18, 1993 at a nursing home in Lawrenceville, Georgia.

Early Career  Dolgikh was born in Barnaul, the son of a worker, his education ended when he was sent to do manual work in a workshop, at 11, only barely literate. His father died in 1910. His mother left for Harbin in 1911, and did not return. Drafted in 1915, he was promoted to sergeant major and decorated for bravery during the war between Russia and Germany. Demobilised after the Bolshevik Revolution, he worked as a tin smith in Barnaul, and joined the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. He joined the Red Army as a volunteer in May 1918, and fought as a partisan in the Altai region. Captured by the White army of Admiral Kolchak in October 1918, he was held in Barnaul prison for five months. After his release, he returned to his old trade as a tin smith, but rejoined the Red Army for the final campaign of the civil war, against the army of Baron Wrangel in the Crimea. He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1920, and was recruited to the political police, or Ogpu, in Altai region in the same year. He was in charge of Barnaul prison in 1926-28. In 1928, he was appointed head of the administrative department of the Barnaul Ogpu.  'Cannibal Island'  In 1931, during the collectivisation of agriculture, when hundreds of thousands of peasants who classed as Kulaks, or who resisted being forced to join collective farms, were rounded up and deported to Siberia, Dolgikh was appointed head of the Western Siberia Department of Special Settlements, in charge of 300,000 deportees.. The area he controlled was divided into thirty administrative districts, the most northerly of which was Alexandro- Vakhovskaya, an area of about 50,000 square kms (19,000 square miles) straddling the Ob River, accessible only by riverboat from May to October. Before collectivisation, the area had a population of around 4,000, of whom a third where Ostyaks. In February 1933, the local Ogpu commander received an order telling him to receive 25,000 deportees. Unable to cope with the numbers, the Ogpu deposited about 6,000 deportees on Nazino, an island on the Ob river, with inadequate food. More than 4,000 died. At least a dozen resorted to mutilating and eating human bodies. Dolgikh headed a commission sent to investigate, on 21 June. In his report, he denied that the cannibals had been motivated by hunger, but blamed \\"individual degeneracy and very well- defined political intentions.\\", and he accused local officials of exaggerating the death toll. After a second commission had been sent in October to investigate the affair, Dolgikh received a 'severe reprimand', while other, more junior officers were arrested.  Later Career  Despite his reprimand, Dolgikh continued to have a successful career in the police. In 1935, he led an unprecedented mass climb up Belukha Mountain, the highest peak in Altai province, at 4,620m (15,157 feet). Forty three members of the party reached the summit. In April 1939, Dolgikh was appointed head of Vyatlag, one the largest labour camps in the Gulag system, which held up to 20,000 prisoners. During the war with Germany, he ran another camp, in Sverdlovsk province. In 1944, he was made deputy head of the administration for prisoners of war. He retired through illness in 1951.  Note  The similarly named Ivan Ilich Dolgikh was also an NKVD officer, and head of Gulag.

The MIDI Manufacturers Association has referred to him as the \\"Godfather of Controllerism\\". He is known for his fusion of music and technology which he synthesizes through a variety of inventions including the Mojo, Robocaster, Octamasher and Guitar Wing. Early life Moldover is originally from the Washington DC area and began playing guitar at the age of 13 in Rockville, MD. He discovered Berklee College Of Music on the internet and moved to Boston to attend in 1998. He earned a degree in electronic music composition in 2002, and then moved to New York City to play in a variety of bands. He soon transitioned to a focus on solo performance; a 2003 visit to Burning Man Festival in Nevada led to him moving to San Francisco in 2008. Career Moldover has released a significant amount of media content in different arenas including 4 studio albums of music, many live videos of his performance known as \\"Live Remashing\\" and also instructional videos for Ask Video and others. Moldover sits in a chair wearing a green velvet suit. Before releasing an official Studio album, Moldover released a series of live recordings called Live Remashing. These were his preliminary journeys into Controllerism before he had come up with the term. In 2006, Marc Urselli of Chain D.L.K. described Live Remashing as \\"an encyclopedia of modern pop culture in sound format\\" and \\"the best example of how to use modern technologies to enhance and extend musicianship and artistic vision\\", and \\"the new form of DJing.\\" In 2009, Moldover released his debut album Moldover. Of the variety of price tiers for the release of the album, the steepest version included a fully playable circuit board, thus highlighting what is termed playable packaging. The track listings themselves were created using circuitry. Inside the package is a small playable light- theremin. In 2016, Moldover released the studio album 4 Track which included the playable packaging Voice Crusher. Featuring Moldover's hacked controller, \\"The Frankentroller\\" Controllerism Moldover suggests that the Controller is \\"the instrument of the next generation.\\" In 2005, he coined the term Controllerism with the encouragement of his manager of the time, DJ Shakey. On the development of Controllerism he said that \\"the basic styles of DJing weren't satisfying to me, I was used to a more visceral way of performing; playing guitar, singing, and producing sound with my body in real time. For me, controllerism is more along those lines than DJing.\\" In a 2007 article in Remix, Moldover stated that controllerism is \\"essentially the same idea\\" as turntablism. THE MOJO : Moldover's custom MIDI controller, made together with 60 Works Controllers Instrument Design Frankentroller The Frankentroller started as a Novation Remote 25 SL Keyboard; Moldover adapted its hardware to make it a new instrument by adding a Kurzweil keyboard touchstrip, a Korg Kaoss Pad, as well as refashioning some of the keyboards black keys to be used as crossfaders. Ean Golden of Remix subsequently stated that the Frankentroller had earned Moldover wins his personal award for \\"most creative mod.\\" Mojo In 2010, Moldover released the MOJO, \\"Limited- Edition Performance MIDI Controller\\". This is his first \\"made from scratch\\" midi controller. It figures prominently in his live performances. In 2012, Moldover made the design for the Mojo open source. Artist Ill Gates called the Mojo, \\"the single greatest controller in the history of MIDI.\\" THE ROBOCASTER : Moldover's custom controller guitar, made together with Visionary Instruments Robocaster The Robocaster is a custom-made signature guitar produced by Visionary Instruments: a \\"hybrid instrument\\", it incorporates several MIDI controller options, including \\"gaming buttons, touch-strips, knobs, faders, switches, motion sensors, a pressure pad and a joystick.\\" Moldover said that he wanted to create the Robocaster as a more tactile and less sample-based instrument that allows for more traditional musicianship combined with advanced FX tweaking and midi integration. THE GUITAR WING : Designed by Moldover and Livid Instruments Guitar Wing Directly inspired by the Robocaster, the Guitar Wing adds an ergonomic, wireless MIDI controller to any electric guitar or bass. The Guitar Wing was created in collaboration with Livid Instruments. Popular Science noted that it allows \\"near effortless control over effects, software, digital audio workstations and even stage lights between strums.\\" Moldover's first jambox, born in 2005 Octamasher Jambox Originally designed as a gift for Burning Man participants, the Octamasher is \\"a multi-input combination of 8 modified keyboards that link to a single brain (computer), the output of which is coordinated and controlled to allow for multiple users combining together to perform new music.\\" Associated Acts & Collaborations Moldover has worked with many artists in helping to design custom gear or optimizing performance potential including Mickey Hart and the Grateful Dead, Bassnectar, DJ Shadow and others. He has performed with his Robocaster with the collective Liberation Movement.

Industries of particular importance are shipbuilding, boat building, maritime transport, aquaculture, mariculture, commercial fishing, seafood processing, offshore wind power and various forms of tourism. Deep sea mining, especially of dormant hydrothermal vents, is also being considered for the future. In 2018 Taiwan was the fourth largest yacht building nation. Taiwan is home to a number of maritime museums and maritime colleges. Background Orchid Island during the Japanese period Kaohsiung international container terminal Taiwan is an island nation and as such as an intimate relationship with the sea. The indigenous Yami People of Orchid Island are famous for their seafaring skills and most Taiwanese indigenous people practiced some right or ritual related to the sea. Waves of immigrants and conquerers have traveled to Taiwan over the seas from Mainland China, Europe, Japan, and elsewhere. The people of Taiwan are collectively known as the \\"Children of the Sea.” The principle goddess of chinese folk religion as practiced in Taiwan is the sea goddess Mazu. Her veneration is particularly popular along Taiwan’s east coast. Geographically Taiwan’s relationship with the sea is shaped by its location at the eastern end of the Eurasian landmass. The west coast is under the influence of the strong Kuroshio Current. The west coast of Taiwan is muddy with large tidal flats, tides in the west are much stronger than those on the east and as such they have a much greater influence on daily routines. The Ship and Ocean Industries R&D; Center (SOIC), founded in 1976 as the United Ship Design and Development Center (USDDC), plays an important role in supporting Taiwan’s maritime industries. SOIC works on commercial, government, and military projects as well as basic scientific research. The Yacht Industry Department of SOIC is the only government supported R&D; center for yacht materials and design in the world. Sea transport As of 2009 90% of Taiwan’s trade was seaborne. Evergreen Marine and Yang Ming Marine Transport Corporation are two major ocean shipping companies based in Taiwan. Wan Hai Lines and Today Makes Tomorrow are smaller but still globally significant ocean shipping companies. In 2016 amid a global downturn in the shipping industry the Taiwanese government spent $1.9B to support the domestic shipping industry. As of 2019 Taiwan had the 11th largest national shipping capacity by deadweight tons. Ports Taiwan’s main ports are located in Taipei, Keelung, and Kaohsiung. Most of the nation’s large ports are managed by Taiwan International Ports Corporation which is a state- owned enterprise. Shipbuilding Yilan (CG128) under construction The modern shipbuilding industry of Taiwan began in 1948 when the Government established the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation (TSBC) in Keelung. In 1957 the US based Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation established the Ingalls Taiwan Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, which subsequently rented the TSBC shipyard and produced 14 vessels between 1957 and 1962. The Government prioritized shipbuilding as one of the core industries of the economy, in 1973 they established the China Shipbuilding Corporation which was merged with TSBC in 1978. In 2008 the ship and boat building industry had a production value of 2.09b USD with CSBC accounting for 54% of production, small and medium yards 22% and yacht builders 16%. As of 2009 there were 116 shipyards (including 34 yacht builders) and 10 marine equipment companies in Taiwan. Major shipyards include CSBC Corporation, Taiwan, Jong Shyn Shipbuilding Company, and Lungteh Shipbuilding. Military and Coast Guard orders make up a large portion of shipbuilders books by dollar value. Between the Taiwanese Navy and the Coast Guard Administration Taiwan spends approximately a billion dollars a year on new vessel construction. Yacht building Taswell center cockpit One third of new yachts sold in the US between 1977 and 1981 were made in Taiwan. In 1987 Taiwan exported 1,755 vessels worth US$190.8 million to the US. During this era more than 100 shipyards and boatbuilders in Taiwan built craft for the export market. Between 1986 and 1992 the New Taiwan Dollar appreciated 58% against the US Dollar which made Taiwanese built yachts significantly less competitive in the US market. By 1994 dozens of yacht and boat builders had gone out of business or been acquired by competitors. Sales recovered but fell again after the 2008 Recession before strengthening again. In 2017 Taiwan exported one hundred and sixty two yachts. In 2018 Taiwan was the fourth largest yacht building nation by feet of yacht built after Italy, The Netherlands and Turkey. Major yacht and boat builders include Horizon Yachts, Ocean Alexander, Johnson Yachts, Jade Yachts, and Ta Shing Yacht Building. Maritime recreation Regulations enacted during the martial law era meant that ownership of personal leisure craft was not permitted until 2010. While maritime recreation facilities and infrastructure remain underdeveloped the Taiwanese government has emphasized marine sports and related tourism as an economic opportunity for Taiwan’s outlying islands. Aquaculture Oyster Trellis at Dongshi fishing harbour, Chiayi County Aquaculture has a long history in Taiwan. By 2006 the production of Taiwanese coastal aquaculture was valued at NT$11,817 million. In the 21st century high technology is playing a greater part in Taiwan’s aquaculture industry as the industry struggles to cope with labor shortages and fierce foreign competition. The Taiwanese government operates six fisheries and aquaculture research centers. The Aquaculture Taiwan Expo & Forum is the primary aquaculture trade show in Taiwan, it is held concurrently with the Livestock Taiwan Expo & Forum and the Asia Agri-Tech Expo & Forum. Shrimp and prawns The Taiwanese scientist Liao I-chiu is known as the \\"Father of Shrimp Farming,” having pioneered many of the techniques and overcome many of the technical hurdles which allowed the creation of the modern global shrimp farming industry. In 2020 Taiwanese shrimp researcher Luo Chu-fang received the annual award for outstanding contributions to the control of animal disease and/or veterinary public health from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Luo Chu-fang is a retired academic chair at National Cheng Kung University. She was the first Taiwanese to win an World Organization for Animal Health award. The giant river prawn is widely cultivated in Taiwan. In 2012 Taiwan produced 3% of world production. Grouper In 1975 Taiwan began ocean ranching of grouper. Ocean ranching of grouper involves growing wild caught individuals to market size. In 1995 Long Diann Bio Technology Co. Ltd. with the help of the Eastern Marine Biology Research Center successfully developed hatchery techniques for giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus). Other species cultured are the Malabar grouper, the orange-spotted grouper, the brown-marbled grouper, the potato grouper, and the leopard coral grouper. In the 2000s Taiwan emerged as a global leader in grouper farming. In 2007 the 89 grouper farmers on Taiwan utilized 1,554.31 hectares of land and produced 17,234 tons of grouper valued at NT$3.88 billion (US$117.68 million). Grouper are shipped live on specially built vessels to Hong Kong and mainland China. Milkfish Milkfish is one of Taiwan’s most commercially important fish, yearly production is 50,000 tons of milkfish valued at $4.1 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Consumption and ranching of milkfish in Taiwan dates back hundreds of years. Milkfish is primarily consumed with congee, pan-fried, as fish ball soup, or braised. Milkfish soup (Shimu Yu) is a southern Taiwanese speciality. In recent years Taiwanese farms have begun raising organic milkfish. Ornamentals The Taiwanese ornamental fish and shrimp industry is significant with more than 250 commercial operations, ~200 of them with operations in Pingtung County. Taiwan was once known as the “cichlid kingdom” for its specialization in cichlids, a fad which culminated in the breeding of the blood parrot cichlid in 1986. The fields of biotechnology and applied ecology are playing an ever increasing role in the Taiwanese aquarium sector. National Pingtung University of Science and Technology offers one of the world’s only graduate programs focussing on aquarium fish. Fisheries Chenggong Fishing Harbor in 2010 Taiwan is one of the largest fishing nations on earth and the associated fish processing industry is also significant. More than one third of the worlds longline tuna fishing vessels are operated by Taiwanese companies with the total strength of the distant waters fishing fleet at more than 2,000 vessels. The fishing industry is estimated to be worth approximately two billion dollars. Taiwan’s ocean fisheries sector employs 350,000 people and there are 130,000 fishing households in Taiwan. Taiwanese conglomerate FCF Co, Ltd. is the largest tuna trader in the world moving more than 500,000 tons a year, in 2019 they acquired Bumble Bee Foods for close to 1 billion dollars. Distant-water fishing Taiwan has the world’s second largest distant-water fishing fleet with 1,100 vessels Taiwan flagged or directly owned vessels that employ 35,000 migrant sailors primarily from Indonesia and the Philippines. Taiwan’s overseas fishing fleet has been criticized for a history of abuse and a lack of protection for migrant laborers, often from Southeast Asia. Official Taiwanese sources put the number of foreign workers aboard Taiwanese vessels at 26,000 but NGOs and US government agencies put the figure around 160,000. Foreign fishermen frequently report non-payment, long work hours, and verbal and physical abuse at the hands of their captains and officers, who are often Taiwanese. In recent years Taiwan has made significant progress on the issue, but abuse remains widespread. In terms of human rights the distant waters fishing fleet lags far behind the rest of Taiwanese industry. A 2020 Greenpeace investigation found Taiwanese vessels in the Atlantic Ocean engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. They also found significant evidence of the abuse of foreign laborers. They also documented Taiwanese fishing companies using flags of convenience to obscure vessel ownership as well as unreported at sea transfers of fish. Taiwanese fisheries conglomerate FCF was specifically singled out for criticism for links to illegal fishing and forced labor. In October 2020 the US Department of Labor added the Taiwanese distant waters fleet’s products to its list of goods produced by child or forced labor. Offshore wind power The first offshore wind farms in Taiwan, Formosa 1 Offshore Wind Farm, started its commercial operation in April 2017 at off the coast of Miaoli County. The Formosa II wind farms will be constructed also offshore Miaoli County with a planned capacity of 300-500 MW. The Formosa III wind farm will be constructed offshore Changhua County with a planned capacity of 1,900 MW. Taiwan has one of the fastest growing offshore wind power industries in the world. As of 2020, there were 361 onshore turbines and 22 offshore turbines in operation with the total installed capacity of 845.2 MW.

Within nationwide science curriculums the portion of marine centered content has been increased. Marine issues are also taught to 9th graders nationwide as part of a curriculum on oceans and climate change.

As the nation took charge of managing its own affairs, it continued to develop the goals and means necessary for a financial structure conducive to the economic growth observed today. Critical to the transition of Malaysia from a low-income country to one of high-income status has been the expansion of its economy. From a commodity and agricultural-based economy, the Southeast Asian nation is transitioning to a leading exporter of more complex goods. As the nation opens up to trade and investment, the World Bank and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Development Association (IDA) continue to assist with its development.  History with the World Bank  Malaysia joined the World Bank following its independence on March 7, 1958, following a resolution to first join the International Monetary Fund. The World Bank continues to identify areas of growth necessary for the Malaysian economy. It cites a need for reduce poverty, income inequalities. Although the growth of the Malaysian economy has been significant, it still trails relative to regional and national competitors of a similar nature. Many of Malaysia's loans from the World Bank have been concerned with infrastructure development relating to energy security and trade.“Malaysia International Loans.” World Bank. https://finances.worldbank.org/Loans-and- Credits/malaysia-international-loans/sx6u-5y8k As such, its first pivotal project was the creation of a hydroelectric power station and dam. Successive projects included funding allocating to the development of ports, roads, in tandem with the Ministry of Finance in Malaysia.“Malaysia International Loans.” World Bank. https://finances.worldbank.org/Loans-and-Credits/malaysia- international-loans/sx6u-5y8k  First Power Project for Malaysia  Malaysia received its first loan from the IBRD in 1958. The proposed loan expected the IBRD to provide 70% of financing, or around US$51.2 million.International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Report and Recommendations of the President to the Executive Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Central Electricity Board of the Federation of Malaya. 11 Sept. 1958, documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/258991468049811598/pdf/multi0page.pdf. These funds were commissioned for the Cameron Highlands District, approximately 100 miles of Kuala Lumpur, as a part of a comprehensive plan to develop energy infrastructure. The hydroelectric power station created as a result of the loan channeled the several local waterways that flowed through the plateau-region. Project completion resulted in diversion tactics, new power stations, and a concrete damn. The project represented the needs greater power demand in the state.  1990s  The first HSBC Bank Malaysia Throughout the 1990s Malaysia continued to receive World Bank loans meant to assist the state's development and diversify the growth of its predominantly agricultural and commodity-based economy. Following its receipt and use of IBRD loans, Malaysia choose to seek relations via a reimbursable advisory services framework (RAS). Malaysia now interacts with the World Bank Group as an upper-middle income economy as a member of the IDA.  Asian Financial Crisis  Although Malaysia was afflicted by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, its economy bounced back with an average growth rate of 5.4% and is on a current upward trajectory. Malaysia's resilience to the financial crises and successive growth was attributed to the presence of well established foreign banks, among these HSBC and Standard Chartered. The presence of foreign banks allowed the state to develop comprehensive data sets regarding the local economy, to the benefit of Malaysian domestic banks. In tandem with the success of Malaysia post-crisis was the growth of physical capital stock.Ghani, Ejaz, and Vivek Suri. Productivity growth, capital accumulation, and the banking sector: Some lessons from Malaysia. The World Bank, 1999. Policies in Malaysia continued to facilitate the flow of foreign direct investment and improved import relations with foreign states.  World Bank Group Global Knowledge and Research Hub  The Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur represent the growing prominence of the city as a financial hub. The World Bank Group Global Knowledge and Research Hub in Kuala Lumpur anchors the WBG's presence. The Hub was established in 2016 and represents the first organization of its kind. Its focus is to disseminate knowledge Malaysians and regional neighbors can use to improve socioeconomic productivity. Creation of the office was underpinned by the sentiment that increasing the access to important information in the region would lead to greater economic growth. The organization works to share keys to Malaysia success with emerging and developing markets transitioning from poverty, to propagate development policy research in tandem with other research institutions and to guide Malaysia rise to a high-income economy. Costs of the Hub were agreed to be financed by Malay government over the course of a five year-term. The Knowledge and Research Hub works in tandem with the Development Economics (DEC) Research Group and Indicators Group, also a part of the WBG. The role of the Hub is information specific. It is meant to use information flow from external actors and its RASs along with information it sends out to understand labor market policy and public spending influences. The RASs are pivotal in providing infrastructure, transportation and public spending data.  New Financial Instruments  The creation of the green sukuk, or green Islamic bond, is an innovation catalyzed by the World Bank. The bond has identified as a Climate Finance tool for cities and low-carbon infrastructure projects meant to stimulate private sector investment. This innovation was particular significant given that green bonds appeal to both private and public sector actors.Bin, Raymond Ling Leh, et al. \\"Feasibility Of Green Bonds Issuance In Malaysia Towards Financing A Sustainable Future–A Conceptual Review Of Literatures.\\" Global Conference on Business and Economics Research. Vol. 16. 2017. Green bonds are typically create to generate sustainable investment and as a prerequisite, projects must also be green. These bonds will typically incentivize the relevant stakeholders to utilize them, in contrast with use of regular bonds that my not offer the same lending terms. The creation of the sukuk expects to build on the growth of sustainable investment asset use in Malaysia and its near abroad.Bin, Raymond Ling Leh, et al. \\"Feasibility Of Green Bonds Issuance In Malaysia Towards Financing A Sustainable Future–A Conceptual Review Of Literatures.\\" Global Conference on Business and Economics Research. Vol. 16. 2017.  Addressing Poverty  Less than 1% of the nation exists at extreme poverty. In addressing the state of poverty in Malaysia, the government has turned to the lower 40% tier who remain vulnerable to economic disturbance. Knowledge developed from the Hub is meant to address key concerns in these areas. Past studies map the ability of Malaysia's poor to transition to higher-income status. The New Economic Policy in Malaysia presented strategies meant to address economic growth.Gopal, Parthiban S., and Nor Malina Malek. \\"Breaking away from the cycle of poverty: The case of Malaysian poor.\\" The Social Science Journal 52.1 (2015): 34-39.

She has been living in Botnang since the 1960s und has so far written more than 400 songs, setting to music both her own and other authors' lyrics. Many of her songs have been performed at 12 benefit concerts (as of 2019).  Life and Work  Gerda Herrmann received piano lessons for almost three years from 1941-1943, until her school was evacuated to Metzingen due to aerial bombings. From then on, she played the piano without receiving further lessons. Her father was an association auditor. After he was denounced to authorities, he was drafted into the German army and fell in 1944 as a soldier. In July of 1944, Herrmann was in Stuttgart and at 13 years old witnessed the heavy bombings of the city and their aftermath. In 1972, Herrmann wrote her first poem, when she was asked to write one for a service held at Friendenskirche Stuttgart in support of Amnesty International. In 1984, Gerda Herrmann wrote her first composition titled \\"Elegie\\". Since then, she has set texts by many authors to music, among them Annette von Droste- Hülshoff, Joachim Ringelnatz, Arthur Schnitzler and Walther von der Vogelweide. In 2013, Herrmann set to music a love poem that her father had written into his diary in 1923. Herrmann herself describes her style as \\"not modern\\", but \\"most likely to be classified as belonging to the romantic period\\". Additionally, her style has become more simple in her old age, which she attributes to Angelus Silesius' quote \\"Human, focus on the essence\\". Herrmann regards her song that sets Rilke's poem \\"Der Panther\\" to music as her favorite of her own songs. So far, many of Herrmann's songs have been performed at 12 benefit concerts in favor of various societies and organisations. The first concert took place in 1991 at Schloss Solitude. On June 29, 2019, the documentary film The Songwriter of Botnang by Alexander Tuschinski had its world premiere at Delphi Arthaus Kino in Stuttgart. It addresses Herrmann's life and oeuvre. The following year, the film had its US premiere screening in competition at Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival and was additionally screened in competition at Berlin Independent Film Festival.  Encouraging creative writing by young people  Since 2003, Gerda Herrman has been a founding member as well as deputy chairwoman of the Förderkreis Kreatives Schreiben und Musik, which publishes anthologies featuring texts by young people. The first anthology was published already before founding of the society, using parts of the proceeds from a benefit concert that showcased some of Herrmann's songs in the white hall of the New Palace in Stuttgart in 1999. The anthologies have been accepted to be recorded in the archive for children's texts of Martin-Luther-Universität Halle- Wittenberg and contain texts of different genres and styles. In 2010, a poem by Ingeborg Wenger from the anthology \\"ÜberBrücken\\" was displayed as part of the program \\"Lyrik Unterwegs\\" inside metro trains in Stuttgart. Herrmann has set several poems from these anthologies to music.Anthologie \\"Nennenswertes\\" liegt frisch gedruckt vor, Botnanger Anzeiger 07/2011, p. 22.  Further commitments  Additionally, from 1968 until the birth of her third child in 1972, Herrmann committed for Amnesty International and regards Amnesty's work as \\"important\\".

The Cuban government believes the purpose of the American mission in Cuba is to promote “peaceful bilateral relations” but instead, it and “particularly its chargé d’affaires have focused in recent months on the failed purpose of recruiting mercenaries, promoting division and confusion among our people, identifying the areas of the economy against which to direct coercive measures, and trying to slander and discredit the work of the Cuban government and the Revolution.” The statement continued that “it was open instigation to violence.” The week before, the embassy posted a video on Twitter showing Tekach with Nelva Ismarays Ortega who is a partner of Ferrer and leader of Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), described as the country’s most active opposition organization.

House Committee on the Judiciary (2020), No. 19-1328 (previously In re Application of the Committee on the Judiciary, No. 19-5288), is a case pending before the Supreme Court of the United States. The case weighs whether a committee of the House of Representatives can assert the House's \\"sole power of impeachment\\" to subpoena materials gathered as part of a federal grand jury investigation which are ordinarily secret. Background Robert Mueller had been appointed as Special Counsel by United States Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to investigate possible Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. The investigation ran from 2017 to 2019. Among his investigation, Mueller assembled a grand jury empowered to subpoena documents, require witnesses to testify under oath, and issue indictments for targets of criminal charges if probable cause was found. Proceedings of the grand jury were keep in confidence. Mueller delivered his final report, Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election but informally called the Mueller Report, to United States Attorney General William Barr on March 22, 2019. A heavily-redacted version of the Mueller report was issued on April 18, 2019, which President Donald Trump stated later was due to executive privilege. The redacted report omitted much of the grand jury proceedings. While Mueller's Report concluded there was no evidence of Russian interference, and while there was no conclusive evidence of any crime committed by Trump, it \\"does not exonerate him\\". The Mueller Report findings gave a strong basis for the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives to consider starting impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. Mueller testified to several House committees on July 24, 2019 on details of the report, but still limited to what he could speak by the prior executive privilege. On July 26, 2019, the House Judiciary Committee filed an application with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to release certain grand jury materials associated with Mulluer's investigation. In October 2019, based on precedent established during the impeachment of Richard Nixon, the court granted the application. However, the Department of Justice immediately sought a stay for the subpoena. Case history On December 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit's panel of Rogers, Griffith, and Rao ordered a briefing to address whether the House Judiciary Committee has Article III standing. On December 16, 2019, House General Counselor Douglas Letter filed a brief outlining the importance of obtaining the grand jury materials. On December 18, 2019, the D.C. Circuit ordered the parties involved to file supplemental briefings by December 23, 2019, addressing whether articles of impeachment render the case moot and whether expedited consideration is still necessary. The D.C. Circuit also suggested the House Judiciary Committee address whether it still seeks the materials from Robert Mueller's grand jury. On December 23, 2019, the House Judiciary Committee and Justice Department filed supplemental briefings explaining their positions on standing and mootness. The case was argued earlier before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Friday, January 3, 2020. The case was heard by a panel of three Circuit Judges: Judith W. Rogers, Thomas B. Griffith, and Neomi Rao.}} On March 10, 2020, the court ruled 2–1 in favor of the Judiciary Committee, ordering the release of the grand jury materials; Judge Rogers wrote the opinion, joined by Judge Griffith, and Judge Rao dissented. Shortly before the court-mandated deadline to produce the material, the DOJ petitioned SCOTUS to stay the ruling and review the case. The Court stayed the Circuit's mandate on May 8, 2020. In June, the Department of Justice and the House Judiciary Committee filed petitions for and against a writ of certiorari. On July 2, 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States granted the Justice Department request for a writ of certiorari appealing the decision of the D.C.

He first appeared in the second issue of 2000 AD (1977), which is a British weekly anthology comic. He is the magazine's longest-running character. He also appears in a number of film and video game adaptations. Judge Dredd is a law enforcement and judicial officer in the dystopian future city of Mega-City One, which covers most of the east coast of North America. He is a \\"street judge\\", empowered to summarily arrest, convict, sentence, and execute criminals. In Great Britain, the character of Dredd and his name are sometimes invoked in discussions of police states, authoritarianism, and the rule of law. Over the years Judge Dredd has been hailed as one of the best satires of American and British culture with an uncanny trend to predict upcoming events such as rampant mass surveillance, rise of populist leaders, and the COVID-19 pandemic.Judge Dredd Foreshadowed Our Covid Reality, by Graeme McMillan, at wired.com, 23 April 2020. In 2011, IGN ranked Judge Dredd 35th among the top 100 comic book heroes of all time.IGN website Judge Dredd made his live-action debut in 1995 in Judge Dredd, portrayed by Sylvester Stallone. Later, he was portrayed by Karl Urban in the 2012 adaptation Dredd. In audio dramas by Big Finish Productions, Dredd is voiced by Toby Longworth.  Character and appearance  Mike McMahon in 1977. The character's appearance has remained essentially unchanged since, except for a more prominent jawline. Joseph Dredd is the most famous of the Street Judges that patrol Mega-City One, empowered to instantly convict, sentence, and sometimes execute offenders. Dredd is armed with a \\"Lawgiver\\", a pistol programmed to recognise only his palm-print and capable of firing six types of ammunition, a daystick, a boot knife and stun or gas grenades. His helmet obscures his face, except for his mouth and jaw. He rides a large \\"Lawmaster\\" motorcycle equipped with machine-guns, a powerful laser cannon, and full artificial intelligence capable of responding to orders from the Judge and operating itself. Dredd's entire face is never shown in the strip. This began as an unofficial guideline, but soon became a rule.Jarman & Acton, pp. 74–75. As John Wagner explained: \\"It sums up the facelessness of justice − justice has no soul. So it isn't necessary for readers to see Dredd's face, and I don't want you to\\".Jarman & Acton p. 75 On rare occasions, Dredd's face has been seen in flashbacks to his childhood; but these pictures lack detail.2000 AD #30 and 1187 In an early story, Dredd is forced to remove his helmet and the other characters react as if he is disfigured, but his face was covered by a faux censorship sticker.Jarman & Acton, pp. 56 and 74. In prog 52, during Dredd's tenure on the Lunar Colonies, he uses a 'face-change' machine to impersonate the crooked lawyer of a gang of bank robbers.\\"The Face Change Crimes\\" in 2000 AD #52 (18/2/1978), written by John Wagner, with art by Brian Bolland. Page 14. In Carlos Ezquerra's original design, Dredd had large lips, \\"to put a mystery as to his racial background\\".Jarman & Acton, p. 22. Not all of the artists who worked on the strip were told of this. Mike McMahon drew Dredd as a black man, while Brian Bolland and Ron Smith drew him as white. The strip was not yet printed in colour, and this went unnoticed. The idea was dropped.Jarman & Acton, pp. 89–90. Time passes in the Judge Dredd strip in real time, so as a year passes in life, a year passes in the comic. The first Dredd story, published in 1977, was set in 2099, whilst stories published in are set in . Consequently, as former editor Alan McKenzie explains, \\"every year that goes by Dredd gets a year older – unlike Spider- Man, who has been a university student for the past twenty-five years!\\".Jarman & Acton, p. 112. Therefore Dredd was 38 when he first appeared, but is now years old, with years of active service (2079–), and for almost 30 years Dredd's age and fitness for duty were recurring plot points (in prog 1595 (2008), Dredd was diagnosed with benign cancer of the duodenum). How Dredd's ageing would be addressed was a source of reader speculation until 2016, when writer Michael Carroll and artist Ben Willsher published the story \\"Carousel\\",Judge Dredd Megazine #375. in which Dredd is ordered to undertake rejuvenation treatment. Regarding the possible death of the character, in an interview with Empire in 2012 Wagner said: \\"There could be many ways to end it, but the probability is that I won't still be around when it happens! I would love to write it, but I can't see it happening. I'll leave the script in my will\\".  Weapon  The Lawgiver is a fictional weapon used by the Judges including Judge Dredd. The Lawgiver is a self-loading handgun featuring manual and automatic focusing and targeting, plus a built in computer capable of controlling its operation. It fires a range of speciality ammunition. An in- line gunsight shows the view directly down the barrel. A Lawgiver can only be operated by its designated Judge owner, whose palm print is programmed into the gun's memory. An earlier weapon appeared in the Origins storyline. Though little was known about the gun itself, it was capable of firing standard and armour-piercing rounds. The gun has a maximum range of up to three miles and has six distinct settings:O'Brien, Daniel. \\"SF:UK: how British science fiction changed the world,\\" Reynolds & Hearn, 2000 *Standard execution - A standard bullet, with identical effects to normal kinetic energy projectile weapons. *Heat Seeker or Hot Shot - A standard bullet propelled by the unstable element, 'Argon 88 b'. Heatseeker rounds lock onto the target's heat source, enabling the Judge to target fleeing perps, accurately fire in low-light situations and so forth. *Ricochet - A metal bullet coated with rubber. Ricochet rounds can bounce off solid surfaces while retaining enough kinetic energy to penetrate flesh. This enables the Judge to, for example, kill a perp that is using a human shield, bouncing their shot off a back wall and hitting the target from behind. *Incendiary - Capable of setting its target on fire. Less widely used due to practicalities of incinerating targets in built-up city areas, although useful against unconventional adversaries such as Judge Death. *Armour Piercing - Armour-piercing rounds are extremely dense and contain a more powerful charge for higher muzzle velocity. Useful against cybernetic criminals and armoured opponents. When used against humans, it can travel through multiple targets. *High-Explosive (HI-EX) - A round containing an amount of extremely concentrated high explosive. Judges must employ caution when using this extremely dangerous round; the blast caused by the exploding bullets can just as easily harm those firing as well as the target. Generally used rarely; against crowding attackers or large/dangerous foes.  Fictional character biography  In 2066, Joseph Dredd and his older (by twelve minutes) \\"brother\\" Rico Dredd are cloned from the DNA of Chief Judge Fargo, the founder of the Judge System, who was said to have died in the line of duty years before.\\"A Case for Treatment,\\" in 2000 AD #389 Their growth is artificially accelerated in gestation so they are \\"born\\" with the physiological and mental development of a 5-year-old child, with appropriate knowledge and training already implanted in their brains.\\"Origins,\\" in 2000 AD #1515 The last name \\"Dredd\\" is chosen by the genetic scientist who created them, Morton Judd, to \\"instill fear in the population.\\" In 2070, the corrupt President Robert Linus Booth starts World War III, also known as the Atomic Wars, and the Judges move to restore order to the panic-stricken public. Cadets Joe Dredd and Rico Dredd are temporarily made full judges to help restore order under the supervision of Judge Kinnison, despite being physically and mentally only nine years old. They make their first kills stopping a rape gang but are unable to prevent Kinnison's death in action.2000 AD #1517 During the war, they discover their clone-father Eustace Fargo is still alive, hidden by higher ranking judges. Seeing them as kin, Fargo recruits Joe and Rico to be his temporary bodyguards. He openly tells them his doubts regarding about the Justice Department, wondering if the system has taken away \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\" while trying to instill strict order and control. Three weeks later, Fargo is placed in suspended animation and the Dredd brothers return to the Academy. After the Battle of Armageddon in 2071, President \\"Bad Bob\\" Booth is captured, tried for war crimes, and sentenced to suspended animation. In the wake of World War III, the office of the President is retired and the Judges now have full control over what's left of America. Distinguishing themselves, the Dredds are fast-tracked through the Academy of Law. Rico graduates at the top of their class in 2079, with Joseph graduating second. Joe's final assessment is done under the supervision of Judge Morphy, who is impressed with the young man and passes him. Joe later discovers Rico has embraced corruption, engaging in multiple crimes including murder, justifying his actions by saying Judges are thugs and killers by nature. Rico asks Joe to help him cover his crimes, but Joe arrests his brother instead, sentencing him to 20 years of labor on the penal colony on Saturn's moon Titan (a typical punishment for corrupt Judges). Joe Dredd continues operating as a judge, quickly gaining a reputation throughout the city as a formidable and incorruptible law enforcement agent. In 2099, Rico Dredd returns to Earth after serving his 20-year sentence. He comes after Joe for revenge, challenging him to a fast draw. No longer used to Earth's gravity, Rico loses and Joe shoots him dead in self-defence. Visibly upset, Joe insists he be the one to carry his brother's body away.\\"The Return of Rico,\\" in 2000 AD #30 Over the decades, Joe Dredd becomes a major force protecting Mega-City One and is sometimes the biggest catalyst in preventing its destruction. Offered the opportunity to become Chief Judge in 2101, Dredd declines, preferring to serve on the streets enforcing the law, though he does temporarily serve in other senior positions.\\"The Day the Law Died,\\" in 2000 AD #108 In \\"Tour of Duty\\", Dredd is appointed to the Council of Five, Mega-City One's highest governing body below the Chief Judge,\\"Tour of Duty,\\" 2000 AD #1693 on which he serves for two years (2132 to 2134).\\"Day of Chaos,\\" 2000 AD #1789 On several occasions, he saves his city from conquest or destruction by powerful enemies, and in 2114 he saves the entire world during the Fourth World War.\\"Judgement Day,\\" in 2000 AD #786–799 In 2107, Dredd loses his eyes in combat during the story City of the Damned. He has them replaced with bionic eyes that granted him night-vision. In 2112, he suffers near-fatal wounds when a battle leads him to fall into a lake of acidic chemicals, burning his entire body. Later on, he undergoes rejuvenation treatment, healing him and added more vitality than a man his age would normally have. In 2130, Dredd is diagnosed with cancer of the duodenum, though it was benign.\\"The Edgar Case,\\" 2000 AD #1595 In 2138, at 72 years old, Dredd undergoes another \\"rejuve\\" treatment after being ordered to. It is specified that his entire epidermis, vascular, and muscular tissue are rebuit on a cellular level, once again restoring some lost youth and vitality. He turns down an offer for a full treatment that would rebuild his internal organs and skeleton. Although Dredd holds his duty above every other priority, this devotion is not blind. On two occasions (in \\"The Robot Wars\\" and \\"Tale of the Dead Man\\"), Dredd resigns from the force on principle, but both times he later returns, believing the Judge System while imperfect and vulnerable to corruption is the best protection that currently exists for people.\\"Robot Wars,\\" 2000 AD #11; \\"Tale of the Dead Man,\\" 2000 AD #668 In 2113, Dredd insists the Justice Department gamble its existence on a referendum to prove its legitimacy.\\"Nightmares,\\" 2000 AD #706 In 2116, he risks 20 years imprisonment with hard labour when he challenges the policy of a Chief Judge.\\"Prologue,\\" Judge Dredd Megazine vol. 2 #57 In 2129, Dredd threatens to resign if the Chief Judge doesn't change the city's harsh anti- mutant apartheid laws.\\"The Spirit of Christmas,\\" 2000 AD #2008 (a December 2007 New Year issue) In 2129 (2000 AD #1535), Dredd is present when his clone- father Eustace Fargo is revived from cryogenic suspension only to die later the same day. Before Fargo dies, he calls for Dredd to be at his side and admits his conclusion that the Judge system was a mistake that killed the American Dream, that it was meant to fix things but not last forever. Since Joe and Rico Dredd are his blood, Eustace hopes they will fix his mistakes, implying they should replace the Judge System with something else (he was unaware Rico Dredd had gone renegade and later died at Joe's hand). After Eustace Fargo dies, Dredd decides not to share the man's final words. In more recent years, Dredd has met other Fargo clones such as Kraken and Nimrod, and a rogue clone of himself called DRƎDD. He has also developed a family of sorts with the introduction of two younger clones of his own named Judge Dolman and Judge Rico (no first name). Dredd also discovered his older brother Rico Dredd fathered a daughter, Vienna Dredd, who now looks on Joe as an uncle.  Family and associates  * Judge Rico Dredd. Judge Joe Dredd's older \\"brother,\\" also cloned from Chief Judge Eustace Fargo and initially superior to him in physical skills. Soon after Joseph and Rico Dredd became Judges, Rico became corrupt. Joe arrests him and sentences him to twenty years on the penal colony on Saturn's moon Titan. Twenty years later, Rico seeks revenge, and Joe kills him in self-defense.\\"The Return of Rico,\\" in 2000 AD #30 * Judge Kraken. Another clone of Chief Judge Fargo, decades younger than Joe Dredd but otherwise identical in appearance and similar in skill. Kraken was created by Morton Judd, the geneticist who cloned and named Joe and Rico Dredd. Kraken was one of the Judda, clones subservient to Judd. After Judd's defeat, Kraken is groomed to one day succeed Dredd and trained to become a Judge, though Dredd believes he isn't mentally fit. When Dredd first temporarily quits, Chief Judge Silver makes Kraken a Judge and has him impersonate Dredd so others won't know that one of Mega-City's greatest lost faith in the system. Kraken is then manipulated and corrupted by the Dark Judges, forced to help them temporarily turn Mega-City One into Necropolis, leading to the deaths of 60 million. After the Dark Judges are defeated, Kraken's mind is free and he peacefully accepts execution by Dredd. * Vienna. The daughter of Rico Dredd and a journalist who visited him on Titan. Dredd considers her his niece and goes out of his way to help her on occasion.2000 AD #116 and #1300 * Judge Rico. A clone created directly from Joe Dredd's own DNA, identical to him but decades younger. Rather than adopt the same last name as Joe Dredd, this clone decides to redeem the name of Joe's late, corrupt older brother and so becomes Judge Rico with no first name. Judge Rico eventually inherits Joe Dredd's old apartment at Rowdy Yates Block.2000 AD #1186–88, #1280 * Dolman. Another clone grown from Joe Dredd's DNA, but years younger. Formerly a trainee judge and member of the MC1 Space Corps. * Cadet Jessica Paris. A recent addition to the family – a clone of Joe Dredd grown without SRY, making her a woman as a result. Has only made a single appearance in the comic to date in which she was shown as being heavily pregnant and the decision on what to do with her and the child being left ambiguous. The Forsaken 2000 AD #1830–1835, reprinted in Judge Dredd – Day Of Chaos: Fallout * Judge Anderson. For years, Dredd had a close but uneasy friendship with Cassandra Anderson of Psi-Division, which came to an end when Anderson briefly abandoned the law. After she returned to duty, Dredd initially denied their friendship, but re-affirmed it after she was injured while saving the city. Dredd has great respect for Anderson's abilities and trusts her often with his life, but sometimes finds her flippant attitude and playful jokes annoying.Judge Dredd Megazine vol. 3 #1–7 * Judge Hershey. Dredd has known Chief Judge Hershey since 2102. Like all Chief Judges since Goodman, Dredd has easy access to her, but they also have a personal relationship based on mutual respect. While they've had differences at times, Dredd believes her to be \\"the best Chief Judge we've ever had\\".2000 AD #1632 * Walter the Wobot and Maria. Dredd used to rent his Rowdy Yates Block apartment from Maria, a landlady with a thick, stereotypical Italian accent. After helping the Judges fight a robot revolution, a former vending machine robot called Walter the Wobot became the city's first free robot and moved in with Dredd, acting as his cook and housekeeper out of love. After several years, Dredd parts company with both Walter and Maria. Walter starts a business, then briefly goes rogue and starts his own robot revolution, leading Dredd and the second Judge Giant to arrest him. Dredd later assigns Walter a probation sentence of community service as house robot and caretaker of Mrs. Gunderson.2000 AD #60 and 288 * Mrs. Gunderson. A sweet-natured widow living in Sylvia Plath Block in a large apartment with multiple bedrooms that she often rents. Following the \\"Necropolis\\" affair, the supernatural alien Judge Death rented a room from her, using the name \\"Jay De'Ath.\\" Mrs. Gunderson was unaware of Judge Death's true nature due to the fact she is partially deaf and nearly blind, and he spared her after concluding he was the one truly innocent soul he had met. After Judge Death decides to challenge the Judges directly and no longer hide, Judge Dredd meets Mrs. Gunderson. He meets her again when it is discovered that one of her rented bedrooms is now haunted by a journalist Judge Death murdered. To ensure she can make money from the room, Judge Dredd helps Mrs. Gunderson contact a ghost-hunting group willing to rent it for their own purposes. Dredd later assigns his former house robot turned criminal Walter the Wobot to serve a probation sentence as Mrs. Gunderson's caretaker and housekeeper. Dredd visits the apartment again when Judge Death returns on the 12th anniversary of his defeat at Necropolis in the audio drama Judge Dredd: Death Trap. * Galen DeMarco. A Judge infatuated with Dredd. This breach of regulations led her to resign from the Justice System and become a private investigator. Dredd first tried to help her adjust to civilian life but she severed contact when he again rejected her advances.2000 AD #1101–1110, 1167; Megazine vol. 3 #52–59 * Fargo clan. A town occupied by the mutated descendants of Ephram Fargo, the twin brother of Chief Judge Eustace Fargo. These mutants, who share the common mutation of an overly large, exaggerated chin, are relatives of Judge Dredd himself, and consider him a \\"cousin\\". This led to Dredd campaigning to have Mega-City One's mutant segregation laws repealed.2000 AD #1511–1512, #1542–48, #2008 * Judge Morphy. Dredd's mentor at the beginning of his career. The two maintained a respect and appreciation for each other over the years, arguably making him one of Dredd's only friends. The same day he told Dredd he would retire from street duty soon and hoped to become a teacher, Morphy was killed in the line of duty.2000 AD #387, 662–668, 775 * Judge Logan. Dredd's assistant for a number of years, later promoted to sector house chief.2000 AD #2115 Dredd encourages Logan to become Chief Judge when Hershey resigns. His public endorsement is instrumental in Logan attaining that office.2000 AD #2117–2118 * Judge Giant Senior. Dredd's first cadet trainee, introduced during Dredd's first year of stories. Having graduated from the Academy of Law, he is assigned to Dredd for final field assessment. After testing if he will stand up even to other judges when they break the law or codes of conduct, Dredd is satisfied and approves Giant. Giant then bid his family goodbye, saying he needed to focus all his energy on enforcing the law. Giant was a recurring character for years and saves Dredd from execution when Mega-City One is temporarily controlled by the insane Chief Judge Cal. Judge Giant Sr. is shot in the back and killed in the line of duty during the \\"Block Mania\\" story (1981) while trying to arrest Orlok, just before the Apocalypse War. * Judge Dekker. Dredd's second cadet trainee, first appearing in \\"Super Bowl\\" (in 2000 AD #370–371, 1984). Dekker quickly proves her worth and becomes a Judge after Dredd's assessment. The two fought alongside each other several times after she became a full Judge, and Dredd considered her his best cadet trainee. She died during the 1992 story \\"Judgement Day.\\" * Judge Giant Junior. The 1989 story \\"Young Giant\\"Judge Dredd: \\"Young Giant\\" (by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra, in 2000 AD #651–655, 1989) establishes Judge Giant fathered a child in 2101 before his death, despite judges being prohibited from marrying and/or creating families. Orphaned when his mother was murdered in front of him shortly after the Apocalypse War in 2104, Giant's son \\"Junior\\" is inducted into the Academy of Law. Years later, the ten-year-old Cadet Giant is supervised on a field test by Judge Dredd, who notes the cadet performs extremely well but has unresolved rage regarding the murder of his mother. With Dredd's help, Giant Jr. brings in his mother's killer according to proper protocol rather than simply hunting the man down and executing him. Giant Jr. spends the next several years as a cadet, helping Dredd on different occasions such as during the \\"Necropolis\\" affair and \\"Judgement Day.\\" Five years after his introduction, Giant Junior's final assessment is conducted by Judge Dredd and he becomes a Street Judge in 2116, the youngest to do so at age 15.Judge Dredd: \\"Giant\\" (by John Wagner and Ian Gibson, in Judge Dredd Megazine vol. 2 no. 50-52, 1994) * Judge Steel. Introduced in the 2002 Big Finish Productions audio drama Judge Dredd: Wanted: Dredd or Alive, Steel was another cadet trained by Dredd who became a trusted ally. Born in Brit-Cit, 5-year-old Amy Steel joined the Judge Academy after the murder of her father, quickly transferring to Mega-City One. On her 18th birthday, she was assigned to Dredd for final assessment. Although she ignored certain orders and protocols, Dredd believed in her and said he was honored to ride with her. Dredd and Steel worked alongside each other in more audio dramas, including against Judge Death. After uncovering information about her past, she left the Judges in the audio drama Judge Dredd: Get Karter! Steel gave Dredd her badge, indicating she might return. * Judge Beeny. Dredd's protégée since 2007. On Dredd's recommendation, Hershey appointed her to the Council of Five.Judge Dredd Magazine #367  References  Category:American superheroes Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977 Category:Fictional bikers Category:Fictional clones Category:Fictional judges Category:Fictional police officers in comics Category:Judge Dredd characters ","title":"Judge Dredd (character)"},{"id":"62513186","text":"is a Japanese shōjo manga series by Koromo.

All 33 seats in the Cortes will be up for election. Overview Electoral system The Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha are the devolved, unicameral legislature of the autonomous community of Castilla–La Mancha, having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution and the Castilian-Manchegan Statute of Autonomy, as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a regional president. Voting for the Cortes is on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprises all nationals over eighteen, registered in Castilla–La Mancha and in full enjoyment of their political rights. Additionally, Castilian-Manchegan people abroad are required to apply for voting before being permitted to vote, a system known as \\"begged\\" or expat vote (). The 33 members of the Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha are elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of three percent of valid votes—which includes blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Parties not reaching the threshold are not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Seats are allocated to constituencies, corresponding to the provinces of Albacete, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Guadalajara and Toledo, with each being allocated an initial minimum of three seats and the remaining 18 being distributed in proportion to their populations. The use of the D'Hondt method may result in a higher effective threshold, depending on the district magnitude. Election date The term of the Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha expires four years after the date of their previous election. Elections to the Cortes are fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. The previous election was held on 26 May 2019, setting the election date for the Cortes on Sunday, 28 May 2023. The president has the prerogative to dissolve the Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence is in process, no nationwide election is due and some time requirements are met: namely, that dissolution does not occur either during the first legislative session or within the legislature's last year ahead of its scheduled expiry, nor before one year has elapsed since a previous dissolution. Any snap election held as a result of these circumstances will not alter the period to the next ordinary election, with elected deputies merely serving out what remains of their four-year terms. In the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional president within a two-month period from the first ballot, the candidate from the party with the highest number of seats is to be deemed automatically elected. Parliamentary status The table below shows the status of the different parliamentary groups in the Cortes at the present time. {  style=\\"font- size:96%; text-align:left;\\" + Current parliamentary composition - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Groups ! rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Parties ! colspan=\\"2\\" Legislators - !

Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election are required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors need to secure the signature of at least one percent of the electorate in the constituencies for which they seek election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates.

Estimates of fatalities range between 40 and 150. Background Protests erupted across Iran on 15 November 2019, after the government announced a sudden gasoline price hike, spreading to more than 100 cities nationwide. The protests quickly extended into opposition to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the current regime. Internet inside the country was completely shutdown by the government on 16 November which made reporting on the details nearly impossible. Massacre During the first few days of demonstrations in Mahshahr in mid-November, protesters gained control over much of the city. Security forces clashed with protestors in Mahshahr on 16 and 17 November, and attempted to suppress protests between 16 to 18 November in the suburbs of Sarbandar and Jarahi. The New York Times, based on interviews with residents, including a journalist and a nurse at the hospital were casualties of the crackdown were treated, dated the arrival of a large force of Revolutionary Guards to 18 November. According to The New York Times, Revolutionary Guard forces entered Shahrak Chamran, a suburb of Mahshahr, and indiscriminately shot at protesters, several who died. Other protestors gathered in a marsh near the location of the initial killing. One protestor, \\"apparently armed with an AK-47\\", according to The New York Times, fired at the Revolutionary Guards. Iranian state media described the protestors in these events as a \\"separatist group\\" armed with \\"semi-heavy weapons.\\" The Revolutionary Guards responded immediately by encircling the protestors in the marsh and shot them with machine guns, killing 100. The Guards carried the dead away on \\"a truck\\" and left, while families of survivors carried them to Memko Hospital. According to Iranwire, some of the security forces involved were killed. A second lethal incident took place in the Shahrak Taleghani district of Mahshahr on 19 November, in which Revolutionary Guards arrived in tanks and carried out an hours-long gun battle against local ethnic Arabs. One senior Guards commander was killed. A protest organiser interviewed by The New York Times was shot in the ribs during the battle. A nurse stated to The New York Times that she had treated people wounded in the battle and most had head and chest gunshot wounds. Some of the wounded protestors were arrested in the hospital. Casualties Initial reports from Mahshahr suggested that over 130 protesters had been killed by security forces in the three days of fighting. The New York Times report, which was published two weeks after the incident, suggested that between 40 to 100 protesters had been killed in Mahshahr and its suburbs. On 17 December 2019, an official from the province of Khuzestan told reports at IranWire that a total of 148 protesters had lost their lives during five days of protests in Mahshahr. Aftermath On 25 November, Mohamad Golmordai, Mahshahr representative in the Iranian parliament, expressed his anger at the massacre in a speech in parliament that was broadcast on state television. He \\"screamed\\", according to The New York Times, \\"What have you done that the undignified Shah did not do?\\". On 18 January 2020, the U.S. State Department sanctioned Brigadier General Hassan Shahvarpour, as being responsible for the Massacre of Mahshahr.

Pouya's mother stated that \\"For a moment I saw that people were carrying the body of a protester, and I realized it was my son\\". In an interview with Masih Alinejad, Manuchehr Bakthiari stated that \\"They killed my son, they might as well execute me. My son was interested in poetry and literature, not hooliganism. People are tired of the officials [of this country] who steal and are corrupt, and it is for this reason that they call people like my son hooligans while they are the real hooligans\\".

It is situated in Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park, north of Pemberton, and south of Mount Gandalf, which is its nearest higher peak. The peak is named for J. R. R. Tolkien (1892–1973), author of the novels The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The names for nearby Mount Aragorn, Mount Gandalf, and Mount Shadowfax were taken from fictional characters in his books, which were read while waiting out stormy weather during the 1972 first ascents of those mountains. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Fraser River. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Tolkien Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Tolkien Peak.

Ripps is most known for the textural density, heavy layering of materials, and heightened canvases in his work, often produced with high volumes of oil paint and incorporation of artificial leaves and metals, among other materials.  Biography  Ripps was born in Brooklyn, New York, to parents Sol Michael and Anne Ripps (née Jacobie). Ripps' father owned and operated a dry cleaning service in Manhattan, New York. Ripps graduated from Andrew Jackson High School in Cambria Heights, Queens, New York. He is an alumnus of both Hunter College and York College. Ripps rose to prominence in the 1970s. In 1977, Ripps participated in his first group exhibition, \\"Painting 75/76/77\\" at the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center. Ripps was an affiliate of Andy Warhol's, posing for a series of Polaroid photographs shot by the latter. Ripps was also mentioned in Warhol's journals and appeared as a guest on the talk show Andy Warhol's TV Early in his career, Ripps worked in construction as a source of supplemental income. Ripps' illustration, \\"Rosette\\", was present in the Whitney Museum's 1979 Biennial event. In 1979, Ripps married designer and academic, Helene Verin in the latter's hometown of Chicago, Illinois. He is the father of conceptual artist, Ryder Ripps  Style and Critical Reception   In Culture  Ripps' work has been tethered to a variety of American artistic movements, most notably neo-expressionism and ornamentalism. This is, in part, the result of Ripps' continuous incantation of nature in his work. In a 1979 review in ArtForum, art critic Donald B. Kuspit attempted to term Ripps' work as a \\"Cosmetic Transcendentalism\\". This terminology defined Ripps' work as a self-conscious form of transcendentalism that, through vibrancy of colors, scale, and textural variety, embrace \\"[...] its own cosmetic character, and which is an expression of a theatrical ambition\\" of the contemporary artistic landscape. Ripps' paintings are often supplemented with artificial leaves made of linen, often bound together and worked over heavily with thick layers of oil paint. Ripps' work has retrospectively been defined by art historians as an unspoken influence of Julian Schnabel, a sentiment echoed by Ripps himself.  Notable Works  Two of Ripps' works, \\"Untitled\\" (1976) and \\"The Meadow\\" (1980) belong to the permanent collection at the Brooklyn Museum under their Contemporary Arts wing. Six of Ripps' work belong to the Vogel 50x50 collection. \\"Odyssey in Space\\" (1980), is part of the permanent collection at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, France  Selected Solo Exhibitions  1991: \\"now is the silence\\"- Marisa del Re Gallery, New York City, New York, United States 1985: Marisa Del Re Gallery, New York City 1984: Carnegie Mellon U., Pittsburgh, 1984 1983: Munson-Williams Procter Institute, Utica, New York Carl Solway Gallery, Cincinnati, 1983 1982: Galerie Daniel Templon, Paris, 1982 Galleria Schema, Florence, Italy Dart Gallery, Chicago Gallery 121, Antwerp, Belgium Gallery G7, Blogna, Italy Munson-Williams Procter Institute, Utica, New York 1981: Holly Solomon Gallery, New York City, New York, United States 1980: Akira Ikeda - Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan 1979: Galerie Hans Mayer, Dusseldorf, West Germany Gallery Bruno Bishofberger, Zurich, Germany 1977: Nancy Lurie Gallery, Chicago, Illinois  Selected Group Exhibitions  2019: \\" Pattern, Crime & Decoration\\" - Le Consortium, Dijon, France 2008: \\" American Abstract Artists: Tribute to Esphyr Slobodkina\\" - The Painting Center, New York City, New York, United States 2005: \\"Blooming\\" - Carl Solway Gallery, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States 1983: \\" New Work New York - Newcastle Salutes New York\\" Gallery North , Northumbria University Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom 1982: \\"Dynamix\\" - Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center (CAC), Cincinnati, Ohio, United States 1981: \\"Figures, forms and expressions\\" Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York, United States 1979: Whitney Biennial 1979 - Whitney Museum of American Art, New York City, New York, United States 1978: \\"Thick Paint\\" - The Renaissance Society, Chicago, Illinois, United States \\"Arabesque\\" - Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center (CAC), Cincinnati, Ohio, United States 1977: \\"New Abstract Objects\\" - Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center, Buffalo, New York, United States \\"Painting 75/76/77\\" - Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center (CAC), Cincinnati, Ohio, United States  References  Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Hunter College alumni Category:York College, City University of New York alumni ","title":"Rodney Ripps"},{"id":"62513970","text":"Radio Kidlat 107.7 (DXQB 107.7 MHz) is an FM station owned and operated by Subic Broadcasting Corporation.

She moved to Kansas City and worked as a bookkeeper, renting a room from James Greenwood, the Kansas City superintendent. Greenwood hired her in 1861 when the library was still a subscription library, calling her \\"the smartest woman I have ever known.\\" By 1897, Whitney had fully ended the library's subscription model, and all city residents were allowed access to the library. The collection, which was described as \\"2,000 catalogued books, plus about a thousand volumes of government documents, reports, and periodicals,\\" was enlarged to 30,000 items by 1897. By 1899, the solo library had grown to include a staff of 28 adults and nine young male pages. In 1901, she was elected to be the first president of the Missouri Library Association. Whitney had strong opinions about reading, including keeping reading for younger people tightly controlled claiming, \\"One unwholesome book will contaminate an entire school.\\" In 1908, she published a three-volume history of Kansas City called Kansas City, Missouri: Its History and its People which included biographies of notable local people as well as a history of the city. She was demoted from her position to assistant librarian in 1910 with The Kansas City Journal saying her position should be held by a man, an opinion supported by the local Board of Education. She was replaced by Purd Wright—who had come back to Missouri after one year at the head of Los Angeles Public Library—and was terminated in 1912. Personal Life Westlake was born in 1854 in Fayette County, Virginia, to Wellington and Helen Van Waters Westlake. In 1861, her family moved to Pettis County Missouri near Sedalia. In 1875, she married E. W. Judson in Sedalia. In 1885, she married newspaperman James Steele Whitney; he died in 1890. She spent the last four decades of her life living with Miss Frances Bishop, whom her obituary described as an \\"inseparable friend.\\" References External links * Kansas City, Missouri: Its History and its People at Internet Archive.

They are often represented within the distinguished small shelly fauna (SSF) group because of their minuscule size-from only a few millimeters long, and because of their overt mineralized skeletons. Most SSF are from the clade Lophotrochozoa, however, it is unclear whether Paracarinachites are identified for certain as there have been rare cases of ecdysozoan SSF. Little is still known about the animal due to limited fossil collections; there are currently 27 known collections from China according to Fossilworks. Morphology Paracarinachites are composed of an arched, biomineralized univalve shell with a multi-layered sclerite.Lu, Yanhao, and Et Al. Palaeontologia Cathayana. Vol. 5, Science Press, 1990. The lower region of the shell is subdivided into two sections: a curved adapicle part and a posterior part. The adapicle part is a semicircular shape with a lower-central opening, while the posterior region has a wide, concaved curve. The sclerite that sits on top of the surface of the adapicle portion contains a simple, rugged array of 5-6 small, protruding bumps; the posterior region's sclerite carries along an alternating array of 10-14 spines. Ecology Established as marine-dwelling detrivores, Paracarinachites spent most of their life on the surface of the ocean, attached to both fauna (plants/algae) and infauna (dead organisms) alike to feed off of. Considering they were slow- moving creatures, they were more vulnerable to larger and faster predators and had to rely on the habitual exploitation of their surrounding environment. As far as locality, Paracarinachites as well as other related Zhijinites have been found in China and in Southern France.MORRIS, S., MENGE, C. 1991.

Featuring a total of 120 exhibits by 65 artists, it was the first time \\"Hong Kong art\\" was the theme of an exhibition, as well as the first large-scale art competition organised by the government. Apart from the usual practice of inviting participating artists, the event also incorporated an open call for submissions, which caught the attention of the local art scene. In his introductory text for the exhibition catalogue, the museum's curator John Warner explained what he envisioned as the \\"valid art forms of today\\": \\"If that artist of to-day sees the world in terms of unified abstract design or explosive blotches of paint, if his pictures remind us of aerial photographs or a nuclear explosion, then at least he is being true to the times in which he lives.\\"  Significance  The City Hall Museum and Art Gallery (later renamed Hong Kong Museum of Art in 1975) was housed in the High Block of the newly built Hong Kong City Hall, a modernist building by the waterfront of Central, Hong Kong. This new museum had a clear-cut policy to promote and recognise \\"local art\\"—not Chinese, British, or other Western art. As a prominent event in the series of inaugural programmes for the new museum/gallery, the survey show Hong Kong Art Today was a manifestation of this mission. Though it was an exhibition mounted in a museum setting, the artworks were for sale, with prices marked in the catalogue. The City Hall Museum and Art Gallery acquired some of the works and formed the foundation of its Hong Kong art collection.  Controversy  The “open call” was successful in generating immense interest from the local art scene, however, it was for this reason that the exhibition soon became controversial. Artist Luis Chan was among the many artists whose works were rejected in the open call. Chan, a watercolour painter known for his naturalistic style landscapes. He had been active in the local art scene since the 1930s. He submitted several abstract works to the exhibition—a somewhat new direction of Chan's artistic endeavor. Only one of his works got accepted. As an established figure in the 1950s, and appointed an adviser to the newly established museum, his failure stirred up a storm in the local art circle, especially when Chan decided to make the rejection public to air his frustrations and address the problems of the exhibition. He wrote a long article titled \\"My Unsuccessful Submission to the City Hall Art Exhibition\\" (Chinese: 大會堂畫展落選記), which was published in serial form in the local Chinese newspaper Wah Kiu Yat Po over a period of time. The issues surrounding the debate included: works by famous artists of the time failing to be accepted through the open call; many rejected artists coming from the same art club (the Contemporary Chinese Artists' Guild, of which Chan was Chair); the obscure criteria of adjudication under the confidentiality of the selection panel; the imbalanced quantity of Chinese paintings and Western paintings being selected; and the selections leaning towards abstract art. The exhibition reflected how naturalism in art had become passé and that abstract art was favoured. In his 2001 article examining the incident and its consequences, Jack Lee, then studying for his PhD in art history, argued that, \\"[Warner's] prejudice for modern and abstract art influenced directly the museum's later exhibitions and its collection policies, which in turn caused some artists to turn to abstract art in the hope that their works would become appealing to the museum. Their conversion in due course formed a new tendency in Hong Kong art.\\" On a personal level, Luis Chan's rejection was a \\"career catastrophe\\" as described by art historian David Clarke, who observed that, \\"for a great part of the 1960s [Chan's] work evidences his loss of artistic security.\\" Chan's trials in abstraction came across as a failure, and his next artistic breakthrough did not come until a decade later.

Belna's precursor—an initially broad trough of low pressure west of Seychelles—was formally designated as a zone of disturbed weather on 2 December during a favourable period for tropical cyclogenesis in the Indian Ocean. The disturbance gradually developed over the course of several days, tracking slowly westward. Météo-France (MFR) upgraded the system to a tropical depression on 5 December and then to a tropical storm later that day. Belna reached tropical cyclone strength on 7 December as it began to turn towards the southwest, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 155 km/h (100 mph) before fluctuating in intensity over the following day as it passed just east of Mayotte. On 9 December, Belna restrengthened and reattained its peak winds upon making landfall near Soalala along the northwestern coast of Madagascar. The cyclone weakened before ultimately dissipating over southern Madagascar on 11 December. In the French overseas department of Mayotte, up to 15,000 people relocated to shelters in advance of the storm. Several of the department's services, including the main airport and ferries, were suspended. The cyclone ultimately passed east of Mayotte with only minor impacts. Northern Madagascar was impacted by heavy rains from Belna. Soalala and Antsiranana experienced extensive flooding. Strong winds in Soalala damaged the roofs of 80% of homes and government offices. In total, there were nine fatalities and over 2,000 injuries associated with Belna. Damage in Madagascar is estimated at around US$25 million. Meteorological history Pawan, Belna, and Ambali MFR began highlighting the potential for tropical cyclone development in their daily bulletins on 25 November, noting an increase in shower activity west of Seychelles. Aided by the passage of a Kelvin wave and a favourable window in the Madden–Julian oscillation, a broad trough of low pressure began to take shape within the storm activity, extending across the equator. Projections from computer models remained in disagreement over the system's future, complicated by the concurrent development of a tropical disturbance in the northwestern Indian Ocean along the same trough. A loosely-defined wind circulation was detected south of Mahe, Seychelles on 29 November, offset from convection. Over the following days, this circulation tightened within an environment moderately conducive for tropical development. Météo-France declared the system as a zone of disturbed weather on 2 December; at the time the system had drifted west from its point of origin. Although the storm was better organised and the environment conducive for intensification, the storm's wind field initially remained elongated and rainfall remained north of the storm's centre. The disturbance became a tropical depression on 5 December, attended by an increase in rainbands and the return of convection at the centre of circulation; at 18:00 UTC that day, the system was upgraded to Moderate Tropical Storm Belna. Belna was upgraded to severe tropical storm status early on 6 December. Around the same time, a cloud-obscured eye briefly became apparent in microwave satellite imagery. Due to a strengthening area of high pressure to its east, Belna began to curve from its initial westward drift to a more directed southwestward trajectory. After a brief period of strengthening, Belna's central dense overcast remained largely unchanged throughout 6 December before signs of resumed intensification emerged by the day's end, followed by the development of another eye across. With the storm's eye becoming better defined, MFR upgraded Belna to a tropical cyclone early on 7 December. Hot towers were detected atop and within the storm's radius of maximum winds, suggesting the onset of a more accelerated rate of intensification. However, the presence of dry air in the mid-levels of the troposphere towards the storm's southeastern quadrant prevented Belna from developing considerably. At 18:00 UTC on 7 December, Belna's winds topped out at 155 km/h (100 mph) before fluctuating at a slightly lower strength over the ensuing day. The system's structure disorganised significantly in a short period, caused by both the dry air and northerly wind shear. The cyclone's structure varied considerably throughout 8 December, at times featuring a small eye surrounded by intense lightning activity and at other times degrading in response to an intrusion of dry air into the Belna's circulation. Belna's strength was highly variable in part due to its small size, making it susceptible to changes in the local atmospheric environment and complicating forecasts. On 9 December, a new phase of intensification began as Belna approached the Madagascar coast near Soalala, with an eye becoming apparent on visible satellite imagery. In its advisories, the MFR noted a \\"spectacular intensification spell\\" in the hours leading up to Belna's landfall on Madagascar, assessing the cyclone's winds at 155 km/h (100 mph) and the pressure at 965 mbar (hPa; 28.5 inHg)–the lowest analysed over the course of the storm's existence—as Belna moved ashore at 15:30 UTC on 9 December. The storm then began to weaken as it tracked farther inland, parallelling the western coast of Madagascar. By 12:00 UTC the next day, Belna's winds had tapered below tropical depression thresholds, though the storm retained a well-defined wind circulation with tightly packed rainbands. Belna curved towards the southeast over Madagascar, and deep convection associated with the cyclone dissipated on 11 December. MFR issued their last update on the system later that day while the centre was over Haute Matsiatra, while the remnant circulation centre associated with Belna was last noted in MFR's bulletins on 14 December. Preparations and impact alt=Visible satellite image of Belna with a faint eye and extended rainbands Comoros and Mayotte A cyclone pre-alert was issued for Mayotte on 6 December, succeeded by an orange and later red alert the following day. Comoros was placed under an orange alert during Belna's passage. Civil security personnel from mainland France and Reunion, some from the National Gendarmerie, were sent to Mayotte to aid storm preparation efforts there. Shelters were opened in several Mayotte communes on 7 December to facilitate mandatory evacuations declared by Mayotte Prefect Jean-François Colombet; approximately 10,000–15,000 people relocated to shelters in Mayotte. Several shelters housed over a thousand evacuees. To preserve the integrity of the department's water systems, water distribution was suspended. Dzaoudzi–Pamandzi International Airport and Mayotte's roads were closed ahead of the storm. Regular ferry service between Petite-Terre and Grande-Terre was also suspended. Belna ultimately passed east of Mayotte on the morning of 9 December, with impacts on the island mitigated further by the storm's small size. Madagascar Météo Madagascar first issued green alerts for Madagascan districts in Diana, Sava, and Sofia on 4 December based on a high probability of Belna impacting northeastern Madagascar. Accordingly, cyclone response measures were activated by the National Office for Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC) and humanitarian organisations across northern Madagascar. By 9 December, 11 humanitarian agencies were active in northern parts of the country. Green alerts were later extended to encompass five districts, and red alerts were eventually issued to all districts in Boeny and Melaky. Schools were closed along Madagascar's western coast. Three teams from the BNGRC tasked with emergency coordination and medicine distribution were dispatched to Mahajanga, Morondava, and Toliara. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies initiated a Disaster Relief Emergency Fund in response to Belna on 9 December, allocating CHF146,491 to 2,500 people within at-risk areas. Approximately 2,900 Malagasy were affected by Belna. Heavy rains and strong winds impacted Boeny ahead of the storm. Belna's rainbands began affecting the Diana region on 7 December. Low-lying areas of Antsiranana were flooded, inundating entire neighbourhoods. Most of Soalala, where Belna made landfall, was flooded. Homes and government buildings were damaged in the city, including 650 homes. Strong winds damaged the roofs of 80% of residences and government offices. Damage to homes displaced 1,400 people, forcing them to seek refuge in mosques, offices, and schools. Outside of Soalala, 900 others were rendered homeless. The city's hospital was inundated with seawater following the collapse of a protective dyke. Another 55 buildings were damaged in the Diana Region and 22 in the Melaky Region. , nine deaths and three missing persons were reported; another 2,693 were injured. In the storm's aftermath, the BNGRC provisioned food and relief supplies to Mahajanga.

Tomás Povedano de Arcos (Lucena, Spain, September 22, 1847 — San José, Costa Rica, February 29, 1943) was a Spanish painter, who spent much of his life in Costa Rica. Biography He studied painting in Málaga and Seville, a city where he worked as an illustrator while he was a student at the Academy of Fine Arts and taught private drawing lessons. His artistic career began by decorating fans, which will be revealed later in a series of flower paintings and allegorical themes.Povedano en el Diccionario biográfico costarricense, s/f; consultado el 24.03.2015Manuel Chacón Hidalgo. Billetes que son obras de arte, La Nación, 28.12.2014; consultado el 24.03.2015 He collaborated with the movement that tried to establish the First Spanish Republic by writing in some media such as El Abanderado and El Baluarte; He was a volunteer militian and representative delegate of the Provincial Committee before the Municipal Committee of Republican Coalition. He was a Mason (he was even Venerable Master of the Respectful Lodge Hermes N. 7) and a theosophist. In 1889-1891 he participated in the scientific, literary and artistic competitions of Seville and in 1889 he won a gold medal at the Universal Exhibition in Paris for a full-length portrait. That triumph contributes to winning the contest opened by the Legation of Ecuador to create a high school of plastic arts in Cuenca. He arrived in that South American country in 1892 and founded the Academy of Fine Arts of Cuenca and also that of Guayaquil. During the time he remained in Ecuador he had important commissions for portraits. He left Ecuador in 1896 to move to Mexico, but on the way he stopped in Costa Rica at the invitation of the Government. President Rafael Yglesias Castro hires him to organize the National School of Fine Arts, which is inaugurated on March 12 of the following year in San José. Povedano served as director of said School until 1940, when the institution becomes part of the University of Costa Rica. Impressed by the aborigines, Povedano painted pictures that reflect, idealized, the culture, history, art and physiognomy of the native population of America. He also made an important national-themed work that includes landscapes and customs. In 1926 he was selected - along with Enrique Echandi, Ezequiel Jiménez and Emil Span - to represent Costa Rica in the 1925 Pan American Painting Exhibition, sponsored by the Los Angeles Museum of Art and held on its premises. He participated in the Exhibitions of Plastic Arts sponsored by the Diario de Costa Rica and was honorary president - along with Span, a German painter who also taught at the Povedano School - of the Art Center. He contributed to the decoration of the National Theater with three great oils: Art, Commerce and Industry. He painted portraits of several presidents and members of important families in the country. Among the first, is José María Castro, who Luis Guillermo Solís, after assuming the presidency in 2014, placed in his office. He introduced watercolor in Costa Rica and showed interest in the flora of the country, painting, like Span, pictures of orchids and other native plants. Povedano also made illustrations for texts such as the Silabario castellano by Porfirio Brenes, the newspaper La Tribuna, the Páginas ilustradas and El Fígaro, as well as for the Historical Booklet of Costa Rica, which, written by Ricardo Fernández Guardia, is the history manual more used in Costa Rican education during the 20th century. A teacher of a large number of young Costa Ricans eager to devote themselves to the plastic arts, Povedano was a clear representative of the academic style, which prevailed in the early years of development of Costa Rican painting. A great defender of the existence of the institution he created, he manages to keep the doors of the School open even in the most pressing economic situations of the country. He stood out in the portrait - he represented some of the most important politicians and characters of Costa Rican society - and in landscapes, customary and decorative paintings. His work was recognized with awards and distinctions, and after his death several important retrospectives have been organized. He was the organizer of the Costa Rican theosophical movement and founder of the Virya Lodge (between 1905 and 1915 he directed the magazine of the same name), from which he derived the Dharana, which Roberto Brenes presided. Povedano married first the Spanish Carolina Amores - with whom she had two children, María de la Cinta and Diego - and then with the Costa Rican María Esmeralda Inés de Jesús Loria Rivera (n. 12.10.1901); from the second marriage he had a daughter, María Elena (n. 25.06.1928).Datos genealógicos sobre familias costarricenses. 17. Tomás Povedano de Arcos, s/f; consultado el 26.03.2015 Fine arts school director Povedano implemented academicism in the School he founded and was a consistent opponent of the new pictorial trends of the late nineteenth century and the avant-garde of the early twentieth century. Thus, he wrote that the works of synthesism, cubism, futurism and orphism were \\"studies of contemporary artistic pathology, [...] engenders of dementia, that it is not conceived how they could have been accepted for a moment without severe rejection in peoples who presume to go to the head of civilization ».Las exposiciones del 'Diario de Costa Rica' (1928-1937), s/f; consultado el 24.03.2015 As an essay dedicated to the plastic arts exhibitions held in San José from 1928 to 1937 points out, the School of Fine Arts was an \\"academy entirely with its back to the renovating tendencies of the time. His works are aimed primarily at certain areas of social elite refinement\\". Povedano students followed the copy of plasters and drawings that were part of the collection of classical sculptures and prints that the Government had acquired for teaching. It was a question of copying «the models imported from Europe with landscapes of an outdated arcadia». As for natural models, in addition to the portrait, still lifes prevailed: flowers, vegetables and fruits; Another frequent theme was the landscapes of lakes with roundabouts or swans, many of which \\"were archaic.\\" \\"Hence, in some cartoons, many of Povedano's students were called\\" paints pillows and ribbons.\\" And the absence of the Costa Rican was notorious, ”says the essay. However, there is unanimity in recognizing their teaching skills. Povedano knew how to teach and possessed a very solid knowledge of pictorial techniques, which together with the fierce discipline he imposed gave good results.Leonardo Santamaría. Tomás Povedano: el artífice de una imagen oficial de Costa Rica, Redcultura, 02.12.2014; consultado el 24.03.2015 Numismatics Several works by Povedano served as the basis for images that were later recorded on banknotes that circulated in Costa Rica. The first in which a portrait made by the Spanish artist was used is that of 10 colones from 1903, issued by the Anglo Costa Rican Bank. This is a charcoal drawing by Braulio Carrillo Colina, which had been published the previous year in the Magazine of Costa Rica. This portrait is the most reproduced in Costa Rican paper money: thus, it was re-engraved on the 5 colón banknotes of the National Bank of Costa Rica in the 1940s, and in others of the Central Bank in the 1950s and 1960s. The portrait of José Rafael Gallegos, who ruled the country twice, was chosen to adorn the 1-colon bill of the Costa Rican Anglo in 1917, but it never went into circulation. The influence of Povedano's drawings is clearly present in the image that illustrates the reverse of the 10-bank National Banknote of the F series of 1939: the engraving of the aboriginal chief is very similar to the cacique huetar that the painter made for the historical Primer of Costa Rica. In 1938, Povedano made a pencil drawing of Juan de Cavallón (currently in the Visual Arts Collection of the Central Bank), which three years later would be reproduced by the engraver of the printing house Waterlow and Sons, London, on the ticket 20 colones of the National Bank, series E, in 1941. In the same year and in the same bank, the 2-colon banknote, series E, was circulated, which had on its back the modified image of The Rescue of Dulcehé, an unfinished oil painting by Povedano. The engraver of the printing house made the pertinent changes to present a finished work: he drew the characters of the figures insinuated in the original work, modified some positions of others and added background elements, as explained by Manuel Chacón, curator of numismatics in the Museums of the Central Bank.

Each chapter is composed of short, two to four page, essays on different shades of its respective color, discussing an interesting aspect of science, history, art, or culture relating to the shade. There are a total of 75 essays in the book. Each page is bordered by a stripe of the color it discusses for easy visual identification, even when the book is closed. The book was generally well-received by critics. NPR listed it on its Best Books of 2017 list. Lily Le Brun of The Economist found the book's design visually appealing and helpful for referencing. Cathy Dillon of The Irish Times called it \\"perfect gift for a colour enthusiast\\". Laura J.

It stars Alison Brie, Debby Ryan, John Reynolds, Molly Shannon, John Ortiz, and Paul Reiser. The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 27, 2020. It was released on February 7, 2020, by Netflix. Plot Sarah is a shy, introverted young woman who lives a quiet life and works at a crafts store. In her spare time, she visits the grave of her mother, who died by suicide the year before, and frequents the horse stable where her former horse, Willow, is boarded, and where she rode in her childhood; Sarah's recurrent visits visibly annoy the owners. On Sarah's birthday, she makes a feeble attempt to ask the woman who teaches her Zumba class to go out with her but fails to make her point. When her roommate, Nikki, finds Sarah home alone on her birthday, she invites Darren, her boyfriend Brian's roommate, over for a double date. The four smoke marijuana and have drinks, and Sarah listens eagerly as Darren reveals details about himself and his past relationship. After he leaves, Sarah has a bizarre dream in which she is lying in a white room with a man and woman. The following morning, Nikki awakens to find Sarah sleeping on the living room floor, and large scratch marks running across the wall. Darren returns to the apartment to retrieve his car, and asks Sarah on a date. At work, Sarah suffers a bloody nose and recognizes a man walking outside who resembles the one from her dream. Later, Sarah spends an afternoon with her childhood friend Heather, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in a riding accident that results in her having recurrent seizures and short term memory loss. A series of bizarre incidents soon befall Sarah: She hears people talking in her apartment when Nikki is not home, and later one morning finds her car has been stolen from her apartment's garage. Gary, Sarah's wealthy stepfather, notifies her the car has appeared at a tow yard, as the registration is still in his name. He brings Sarah to retrieve it, and the tow driver informs them the car was abandoned near a water facility in the middle of the road. Later, Sarah apparently sleepwalks out of her apartment and awakens standing on a sidewalk, and has unexplained time loss. Her boss, Joan, suggests that Sarah visit a doctor given Sarah's familial history of mental health problems. Sarah becomes convinced she is experiencing alien abductions and might be a clone, the latter triggered by a subplot in Purgatory, a fantasy television series Sarah watches regularly. Due to her striking resemblance to her deceased grandmother, Sarah worries she may be a clone of her. Meanwhile, she tracks the man from her dream, Ron, to a plumbing store that he owns. While on a date with Darren, Sarah manically confides her belief that she is a clone, and has him drive her to her mother's grave to dig her up and retrieve her DNA. When Darren becomes disturbed, Sarah accuses him of plotting against her, and threatens him with scissors, forcing him to leave her there. After Sarah strips nude at work with no memory of doing so, she is admitted to a psychiatric hospital. There, she recognizes another patient as the woman from her dream; when Sarah describes it, the woman reveals that she has had the same dream. Sarah takes this as confirmation of her belief that they are both alien abductees, and soon joyfully tells her social worker that she is not delusional. Despite his reservations, Sarah is discharged after 72 hours in the hospital and dresses in her grandmother's dress, covertly stealing Willow from the stable and walks with her into the woods. Sarah stops in a clearing and lies on the ground. Moments later, a spaceship appears; she levitates toward the sky and disappears.

I wanted to write a song for that emotion – the relentless humanity in thinking something is gold when it just isn't.\\" Certifications References Category:2017 singles Category:2017 songs Category:Australian songs Category:Australian pop songs ","title":"Fool's Gold (Jack River song)"},{"id":"62514758","text":"Nancy Abelmann (April 24, 1959 - January, 6, 2016) was an American anthropologist and Harry E.

The area is mainly industrial, but is most known among railfans because of the diamond junction between the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Canadian National Railway.  History  In 1855, the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) built a railroad line from Brookfield to Watertown, which eventually went to Portage. In 1885, the Wisconsin Central Railroad built a railroad line from Rugby Junction to Chicago. This eventually led to their tracks crossing in Duplainville. In 1890, a tower was built in the northwest quadrant of the diamond. Because of heavy winter snow, help was hired to keep the tracks and switches clear. Although there were signals and gates at the Duplainville Rd crossing, there were numerous accidents and some fatalities. The tower burned down on January 1, 1929. A new brick building was then built, which was torn down in 1987 after an interchange track was installed in the northeastern quadrant of the diamond connecting the two lines. The line built by Milwaukee Road eventually fell under ownership of Canadian Pacific. The line built by Wisconsin Central went through the ownership of various railroads before being handed to Canadian National in 2001. The interchange switch on the CP side was removed on or around August 1, 2019 due to a dispute over where in Chicago the railroads should interchange and a lack of activity.  Current railroad operations  The diamond junction in the center of Duplainville attracts many rail enthusiasts and railroad photographers due to around 20–25 trains that run though each line per day. The east–west mainline belongs to the Canadian Pacific Railway's double-tracked Watertown subdivision, which operates under the Soo Line Railroad subsidiary. Duplainville is at milepost 102.2. The north–south mainline belongs to the Canadian National Railway's single-tracked Waukesha Subdivision, which operates under the Wisconsin Central Ltd. subsidiary. Duplainville is at milepost 102.6. The Wisconsin and Southern Railroad also has trackage rights over this line.

It was the first television station in the United States to orient its entire programming to an African-American audience, along the lines of co-owned WOOK radio. Mounting license troubles for the United Broadcasting station group, economic difficulties faced by independent and UHF stations, and an inability to upgrade channel 14's facilities to be competitive in the market led to the closure of WFAN-TV on February 12, 1972. History The road to air In 1953, Richard Eaton's United Broadcasting Company, owners of WOOK AM, WFAN FM and Rockville-based WINX among other outlets in the mid-Atlantic states, filed for television channels 18 in Baltimore and 50 in Washington. With no applications pending for channel 14 at Annapolis, Maryland, Eaton petitioned the FCC to move the channel 14 allotment to Washington, which it did in 1955; Eaton also acquired channel 14 equipment at auction from the bankrupt KACY-TV of Festus, Missouri. In February, Eaton announced that WOOK-TV would debut with programming in the evenings only and would not feature a network affiliation or a schedule of films; in addition, Eaton, planned to build out the Baltimore construction permit as a semi-satellite of WOOK-TV. The station signed jazz musician Lionel Hampton as its musical director. WOOK-TV would launch from WOOK radio's studio facility in the Chillum Castle Manor subdivision, on 1st Place, NE. Initially planned to debut in September 1962, WOOK-TV's start was delayed due to technical challenges. It missed another launch date, in February, in part due to equipment issues and also because it had a problem to sort out in the Black community. Leaders in the Urban League and the NAACP worried that the station would not represent the community well, that WOOK-TV would depict African Americans \\"in the tap-dancing, shouting type of program\\", much as in radio; Eaton pledged not to program \\"distasteful\\" shows on the new station. It was the District's second UHF television station, after public WETA-TV (channel 26), which had gone on the air in 1961. Some 90,000 to 100,000 UHF converters were in place when channel 14 signed on. Initial programming At the outset, channel 14's programming included a number of Black-hosted series. The station aired two daily newscasts, as well as the interview show Washington Speaks and several syndicated shows aimed at an African American audience. However, going against Eaton's promise of a year earlier, WOOK-TV filled its remaining hours with films, primarily pre-1945 fare. It also produced some general-audience entertainment programs, including a high school quiz show, children's program Aunt Mary's Birthday Party, and a talent show. Musical director Hampton produced at WOOK a music show that was syndicated to other stations. The Precola DeVore Show, covering fashion and beauty topics, was hosted by Precola DeVore, who became one of the first black women business owners in Washington when she founded a charm school in 1953; she was nationally recognized for helping to break the color barrier in modeling. Channel 14's connection with WOOK radio also had its advantages. Six days a week, WOOK disc jockey Bob King hosted Teenarama Dance Party, an in- studio dance show with a black teenage audience. Over a seven-year run on the air (though King left in a dispute with management in 1968), Teenarama hosted rising stars and famous musicians including Chubby Checker, Dee Dee Sharp and Brook Benton, as well as musical talent in town to play the Howard Theatre. Teenarama Dance Party would later be considered the most important program in WOOK-TV/WFAN-TV's broadcast history. WOOK-TV also produced for local and national advertisers commercials for its target market. The station's production department counted among its clients Budweiser, Safeway, Sinclair Oil, Newport cigarettes and Speed Queen washers and dryers. On March 1, 1967, the Baltimore station, with the call letters WMET-TV and having been moved to channel 24 in a 1961 allocation revision, began telecasting, with plans to carry 80 percent of WOOK-TV's programming. An attempted 1971 sale of WMET-TV to the Christian Broadcasting Network never closed, and channel 24 folded on January 14, 1972. A time of change In 1967, WOOK's programming began to shift to include more local news and public affairs content. That year, it added two and a half hours a day of local and United Press International news hosted by Tex Gathings and a new talk show, Controversy, hosted by Dennis Richards. Controversy went through several host changes in its early months on air, while the new news show met with poor reception because of the small size of the WOOK-TV news department. Also in 1967, WMET-TV (moved to channel 24 in an allocation revision six years earlier), the Baltimore station, finally began broadcasting. Early the next year, Channel 14 also added weekly hours in Italian and Spanish, and on February 14, it changed call letters from WOOK-TV to WFAN-TV, matching Eaton's other Washington station, Spanish-language FM outlet WFAN 100.3. More than the programming and call letters was changing at the newly renamed WFAN-TV in 1968. John Panagos, the station's general manager and vice president of United, was replaced with E. Carlton \\"Bud\\" Myers; Bob King left, leaving Teenarama Dance Party to rotate hosts until it ended in 1970; and an attempt to unionize led to a walkout at the end of August. License challenge In 1965, even as the Federal Communications Commission gave short-term renewals to a number of Eaton-owned outlets, WOOK-TV was one of three that received a full-term renewal of its license. In 1966, United's AM and TV stations in Washington came in for competition when two groups vied to take them over: Washington Community Broadcasting Company, led by journalist Drew Pearson and which also sought to take over the radio station, and Washington Civic Television, whose principals included WRC-TV sportscaster Jim Simpson and Lewis Shollenberger, former head of Radio Liberty in Munich. At the next renewal cycle, in 1969, the FCC designated Washington Community's challenges alongside WOOK's and WFAN-TV's license renewals for hearing. Washington Community had become the only challenger for channel 14 when Washington Civic Television dropped out and merged with it, bringing Truman- era Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold into its fold. It then dropped out of the television fight in 1970 after the death of Pearson the year before. (Washington Community would eventually win the 1340 frequency held by WOOK radio, with the result being the launch of WYCB in August 1978.) United also attempted to upgrade WFAN-TV's signal, boosting its effective radiated power to 1,265 kW from a transmitter site in Bethesda, Maryland; however, the FCC denied the move because of overlap with WMET-TV's signal. Closure and license deletion On February 12, 1972, United took WFAN-TV dark, citing the company's financial condition. The February 27 edition of the Washington Post, as well as the next day's issue of Broadcasting magazine, carried a full-page \\"In Memoriam\\" ad for WFAN-TV. The ad, taken out by Eaton, diagnosed channel 14 as being \\"choked to death literally because of lack of power to cover greater Washington\\", because of the failure of a common tower site for D.C. television stations in 1966 and the hearing-related freeze on later facility improvements, and revealed that in nearly nine years of operation, the television station had lost $1.45 million—$153,000 of that in 1971 alone. Eaton also noted competition from Washington's other independent stations—longstanding VHF independent WTTG-TV and UHF newcomer WDCA—for programming and advertisers. That November, amid calls to delete channel 14 from television use in Washington and convert it to land mobile use, United found a buyer for WFAN-TV: two Milwaukee businessmen who proposed operation of channel 14 on a subscription television basis and would pay $250,000 for the channel if the FCC approved their plan. In 1973, while the hearing examiner's initial decision found against WOOK and preferred its competing application to the renewal of that station, it found United qualified to be a licensee and recommended renewal of channel 14's (unchallenged) license. United asked the FCC to keep the WFAN-TV license active while it tried to sell it, but the FCC said that because of the multiple and interrelated proceedings against Eaton that were likely to take years, that would simply take too long. The commission ordered United to put WFAN-TV and WMET-TV back on the air by July 1. The deadline was pushed back to December 1; United notified the FCC that it intended to appeal the order. On April 26, 1974, the FCC ruled that both licenses should be revoked so that new applications could be accepted for Washington's channel 14 and Baltimore's channel 24. Channel 14 after WOOK- TV Channel 14 remained unused by a full-power station in Washington for more than 20 years after the closure of WOOK-TV. In 1976, it was reactivated in the form of translator W14AA, relaying the Central Virginia Educational Television Corporation's WNVT from Annandale, Virginia; WNVT was licensed to rural Goldvein, Virginia, too far to the south to adequately cover the Washington suburbs. CVETC attempted to have the full-powered channel 14 allocation moved to Fairfax, but this request was denied. What was to become WNVC was constructed on channel 56 instead, and on its sign-on in June 1981, W14AA was no longer necessary. CVETC received special approval to broadcast Congressional hearings in the interim. Later in the year, CVETC sold W14AA to Los Cerezos Television Company. Los Cerezos (Spanish for \\"Cherry Trees\\") had established in 1980 a satellite-fed translator station on channel 56 of the Spanish International Network, the second such \\"satellator\\", initially authorized on an experimental basis. After the FCC gave its approval to feed translators by satellite, W14AA returned to air as the Washington affiliate of SIN (now known as Univision). In order to accommodate the new full-power channel 14, this station moved to channel 48 in 1989 and is today WMDO-CD. As the FCC began taking applications for a new licensee for channel 14, now licensed to Arlington, Virginia, D.C. mayor Walter E. Washington expressed his desire that the new channel 14 be minority-owned. Overruling his initial decision, in 1984, administrative law judge Edward Kuhlmann selected the bid of Urban Telecommunications Corporation, finding that since Urban was financially qualified, its management and operations were more integrated than those of previous winner WSCT-TV. After years of extensions, the station went on the air in 1993 as WTMW, named for Urban's sole owner, Theodore M. White.

After an initial boom in screenings and production, the presence of cinema in the nation was lower between 1900 and 1910.  Industry development  A film circuit was established in Caracas in 1899, which included the Teatro Caracas, the Circo Metropolitano, a small bar opposite the Circo, the Café La Francia, and the Socorro bodega. After this, cinema appears only sparsely until about 1907.:31 Farrell writes that in the 1890s Venezuela was a frontrunner in the industry of film within Latin America, a status it lost after the state became involved with production in the 20th century.:20-21 It is in 1907 that contemporary evidence exists, through newspaper reviews, of more national films being created. These films were still vistas, depicting everyday activities of the common people, with an aim to \\"[win] the favor of the public and that of the tyrannical authorities of the time\\".:31 The filmmakers were also active in making propaganda for the government.:31 Some of the subjects of the reemergence of 1907 include \\"national holidays, bullfights, events, sports, views of places of the national territory and official events\\".:10 For a few days, beginning on 30 November 1900, a Bioscope was presented by W. H. Whiteman in the Hotel Bolívar of Ciudad Bolívar.:38 These screenings were so popular that the public in the city wrote to the newspaper to ask the show to be transferred to the Teatro Bolívar, where the zarzuela performances were cancelled to allow this to happen.:38 The first sound films of the country were shown by the Frenchman G. Romegout on 31 August 1901, operating a gramophone at the same time as the projector.:67-68 Cinema did not reappear in Caracas until the end of 1901; in the 1890s, Carlos Ruiz Chapellín had shown films in various venues, filling them with theatre during 1900.:87 However, the resurgence of the cinema here, being shown at the Teatro Municipal of Caracas, was not as popular. In November 1901, El Tiempo wrote: The Teatro Municipal of Caracas at the time From 1902 through 1904, the screenings of films again became minimal.:132 Additionally, most halls used for showing films did not have permanent facilities for the function, being limited to the Baralt Theatre in Maracaibo and Teatro Municipal in Valencia; in 1904, the Teatro Municipal in Barquisimeto was the main location for cinema in this region, with other areas using commercial public buildings like cafés and hotels for screenings.:37 The pioneer Manuel Trujillo Durán had returned to photography until 1902; in August 1903 he was working with fellow Zulian Alfredo Duplat in San Cristóbal, Táchira on films, traveling through the state after showing films in Cúcuta.:55 A report in the newspaper Horizontes announced that they were showing films that they had directed.:55 Trujillo Durán continued to work in film through the decade, but sparsely: he operated projectors at several locations, including as the duo 'Trujillo & March' at the Baralt Theatre, where he is documented in 1906 and 1908; at the University of the Andes in 1907; and around the country for Pathé in 1908 and 1909.:55 In 1905, film screenings emerged again in Caracas. Ruiz Chapellín, who had been the main film entrepreneur in the city, was replaced in this position by Carlos Badaracco; seen as a more gentile person, Badaracco's presence and the ability from 1904 to rent films from U.S. companies rather than buy them outright led to more investors in cinema. Badaracco created the Empresa Nacional and guidelines to film projection in 1905, making it an official job.:122 Badaracco would work as a professional projectionist until the end of the decade. This year, a company owned by the Ireland brothers began showing a hundred films that they had imported at the Municipal in Caracas; though a renowned company, the shows left the Municipal starting on 25 April 1905, with the reason that the Circo Metropolitano could hold the much larger audiences they were attracting. The Irelands also introduced different film seasons through the year, and held a special screening on 27 April 1905 with then-Vice President Juan Vicente Gómez in attendance, their last show at the Municipal, though running concurrently with their regular programming at the Circo.:100 Other companies were formed in the decade. In 1908, after the Baralt brothers of Maracaibo relocate to Caracas, the Baralts worked with the Delhom brothers and the two sets of siblings formed a company together. Though it dissolved a year later, the Delhoms continued to make films for another five years, with Manuel Delhom making at least a dozen in 1908.:11 In 1908, the government of Carabobo had several films made commemorating the 5 July 1811 act of Independence.

Origins  The Great Barrier Reef Expedition was a scientific study suggested by Sir Matthew Nathan and Professor Henry Richards who led the Australian Great Barrier Reef Committee from its establishment in 1922. With support from the British Barrier Reef Committee and the Association for the Advancement of Science in England, there was considerable interest in conducting zoological studies of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, to investigate theories put forward by Charles Darwin and others. It was also planned to determine the economic importance of the reef’s marine life. This largely British expedition of scientists sought financial support from the Australian government, universities and the public to fund the expedition and study biological and geological life in a number of sections of the Reef.  Personnel  C. Maurice Yonge, a marine invertebrate researcher, was encouraged to join a proposed expedition to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef in 1927. He was eventually appointed its leader. Twelve scientists including Yonge, his wife Dr Mattie Yonge who would act as medical officer, as well as Frederick Russell, a naturalist with the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth and his wife Gweneth, Dr Andrew Orr and Dr Sheina Marshall, naturalists at Millport Marine Laboratory, Dr Thomas Stephenson, lecturer in zoology at University of London and his wife Anne, Geoffrey Tandy a botanist with the Natural History Museum who would collect marine plants and animals joined the expedition. Thomas Stephenson with apparatus for photographing corals, Low Islands, Queensland, circa 1928 - C.M. Yonge (26544167848) Others included James Steers, lecturer in geomorphology who acted as the expedition’s surveyor. He was assisted by Michael Spender and E.C. Marchant. G.W. Otter and Aubrey Nicholls would be assistants, and Frank Moorhouse of the University of Queensland would provide local marine biology knowledge. They arrived at the two islands of Low Isles on 16 July 1928 and encamped there for thirteen months. Sidnie Manton and Elizabeth Fraser would join the expedition for four months and work with the shore party. The expedition was unique in its inclusion of female researchers. The Australian Museum also sent five people to help with the research throughout the year – Tom Iredale, Gilbert Whitley, William Boardman, Arthur Livingstone and Frank McNeill. Indigenous workers were hired from the nearby Anglican mission at Yarrabah to work on Low Isles in support of the team. They included Andy and Grace Dabah who worked as handyman and cook and were later replaced by Claude and Minnie Connolly. The children of the Dabah and Connolly families also lived with their parents during the time they supported the expedition. Harry Mossman and Paul Sexton from Yarrabah were hired as crew on the research vessel Luana. The Luana was used to carry out scientific studies on and in the water as well as carry provisions to and from the mainland. The expedition was divided into four parts. Researchers investigated ocean conditions, taking hydrographic measurements, recording meteorological and tidal data and monitored plankton. They observed the growth rate of the corals and the marine life around it. They collected specimens including plankton as well as conducting dredging and trawling around the reef. Trochus shell was collected and studied and at the time a trochus farming industry was proposed. Black-Lip pearl oysters, Beche De Mer and rock and mangrove oysters, as well as the fish populations of the surrounding areas were assessed for potential economic development. Other studies considered a sardine fishing industry for the region and the turtle industry of Heron Island, near Gladstone. Boring of the reef had been undertaken around Michaelmas Cay in 1926 to determine the age and thickness of the reef, which helped the geological research. Exposed coral near the anchorage, Low Islands, Queensland, ca. 1928, 1 - C.M. Yonge (37190980776)  Outcomes of the expedition  The scientific discoveries of the expedition were well reported in the press during 1928–1929. One of the first visitors to Low Isles during the Expedition was journalist Charles Barrett whose newspaper articles were later published as a book. The expedition itself published seven volumes of scientific material in addition to articles in scholarly journals. Maurice Yonge also published a book aimed at a general audience – A year on the Great Barrier Reef (1930). In part due to the extensive newspaper coverage, tourists sought out the islands following the expedition to collect shells and corals. This collecting for scientific and private collections was so extreme that the island was ‘virtually swept clean’. Yonge and his team’s research pioneered studies into coral physiology and their research persists in being vital reference material to current study.  Subsequent expeditions  In 1968 a Belgian expedition to the reef was undertaken. In 1973, a Royal Society and Universities of Queensland Expedition was undertaken to the northern part of the reef.

It has smooth greyish bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, red to pink, sometimes yellowish flowers and conical to slightly bell-shaped fruit.  Description  Eucalyptus proxima is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth grey bark that is shed to reveal pale orange or coppery new bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on a slightly flattened, down- turned, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on thick pedicels long. Mature buds are oval long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from September to November and the flowers are red to pink, sometimes yellowish. The fruit is a woody, conical to slightly bell-shaped capsule, long and wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus proxima was first formally described in 2005 by Dean Nicolle and Ian Brooker from a specimen they collected near Jerdacuttup in 2002. The specific epithet (proxima) is from the Latin word proximus, meaning \\"nearest\\" or \\"most similar\\", referring to similarity of this species to E. cernua. Distribution and habitat Nodding mallee grows in mallee shrubland between Ravensthorpe and Hopetoun in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions.

There it is known as カジカエデ, kaji kaede or オニモミジ, onimomiji, and is planted as an ornamental. It is occasionally planted as an ornamental outside Japan. It gets its specific epithet and its common names from the two hornlike appearance of the protruding curly stigmas of its flowers, which are retained on its winged seeds. Description In the wild in Japan, Acer diabolicum typically reaches 10 to 15m, rarely 20m, with a fairly wide, rounded canopy. Young branches are brown or reddish brown in their second year and changing to a light grayish brown. Older bark is grayish brown, and nearly smooth or slightly pebbled. In its bark it somewhat resembles members of the snakebark maples (Acer sect. Macrantha), but it is a member of Acer sect. Lithocarpa. The winter buds are ovate to oblong-ovate, dark brown in color, and protected by 6 to 8 pairs of pubescent scales. Petioles are long and slender from 4 to 10cm, with some pubescence at their apices. The deciduous leaves have five lobes, and are from 10 to 12 centimetres in length and breadth. They are cordate or subcordate, and rarely basally truncate. The lobes are broadly ovate, acuminate, and distally dentately serrate, or one might say crenately dentate, with the teeth broadly acute or even obtusish. The middle lobe is larger and itself frequently slightly three-lobed. The two basal lobes are smaller have perhaps one or two teeth on their margins. Young leaves have long silky caducous hairs, and retain some pubescence on their undersides at maturity. Leaves and male flowers The trees are dioecious, with the usually salmon to brick red flowers appearing in early spring before the leaves fully unfurl. Staminate (male) flowers are held in 8 to 10 flowered nodding fascicle-like racemes. The slender pedicels are pilose or glabrate and from 2 to 4cm long. The perianth is broadly campanulate and typically 4mm long, with 4 to 8 unequal lobes. There are eight 8mm long stamens, and no petals. Anthers are oval. Unripe samaras with bristles and horns. Some specimens' wings have less overlap than these. Pistillate (female) flowers are held in 5 to 7 flowered pendulous sessile or peduncled racemes, and are 2 to 3cm long. Their pedicels are 5 to 10mm long. The sepals are elliptic, obtuse, and 5 to 6mm long. The petals are oblong, ovaries are densely pubescent, styles are short with two curled stigmas projecting past the petals. The typically 3cm long samaras hang from pendulous racemes, and drop in October. Bristles sheath the area containing the seeds, supporting the retained curly stigmas which have a hornlike appearance. It is these horns which give the plant its scientific and common names. Distribution and habitat Acer diabolicum is found growing on wooded mountain slopes exclusively on Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu islands of Japan. It is generally rare, preferring the warmer conditions of the Pacific side. Cultivation and uses Seeds from the purplish-red flowered purpurascens variety or form of Acer diabolicum were sent to botanical gardens in Britain and the United States in the late 1800s and early 1900s. As a consequence, the more common pinkish-red flowered form is still difficult to obtain from commercial nurseries. In springtime, the emerging foliage and male flowers are reddish and rather striking, especially on the purpurascens form. In the US it makes a sturdy tree, and it does best in USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 6a to 8b. In Zone 5 it will probably need to be planted on a south slope or otherwise protected place. Its wide growth form largely precludes it from being planted on street parkways, but the fact that it, unlike most maples, has male and female individuals it makes it useful to plant males in landscape and garden applications where seedlings are not desired. The flowers attract pollinators. Male flowers and young leaves of the standard form In Japan it is planted as an ornamental, and its timber was used like other maples. In its large leaves and its growth form it is similar in landscape application to the sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus). The similarity to the sycamore and its rather ordinary yellow to orange fall foliage have discouraged its widespread adoption as an ornamental outside Japan.

A tire salesman and garage proprietor prior to his political career, Yoerg established his company, Yoerg Tire & Rubber Company in 1909, reportedly selling more U.S. Brand tires than any other New England competitor during his time in business, overseeing it in some capacity until his retirement in 1954. During his tenure as mayor, he presided during several WPA projects, including the expansion of Mackenzie Stadium, completion of the city's War Memorial Building, and the construction of flood controls in the downtown and Springdale. He also ran an unsuccessful campaign for Lieutenant Governor in 1938. Personal life Yoerg sitting in a service car in front of his Chestnut Street garage, 1922 William Paul Yoerg was born in South Hadley Falls, Massachusetts on October 16, 1883 to Michael John, a mill supervisor, and Nellie Yoerg (née O'Brien). Yoerg would attend public school in South Hadley until he was 13, when he took up work as an errand boy and eventual clerk for the J. Russell & Company Hardware Store in Holyoke. At 18 he became a clerk and eventual manager for the Revere Tire Company on Main Street, beginning his automotive business career, and by the age of 23 was serving as a travelling sales representative for Diamond Rubber. On November 17, 1907, he married his wife, Mary G. Dugan of Ware at St. Patrick's Church in South Hadley, and on April 19, 1909 went on to open his own tire business. Initially across from City Hall at 496 Dwight Street, Yoerg would gradually build his business over the next three decades with the phrase \\"Call Yoerg, 804\\", capitalizing on the still-relatively new telephone system. He would change locations several times to accommodate his growing business until he eventually settled Yoerg Tire and Rubber at 158 Chestnut Street in 1915, where it remained until his retirement in 1954; his former garage building still stands at that address today. Prior to his election he would also serve as the president of the Holyoke Automobile Maintenance Association and on the board of directors of the Tri-County Automobile Club. Mayoralty In 1934 Yoerg would run for the first time against incumbent Mayor Henry Toepfert, but this first campaign proved unsuccessful. On October 30, 1935, Yoerg again took out nomination papers. Although his father, a mill supervisor, had been active in Democratic politics, Yoerg's campaign and subsequent win in the throes of the Great Depression were reported as unexpected by the Boston Herald. Yoerg managed to successfully posture himself as a more responsive alternative to the incumbent Henry Toepfert, with his campaign chairman labeling the mayor \\"dictatorial\\" for his refusal to enforce traffic orders passed by the board of alderman for new stop signs and traffic patterns. He would go across the city appealing to many of its clubs and groups across ethnic and class lines, reportedly holding 10 rallies in a single day, criticizing the incumbent administration's actions as opaque and unresponsive. Ultimately by characterizing his opponent as autocratic, chastising Toepfert's hold over the welfare commission, and using accident statistics and appealing to his experience in the automotive industry, Yoerg was able to win over voters. * He won in an electoral upset by a margin 1,203 votes on December 3, 1935. ;Holyoke mayoral election, 1934 { class= !colspan=1 Candidates !colspan=2 General election - ! !Votes !% -  Henry J.

In 1938 he was credited with successfully lobbying for nearly $1.5 million in Works Progress Administration funds for several streets and sewers projects, equivalent to $26.7 million dollars in 2019 US Dollars. Influenced by Roosevelt's fireside chats, in 1939 Yoerg would also spend a series of radio broadcasts outlining the housing, infrastructure, and other issues that needed to be addressed by the city and its counterparts in state and Federal government. Yoerg would go on to win two more elections, defeating Toepfert-favorite Dr. Robert Cleary in 1936, and Toepfert a second time in 1937, marking the beginning of the first 2-year term in the city's history. Two months before the election, in October 1939, Yoerg would drop out of the race to lead the newly-formed Holyoke Housing Authority as it planned its first project, Lyman Terrace. He would perform his duties as executive director of the agency without salary until September 1940, when he would resign to resume his full-time duties managing his garage. Later life and death Following the end of his term as director of the housing authority, for much of the remainder of his life, Yoerg would remain involved in his garage business, and as a field representative of the local Tri-County Automobile Club. He would later offer public support for controversial Mayor Edwin A. Seibel in the 1950s, who in return would appoint him to the board of the department of public works from 1953 to 1956. After a period of illness, Yoerg died at the age of 72 on September 26, 1957; he was interred in St. Jerome's Cemetery. Legacy The former home of Yoerg's Garage, as it appeared in 2019; the building was designed in 1915 for Yoerg by Holyoke architect George P. B. Alderman. Yoerg's relatively brief tenure, left a considerable legacy in Holyoke, through the many WPA projects that he and his administration pursued, including the War Memorial Building, modernization projects of Mitchell Field and Mackenzie Stadium, modernizing of sewer systems, construction of the city's levy and pumping station systems, the implementation of modern school lunch programs, and the building of Lyman Terrace and Holyoke Housing Authority. With Yoerg's extensive ties to the automobile industry, serving as a director of the Tri-County Automobile Club, he would however assure that the Holyoke Street Railway Company completely dismantled its tracks on city streets with the termination of trolley service in 1937. Yoerg's Garage, still stands today at Chestnut Street, as does Yoerg Circle in Beaudoin Village, the latter memorializing his pro bono service in helping to establish the housing authority.

Location The eastern shores of Taiwan face the Pacific Ocean, and serve as major locations for surfing. Period People in Taiwan surf all year round except during the typhoon seasons, which has been prohibited by law since 2011. The prohibition period starts after the Central Weather Bureau issues land warning. Competitions The Taiwan Open of Surfing has been held since 2010, and is sanctioned by the World Surfing League.

Early life Burden was born on July 11, 1877 in Troy, New York to millionaire iron manufacturer I. Townsend Burden and Evelyn Byrd (Moale) Burden. He attended Groton School where he was a member of the school's football team. In 1895, he succeeded Percy Haughton as team captain. Harvard Burden played on the Harvard freshman football team in 1896. The following season he became the backup center on the varsity team. In 1898 he became a starting guard and in 1899 was the team captain.

This thin-leaved fern is commonly found in New Zealand and Tasmania, growing in patches on rocks and is epiphytic on trees and tree ferns, growing in moist gullies or rainforests. A rather drought tolerant species often found at exposed sites ranging from coastal to montane areas. Forming extensive, interwoven and creeping patches with its thin long (creeping) rhizomes sparsely covered in red-brown hairs, easily recognised by its membranous grey-green fronds, the smooth margins of the pinnae, ultimate segments and indusia; and by the sunken sori in the uppermost segments of the uppermost pinnae. The species can be found throughout Tasmanian rainforests as well as occurring in New South Wales, Victoria and New Zealand on the North and South Islands as well as, Stewart, Chatham and Auckland Islands.  Etymology  Hymenophyllum: Membranous leaf, from the Greek humen and phullon. rarum: thin-leaved; from the Latin rarus.  Description  The narrow filmy-fern is distinct by its long thin, creeping rhizome, membranous fronds, that grow in moist areas. Fronds are pale grey- green, and the entire plant is glabrous (devoid of hairs). Fronds are pendant and up to 15 cm long; stipe to 20–70 mm long, very thin, black; rachis winged in the uppermost section of the frond; lamina 1-pinnate 1–2-pinnatifid, pale green, and up to 100 mm in length and 10–25 mm wide, with no toothed margins. Solitary sori borne at apex of segments, and sunken at the base but not tubular; a whorl or rosette of bracts surrounding the inflorescence or at the base of an umbel, shaped like a rhomboid, apex rounded or obtusely angled; receptacle slender, included. Indusium completely covers the sporangia, and splits apart when spores are ready to be dispersed by wind.  Habitat and distribution  The narrow filmy-fern is found in rainforests, forming patches on rocks and is often epiphytic on trees and tree ferns in moist gullies. It is highly dispersed throughout the tropical and south temperate zones occurring across Australia in New South Wales and Victoria. This species can also be found in Tasmania and on the Bass Strait Islands, While being highly dispersed throughout New Zealand, occurring on North and South Islands as well as, Stewart, Chatham and Auckland Islands. Occurring in coastal to montane habitats, this species is common in rainforests, scrub, shaded cliff faces or amongst boulders and damp gullies. Often growing amongst other filmy-ferns, this species closely resembles is relatives H. cupressiforme and H. peltatum. As with H. peltatum, the pinnae are often divided on only one side. Unlike both these species, however, the pinnae of H. rarum do not have serrated margins.  Taxonomy and evolution  The family Hymenophyllaceae is a largely successful family under the division of Pteridophytes (ferns and fern allies). This family is commonly referred to as the filmy fern family, with around 670–700 named species, only 131 are accepted. Divided into two genera, Hymenophyllum and Trichomanes. The Genera are separated based on the sorus and gametophyte structures, particularly the indsium structure (membrane covering sorus) and the receptacle. The Australian plants of H. rarum differ from their New Zealand counterparts with widely spaced pinnae rather than imbricating pale green pinnae. The Sori of the Australian H. rarum are not wholly sunken within the pinnae nor are they bound to the uppermost segments of the uppermost pinnae. Members from the genus Hymenophyllum are all small, thin and delicate. They are either epiphytic plants or rock plants, forming dense patches or mats along rainforest floors. Members of this family most commonly occur in moist habitats with few members being able to withstand dryer conditions, in which they are able to later 'revive' themselves when moisture becomes readily available.

Biography  His mother was the animal painter, Henriëtte Ronner-Knip. He grew up in an artistic environment. Several uncles, aunts, cousins and other relatives were painters of varying proficiency; professional and amateur. His mother gave him his first lessons and his sisters, Alice and Emma also became painters. From 1868 to 1879, he studied at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. After graduating, he chose to become a genre and portrait painter, rather than focus on animals and still-lifes like his other family members. Although he participated in numerous salons, he never became as popular or familiar as they did. He took a few students, notably . In 1880, he participated in the Belgian Prix de Rome, but did not advance past the preliminary stages. Eventually, he abandoned painting, because the turpentine fumes irritated his weak lungs, and focused entirely on book illustration. Following his father's death in 1883, he took over managing his mother's business interests; selling and arranging exhibitions for her paintings. He remained unmarried and, for much of his life, lived with his family. In his last few years, he lived independently, but returned home to die. After his mother died in 1909, his sisters auctioned off their remaining works at two large sales, in 1911 (The Hague) and 1919 (Amsterdam). Many of his illustrations were for children's books; notably those for Dom Placide, by Eugène Van Bemmel.

Background and early life  Le Tellier was born in an aristocratic family, the grand-grandson of Minister François Michel Le Tellier, marquis de Louvois. After receiving a basic education he joined the Army. In 1733, aged 15, he took part in his first campaign as an aid in the staff of Marshal Louis de Noailles, who was his uncle. Promoted to Colonel in 1740, he led the Royal Regiment in the campaigns of Bohemia and Bavaria.  Scientific career  In 1745, Le Tellier left the Army for health reasons. After a few years, he associated with Madame de Pompadour in an effort to revigorate dancing at the Court, from 1745 to 1754. He also grew interested in natural history, chemistry, geography, physics, mechanics and astronomy. He gave his son, Charles François César Le Tellier, a thorough education, which earned him an honorary seat at the Academy of Sciences.  Contributions to chemistry  Le Tellier worked on \\"marine ether\\" and on the \\"inflammation of radical vinegar\\".  Marine chronometers  In 1767, the Academy of Sciences offered a prize for building a marine chronometer. Le Tellier had a ship build, Aurore, which he used to test the various candidates in real conditions at sea. The expedition also comprised Pingré, Messier and the watchmaker Le Roy, who had built two of the chronometers. Aurore sailed off France, Flander, and Holland in a three-month- and-a-half cruise, sustaining several storms to test whether the chronometers could sustain the movements of the ship. They also made frequent calls to port in order to check the working of the mechanisms and the precision of the longitude measurements made with the chronometers. In 1769, one of the Le Roy chronometers was awarded the prize by the Academy,  Colombes laboratory  Colombes observatory tower Le Tellier set up a laboratory and observatory in Colombes, which he would lend to his colleagues. He also had the tower equipped with state-of-the-art instruments, including some he had custom- built.

Cohen. First published in 2004, the book attempts to answer the question of \\"What is Pakistan?\\" and goes beyond the simplistic labels given to this south-Asian nation; by unravelling Pakistan's past, Cohen wants to predict the nation's future and how the idea of Pakistan will work. Background and content The book is a followup to India: Emerging Power and prepares the way for The Future of Pakistan, written in 2012, which was drawn from the concluding chapter of The Idea of Pakistan. In the book Steve Cohen discusses the \\"idea of Pakistan, the state of Pakistan, regionalism and separation, demographic, educational and economic prospects, Pakistan's future and American options\\" among other things. Towards the end, Cohen outlines five futures for Pakistan (implicitly saying that the future will consist of a mix of each rather than any single one). These scenarios are: \\"the emergence of a moderate, democratic state; the rise of authoritarianism; the rise of an Islamist state; Pakistan’s possible breakup and Pakistan after a major war with India\\". Cohen notes how the vision of Pakistan as a state for the Muslims of South Asia was torn apart with the creation of Bangladesh in 1971. Ahmad Faruqui notes how Cohen acknowledges that \\"the relentless pursuit of Kashmir has done more damage to Pakistan than any other single issue\\". He says that the vision of a democratic state \\"is doubtful whether the Pakistani military with its oversized political agenda will ever let this vision come to pass,\\" adding that \\"the Pakistani army is long on memory and short on foresight\\". Ahmad Faruqui notes how the \\"book’s implicit hypothesis is that Pakistan's insecurities have led to military rule\\". Cohen also blames the politicians for being unable to make a state that fulfills basic obligations to its citizens. Reviews and reactions India Today writes that the book \\"is a detailed biography of a state let down by men as well as history, with every act of salvation ending as betrayal...\\". Rizwan Web of the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies writes that Cohen says that Pakistan is run by the \\"Establishment\\" comprising various elites; a group which > believes that India has to be countered, nuclear weapons have secured > Pakistan, Kashmir is the unfinished part of the partition plan, and large- > scale social reforms are unacceptable, vocal Muslim nationalism is desirable > but Islamism is not; Washington should not be trusted but should be taken > maximum advantage of. The book also provides a view of how Washington can advance its interests in South Asia. Qadar Bakhsh Baloch of Qurtuba University writes, \\"The basic theme of the book is that the Idea of Pakistan has fallen short of its ideas and the biggest question today is how the idea of Pakistan will work\\". However Baloch writes: \\"Cohen's facts are questionable, his logic manipulative, and his omissions are deliberate and meaningful\\". In Outlook magazine, Indian politician Jaswant Singh cites Cohen, who says that \\"this 'Indian dimension of Pakistan's identity' [was]...systematically overlooked by contemporary Pakistani politicians and scholars\\"; this, according to Singh, \\"creates a cruel dilemma—for it can neither be rejected nor acknowledged by Pakistan.

Aged 15, he was one of a group of senior boys from his Berlin secondary school to be conscripted for war service. The boys were sent to a base near Auschwitz. Given a number guard assignments at the concentration camp during the second part of 1944, Gnielka became aware of various Shoah atrocities several months before the arrival of the Red army in January 1945 opened the way for the Nazi atrocities to become more widely known. He never forgot those experiences, and as an investigative reporter for a regional newspaper reporter in the 1950s and early 1960s he played a pivotal role in ensuring that these more nightmarish aspects of Nazi Germany could not simply be forgotten. A file of papers passed on by Thomas Gnielka to the state prosecutor Fritz Bauer triggered the Auschwitz Trials of 1963–65 in Frankfurt, although Gnielka himself died of skin cancer some months before August 1965 when the court delivered its verdicts on the twenty defendants. Life Child soldier Thomas Gnielka was born and grew up in Berlin. Towards the end of the Second World War he was conscripted to serve as a \\"Luftwaffenhelfer\\" (child soldier). With fellow pupils from the Kant-Gymnasium (secondary school) in Berlin-Spandau has was sent in 1944 to the Auschwitz region. Their mission was to defend the IG Farben plant there: duties included supervising the emaciated concentration camp inmates who were sent out each day to be used for forced labour. One of the tasks the boys were required to supervise involved the construction of a protective wall around the plant. The Soviet army arrived to liberate the concentration camp complex on 27 January 1945. Half an hour before they arrived the German child soldiers escaped and fled towards the west. A few survived. Gnielka was one of the survivors. Journalism and marriage After the war Gnielka volunteered for an Internship with the Spandauer Volksblatt (newspaper), based in the Berlin quarter where he had grown up. Through the internship he came across Hans Werner Richter who had recently launched his influential Group 47 young writers' group. Richter's advice was simple: \\"Schreib dir alles von der Seele\\" (loosely \\"write down everything, and write it from the heart\\"). It was advice which Thomas Gnielka would follow throughout his career as a journalist. Later he moved to Munich where in 1948 he met and teamed up with the cabaret artiste (subsequently better known for her work as an author and television journalist) Ingeborg Euler. He set her lyrics to music and accompanied her on the piano when she appeared on the stages in the Simpl quarter of Munich, generally seen as one of the city's \\"entertainment hubs\\": as often as not they would perform together in exchange for no more than a hot dinner. They were married towards the end of 1949, settling in Munich. Between 1950 and 1962 the marriage produced five recorded children. During (or shortly before) the early 1960s they relocated from Bavaria to the \\"Dillenberger Mühle\\" (old mill house) at Herold, a village in the hills between Koblenz and Wiesbaden. Traumatic memories In May 1952 Gnielka was invited to join the twice yearly meetings of Hans Werner Richter's Group 47 writers' circle. (His wife had been attending since 1949.) At his first meeting he read from his \\"novel\\", which sixty-two years later would be published with the title \\"Geschichte einer Klasse\\" (\\"The story of a [school] class [group]\\"). The \\"dismally authentic\\" text concerns a group of school classmates sent from Berlin to serve as child soldiers (\\"Flakhelfer\\") directly beside the Auschwitz concentration camp complex during the closing part of the Second World War. Wiesbaden In 1956 he took a job as a local reporter with the Wiesbadener Kurier (regional newspaper). With effect from 11 February 1957 he switched, becoming the Wiesbaden local editor for the Frankfurter Rundschau, a regional newspaper launched twelve years earlier which had already acquired a national reach. At the beginning of 1959 Gnielka received an unexpected reaction to an article he had produced the previous year for the Frankfurter Rundschau on the situation in the Wiesbaden Social Security Office. Gnielka, in his article, had expressed concern that office employees were processing compensation claims from surviving holocaust victims, if at all, only with great reluctance: some of the clerical employees were prepared to identify themselves as former Nazis. According to Gnielka's report, approximately 50,000 compensation claims were sitting unprocessed in a large heap. Applicants were being treated with a marked absence of courtesy, and old Nazi-era antisemitic songs could sometimes be heard from the back offices. Visit from an Auschwitz survivor On 14 January 1959 Gnielka received a visit from as an Auschwitz survivor called Emil Wulkan. The concentration camp had been (formally) liberated on 27 January 1945. In May 1945 Wulkan had found himself in Breslau (as Wrocław was still known at the time). Wulkan arrived with a little bundle of files neatly tied up with red ribbon, which had been rescued by Wulkan or a friend from outside what remained of SS-main building and, adjacent to it, \\"Polizeigerichts XV\\" (\\"Police court 15\\"), in the rubble that had been the Agnesstraße. The files, a somewhat grisly souvenir of the destructive Siege of Breslau, had been blown into the street by the fire storm that engulfed the buildings on 8 May 1945. Wulkan stated that there had been more papers, but when they had gone back to retrieve these, they found the papers they were looking for had been destroyed by fire. Thirteen years later, still in possession of those papers, Wulkan had read Gnielka's article about the situation in the Wiesbaden Social Security Office and had come to invoke Gnielka's support in his attempts to progress his own compensation claim. When Wulkan left the office, on top of the little sideboard that might normally have accommodated a drink or a small portion of cheese, there was instead the bundle of papers, still tied around with the red ribbon. When he looked at the files left behind by Emil Wulkan, Gnielka found that they dated from 1942. They included a numbered listing compiled with characteristic care and precision which showed the names of Auschwitz detainees who had allegedly been \\"shot while trying to escape\\" (\\"auf der Flucht erschossen\\"). Also identified by name were the \\"successful\\" National Socialist paramilitaries (\\"SS-members\\") involved in the shootings. The document was stated to have been completed by the camp commander (\\"\\"Kommandatur Konzentrationslager Auschwitz\\"\\") and it was indeed personally signed by Rudolf Höß who had overseen the construction of the concentration camp complex around an old army barracks, and served between 1940 and 1943 as camp commander. Fritz Bauer The state prosecutor for the state of Hessen at this time was a man called Fritz Bauer who was by this time already active in the post–war efforts to obtain justice and compensation for victims of the Nazi regime, and was already investigating suspected war crimes committed at the Auschwitz concentration camp during the Hitler years. Finding evidence that would stand up in court was a major challenge for Bauer, however. On the evening of 14 January 1959, after working through the files he had received from Emil Wulkan, Thomas Gnielka arrived home looking \\"really green faced\\" (er ist \\"ziemlich grün im Gesicht nach Hause gekommen\\"), according to his wife. Ingeborg Euler recalled that Thomas Gnielka made a telephone call to Prosecutor Bauer, and a car was sent round to collect the files later that evening. Other sources state that it was only on the next day, 15 January 1959, that the journalist sent the papers with the signature of the concentration camp commander over to the prosecutor's office. They arrived with a brief (seventeen line) cover letter from Thomas Gnielka. Bauer immediately allocated two staff in his office to the case. The named perpetrators of the shootings had managed to leave their Nazi pasts behind them, but they were now sought out and, over time, arrested. In the end the prosecutor managed to find some 1,500 witnesses. There followed nearly five years of meticulous preparation. But when the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials opened in 1963 it was widely acknowledged that the entire investigation had been made possible by the handing over of those vital files by Thomas Gnielka. Political journalist: investigative journalist Gnielka remained a member of the Frankfurter Rundschau editorial team till September 1960. After that he was able to become a freelance journalist, although many of his contributions continued to be for the Frankfurter Rundschau. He also wrote regularly for \\"metallzeitung\\", the newspaper of West Germany's powerful IG Metall trades union, for the illustrated news magazine Quick and for the Munich-based news magazine Weltbild. As a political correspondent he specialised in \\"Nation Socialist continuity\\", identifying former Nazis who were now hiding in plain view as \\"respectable citizens\\" in post–war West Germany, and in some cases exercising influence as members of associations, political parties or employees with government authorities/agencies. Increasingly this meant operating not so much as a political journalist, but more as an investigative journalist. A particularly high profile case in point was Richard Baer, who served, in Gnielka's words, \\"as the last and cruellest of the camp commanders\\" (\\"der letzte, grausamste Kommandant des Lagers\\") at Auschwitz between May 1944 and the establishment's hasty dissolution and abandonment (by the Germany) in January 1945. After the war he seemed to disappear. He located and visited the home of Baer's wife, Maria, in Hamburg. Maria was not at home, but her sister was. Gnielka found the answers provided by Baer's sister-in-law \\"cautious\\", and her overblown praise for the human qualities of her sister's \\"exemplary husband\\" unpersuasive. Gnielka returned home and produced a report which was published in a German illustrated magazine: in his article he ventilated his suspicion that Richard Baer was at liberty, leading the \\"life of a respectable citizen under a false name\\" (\\"...irgendwo unter einem falschen Namen das Leben eines Biedermanns...\\"). The article's impact was no doubt enhanced by the large portrait of Richard Baer at its head. Immediately after its appearance Richard Baer was recognised by a co-worker on the family estate and former retirement home of Chancellor Bismarck where he was employed as a \\"forestry concierge\\", using the name \\"Neumann\\". Baer was arrested shortly afterwards, and died a few months later while still being held in pre-trial detention. Death and celebration The Auschwitz Trials opened on 20 December 1963. By this time Thomas Gnielka was less in the public eye, increasingly content to work from home in the old village mill-house in Herold from where he witnessed the trial, like most people, through the prism of press reports by others. Thomas Gnielka had been diagnosed with skin cancer earlier that year, and by the time the trial ended, on 19 August 1965, he was dead. His death had been reported in the Frankfurter Rundschau of 8 January 1965 under the headline \\"Rebell gegen die Trägheit\\" (\\"Rebel against inertia\\"). The report continued, \\"Nothing made him more angry than the attempts of the old die-hard [atrocity deniers] to keep on cleaning up the old rag dolls [of falsehood] and put them back in the shop window\\" (\\"Nichts konnte ihn mehr erbittern, als die Versuche der Ewiggestrigen, die alte Lumpenpuppe frisch aufgeputzt ins Schaufenster zu stellen.\\"). At his funeral in Herold the oration was delivered by his friend, the writer Heinrich Böll. Left with five children to look after, his widow now moved with the family to Frankfurt where she now plunged into a full-time career as a television journalist with Hessischer Rundfunk. With regard to childcare responsibilities, she was able to team up with her own mother, who had been widowed just six months earlier. Film The history of the Auschwitz Trials of 1963–65 was disclosed to a new generation in 2014 in the drama movie Labyrinth of Lies (\\"Im Labyrinth des Schweigens\\") written and directed by Giulio Ricciarelli. The part of Thomas Gnielka was played by André Szymanski.

He was a member of the National Commission for the Evaluation of Research on Nuclear Materials and Radioactive Waste (1994-2019).  Research  Robert Guillaumont began his research in 1959 on the chemistry of protactinium in solution. He showed that the electronic filling of the 5f underlay begins for this element. The UV absorption spectrum of Pa4+ is typical of a 5f16d1 transition (Pa atom: 5f26d17s2). Together with his collaborators, he extended his methodology for studying the behaviour of radioelements in imponderable quantities to other actinides. The rest of his work can be linked to the common thread of the consequences of filling the atomic underlayer 5f on the physicochemical properties of actinides. This filling plays an essential role in the behaviour of the 15 actinides, especially when these electrons are delocalized, from protactinium (Pa) to americium (Am). This results in a high richness of oxidation degrees of the first actinides (usually from 3 to 6) and in the manifestation of particular effects in the series (electronic states characterized by the quantum number J). Thus, he studied the thermodynamic consequences of the population of sublayer 5f on a series of solution complexesS. Hubert, M. Hussonnois, L Brillard, G. Goby et R. Guillaumont, « Détermination simultanée de constantes de formation de complexes citrique de l'américium, du curium, du californium, de l'einsteinium et du fermium », Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry, 1974, 36 (10), p. 2361-2366 (citric complexes of trivalent actinides from Am to fermium (Fm). He showed the existence of the \\"tetrad effect\\" for trivalent actinide complexes, an effect that reflects an extra-stabilization of the fundamental state of actinides for 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 of the filling of the 5f underlay. After the curium (Cm), it is necessary, to carry out experiments, to synthesize isotopes of berkelium (Bk), einstenium (Es) and Fm by nuclear reactions with particle accelerators,B. Désiré, M. Hussonnois, R. Guillaumont, « Détermination de la première constante d’hydrolyse de l’américium, du curium, du berkélium et du californium », CR Acad. Sci. Paris, 1969, 269, p. 448-462M.

To conduct most of his research he developed the methodology for studying species and equilibria between species in extremely diluted solutions (which radioactivity allows until about 10−14 M), and he pushed, at the theoretical level, the description of the thermodynamic behaviour of a few atoms in terms of deviation from the law of mass action,A.

He was an important warrior and negotiator, bringing numerous Aboriginal clans together in an armed resistance against the 99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot, squatters and the squatters' servants and other workers in the 1840s. Resistance From 1841 over the course of decades, 1200 Aboriginal warriors in the Colony of New South Wales in the Lockyer Valley area (which became part of the Colony of Queensland from 1859), were opposed by, amongst others, the 99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot. Intermittent conflict continued on into the 1850s and 1860s. The line of settlement was held back by 15 years of armed conflict. Multeggerah's tactics included road blocks made from felled trees, and setting an ambush site on a steep hill and in amongst bogs and heavy scrub. Multeggerah was said by some to have lived to old age; but possibly died in 1846 as part of the continuing conflict. Battle of One Tree Hill The mass poisoning at Kilcoy Station instigated a strengthening of resistance activity. Multeggerah organised ambushes of the supply drays on their way up the escarpment from the coast; \\"He had sent word to the Europeans, warning them not to come through.\\" In September 1843 an armed convoy of three drays with a crew of 18 was stopped and turned back.

She was a member of The Souls, an upper class circle that challenged the conventions and attitudes of their class in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Personal life  Cust was born at Denton Hall to Victoria, Lady Welby, a philosophical writer and Sir William Earle Welby- Gregory, a politician and landowner. Her maternal grandmother, Lady Emmeline Stuart-Wortley was a renowned Victorian poet and travel writer. On 11 October 1893, Cust married another member of The Souls, Henry John Cockayne-Cust. She supported her husband in much of his work, including correspondence for the Central Committee for National Patriotic Organisations. Cust was devoted to her husband, despite a reputedly unhappy marriage that lasted until his death in 1917. Cust was a direct neighbour of sculptor Jacob Epstein when they both lived at Hyde Park Gate in London.  Writing and translation  Cust wrote a biography of her mother, Victoria, Lady Welby's first thirty years, entitled 'Wanderers: episodes from the travels of Lady Emmeline Stuart-Wortley and her daughter Victoria, 1849-1855'. She also published accounts of her grandmother's travels. Cust contributed shorter pieces to contemporary periodicals including the journal of the English Association. Virginia Woolf is known to have reviewed at least one of Cust's published books, probably 'Gentleman Errant'. Cust's translation of 'Semantics; studies in the science of meaning' by Michel Jules Alfred Bréal presented the text's first appearance in English.  Other published works include  * Gentlemen Errant: being the journeys and adventures of four noblemen in Europe during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, first published by John Murray, London, in 1909 * Not all the suns; poems, 1917-1944, first published by Nicholson & Watson, London, in 1944 * A Tub of Gold Fishes, first published by James Bain, London * Dilectissimo, first published by Macmillan and Co., London, in 1932  Artwork  Cust may have attended the Académie Julian in Paris, although it is unclear which art forms she trained in. It is also possible that she studied sculpture in London. Cust exhibited her sculpture at the Royal Academy in 1906 showing a bust of her niece and in 1927, part of a model of her husband. She exhibited both in the United Kingdom and abroad, with works shown in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and Paris. In 1884, Cust was the subject of a portrait bust by Alfred Gilbert. Alexander Fisher produced an enamelled portrait of Cust in 1898.

Political Situation at the End of the 13th Century  By the end of the abbacy of Berchtold von Falkenstein (died 10 June 1272), Count Rudolf of Habsburg began to restrict the influence the abbey had on the region of Thurgau. An election for the successor of Berchtold ended in conflicting results, giving Rudolf the opportunity to seize more influence and become more involved in matters of the abbey (he was crowned king in 1273). Rudolf sided with Ulrich von Güttingen, who was elected abbot by the citizens of the city of St. Gallen. The convent, however, had chosen Heinrich von Wartenberg, whom the citizenry rejected on the grounds of being from the same family as Berchtold. The Gotteshausleute (inhabitants of the area of influence of the Abbey), especially the city of St. Gallen, which at the time had not yet gained independence from the Abbey, accepted Rudolf as protector, which was confirmed to them in a Handfeste. However, Rudolf appointed Ulrich von Ramschwag as advocatus over the princely abbey. Additionally, Ulrich was a bad economist who amassed a large amount of debt for the city, in large parts due to his warring efforts against Heinrich von Wartenberg. Ulrich also fought against Heinrich's successor, Rumo von Ramstein. When Ulrich died, everybody recognised Rumo as the only legitimate abbot. The Abbey's economic standing did not improve, however, as Rumo had to sell many treasures to pay the amassed debt and was generally seen as inept. He abdicated in 1281 when he could not handle the situation any longer.  Tenure  Coat-of-arms of the counts of Montfort Wilhelm's election signalled a systemic change for Saint Gall. he was elected abbot from the dynasty of the counts of Montfort, which was hostile towards the abbey during Berchtold's abbacy and sided with Ulrich during the time of double rule. While the spreading influence of the Montforts from the Rheintal to the Argengau had been a point of contention between the house and the convent, the electorate now sought to use the name of the counts for their own benefit. Wilhelm had influential secular brothers who boosted his election, among which were Rudolf I von Montfort, Ulrich I von Montfort as well as the later bishop of Chur, Friedrich von Montfort. After the election, Wilhelm endeavoured to restore the Abbey's former glory. Those ambitions were stopped by king Rudolf who, after dealing with his strong will, grew more hostile towards Wilhelm. Wilhelm was forced to interrupt his first visit at the royal court in Augsburg abrubtly in December 1282 to avoid further impositions from the king. Inhabitants of the abbey were so unhappy with Wilhelm's savings policies and his orders that every monk should be ordained priest, that they lodged a complaint at the royal court. Their accusations were backed by the court and in 1287, Rudolf constricted Saint Gall's access to secular goods and used his influence on a papal legate to impose an anathema on Wilhelm. The king had built the castle Schwarzenbach as a stronghold against the city of Wil, an important trading centre of the Gotteshaus (area under rule of the Abbey). A fierce fight erupted there in August and September 1287. An agreement of atonement was settled outside of Wil on the 6 September 1287. However, when Wilhelm visited the king to finalise the peace, the agreement fell through and Rudolf forced Wilhelm to make further concessions towards the king's sons Albert I and Rudolf II. Spurred by this, Wilhelm continued the fight, assisted by his brother, Bishop Friedrich. The king placed more interest into Ulrich von Ramschwag. When the ruling that Wilhelm was to be excommunicated was finalised, the king, followed by his sons Albert and Rudolf, appointed the abbot of Kempten, Konrad von Gundelfingen to be anti-abbot. Supporters of Wilhelm were threatened to receive the imperial ban if they continued their support. Count Rudolf II stayed behind to fight Wilhelm, who now had to endure a time of defeat and persecution. His castles, among which was castle Alt- Toggenburg, fell into enemy hands. One after the other, his refuges were lost or became unusable. Bishop Friedrich was captured in a battle and died in 1290 when he attempted to escape from Werdenberg castle, which was controlled by Hugo von Montfort, who was on the king's side. When King Rudolf died on 15 July 1291, Wilhelm immediately sought negotiations with the citizens of the city of St. Gall, promising to restore their old rights. They promptly reinstated him as the only legitimate abbot on 25 July of the same year. He thanked the citizenry by formalising their rights on the 31 July 1291 in a comprehensive treaty. Friedrich II († 1290, left), Henry III († 1307, middle), and Wilhelm I von Montfort († 1301, right) Konrad von Gundelfingen had to leave his post. He tried to re-establish himself as abbot through martial means, but relented when Wilhelm paid him 100 Mark. Wilhelm, along with other enemies of the late king, joined an alliance against count Albert which was being assembled by bishop Rudolf von Konstanz. Subsequently, war erupted again in the Gotteshaus. Albert was largely victorious, but Ulrich von Ramschwag's sons – Ulrich himself had been driven out of the city when Wilhelm returned – suffered a major defeat outside the city of St. Gall on the 15 February 1292. Following these events, the conflict was seemingly de-escalating, but never ceased entirely. In 1296, Wilhelm travelled to Austria to negotiate a peace treaty but had to leave without satisfying the wishes and hopes of everybody in St. Gall. When a feud broke out between Albert and King Adolf of Germany, who was Rudolf I's successor, Wilhelm joined forces with the new king, as he had shown himself to be beneficial towards St. Gall. After being granted assurances in the treaty of Schletstatt of 1 September 1297, the abbot consulted with King Adolf for the first time in the vicinity of Frankfurt to support him in his campaign against Albert I. In the summer of 1298, Wilhelm was the only clerical ruler (\\"Pfaffenfürst\\") in Adolf's camp. On the 2 July at the battle of Göllheim, Wilhelm was one of the fugitives from the battlefield. Defeated and faced with economic difficulties due to the military expenditures and losses, he returned to the abbey. Moreover, the old enemy, Albert I, was now king. Only in 1301 could the questions raised about Schwarzenbach since 1292 be reconciled with the new king. According to the contents of the contract, the implementation of which would be delayed and never completely finalised, the castle and the city of Schwarzenbach should have been broken broken up and the city of Wil would have been completely restored. However, Wilhelm had already fallen ill when Bishop Heinrich von Konstanz could report about a settlement. He died on 11 October, five days before the completion of the peace treaty.

Commissioned by the wealthy French Jewish banker Louis Cahen d'Anvers in 1880, the painting depicts his daughter Irène Cahen d'Anvers at the age of 8. During World War II, the painting was stolen by the Nazis during their organized looting of European countries. In 1946 it resurfaced and was exhibited in Paris as one of the \\"French masterpieces found in Germany\\". In 2014, it appeared in the movie The Monuments Men as one of the pieces of art saved by the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program. History In the 1870s-80s, Renoir frequently painted portraits for the families of the Parisian Jewish community. Through the collector Charles Ephrussi, proprietor of the Gazette des Beaux-Arts, Renoir met Louis Cahen d'Anvers. The Cahen d'Anvers family was one of the wealthiest Jewish banking families in Paris.The Hare with the Amber Eyes - Edmund de Waal p. 44. In 1880, Louis Cahen d'Anvers commissioned two portraits of his three daughters, the eldest of which was Irène. The younger daughters Alice and Elizabeth would become the subject of a later painting by Renoir, now commonly known as Pink and Blue. The Portrait of Irène Cahen d'Anvers, also commonly called Little Irene, is considered today as one of Renoir's masterpieces. At the time, for an unknown reason, Louis was so dissatisfied with the painting that he hung it in the servants' quarters and delayed Renoir's payment of 1500 francs. In 1883, the painting was first exhibited in the first exhibition dedicated exclusively to Renoir, held in Paul Durand-Ruel's Boulevard des Capucines gallery. In 1910 the painting was purchased by the wealthy Camondo family, which Irène had married into in 1891. After the fall of France, the painting was looted from Château de Chambord by the Nazis. Like many other important pieces of European art, it became a part of Hermann Göring's personal collection. In 1946, Portrait of Irène Cahen d'Anvers resurfaced and was exhibited in Paris as one of the \\"French masterpieces found in Germany\\". The painting along with dozens of other artwork stolen by the Nazis was later acquired by Emil Georg Bührle, a Swiss industrialist, art collector of German origin and CEO of the armaments company Oerlikon, a wartime supplier of the German military. The painting remains part of the E.G. Bührle Collection in Zürich. In 2014, it appeared in the movie The Monuments Men as one of the pieces of art saved by the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program. In 2018, Little Irène gained popularity in Japan when it was exhibited in the National Art Center in Tokyo, as part of a series on Impressionist artworks on loan from the E.G. Bührle Collection. Irène Cahen d’Anvers Irène Cahen d’Anvers (1872–1963), the subject of this painting, was 8 years old at the time of the portrait. The eldest daughter of the wealthy Jewish French banker Count Louis Cahen d'Anvers, she married Count Moïse de Camondo in 1891. They separated in August 1897 after her affair with de Camondo's stable master, Count Charles Sampieri, whom she would later marry and divorce. Irène had two children with de Camondo, Nissim and Béatrice. During World War I Nissim became a fighter pilot of the French Air Force and was killed in action in 1917 over Lorraine. In 1935, Moïse de Camondo bequeathed his Parisian mansion, at 63 rue de Monceau, including its contents and a major collection of art, to the Musée des Arts Décoratifs to be used to create the Musée Nissim de Camondo in honour of his and Irène's son. During World War II, Béatrice, her ex- husband and their two children were murdered by the Nazis in Auschwitz because of their Jewish ancestry. As her daughter Béatrice's sole inheritor, Irène received the large de Camondo fortune. Irène also had a daughter with Sampieri, Claude, who would marry the French fighter ace and race car driver André Dubonnet. Irène lived until 1963 and died in Paris, aged 91.

Bracket The bracket of the qualifying play-offs for each zone was determined based on the association ranking of each team, with the team from the higher-ranked association hosting the second leg.

Life and Works  Hiltbold von Werstein was the son of a baronial family whose seat was located in the upper Neckar valley. He is first mentioned as a monk in a document of the Abbey of Saint Gall from 1279. He is said to have administered the courts of Gochain and Höchst in 1283 and he is recorded as thesaurarius. Together with Heinrich von Ramstein, he lodged complaint against King Rudolf along with a third monk. He is registered as custos in 1297 and as portarius from 1303. Like his predecessor Heinrich von Ramstein, he ran against Ulrich von Trauchburg in the election of 8 May 1318. The ministeriales supported Hiltbold, securing his victory in the election. The Constance auxiliary bishop Johannes performed Hiltbold's consecration. Hiltbold did not receive the jura regalia, as he remained neutral and did not take sides for any claimants to the German throne. He did, however, get closer to the Habsburg party and received an assurance of assistance from Duke Leopold, documented in a treaty from the 30 June 1319. It is recorded that, on 17 November 1318, he ratified the Handfeste of Abbot Wilhelm from 1291. A document from 15 November 1323 reports the negotiations about a border dispute between Appenzell and Hundwil for which Hiltbold acted as mediator. It is also recorded that on 27 November 1325, Leopold of Austria arranged a settlement for a dispute with the family of Toggenburg in which the abbot was implicated against his will. Kuchimeister reports that Hiltbold spent the rest of his days after his abdication plagued by old age in Falkenstein Castle and subsequently Appenzell Castle. He was buried in the abbey's cloister. Hiltbold's abbacy was characterised by many dispositions and pledgings, which suggests that the abbey was plagued by financial hardship. He was compelled by his old age to entrust his seal with a conventual, a ministerialis and a citizen, who took over his administerial functions by the end of 1325 or the beginning of 1326.

Jakobovits was one of two sons of Rabbi Tobias Jakobovits, Czech historian and librarian, historian of the Jews of Czechia and scholar of ancient Hebrew texts, and was the cousin of Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits, Baron Jakobovits, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Commonwealth. Jakobovits added Jakobi to his family name (Moshe Jakobi- Jakobovits) prior to his diplomatic mission for the State of israel.  Childhood  Moshe Jakobovits was born in 1926 in Prague, capital of Czechoslovakia, son of Bertha (née Petuchowski, of Berlin) and Rabbi Tobias (Tuvia) Jakobovits – librarian of the Jewish community of Praguehttps://www.kehilaprag.cz/en and scholar of Jewish texts. Born to a religious family, Moshe was educated at the Jewish school in his native city. The school was located in the same building in which the family resided, at Jáchymova Streethttps://www.dreamstime.com/jáchymova-street-prague-jáchymova- street-prague-prague-capital-largest-city-czech-republic-th-image99839152, No. 3, today housing the offices of the Jewish Museum of Prague. In March 1939, days before the entry of the Wehrmacht into Prague, Moshe Jakobovits marked his Bar Mitzvah by ascending to the Torah in the Altneuschul Synagogue in Prague. The venue of the event did not appear on the invitations for the security of invitees. Following his Bar Mitzvah, Moshe joined the Bnei Akiva youth movement.  Aliyah (immigration)  On 21 October 1939, Moshe Jakobovits was sent to Mandatory Palestine under the auspices of the Youth Aliyah, and lived in Tel Aviv with his uncle, Michael Jakobovits. Following his Aliyah, he studied and lived at Yeshiva \\"Ha’Yishuv Ha’Chadash\\" of Rabbi Amiel in Tel Aviv, and, subsequently, at Yeshivat \\"Kol Torah\\" in Jerusalem. During the 1941/42 academic year, following a conversation with Henrietta Szold, Moshe Jakobovits moved to the Moshav Kfar Haroeh where he joined a group of children preparing for studies at an agricultural school of the Youth Aliyah. In the 1943/44 academic year, the group began its studies at the Mikveh Israel Agricultural School. During his studies at Mikveh Israel, Moshe Jakobovits joined the Haganah and underwent basic trainingA Concise History of the \\"Hagana\\".

At the end of 1943/44 academic year, Jakobovits finished high school at Mikveh Israel and, with other graduates of the school, formed the \\"Czech Gar'in\\" [\\"Gar’in\\" refers to a \\"nucleus\\" or formative group] which began its training at Kibbutz Tirat Zvi in 1943. During his training at Tirat Zvi, he volunteered to be a \\"Noter\\" in the Jewish Settlement Police set up by the British, serving as a Noter in the Gilboa Brigade at Tirat Zvi station, and, in parallel, continued to be active in the Haganah. During this period he met his spouse to-be, Sarah Schwarz. In November 1944, he and fellow members of his Gar’in, then already called the \\"Masu’ot Group\\", established a temporary kibbutz settlement within the bounds of Kfar Haroeh, with the objective of establishing a permanent settlement on Mount Hebron, next to Kibbutz Kfar Etzion. In April 1945, the Gar’in moved to Gat Rimon, next to Petach Tikva. At the beginning of November 1945, the Gar’in established a settlement on the land of Hubela, to the west of Kfar Etzion, and decided to name the new kibbutz \\"Masu’ot Yitzhak,\\" after the Chief Rabbi of Israel, Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevy Herzog, then still living.  Commander of Masu’ot Yitzhak  Moshe Jakobovits continued to serve as a Noter at Masu’ot Yitzhak as well. He was sent to a Notrim course at the central school for Notrim at a youth village next to Afula, and, upon his return from the course, he was appointed commander of the Notrim station at Masu’ot Yitzhak. In parallel, he continued his activity with the Haganah, as was customary in that periodReport of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry (1946). In this context he participated in the squad leader training course of the Haganah, Jerusalem District, conducted at Gush Etzion (the \\"Etzion Bloc\\") in the summer of 1946. That same year, he was called upon to serve as regional director of Masu’ot Yitzhak – this, too, in the context of the Haganah. A dispute erupted between the people of the young kibbutz and the Arabs of the area over a portion of the lands of the settlement, especially concerning a plot that was called the \\"600 dunam\\". In the summer of 1947, the Arabs attacked a group of kibbutz members engaged in agricultural work in the disputed area, and a squad of Notrim was summoned from Masu’ot Yitzhak under the command of Moshe Jakobovits. On the heels of a riot that erupted, the British police were summoned and separated the belligerents. An investigation was launched against Moshe Jakobovits for use of arms, and he was suspended from his post as commander of the Notrim station until the investigation was completed. During the period of his suspension (summer to fall, 1947), the Haganah Jerusalem Zone Command sent him to a course for platoon commanders, at that time, effectively an officers’ training course.  Platoon Commander Course  The platoon commander course in which Jakobovits participated (Course 19)The graduates of the \\"Hagana\\" platoon commanders training course. Letter \\"J\\" was the last such course directed by the Haganah. The course, under the command of Mundak Pasternak (Moshe Bar- Tiqvah)Officers Training courses instructors: senior instructors, was initially conducted at the kibbutzim Sarid and Ginegar in the Jezreel Valley, with the participants under the cover of naturalists. The platoon of Moshe Jakobovits – Platoon 1, under the command of Danny Mass – trained unarmed at Kibbutz Sarid, while Platoon 2, under Natanel Hitron, and Platoon 3 under Uzi Narkis, trained at Kibbutz Ginegar and included training with a medium machine gun in a hidden cave. A British patrol detected the site of machine gun training and it was consequently decide to move the entire course to Juara. At the end of the course, in November 1947, Moshe Jakobovits stood for oral examination by Haim Laskov and Yigael Yadin, and participated in the graduation review in the presence of Haganah Commander-in-chief Yaakov Dori. Beside Moshe Jakobovits, other graduates of Platoon Commander Course 19 included personalities who held key positions in the War of Independence, and thereafter, as major generals and brigadier generals. Among them were Yekutiel Adam, Avraham Adan (\\"Bren\\"), Uri ben Ari, Mordechai ben Porat, Rehavam Ze'evi (\\"Gandhi\\"), Avraham Tamir (Avrasha), Israel Tal (Talik), Yaakov Salman, Elad Peled, Moshe Rusnak, Nachum Shoshani, Aharon (Jimmy) Shemi, and many others.  During the Course of the Battles   Command of Masu’ot Yitzhak  After completion of the course, Jakobovits returned to Masu’ot Yitzhak. A few days thereafter, on 29 November 1947, the United Nations decided upon the partition of Palestine. The Etzion Bloc was included in the intended Arab state. The day after the partition declaration (the onset of the War of Independence), Jakobovits was summoned to the headquarters of the Jerusalem Sector of the Haganah for assignment of a command role. Among the various roles he was offered, Jakobovits elected to return to his role as regional commander in Masu’ot Yitzhak. During the first weeks, he was responsible for securing convoys from Jerusalem to the Etzion Bloc. On the night of 15–16 January 1948, Jakobovits stood at the head of his men, at the western emplacements of Masu’ot Yitzhak, awaiting the arrival of the Mountain Brigade (the Brigade of the Lamed-Heh = Convoy of 35) that had been dispatched to reinforce and resupply Gush Etzion. With dawn, Jakobovits discerned heavy traffic of military vehicles and ambulances in the region of the village of Jeva. Only later would the connection with the bitter fate of the Brigade of the Lamed-Heh become clear.  Commander of the Western Sector  On 21 March 1948, Moshe (Mosh) Zilberschmidt assumed command of Gush Etzion. In early May, he redesigned the defenses of the four settlements of the Bloc, and divided the Bloc into three defensive sectors. Moshe Jakobovits was name commander of the western sector, in addition to his position as regional commander of Masu’ot Yitzhak. Under his command was a company composed of defenders of Masu’ot Yitzhak and Revadim, responsible for the defense of the two settlements and the adjacent command posts: \\"the Fifth Point,\\" \\"Giv’at Olga,\\" \\"the 600 Dunam,\\" and \\"Giv’at Hasla’im\\" [\\"Boulder Hill\\"] that connected Masu’ot Yitzhak to Kfar Etzion. In the Arab attack on Gush Etzion on 4 May 1948, Jakobovits sent forces of the brigade under his command to capture the first three command posts.  Rescue of the Hospital and Its People  On the 12 May 1948, a massive Arab attack began on the redoubts of Gush Etzion^ Mark Daryl Erickson, Joseph E. Goldberg, Stephen H. Gotowicki, Bernard Reich, Sanford R. Silverburg (1996). An Historical Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, p. 149. Greenwood; . To maintain constant communication between Masu’ot Yitzhak and Kfar Etzion – even in the face of Arab penetration of the first line of defense – Moshe Jakobovits sent a squad from Masu’ot Yitzhak to capture Giv’at Hasla’im. This force managed to deflect charges of the Arab Legion and thus prevent an attack on Kfar Etzion from this direction. Under the cover of darkness, Jakobovits managed to reach Kfar Etzion to coordinate with Ya’akov Altman (named commander of the Bloc after Mosh fell at the Battle of the Russian Monastery)Kfar Etzion massacre and to convince him to move the hospital, and all of its medical personnel and injured to Masu’ot Yitzhak. Evauation of the hospital was conducted during the course of the night by the men of Masu’ot Yitzhak who carried the injured on their backs and secured the path via Giv’at Sela’im. The hospital was lodged in natural caves in Masu’ot Yitzhak that had been cleaned and prepared in advance for possible shelter. Thus, Jakobovits saved the lives of about sixty injured and medical staff, among them Weisenberg, director of the hospital, and the chief medic, Rivka Nedivi (Prague, born 1926) who volunteered to remain in Gush Etzion and treat the injured while her infant was evacuated to Jerusalem, along with the other mothers and children.  The \\"Queen\\" Has Fallen  POW group in Jordan, 1949. Moshe Jakobovits is second row, middle. The next morning, several armored vehicles of the Legion succeeded in penetrating into Kfar Etzion, and its defenders decided to surrender. After the surrender, a massacre was perpetrated on the men of Kfar Etzion, among them Ya׳akov Altman. Nachum ben- Sira, member of Masu’ot Yitzhak, succeeded in escaping the massacre and reached the kibbutz. Moshe Jakobovitz assumed command of the Bloc, the forces under his command were arrayed for the defence of Masu’ot Yitzhak, Revadim and Ein Tzurim. Later in the day, he telegraphed Haganah HQ in Jerusalem, by means of a heliograph: \\"Queen has fallen, we are left without ammunition and will not be able to hold. Requesting assistance.\\" (‘Queen’ was the code name for Kfar Etzion.)  As POW in Jordan  It was concluded that the Etzion Bloc would surrender and that its fighters would be taken prisoner. Due to the concern that Arab villagers would breach the kibbutzim and slaughter their inhabitants, Moshe Jakobovits decided that surrender would be orderly and would be coordinated with officers of the Legion, thus ensuring the safety of the surviving residents. On the afternoon of Friday, 14 May 1948 – at the time Ben Gurion declared the establishment of the State of Israel in Tel Aviv – two Legion officers arrived at Masu’ot Yitzhak and began coordination with Moshe Jakobovits, with the assistance of the medic Uriel Ofek, who knew Arabic. They promised to preserve the safety of the people of the settlements, and, in accordance with their promise, soldiers of the Legion took up positions around the settlement and drove away Arab villagers with gunfire. The Legion officers also acceded to Jakobovits's request and allowed him to remove a Torah scroll and Holy Books, previously hidden in the ground, and to remove them along with the population of Masu’ot Yitzhak. After about two weeks’ confinement at the Hebron police station, the prisoners of war were transferred to a prison camp at Umm el-Jammal. The prisoners were released in stages, in several groups, ending in March 1949, and were transferred to Israel via the Mandelbaum Gate.Prisoners-of-War and Captive Soldiers Exchanges Moshe Jakobovits was the last to leave the POW camp.Prisoners of war from Jordan returning to Israel, 1949  At the Treasury (Israel Tax Authority – Customs)  About two months after his release from custody, he was married and the couple moved to Haifa. There, Jakobovits began to work at Customs. In 1977, he was appointed Chief Customs Officer (גובה המכס) for the Haifa and Northern District. At the time of the First Lebanon War, he served as responsible for the negotiating the transport of goods from Lebanon. To that end, he met in Haifa with his Lebanese counterpart from Beirut. In the summer of 1987, Moshe Jakobovits was sent to Milan, Italy, where he served as Consul for Economy and Trade (Customs) in Europe until his return to Israel in the summer of 1990. Moshe Jakobovits was survived by a son and daughter, five grandchildren and four great grandchildren.

(September 12, 1896 October 4, 1987) was a civil rights activist and the fifth president of Manhattanville College. She was best known for her efforts to reform the American educational system in order to provide equity for women and African Americans, as well as facilitating the transfer of the Manhattanville College campus from New York City to Purchase, New York. She later was president of Universidad del Sagrado Corazón.  Early life  O’Byrne was born on September 12, 1896 to Marie A. O’Byrne (née McDonough) and Michael Alphonsus O’Byrne. She grew up in Savannah, Georgia, and had four siblings, all of whom died young. The values of religion and civic engagement were instilled in her from a young age, as her father, a prominent Savannah lawyer, was a member of such organizations as the American Irish Historical Society and the Knights of Columbus, as well as vice president of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, and president of the Female Orphans Benevolent Society. The family attended services at Cathedral parish, and carried those religious beliefs into their home. Her mother was also very religious, and donated money to the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist restoration effort. Her mother died in 1903, and her father eventually remarried to Sara Lorene Wren, who happened to be a Manhattanville alumna from the class of 1900.  Education and early career  O’Byrne was first educated at the Pape School in Savannah, Georgia, and then furthered her studies at Manhattanville College. She won the ”Prize of Excellence” award at her graduation in 1915. The following year, she became a member of the Society of the Sacred Heart, and after doing her noviceship at Kenwood Convent, she took her vows on December 8, 1918. She then went on to get her Master’s degree from Fordham University. She got her first job out of college as the Directress of Studies at Convent of the Sacred Heart, Overbrook, which is now known as Sacred Heart Academy Bryn Mawr, from 1924 to 1928. She was relocated to a Washington, D.C. area school within the Sacred Heart network for the 1928-1929 school year. She then got another Bachelor’s degree from Oxford in 1933, and was subsequently employed at Manhattanville College as a history professor for the 1933-1934 school year. She was given the post of Dean of Students the following school year, and remained as such until 1945. She got her second Master’s degree from Oxford in 1936.  Academia  O’Byrne was Manhattanville College’s president from 1945 to 1966, appointed as such after the unexpected death of her predecessor, Mother Grace Damman. O'Byrne was beloved by the students, and on a first-name basis with almost all of them. During her tenure as president, she tripled the worth of the school to $19.1 million, and increased alumni contributions from $65,000 in 1945 to $169,050 in 1965. Additionally, she doubled the amount of faculty and increased the school’s enrollment from 399 students in her first year to 935 in her final. She is most remembered for transferring the school to a new location. City College was struggling to keep up with a boom of new students in the wake of World War II, and requested permission to take over Manhattanville’s campus on September 15, 1949. Manhattanville got a new piece of land, the estate of Whitelaw Reid, a diplomat, that was located in Purchase, New York. They planned and constructed the new campus in one and a half years. The old Manhattanville campus was officially absorbed by City College on October 27, 1951 by the City of New York’s right of eminent domain. $8,808620 was awarded to Manhattanville for their campus and buildings. Under O'Byrne's leadership, the 1960s brought with it a more political student body. Students became involved in racial equality, poverty, apartheid, and substance abuse through protests and lawmaking. On August 28, 1963, she led two professors and six students from Manhattanville College to Washington D.C. in order to participate in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. In 1962, the school finished the building that was dedicated as the O’Byrne Chapel, which was named after her. When she was questioned about the abstract nature of the chapel’s stained glass windows, she retorted, “We are living in a contemporary world–not in the 13th century.” From 1967 to 1970, O'Byrne served as president of Universidad del Sagrado Corazón.  Advocacy work  O’Byrne strove to create equality in education, the workplace, and the world as a whole. She created and was a part of many organizations, like the Department of Education and New York state committees, the American Association of University Women, the College Entrance Examination Board, and White House Conference on Civil Rights, working in close proximity to political leaders like Robert F. Kennedy and Nelson Rockefeller. She made great strides for equality on a plethora of boards and committees, however, she was most proud of her efforts to aid the African American community. In 1953, she started tried to convince the Association of American Colleges to make scholarships and fellowships open to black students. She was also a director of Catholic Scholarships for Negroes Inc., a member of the United Negro College Fund, on the advisory committee of the John La Farge Institute, and advised the National Scholarship Service and Fund for Negro Students. In 1963 she worked on an interracial justice campaign with Roy Wilkins, Executive Secretary of the NAACP. She received many honorary degrees and awards for her efforts towards gender, racial, and educational equity. She was given honorary degrees from NYU, Fordham University, University of Notre Dame , Georgetown University, and Boston College. She was also awarded the Award of Palmes Academiques from France’s government as a form of recognition for how she had contributed to education in 1966. Eleanor O'Byrne's gravesite at Kenwood Convent.  Retirement  When O'Byrne announced her retirement for July of 1966, it was to the shock of many people in the community. Although she was in good health and not ill of mind or body, she was ready to move on. In light of this decision, she was honored in the Congressional Record by Ogden R. Reid of New York as “One of the ablest, most creative and thoughtful leaders of higher education in America.” Although she was no longer Manhattanville’s president, she did not cease her advocacy work, nor did she lose her sense of humor. She said herself that “I won’t be knitting by the fireplace” in her retirement. She continued to serve on New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller’s Commission on the Education and Employment of Women from 1963 to 1970, after which she began a more isolated retirement at Kenwood Convent, during which she worked on a classified educational project. She died there of an illness on October 4, 1987 at the age of 91.

Kimball and built in 1905, with an addition of 1907, and Kimball's United States Realty Building of 1907, located respectively at 111 and 115 Broadway in Manhattan's Financial District, are among the first Gothic-inspired skyscrapers in New York, and both are New York City designated landmarks. The Trinity Building, adjacent to the churchyard of Richard Upjohn's neo-Gothic Trinity Church, replaced an 1853 Upjohn structure of the same name. Earlier, the Van Cortlandt sugar house stood on the west end of the plot – a notorious British prison where American soldiers were held during the Revolutionary War. Trinity Building of 1853 The Trinity Building of 1853 (long building) and the Boreel Building (to its right) in 1902. The buildings to their right have been replaced by Zucotti Park. The Van Cortlandt sugar house, on the southeast corner of Thames Street and Trinity Place, adjoining Trinity Churchyard, was demolished in 1852. The sugar house occupied the western end of a narrow strip of land bordering the churchyard, measuring 40 feet on Broadway, 46 feet on Trinity Place, 259 feet along the graveyard, and 263 feet on Thames Street. Also demolished that year was the New England Hotel at 111 Broadway, at the eastern end of the strip. It was a frame structure, said to be favored by the clerks and traveling salesmen in the dry goods trade, which centered in that neighborhood at the time. A dry goods merchant, H.B. Claflin, together with associates, replaced the sugar house and hotel with a new building, huge for its time, occupying the entire strip: five neo-Romanesque stories of yellowish brick with terracotta trim, except the basement, which was cut brownstone. The basement was below Broadway but above Trinity Place, owing to the land slope, and was completely given over to the dry goods store of Claflin, Mellin & Company. Its entrance was near Trinity Place in Thames Street, but the other floors were entered from Broadway. \\"Besides the stairwell there [was] an ample well-hole from top to bottom, which answer[ed] both for the purpose of ventilation and of light.\\" Although the new building had no tie with the church, they called it Trinity Building. By the end of May, 1853, nearly all the space was let, despite high rentals. The top floor was occupied by Toppan, Carpenter, Casilear & Company, the engravers, as a workshop. Tappan & Company, a mercantile agency, had a single-room office that took up half the second floor. The rest of the building was divided into small offices. The store moved away in 1861. Richard Upjohn moved his office into the building and in 1857 was one of the founders of the American Institute of Architects, which was established there. From 1892 the New York Real Estate Salesrooms had quarters in the basement of the Trinity Building. In its room all the court and the majority of other auction sales in that time were held. The real estate business of Peter F. Meyer & Co. – Richard Croker and Peter F. Meyer – had offices in the building almost continuously for 43 years. Many prominent lawyers had offices there, too. When the building was finally emptied on April 30, 1903, a list of individuals and firms was published with their new addresses; it comprised more than 130 names, mostly lawyers and real estate businesses. United States Realty and Construction Company In 1901 Harry S. Black, who had just taken over the George A. Fuller Company from his late father-in-law, established the United States Realty and Construction Company, a powerhouse development organization with some of the biggest names in New York real estate, including Robert Dowling, Henry Morgenthau, Cornelius Vanderbilt and Charles F. Hoffman. It then acquired a large percentage of the George A. Fuller Company (general contractor for these commissions), and the well-established New York Realty Corporation, among other holdings. The corporation was formed to combine three functions: to purchase real estate for investment and sale, to erect buildings through the George A. Fuller Company, and to raise capital to do both. For its first large project, it bought the old Trinity Building. The Trinity and U.S. Realty Buildings were originally conceived as freestanding office buildings to be erected simultaneously. But acquisition delays held that project up, and U. S. Realty went ahead with a 21-story building on the site of the Trinity Building itself, 40 feet wide and 290 feet high. The north wall of the Trinity Building was left in utilitarian brick, so the building could be expanded They were actually built two years apart and not as identical structures. To attain maximum exposure to light for both skyscrapers with a minimum of interior offices, it was planned that the buildings would be erected on equal, full- block sites. To secure equal sites, however, municipal consent was needed to move the existing Thames Street approximately twenty-eight feet to the north, and to permanently close the south half of two-block-long Temple Street, which originally ran between Thames and Liberty Streets, bisecting the site of the U.S. Realty Building. The city granted these changes, with the condition that Thames Street be widened from twenty-five to thirty feet. Design The commission for the design of both was given to Francis H. Kimball, a devoted and prolific Gothic Revivalist who was an early advocate of Neo-Gothic style for office buildings. These are among the first Gothic-inspired skyscrapers in New York. Here the style establishes a sympathetic relationship between the skyscraper and its early Gothic Revival neighbor, Trinity Church and Churchyard. Both buildings are long, narrow 20-story slabs with no setbacks. Their footprints are slightly irregular and not identical. Trinity's dimensions are roughly 69 feet on Broadway, 74 feet on Trinity Place, 260 feet along the churchyard, and 264 feet along Thames Street. U.S. Realty's dimensions are 61 feet on Broadway, 270 feet on Thames Street, and 275 feet on Cedar Street. The basements are below Broadway but above Trinity Place as the site slopes downward 11 feet. U.S. Realty's basement extends under the Broadway sidewalk to the curb line. There is also a stairway outside the building line to a basement retail space. The basements and first floors are given mostly to retail. The southern elevation is on grade with the elevated churchyard. Both buildings have a direct connection to the Wall Street station of the New York City Subway's IRT Lexington Avenue Line. A subway entrance from the street is built into Trinity's Broadway facade. The basements are clad in granite, and above them the curtain wall is Indiana limestone richly ornamented with a wide variety of gargoyles. The facades have a tripartite form: four-story base, 13-story shaft, and four-story capital. The Broadway elevations of the 1905 building and U.S. Realty are each symmetrical and identical in design except the former is narrower. With the addition of the 1907 extension, the Trinity facade became asymmetrical. In 1912, a copper-clad addition was erected on a portion of the roof of the U.S. Realty Building as a second story for the new Lawyers Club. The same year, a footbridge was added over Thames Street connecting the roofs. Designed by Kimball, the bridge has steel framing and ornamental wrought iron panels with a quatrefoil pattern. Construction Kimball had developed a technique in the 1891–92 iron-and- steel-framed Fifth Avenue Theatre for constructing foundations with concrete cylinders sunk by mechanical means, that was a precursor of the later pneumatic caisson system of skyscraper foundation construction. The seminal 1893–94 17-story Manhattan Life Insurance Building, by Kimball and his partner at the time, George Kramer Thompson, is credited with being the first skyscraper with a full iron and steel frame, set on pneumatic concrete caissons (although the front masonry wall was load-bearing). The foundations of the 1905 Trinity Building, installed in early 1904, consist of 50 caissons, 32 of wood and 18 of steel. These caissons were sunk through quicksand to bedrock, an average depth of 80 feet below the curb, and may have been the deepest foundations ever put down in New York to that time. The caissons and columns forming the north wall were designed in anticipation of the extension, in order to obviate the construction of a new line of caissons for it. Connections were made with those columns in 1906, and seventeen additional caissons were sunk. The foundations for the U.S. Realty Building consist of 70 pneumatic caissons. Bedrock below U.S. Realty was reached at 75 feet. This foundation and the extension of Trinity were commenced in June 1906 and practically finished in August – 60 days – an unparalleled achievement. On average, 500 men were employed. Erection of steel began on October 26, 1906, and finished on January 28, 1907. Stone-setting began November 23, 1906 and was completed, despite severe weather, April 18. Not only did these two buildings set world records for rapidity of construction, but they were also considered to be the costliest business structures ever, together totaling $15 million, including land. Later history For decades after 1907, of the four large facades only one was visible from a distance of more than 34 feet: the south side of the Trinity Building, lining the open churchyard. The north side of 34-foot-wide Cedar Street was occupied by buildings to the property line (see \\"Moving Thames Street\\" maps). In the early 1970s, however, those buildings were demolished and replaced by Zuccotti Park (then called Liberty Plaza Park), making 115 Broadway as visually prominent as 111. Both buildings were designated as landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on June 7, 1988. The interior lobby spaces were renovated beginning in 1987 by Swanke Hayden Connell Architects. In addition, all the exteriors have been cleaned as well. In 2017 an application was made to the city's Department of Transportation to turn Thames Street into a pedestrian plaza.

Kansas, 589 U.S. ___ (2020), is a case of the United States Supreme Court in which the justices ruled that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution did not require that states adopt the insanity defense in criminal cases that is based on the defendant's ability to recognize right from wrong. It was argued on October 7, 2019 and decided on March 23, 2020..  Background   Insanity defense  The insanity defense is a traditional affirmative defense that dates at least back to English common law. The codification of the M'Naghten rules, which have been referenced in one form or another in US law as well as UK law, indicates that someone may be found not guilty of a crime because of a mental condition which prevents them from either controlling their actions or from knowing whether their actions were right or wrong.  Legislative activity  In 1995, the state of Kansas passed a law (Kan. Stat. Ann. § 22-3220) which revoked the traditional insanity defense. Defendants could no longer argue that, because of their mental illness, they were incapable of deciding right from wrong. Instead, defendants suffering from mental illness were only permitted to argue that their mental illness prevented them from forming the specific intent (or mens rea) needed to commit the crime. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer described the distinction between the two systems in his dissent in Delling v. Idaho, a case covering the same topic that the Supreme Court declined to hear in 2012: > Case One: The defendant, due to insanity, believes that the victim is a > wolf. He shoots and kills the victim. Case Two: The defendant, due to > insanity, believes that a wolf, a supernatural figure, has ordered him to > kill the victim. In Case One, the defendant does not know he has killed a > human being, and his insanity negates a mental element necessary to commit > the crime. In Case Two, the defendant has intentionally killed a victim whom > he knows is a human being; he possesses the necessary mens rea. In both > cases the defendant is unable, due to insanity, to appreciate the true > quality of his act, and therefore unable to perceive that it is wrong. But … > the defendant in Case One could defend the charge by arguing that he lacked > the mens rea, whereas the defendant in Case Two would not be able to raise a > defense based on his mental illness. As of 2020, at least four other states have passed laws which are conceptually similar to Kansas's: Idaho, Alaska, Utah, and Montana  Kahler murder case  In late 2009, James Kahler was arrested and charged with four counts of first-degree murder with the murder of four members of his family: his wife, his mother-in-law, and his two teenage daughters. During his trial, his defense argued that he had mentally 'snapped' following his divorce and job loss. At the time of the murder, they asserted that he suffered from depression and had an obsessive-compulsive, narcissistic, and histrionic personality. The prosecution rebutted the defense's psychiatric testimony with an expert psychiatrist of its own. The prosecution's psychiatrist conceded that Kahler indeed suffered from clinical depression but argued that he was still capable of planning the murders. Despite this testimony, he was found guilty of each murder and sentenced to death at the end of August 2011. An Osage County judge issued a death warrant for Kahler on October 11, 2011.  In lower courts  Under state law, capital murder cases can be appealed directly to the state supreme court. Accordingly, Kahler appealed his case to the Kansas Supreme Court, raising ten issues related to the conduct of the trial and actions taken by the judge and prosecutor. Two of these issues were the constitutionality of KSA 22–3220, the 1995 state law which abolished the traditional insanity plea and allowed defendants only the option of arguing that their mental illness prevented him from forming criminal intent, as well as the constitutionality of executing someone who currently suffers from a severe mental illness In a ruling, the Kansas Supreme Court rejected Kahler's appeals, noting its prior precedent in State v. Bethel (2003): > The same arguments made by Kahler were considered and rejected by this court > in State v. Bethel, 275 Kan. 456, 66 P.3d 840 (2003). The Bethel court > conducted a thorough review of the pertinent decisions of the United States > Supreme Court and other states that had considered the issue. Ultimately, > the Bethel court concluded that \\"K.S.A. 22-3220 does not violate the > defendant's right to due process under the United States or Kansas > Constitutions.\\" 275 Kan. at 473; see State v. Searcy, 118 Idaho 632, 798 > P.2d 914 (1990) (finding mens rea approach of state statute did not violate > due process); State v. Korell, 213 Mont. 316, 690 P.2d 992 (1984) (same); > State v. Herrera, 895 P.2d 359 (Utah 1995) (same). Kahler relies on Finger > v. State, 117 Nev. 548, 569, 27 P.3d 66 (2001), in which the Nevada Supreme > Court held legal insanity is a fundamental principle of the criminal law of > this country. But the Bethel court considered and rejected the reasoning of > the Nevada Supreme Court in Finger, and we adhere to our Bethel decision. The Kansas Supreme Court acknowledged that the judge had made errors in handling the case but did not deem these errors significant enough to warrant a new trial or to vacate Kahler's convictions or sentences. He then appealed his case to United States Supreme Court, which granted a writ of certiorari on March 28, 2019. At issue in the case is whether the lack of an insanity defense violates the due process clause of the 14th Amendment and 8th Amendment.  At the Supreme Court  Sarah Schrup, the head of the Northwestern University School of Law Supreme Court practicum, argued the case before the Court on behalf of Kahler. Toby Crouse, the Kansas Solicitor General, argued the case on behalf of the state of Kansas. Oral arguments were held in October 2019. Kahler v. Kansas was the first case that was heard during the October 2019 term. Kahler's argument is that the M'Naghten rule represents the codification of a legal concept that goes back all the way to Medieval common law and should be considered part of the due process of law. His argument asserts that, for centuries, defendants were held culpable only when they were able to distinguish between right and wrong and that people who were legally insane did not have the capacity to do so. The state's argument emphasized the importance of federalism, allowing states the autonomy to make their own laws within the framework of the state and federal constitutions. The state also noted that the definition of insanity has varied in different ways throughout history and that one version (the M'Naghten rule) should not be viewed as an inherent aspect of due process.  Majority opinion  Justice Elena Kagan wrote the majority opinion which upheld Kansas's state law. In the opinion, Kagan wrote that the Kansas law did not violate Kahler's fundamental right to due process, noting that definitions of legal culpability and mental illness have been traditionally reserved for the states. Kagan noted that, contrary to Kahler's argument before the court, Kansas had not in fact abolished the insanity defense but had instead simply modified it, which the Constitution has generally permitted. The opinion points out that Kahler could have still presented a mental illness defense at trial and could also have presented evidence during his sentencing hearing.  Dissent  Justice Stephen Breyer dissented from the majority opinion, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. Breyer conceded that states do have broad leeway to define state crimes and criminal procedures, including the definitions and standards of the insanity defense. However, he argued that Kansas's law did not simply modify the insanity defense but had removed the core requirement of whether or not the defendant could distinguish from right and wrong. Breyer's dissent was rooted in the centuries of tradition behind the original M'naghten Rule and noted that only a handful of states had modified it in the way that Kansas had.

She returned to the stage again and played among others Ibsen's Nora in Prague in 1888; at the beginning of the twentieth century she appeared in 's comedy Im bunten Rock. Buska's first marriage inspired Theodor Fontane to write his novel Count Petöfy. In the Klassik Stiftung Weimar and art collections a letter from Buska to Julius Rodenberg is kept; in the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek there are several autographs of the actress, especially from the collection of Otto Frankfurter. In the Alfred Reucker-Archive of the Akademie der Künste are also autographs and photos by Buska from the time of Angelo Neumann's death in December 1910.

She was a founding member of the Pediatric Congenital Heart Association and is currently its Director of Programs.  Background  Basken has a son with congenital heart disease and a background in policy and advocacy. Realising there was no national advocacy organisation for families living with congenital heart disease, she founded the Pediatric Congenital Heart Association in 2013 along with her friend David Kasnic. She has a masters of science degree from the University of Wisconsin - Madison.  Advocacy  In an article in U.S. News & World Report, Basken explained that part of the mission of Pediatric Congenital Heart Association is to empower families because \\"Families deserve to be empowered with essential information to support shared decision-making with their providers.\\" The association developed the guided question tool with families to help them navigate the health care system when their child is diagnosed with congenital heart disease. Several children's hospitals in the USA, including Lurie Children's Hospital and Children's Hospital Colorado, now produce information for families that is based on the guided question tool and designed to address the Pediatric Congenital Heart Association's call for transparency. She is also leading Pediatric Congenital Heart Association's efforts to build better web resources for families to interpret published surgery outcomes. Basken was instrumental in advocating for, and helping to pass, the Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act that was passed by US Congress and became US law in 2018. The law authorizes $10 million in research, data collection, and awareness activities, at the Centers for Disease Control over the next five years, more than double previous funding.

He was born into the young family of Montfort-Feldkirch of the Swabian noble family of Montfort.  Life   Family  Rudolf was the son of Rudolf II († 1302), Count of Montfort-Feldkirch, a collateral line of the County palatines of Tübingen. His mother was Agnes von Grüningen, daughter of Count Hartmann II von Grüningen.Cf. WUB VI, Nr. 1833, pp. 228–229, WUB online (German) In 1303, he studied law in Bologna. After the early death of their brother Hugo IV († 1310), Rudolf and his younger brother Ulrich II – himself a cleric († 1350) – became regents for their underage nephews. Rudolf's sister Elisabeth was married to the Steward Eberhard von Waldburg.Cf. WUB VII, Nr. 2520, pp. 381–382, WUB online (German).  Spiritual and Political Works  Rudolf's clerical career was largely similar to his uncle Friedrich von Montfort's († 1290): He became canon in 1283The recorded employment as canon (cf. Degler-Spengler) makes a birth year of 1275 (cf. Feller-Vest) impossible and prompts a date of around 1268. and provost in Chur in 1307. In 1310 he was appointed vicar general and deputy of the bishop of Chur. After the death of Chur's bishop Siegfried von Gelnhausen († 1321), Rudolf was appointed his successor and took office on 19 July 1322. However, Pope John XXII appointed him bishop of Konstanz shortly after, in October of the same year. He retained the position in Chur as administrator until he was replaced by the Konstanz Canon Johann Pfefferhard on 12 July 1325. Between 1330 and 1333 he was also administrator of the Abbey of Saint Gall, where some years prior, Rudolf's uncle Wilhelm von Montfort († 1301) had been presiding as prince-abbot between 1281 and 1301. After the split election of 1318, the Konstanz episcopate had been vacant for four years. As a result, when Rudolf took office, the financial situation of the bishopric was already badly damaged. Rudolf began to focus on the financial betterment of the bishopric and the ecclesiastical life in his diocese. In the struggle for the throne between Louis the Bavarian and the Habsburg Frederick the Fair, Rudolf and his brother Ulrich sided – against tradition of the counts of Montfort – with Habsburg. Regarding the dispute between King Louis and the pope, Rudolf and his cathedral chapter sided with the pope. Rudolf was caught in the crossfire when the imperial city of Konstanz sided with King Louis and the king made peace with the Habsburgs. He eventually yielded to the pressure in 1332 and agreed to receive the jura regalia. In 1333, the pope placed an anathema on him and lifted him from his administrative position in the abbey of Saint Gall. Since he had been excommunicated, after his death, Rudolf was buried in unhallowed ground in Arbon in 1334. Bishop Heinrich III of Brandis had his remains moved to the Konstanz Minster when he started his tenure in 1357.

With a difference of , the Jacob River flows southerly in a forest zone between the Snigole River (West side) and the Comporté River (East side). After several rounds of rapids, waterfalls and falls in the forest area, the Jacob River flows into the Malbaie River in front of downtown Clermont. This small forest valley is mostly accessible in its lower part by the Marais road which goes to the North, and in its upper part by a secondary forest road serving the west bank of the river. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector; recreational tourism activities, second. The surface of this stream is generally frozen from mid-December to late-March. Nevertheless, safe ice traffic is generally from late December to mid-March.  Geography  The Jacob River has its source at Jacob Lake (length: , altitude: ) located in Zec du Lac-au-Sable. This wild lake is located in a small forest valley (in the north-south axis). This lake is enclosed by mountains with a peak of in the east, in the southwest, and another of to the northwest. A stream on the north shore of this lake drains a small valley. Hydro-Québec high-voltage lines (north-south direction) pass on the west side of the lake. From the dam at the outlet of Jacob Lake, the current flows southward along the following segments: * to the south in elevation of crossing several series of rapids and waterfalls, first in the unorganized territory of Mont-Élie then in the territory of the town of La Malbaie, until the first bridge of the Chemin des Marais; * to the south crossing several series of rapids and waterfalls, and entering the territory of Clermont, to the second bridge of the \\"chemin des Marais\\"; * to the south, crossing several series of rapids and waterfalls, to the Lac des Lacs bridge; * to the south passing through agricultural and industrial territory, and passing under the railway bridge, until its confluence with the Malbaie River. For regulatory purposes, a low-capacity dam owned by the Government of Quebec was erected on the Jacob River upstream of the mouth of the Jacob River. The concrete-gravity type structure with a height of and a length of was built in 1938.Commission de toponymie du Quebec - Bank of Place Names - Toponym: Jacob River The confluence of the Jacob River is located opposite a municipal park in downtown Clermont, at downstream of the dam which creates a widening of the Malbaie River and a hundred meters upstream from the railway bridge over the Malbaie River in downtown Clermont.  Toponymy  The term \\"Jacob\\" refers to the memory of a former owner of a lot of land around Lake Jacob. According to the Commission de toponymie du Québec, four mills were built and operated along its route: two saw mills, a flour mill and a wool card mill. The name \\"Jacob River\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Québec.Commission de toponymie du Québec - Bank of Place Names - Toponym: Jacob River See also * Zec du Lac-au-Sable, a controlled harvesting zone * Mount-Élie, unorganized territory * Clermont, a municipality * La Malbaie, a city * Malbaie River, a watercourse * List of rivers of Quebec  Notes and references  Category:Rivers of Capitale- Nationale ","title":"Jacob River (Quebec)"},{"id":"62517968","text":"Michael Tisdall (1730-1788) was Archdeacon of Ross from 1781 to 1788.\\"Fasti Ecclesiae Hibernicae: The succession of the prelates Volume 1\\" Cotton, H. p362 Dublin, Hodges & Smith, 1848–1878 Tisdall was born in Dublin and educated at Trinity College there.\\"Alumni Dublinenses : a register of the students, graduates, professors and provosts of Trinity College in the University of Dublin (1593–1860George Dames Burtchaell/Thomas Ulick Sadleir p814: Dublin, Alex Thom and Co, 1935 He was ordained on 15 November 1753 and began his ecclesiastical career with a curacy at his father's church, St Mary, Shandon.

In October 2016, Finn and his handler confronted a youth who was suspected of being armed; the dog was stabbed and the police officer injured to the hand with a large knife. The dog required emergency surgery, but he returned to duty eleven weeks later. The case received widespread media coverage and initiated a popular campaign to improve legal protection for animals in public service, resulting in a 2019 act of parliament known as \\"Finn's Law\\". The incident On 5 October 2016, Finn's handler, PC Dave Wardell, operating with the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Police Dog Unit, was called to an incident in Stevenage where there was a search for a male suspect, believed to be armed. PC Wardell and Finn located the suspect who ran off. After a shouted warning, PC Wardell released Finn and the dog seized the youth's leg as he was attempting to escape over a fence. Falling on the ground together, the suspect stabbed the dog in the chest with a large knife, before making a second attack in which he slashed the dog's head and PC Wardell's hand. Despite this, Finn retained his grip on the suspect, enabling PC Wardell to disarm the youth. When other officers arrived, Finn was taken to a veterinarian and then on to a specialist where he received emergency surgery in which part of his lung was removed. PC Wardell later received medical treatment for a hand injury. Fortunately for PC Wardell this was a superficial injury with no long lasting effects on his hand. Finn recovered from the attack and returned to duty eleven weeks later, before retiring due to age, shortly before his eighth birthday in March 2017. In May 2017 at Stevenage Youth Court, a 16 year-old boy from Lewisham in south London was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for the attack on PC Wardell, but could only be convicted of criminal damage for stabbing the dog. Although, he was convicted Criminal Damage (over £5000) this actually gave higher sentencing guidelines for the courts when passing sentence to the defendant. In the circumstances a sensible decision made by the investigating officer and CPS. He was later sentenced to eight months' detention in a Young Offender Institution. \\"Finn's Law\\" Finn's case highlighted the limited legal sanctions available against those who injure animals being used by the emergency services. An online petition on the UK Parliament petitions website for a \\"Finn's Law\\" attracted more than 127,000 signatures, resulting in the Sentencing Council recommending that in future, similar events should be treated as an \\"aggravated offence\\" rather than criminal damage. However, Finn For Change Member of Parliament, Sir Oliver Heald, with Dave Wardell and Finn as mascots took the matter further by proposing a private member's bill, the Animal Welfare (Service Animals) Bill, which was debated in the House of Commons on 5 December 2017. The bill, which was introduced to the House of Commons on 13 June 2018, provided: The bill completed all the parliamentary stages and received Royal Assent on 8 April 2019 as the Animal Welfare (Service Animals) Act 2019. and came into force in June 2019. In September 2019, Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, announced that a new Animal Welfare Bill, incorporating \\"Finn's Law\\", would be part of the new programme of legislation to be introduced into the Scottish Parliament. On the 10 February 2020, a motion was put forward through the Northern Ireland Assembly to incorporate \\"Finn's Law\\" to Northern Ireland under its own animal welfare laws. The motion was passed unanimously, and was passed to the Northern Irish Agricultural minister Edwin Poots. Recognition In October 2017, Finn was awarded the International Fund for Animal Welfare \\"Animal of the Year Award\\" in a ceremony at the House of Lords. In May 2018, Finn was awarded the PDSA Gold Medal \\"for life-saving devotion to duty, despite being grievously injured while preventing a violent criminal from evading arrest\\", at the charity's music festival at Cheltenham Racecourse, which was the first time the award had been presented at a public ceremony. In March 2019, Finn was awarded the Kennel Club's \\"Friends for Life\\" prize at the annual Crufts dog show at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. In the spring of 2019, Dave Wardell and Finn participated in the television talent show, Britain's Got Talent, with a mind-reading act which took them to the final and prompted an emotional response from the judges.  Thin Blue Paw Foundation  In May 2020 Finn together with the Wardell family started up the charity the Thin Blue Paw Foundation, an organisation to help support retired police dogs once they have left their role a working police dogs. This is for primarily aimed at the other 35 territorial and specialist constabularies, that don’t have their own retired police dog charities like in Finn's home constabulary of Hertfordshire. In starting up the charity, the charity had a backlash from other retired police dog charities like the Essex Retired Police Dogs Fund which deals with retired dogs from Essex Police accusing the Thin Blue Paw of divesting support from their charity work.

It was operated by the Tavannes–Noirmont Railway (French: Chemin de fer Tavannes–Noirmont, CTN), which was formed in 1913 from the merger of the Tramelan-Tavannes Railway (Chemin de fer de Tramelan–Tavannes, TT) and the Tramelan-Breuleux-Noirmont Railway (Chemin de fer Tramelan–Breuleux–Noirmont, TBN). The line was electrified in 1913 and has belonged to the Chemins de fer du Jura (CJ) since 1944.  Tavannes-Tramelan Railway (TT)  TT freight train hauled by locomotive no. 2 in Tramelan in about 1910. The first railway lines in the Jura were built to connect Switzerland with France. Afterwards efforts were made to connect areas that were not yet developed with Lokalbahnen (\\"local lines\\") to the main lines. The metre-gauge Tavannes-Tramelan railway was opened as a branch line on 16 August 1884. The 9 km-long line connected Tramelan with Tavannes, which lay on the existing standard-gauge Sonceboz- Sombeval–Moutier railway opened on 1874. The railway was, after the Lausanne–Echallens (1873), the Rigi-Scheidegg (1874), the Herisau–Urnäsch (1875) and the Waldenburg (1880) lines, one of the first Swiss narrow gauge railways and served as a model for many similar operations. The railway was initially operated with two class G 2/2 two-axle tender locomotives. A third locomotive was acquired in 1891. A very high level of performance was required for the steam locomotives as the line had gradients of up to 4.0 percent. Shortly before the electrification, the locomotives were equipped with new boilers.  Electrification  Tramelan station after the electrification of the TT and the opening of the TBN. Electrical operations at 1200 volts DC commenced on 15 November 1913. The reason for the electrification was the opening of the meter-gauge, electrically operated Tramelan-Breuleux-Noirmont Railway (TBN). For electric operations, the TT procured two BCe 2/4 railcars (nos. 60–61) and a two-axle locomotive of class Ge 2/2 (no. 4). Both types of vehicles had the same electrical equipment. The three units were identical to the two railcars, 70–71, and the Ge 2/2 locomotive no. 5 of the TBN. While the railcars were procured for passenger trains, the two locomotives hauled freight trains and were used for pretensioning services. The electric supply to the catenary of the two lines was carried out through a substation in Tramelan, which was equipped with backup batteries.  Operating results The TT mainly served passenger traffic. At times it was able to pay a modest dividend. Investment in catenaries and new rolling stock were necessary for the electrification in 1913. The First World War led to additional revenue from both passenger and freight transport. In 1917, the railway had the best operating result in its history. Thereafter, however, sharply rising operating expenses affected the balance sheet.  Tramelan-Breuleux-Noirmont Railway (TBN)  Railcar BCe 2/2 of the TBN on delivery. Advances in electrical engineering enabled the continuation of the narrow gauge line from Tramelan through the heights to Les Breuleux and Le Noirmont to connect to the Saignelégier–La Chaux-de-Fonds railway (Chemin de fer Saignelégier–La Chaux- de-Fonds, SC). The Tramelan-Breuleux-Noirmont Railway was operated at 1200 volts DC from its opening on 16 December 1913. Ge 2/2 of the CTN in Tavannes. Railcar BCe 2/4 no. 70 is visible behind. As already mentioned, the TBN procured two BCe 2/4 railcars (70–71) and Ge 2/2 locomotive (5). The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 led to increased traffic at the TBN and led to financial relief. At the beginning of the 1920s, declining income from passenger transport increasingly led to financial difficulties.  Tavannes–Noirmont Railway (CTN)   Operating community  TT and the TBN, which opened in 1913, formed a joint operating arrangement and operated the line with the electric rolling stock running through from Tavannes to Le Noirmont. The Saignelégier-La Chaux-de-Fonds Railway (SC) continued to use steam locomotives on the line from Le Noirmont to La Chaux-de-Fonds which made through running difficult. Since 1 May 1921, standard gauge freight cars have been loaded on transporter wagons in Tavannes, so that they can be carried on the narrow gauge line to Le Noirmont. On 1 January 1927, the two electrically operated railways TT and TBN, which previously formed a joint venture, joined together to form the Tavannes–Le Noirmont Railway (CTN). But even after the merger, the operating results remained modest and the infrastructure became obsolete. The Tavannes–Noirmont Railway was merged on 1 January 1944 with the SC and two standard gauge railways, the Régional Saignelégier–Glovelier (RSG) and the Régional Porrentruy–Bonfol (RPB) to form the Chemins de fer du Jura (CJ).  Operation by the Chemins de fer du Jura  Railcar CFe 4/4 601, which was built at the beginning of the CJ, in Le Noirmont. GTW ABe 634 and 631 coupled sets in Tramelan. Arosa Railway in Le Noirmont. With the merger of the four railway companies in the then Bernese Jura, the foundation was laid for a comprehensive technical renovation. The CJ has operated its entire metre-gauge network with 1500 volt DC since 4 October 1953. For this purpose, the overhead line voltage was increased from 1200 to 1500 volts DC. The converter plant in Tramelan was replaced by three rectifiers in Orange, Les Reussilles and Le Noirmont. The rolling stock was almost completely replaced by new vehicles. No changes were made to the existing locomotives. A train carrying railway staff crashed into a train carrying train axles at Orange between Tramelan and Tavannes on 27 October 1953. Two railway employees were killed by axles flying off a flatcar hauled by Ge 2/2 5\\\\. The railway staff train had not waited in Orange to allow the trains to cross. The 246 metre- long Tavannes viaduct was opened in 1966 to separate the railway from the road in the village of Tavannes.  Current operations  Passenger services run between Le Noirmont and Tavannes almost continuously every hour. They connect with La Chaux-de-Fonds–Saignelégier–Glovelier services in Le Noirmont. There are connections with the regional trains of the SBB towards Sonceboz-Sombeval and Biel/Bienne in Tavannes. Freight trains run on the line regularly from Monday to Friday. Waste has been carried from Tavannes to the La Chaux-de- Fonds incinerator since 2000. In addition, standard-gauge wagons are carried on transporter wagons, which primarily carry timber logs, fuel oil, gravel and road salt. Scheduled steam trains are operated by La Traction on the Pré- Petitjean–Saignelégier–Le Noirmont–Tavannes route from July to September. A depot in Tramelan, where the workshop for all CJ vehicles is located, is used to maintain rolling stock used in regular traffic. Transports Régionaux Neuchâtelois (TRN) rolling stock is also regularly maintained at the local underfloor lathe. Construction service vehicles are maintained at a single- track carriage shed in Le Noirmont.  Route description GTW ABe 632 set outside Tavanne. The line leaves Tavannes station running parallel to the SBB line to Moutier. After a few metres, it turns left and crosses the Birs on the 246 metre-long Tavannes viaduct. After that, the line runs with a 4.0 percent gradient through meadows and fields. The almost flat route follows the Trame stream from the Orange crossing loop to the halt of Tramelan-Dessous. Trains arrive at Tramelan, home of the CJ's main workshop. After Tramelan station, the line climbs at 5.0 percent on a winding route to the hamlet of Les Reussilles where the Franches-Montagnes plateau starts. Afterwards, the line passes through several meadows and fields to cross the high moor and \\"La grande Tourbière\\" nature reserve. There, the line leave the Bernese Jura and enters the Canton of Jura. After the halt of La Chaux-des-Breuleux, the line reaches Les Breuleux. The line then passes through a tight right-hander and reaches the halt of Les Breuleux-Eglise, the highest point of the line. After passing through beautiful forests and pastures, the line descends on a grade of 4.4 percent to reach Le Noirmont, where the narrow-gauge line from Saignelégier enters the station from the right.

Burden was photographed firing shots with a pistol at a Boeing 747 passenger airplane while it took off from Los Angeles International Airport at about 8am on January 5, 1973. The piece had a single witness, photographer Terry McDonnell, who filmed the act. Burden was interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) several years after 747 after a photograph of the piece was published in a magazine. A calling card was left by the FBI at his studio and a meeting took place at his lawyer's house. Burden's lawyer explained to the person from the FBI of the nature of Burden's work in performance art. Burden said of the act that \\"the plane wasn't in any danger. I went down to the beach and fired a few shots at a plane flying over head. I wasn't trying to shoot the plane down, it was more a gestural thing, trying to get it photographed — to make an image\\". Burden said in a 1980 interview with David Robbins that he told the FBI that the piece was \\"about the goodness of man — the idea that you can't regulate everybody. At the airport everybody’s being searched for guns, and here I am on the beach and it looks like I'm plucking planes out of the sky. You can’t regulate the world\\". The piece is one of a number of photographs of Burden's work that in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Critic Dominic Johnson in his 2018 book Unlimited action: The performance of extremity in the 1970s wrote of the piece that \\"threat of criminal damage, mass death and personal ignominy ground the formal challenge that confirms the action as a performance... Uncertainty, notoriety and doubt form part of a work's existential charm\\". 747 was analysed by Daniel Cottom in his 2002 essay on Burden's art \\"To Love to Hate\\". Cottom identifies the piece as belonging to the Western European artistic tradition of 'misanthropy' feeling that Burden \\"committed an artwork of terrific suggestiveness\\" when he fired the gun at the airplane.

The assailant killed three men and injured eight others. The shooter was killed by Escambia County sheriff deputies after they arrived at the scene. He was identified as Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, an aviation student from Saudi Arabia. The FBI investigated the case as a presumed terrorism incident, while searching for the motive behind the attack. On January 13, 2020, the Department of Justice said they have officially classified the incident as an act of terrorism, motivated by \\"jihadist ideology.\\"[AG: NAS Pensacola shooter was 'a terrorist' \\"The Department of Justice reports...]; report; January 13, 2020; Channel 23(?); retrieved January 13, 2020; quote: \\"...has determined that a December 6 shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola was an act of terror...\\"Jihadist Ideology; January 13, 2020; report; WEAR-TV online; retrieved January 13, 2020 On February 2, 2020, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the shooting. In an audio recording, Emir of the Yemen-based group Qasim al-Raymi said they directed Alshamrani to carry out the attack. On May 18, 2020, the FBI corroborated the claims. Background Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, a second lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force, was participating in a training program sponsored by the Pentagon as part of a security cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia. A Department of Defense official said more than 850 Saudi nationals are in the U.S. participating in the training program, which includes English, basic aviation, and initial pilot training. Saudi Arabia is one of many countries allied to the United States that send members of their military to the naval station for training. At the time of the shooting, the program hosted 5,180 students from 153 countries, including the perpetrator. Shooting Prior to the attack, at 6:39 a.m. a message on Twitter was posted by a user using the handle @M7MD_SHAMRANI, which declared hate for Americans due to its support of Israel. This message has not yet been verified as being posted by the perpetrator. The shooting was first reported at 6:51a.m. when the suspect, armed with a 9mm Glock handgun and several extra magazines, opened fire in one of the classroom buildings. During the incident he moved through two floors of the building, discharging his weapon on both. One of the victims was able to make his way away from the scene to alert the first response team of the location of the shooter amongst other details. The suspect was shot and killed at 7:45a.m. after two deputies from the Escambia County Sheriff's Office and members of the base security force exchanged gunfire with him. The outside of the building was videotaped by another Saudi Arabian student while the shooting was occurring, as two additional Saudi Arabian students watched the shooting from a car. The student who was filming, and the other two students, had attended a dinner party hosted by the perpetrator prior to the attack. Victims The shooter killed three U.S. Navy sailors, and injured eight others who were taken to the hospital, including the two deputies who sustained gunshots to their limbs. Of the deceased, two were declared dead at the navy base and the third, who was able to get to authorities and give them a description of the shooter, died at the hospital. The three victims who died from their injuries were a 19-year-old airman from St. Petersburg, Florida; a 23-year-old ensign and recent graduate of the United States Naval Academy from Coffee, Alabama; and a 21-year-old airman apprentice from Richmond Hill, Georgia. Perpetrator Photo of Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani issued by the FBI The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, 21, a second lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force, and said he was the sole shooter. He was participating in aviation training at the station. His training with the program began in August 2017 and was scheduled to conclude in August 2020, and included initial pilot training, basic aviation, and English-language instruction. SITE Intelligence Group said that someone who may have been Alshamrani posted a justification of the planned attack on Twitter before the shooting. The post referred to U.S. wars in Muslim countries, wrote of his hatred for the American people, criticized the U.S. government's support of Israel, and quoted Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki. Prior to the shooting, Alshamrani had hosted a dinner party at which he and three other Saudi Arabian students had watched videos of other U.S. mass shootings. Aftermath Mural on 17th Avenue bridge painted by a resident of Pensacola Due to the attack, the national anthem was not played on the loudspeakers of the base at 8:00 a.m., as was otherwise customary. The store Wings & Things Monogramming and its parking lot was used as a congregation area for many military members who were not able to enter the locked-down base. A mural was started by a local artist at the local Graffiti Bridge to honor the victims and survivors. Investigation All foreign students on the base have been accounted for and no arrests have been made; students from Saudi Arabia have been ordered by their Saudi Arabian commanding officer to remain on the base. The FBI agent leading the investigation said that all of the Saudi Arabian students are cooperating with the investigation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened an investigation into the perpetrator's social media. Investigators are looking for any signs of radicalization in the perpetrator's upbringing, and whether the attack was an act of terror. Officials reported that the perpetrator had obtained a hunting license which allows for non-immigrants on a non-immigrant visa to purchase a gun. He then legally purchased a weapon from a gun store earlier in the year.A brief by the FBI on the shooting in Pensacola On December 8, the FBI said it was treating the shooting as a presumed terrorist attack. The Navy suspended flight training for all Saudi Arabian military aviation students pending the results of the FBI investigation; they will continue to get classroom instruction. Flight training has been resumed for all other international students. On December 11, a Saudi Arabian government analysis revealed that the shooter appears to have embraced radical ideology as early as 2015. A Twitter account believed to have been used by al-Shamrani, indicates that four religious figures described as radical appear to have shaped his extremist thoughts. The account also expressed support for radical Islam and terrorism, sectarianism, support for the Taliban, and hatred for the West. Another investigation was opened by Defense Secretary Mark Esper into the vetting measures that go into accepting foreign nationals into the United States to train with the military. On January 12, 2020, Attorney General William Barr declared the Pensacola shooting by Saudi Arabian citizen Mohammed Alshamrani, an act of terrorism that was motivated by “jihadist ideology”. On May 18, 2020, Barr announced the FBI had managed to unlock the shooter's iPhone without Apple's help. Responses Domestic Matt Gaetz, the U.S. representative for Florida's 1st congressional district (which includes Pensacola), said, \\"I believe we can safely call this an act of terror, not an act of workplace violence.\\" Florida senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott called for thorough investigations of military training programs for foreign nationals on U.S. soil, and possible flaws in the trainee vetting processes. Governor Ron DeSantis placed a large amount of blame and need for compensation on the Saudi Arabian government, saying, \\"They [Saudi Arabia] are going to owe a debt here given that this is one of their individuals.\\" Saudi Arabia The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed \\"its deep distress\\" after the incident and offered \\"its sincere condolences to the victims' families, and wishes the injured a speedy recovery\\" through a statement. The king of Saudi Arabia, Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, called President Donald Trump who posted about the call on December 6, through Twitter. Trump said the king had expressed his \\"sincere condolences\\" to those involved. Trump further elaborated that the king had said that the Saudi Arabian people were angered by the attack and that the perpetrator \\"in no way shape or form represents the feelings of the Saudi people who love the American people.\\" See also *List of mass shootings in the United States in 2019 *2009 Fort Hood shooting, another terrorist mass shooting at US military base *Washington Navy Yard shooting References External links * Pensacola Victims: Three Hopeful Men at the Dawn of Naval Careers.

During his long career, American film director David Gordon Green has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these productions fell in development hell or were cancelled. 2000s A Confederacy of Dunces In November 2002, it was announced that Green was to helm a film adaptation of John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces for Miramax Films, which bought the film rights to the novel from Paramount Pictures on June that same year. Will Ferrell was to have portrayed Ignatius J. Reilly and Lily Tomlin, Drew Barrymore, Mos Def and Olympia Dukakis were to have co-starred. The script was written by Steven Soderbergh and Scott Kramer. It was reported in 2003 that Barrymore's production company Flower Films was to co-produce the film with Warner Bros.

Then, in 2004, it was announced that Green will write and direct the film for Focus Features, with Lauren Shuler Donner serving as producer. A film was eventually released in 2008 without Green's involvement. Fat Albert Green admitted in a July 11, 2003 interview with MTV News that he wanted to direct a live action film adaptation of Bill Cosby's Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids. Green stated, \\"I’ve had two goals as far as movies are concerned forever that I can remember. One of them was to [make] Dunces, and [then] more than anything in the whole world, I really wanna do Fat Albert. I got really depressed because they were about to go into production on Fat Albert a year ago with Forest Whitaker directing, so I was super pissed.\\" After Whitaker dropped out of Fat Albert, Green campaigned to direct the film. Green was unsuccessful. The film was instead directed by Joel Zwick and released in 2004. The Precious Few It was reported in July 25, 2003 that Green was working on a script of a film titled Precious Few. Green co-wrote the script with Danny McBride.

Career  A Russian, born in of Oryol Governorate, and educated at Moscow, Dolgikh joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1931, and was appointed a lieutenant in the NKVD in Kharkiv Oblast in February 1936. According to the former political prisoner, Anton Antonov-Ovseyenko Dolgikh was promoted to the rank of Captain in November 1941, and appointed deputy head of the NKVD in Khabarovsk Krai. In 1945, he was appointed head of the NKVD in Khabarovsk Krai. He was head of Gulag in 1951-54. In May 1954, he led the commission which opened negotiations with prisoners at the Kengir labour camp, in Kazakhstan, who had revolted and taken control of the camp. Dolgikh conceded to some minor demands, including the transfer of prison guards who were particularly hated, whilst forbidding food or medicines to be shipped to the camp. The rebellion was violently suppressed (unarmed people inculing women were crushed by T-34 tanks caterpillars) in June 1954. In 1955-56, Dolgikh was an inspector at the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs. In 1956, shortly after Nikita Khrushchev had denounced the crimes of the Stalin era, in his Secret speech to the 20th Congress of the CPSU. Dolgikh was found guilty of 'flagrant violations of socialist law', sacked, stripped of his rank, and expelled from the Communist Party. He died in 1961.

It is designed for knowledge graph representation and is a native revision control database. TerminusDB's secondary database models are listed as document store and RDF store on DB-Engines TerminusDB is available under the GPLv3 license. The development team claim that it will be 'open source now and forever'. TerminusDB is implemented in Prolog and Rust and accessible from software written in other languages using the Web Object Query Language through a transactional HTTP endpoint. TerminusDB uses JSON-LD as a lightweight, language-independent data interchange format.  History   DataChemist  TerminusDB, previously known as DataChemist, was founded in Dublin, Ireland. It was launched by Irish Tánaiste Simon Coveney in August 2018. TerminusDB opened a research and development hub in Utrecht, Netherlands in 2019.  ALIGNED Project  Starting in Trinity College Dublin, the development team behind TerminusDB ran the Horizon 2020 project ALIGNED that worked from February 2015 to January 2018. A book entitled Engineering Agile Big-Data Systems was published on completion of the ALIGNED project - it is available as an open-access e-book  Seshat  Seshat is an international scientific research project of the nonprofit Evolution Institute which uses TerminusDB as data infrastructure. Seshat has been working with the development team from the ALIGNED project onward. This work has been reported in several major newspapers. TerminusDB is also the database behind the associated Institute for Economics and Peace and Oxford University historical peace index project. The results of some aspects of this research, focused on the relationship between complex societies and moralizing gods, appeared in Nature, the prestigious scientific journal. Kevin Feeney, one of the founders of TerminusDB, is an author of the paper and sits on the Board of directors of Seshat.  Open source  Version 1.0 was released in October 2019. TerminusDB is released under the GPLv3 licence and the client libraries are released with the Apache 2 licence. TerminusDB 1.1, with the newly integrated terminus-store, was released in January 2020. Version 2.0 of the database was released in June 2020.  Name  TerminusDB is named after the Roman God of Boundaries, Terminus. It is also named after the home planet of the Foundation in the series of science-fiction novel by Issac Asimov. TerminusDB uses a CowDuck logo - the motif finds its origins in the examples used by core engineer Matthijs van Otterdijk when first demonstrating the append only immutable data store  Main features  TerminusDB is a full featured in- memory graph database management system with a rich query language. The design of the underlying data structure, which is implemented in a Rust library, uses a succinct data structures and delta encoding approach drawing inspiration from software source control systems like Git. This allows all of the Git semantics to be used in TerminusDB. The TerminusDB infrastructure is based on the RDF standard. This standard specifies finite labelled directed graphs which are parameteric in some universe of datatypes. The names for nodes and labels are drawn from a set of IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers). TerminusDB uses the XSD datatypes as its universe of concrete values. For schema design, TerminusDB uses the OWL language with two modifications to make it suitable as a schema language; it dispenses with the open world interpretation and insist on the unique name assumption. This provides a rich modelling language which can allows constraints on the allowable shapes in the graph. TerminusDB supports a subset of OWL that provides for the following schematic control features: # Classes and sub-classes for modelling taxonomies and inheritance hierarchies, with special classes for modelling complex relationships and entities # Typed properties for modelling the attributes of things # Datatypes for modelling the different types of data # Scopings for modelling things that change with time, space and confidence # Constraints for applying logic and rules to things TerminusDB has a promise based client for the browser and node.js it is available through the npm registry, or can be directly included in web-sites. It also has a Python client for the TerminusDB RESTful API and the pythonic version of the web object query language, WOQLpy.  Query language  WOQL (web object query language) is a datalog. It allows TerminusDB to treat the database as a document store or a graph interchangeably, and provides query features to make relationship traversals easy. WOQL's primary syntax and interchange format is in JSON-LD. This gives us a relatively straightforward human-readable format which can also be easily stored in TerminusDB itself. = Example = This demonstrates a simple query which allows retrieval of all documents in the database, along with their labels and types. {\\"@context\\" : {\\"@import\\": \\"https://terminusdb/contexts/woql/syntax/context.jsonld\\", \\"@propagate\\": true, \\"db\\" : \\"http://localhost:6363/testDB004/\\"}, \\"from\\" : [ \\"db:main\\", {\\"select\\" : [ \\"v:Object\\", \\"v:Class\\", \\"v:Class_Label\\", \\"v:Label\\", \\"v:Type\\", {\\"and\\" : [{\\"triple\\" : [\\"v:Object\\", \\"rdf:type\\", \\"v:Class\\"] }, {\\"sub\\" : [\\"v:Class\\", \\"dcog:Entity\\"] }, {\\"eq\\" : [\\"v:Type\\", {\\"@value\\" :\\"Entity\\", \\"@type\\" : \\"xsd:string\\"}]}, {\\"quad\\" : [\\"v:Class\\", \\"rdfs:label\\", \\"v:Class_Label\\", \\"db:schema\\"]}, {\\"opt\\" : [{\\"triple\\" : [\\"v:Object\\", \\"rdfs:label\\", \\"v:Label\\"]}]} ]} ]} ]}  See also  * Graph database  References  External links * Category:Graph databases Category:Structured storage Category:Free database management systems Category:Software companies of Ireland Category:Free software programmed in Rust Category:Logic programming Category:2019 software Category:NoSQL Category:Software using the GPL license ","title":"TerminusDB"},{"id":"62518559","text":"The Glory and Misery of Human Life () is a 1988 Finnish drama film directed and written by Matti Kassila starring Lasse Pöysti, Liisamaija Laaksonen and Tuula Nyman.

Course  Jean-Dominique Lebreton obtained a university degree in Mathematics and Physics in 1969, then a Certificate of Master of Mathematics and Fundamental Applications and a Master of Computer Science in 1971. He obtained his Diploma of Advanced Studies in Applied Biology in 1972, his Doctorate of Specialty in Lyon in 1974 and his Doctor of Science in 1981. He was Assistant and then Assistant Professor at the University of Lyon before becoming Director of Research at the CNRS (CEFE) in Montpellier in 1990. Since 2014, he has been Director of Research Emeritus.  Scientific work  Computer scientist and mathematician by training, naturalist by family tradition (younger brother of Philippe Lebreton.), Jean-Dominique Lebreton is a biomathematician, mainly specialized in modelling in ecology and population dynamics. Animal and plant population dynamics result from multiple mechanisms, such as feedback from populations on demographic performance or environmental variability. On an evolutionary scale, the diversification of demographic strategies raises many questions. Only modelling can therefore shed light on population dynamics, both at the ecological and evolutionary level. It is one of the main international actors in the development of population dynamics models. First, it contributed to the launch of matrix models of population dynamics, producing formal sensitivity results and original stochastic generalizations,LEBRETON, J.-D., « Demographic models for subdivided populations: the renewal equation approach. », Theoretical Population Biology, 1996. 49, pp. 291–313 and applying these models to various vertebrates. He then demonstrated the key role of generation time in the diversity of demographic strategies and in the sensitivity of populations to demographic impacts. Jean-Dominique Lebreton was then one of the driving forces behind the renewal of demographic capture-recapture methods. First, it was necessary to shift their focus from a focus on numbers to estimating individual flows and then to introduce ideas from generalized linear models, thus making it possible to analyze probabilities of survival according to age, gender or environment.LEBRETON, J.-D., « Modeling survival and testing biological hypotheses using marked animals: a unified approach with case studies », Ecological Monographs, 1992, 62, pp. 67–118 His work, by bridging the gap between capture-recapture models and analysis of variance, has contributed to a real revolution, with a wide range of applications in evolutionary ecology and conservation biology. In recent years, he has been involved in the development of various types of models in which individuals move between several states, for example, to study dispersion and reproductive achievement.LEBRETON, J.-D., « Modeling individual animal histories with multistate capture-recapture models », Advances in Ecological Research, 2009, 41, pp. 87–173 At the same time, he developed a long-term program on the Forézian population of Black-legged Kittiwake Chroicocephalus ridibundus, which highlighted the importance of dispersal behaviour in colonial birds in the face of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the environments. He has also relaunched theoretical and practical studies in the context of the biology of exploited populations.LEBRETON, J.-D., « Dynamical and Statistical models for exploited populations. Australian and New-Zealand », Journal of Statistics, 2005, 47, pp. 49–63 The integration of the dynamic and statistical models he developed, both by himself and in the team he created in Montpellier, has enabled him to shed light on the conservation and management of the populations subject to sampling: * Hunting, especially ducks and geese; * Involuntary removals, such as incidental catches of Albatrosses by longline fishing lines; * Levies to limit numbers, with the elaboration for the Ministry of the Environment of a management plan for large cormorants wintering in France. Both personally and through the team he created, but also through the development of close collaborations with the French vertebrate population biology teams (LBBE Lyon, Paris VI, MNHN, Chizé, Strasbourg, Tour du Valat), he and various colleagues have contributed to the creation of a \\"French school\\" for the dynamics and biology of vertebrate populations with high international visibility. The development and distribution of flexible and user-friendly software (Biomeco; U-CARE; SURGE, M-SURGE, E-SURGE) to support his team's research production have greatly contributed to this visibility.CHOQUET, R., « U-CARE: Utilities for performing goodness of fit tests and manipulating CApture-REcapture data. », Ecography, 2009, 32, pp. 1071–1074 As in his research administration activities, he was able to focus on \\"social utility\\" and collective construction in his international research and collaborations – there was a full choice in his generation. He has established long-term collaborations with colleagues such as J.D. Nichols and H. Caswell in the United States, B.J.T. Morgan in Great Britain, G. Gauthier in Canada. The population dynamics workshops he has launched for more than 20 years, after similar workshops in statistical ecology, have brought together hundreds of colleagues, many of whom have remained in contact for data processing, visits to CEFE, or long-term collaborations. These workshops have been organized on several occasions in foreign countries (Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Spain, Morocco, United States...). He recently organized a workshop on \\"Matrix models for population management and conservation\\", from March 5 to 10, 2017 at the University of Florida (Gainesville). He is regularly invited to international conferences in his field. Since 2009 he has been a Member of the Academia Europaea.

Early life Remick was born on East Boston, Massachusetts on October 14, 1866. He was a son of Joseph Remick and Mary Ann Pickering (née Hammond) Remick. Among his siblings was Joseph Remick of Pillsbury, Remick & Co. of Boston and Frank W. Remick, a member of Kidder, Peabody & Co. who served as president of the Boston Stock Exchange while William was president of the New York Stock Exchange. His maternal grandparents were Mary (née Kennard) Hammond and Captain William Hammond, who resided at Bolt Hill and was representative to the legislature, county commissioner and register of probate. After attending public schools in East Boston, he began working in the woolen business before going into banking. Career In 1893, he became associated with R.L. Day & Co. in Boston. Two years later, he opened their New York office before becoming a partner in 1903. In 1913, he established his own investment banking firm, Remick, Hodges & Co. located at 14 Wall Street. In 1917, he was made chairman of the second Liberty Loan drive Committee of stock exchange houses and continued as chairman during succeeding loan drives. In 1907, he purchased his seat on the New York Stock Exchange and in 1909, he was chosen to serve on the Exchange's Board of Governors, a position he retained until his death in 1922. While on the Board, he served on various committees, including the Committees on Laws, Finance, Stock Lists, Ways and Means, and as Chairman of the Committees on Insolvencies and on Admissions. From May 1919 to May 1921, he served as president of the New York Stock Exchange. The period of Remick's presidency of the Exchange was \\"exceptionally trying due to the banking situation in the Fall of 1919 and the strain on the credit structure of the country.\\" In April 1921, Remick stated to a group of visitors to the Exchange that \\"the gradual development of the country through the railroads and industrial enterprises was made possible by the liquid wealth of the Eastern section of the country.\\" He added that \\"your Governing Committee is doing the utmost to safeguard the public in every way possible and that the code of ethics and the sense of fair dealing of the members of the Exchange is as high --yes, higher--than is found in any business of the country.\\" He was succeeded by his vice-president, Seymour L. Cromwell. A Republican, Remick also served as a director of the Stock Clearing House Corporation, the Submarine Boat Corporation, the Electric Boat Company, the New York Railways Company, and a trustee of the Dry Dock Savings Institution. At the time of his death, he senior member of his investment bank, Remick, Hodges & Co. Personal life On October 7, 1903, Remick was married to Elizabeth Wilson Moore of Wilmington, Delaware at \\"The Folly\\" at Fort Washington. Elizabeth, the daughter of John and Mary (née Wilson) Moore, was a niece of Mrs. J. Hood Wright, studied at Michigan State University from 1891 to 1893. Together, they lived at 907 Fifth Avenue, located at Fifth Avenue and 72nd Street, which was built in 1916 and was the first apartment building to replace a private mansion on Fifth Avenue above 59th Street. William and Elizabeth were the parents of two daughters: * Mary Moore Remick (born June 11, 1905) * Elizabeth Hammond Remick (born February 6, 1909), who predeceased William. He was a member of the Union League Club, the Metropolitan Club, the Piping Rock Club and the New York Yacht Club. His wife was a life member of the Sorosis Club, the first professional women's club in the United States. Remick died of heart disease at his residence in New York City, on March 9, 1922.

Background A house in the town of Salem, Polk County (most of Salem is located in Marion County), Oregon was burglarized. A witness to the burglary contacted the local sheriff's office and implicated an 18 year old neighbor, Michael Elstad. Two officers went to Elstad's home with a warrant for his arrest. When the police entered the house and asked Elstad about the burglary he admitted to the burglary. The officers then escorted Elstad to the sheriff's headquarters. About an hour later, the same officers began interrogating Elstad by reading him his Miranda rights for the first time. During this interrogation, the officers obtained a written admission of Elstad's involvement in the burglary. Subsequently, Elstad was convicted of burglary and sentenced to 5 years and $18,000 in restitution..  Case  The issue presented was whether the self- incrimination clause of the 5th amendment requires suppression of a confession made after Miranda warnings and a waiver, because police obtained an earlier admission without Miranda warnings. Justice O'Connor, writing for the majority, held that, while the pre-Miranda statements must be suppressed, the statements made after Miranda do not need to be suppressed as long as the statements were made knowingly and voluntarily. Subsequent Developments In Missouri v. Seibert the police practice was to obtain a confession from suspects, then Mirandize the suspects and obtain a \\"valid\\" confession. Missouri developed this practice as a result of the holding in Oregon v. Elstad. The Supreme Court condemned this practice and suppressed the statements..; Further reading *  References  External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court Category:1985 in United States case law Category:United States Fifth Amendment self-incrimination case law ","title":"Oregon v.

It was initiated and has been run by Martin Lutz. The city awards the Bachpreis der Landeshauptstadt Wiesbaden' to an organist who wins the festival's international competition.  History  In 1975, Martin Lutz, a Wiesbaden church musician and conductor of the Schiersteiner Kantorei, founded the Wiesbadener Bachwochen as a festival with a focus on the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. He also founded a supporting organisation, the Johann- Sebastian-Bach-Gesellschaft. Lutz has described Bach's music as rapturous and moving (\\"mitreißende, bewegende Musik\\") with a transcendental dimension (\\"Dimension, die ins Transzendentale weise\\"), faith turned into music (\\"Musik gewordener Glaube\\"). Concerts have been performed by local groups and international guests. Beginning in 1977, an international competition for organists has been part of the festival, with the winner being awarded the Bachpreis der Landeshauptstadt Wiesbaden. After Lutz retired from his church positions at the end of 2017, he continued to run the festival. St. Bonifatius, 2015 Concerts and other events are held every two years around November. Each festival has a motto, and events include lectures, chamber music, organ concerts and the organ competition, and large choral concerts. The events are held mostly in Wiesbaden churches, such as the Marktkirche, Lutherkirche, St. Bonifatius and Bergkirche. They have been performed by both local groups and international artists. The motto in 2015 was \\"Vom Himmel auf Erden\\" (Of Heaven on Earth), with Fauré's Requiem sung by a festival choir conducted by Andreas Großmann at St. Bonifatius, Dvořák's Requiem at the Marktkirche, and Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius at the Lutherkirche. In 2017, the motto was \\"Werk und Wirkung\\" (Work and influence), presenting among others Bach's Sonatas for violin solo and Cello Suites, his cantata Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140, in the series Bachvespern, Beethoven's Missa solemnis sung by the Bachchor Wiesbaden, and Verdi's Requiem and Bach's complete Christmas Oratorio, both sung by the Schiersteiner Kantorei. The 23rd festival ran from 3 November 2019 to 11 January 2020. With the motto \\"Bach und seine Zeit\\" (Bach and his time), it opened at the Marktkirche on 3 November 2019 with the cantata Tritt auf die Glaubensbahn, BWV 152. As chamber music, Bach's Sonatas for Viola da gamba and the Goldberg Variations were played. Ton Koopman, Tini Mathot and Klaus Mertens appeared with songs and works for keyboard instruments. Schiersteiner Kantorei sang Bach's Mass in B minor, and the choir of the Bergkirche performed Handel's Messiah.

The basal leaves are about one metre (3 ft) long, and are rough at the top, on their edges, on their dorsal veins, and towards their apex on two main veins of their upper face, where they have very fine needle-like teeth. The umbel rays are five to ten in number; the largest are in length. The outer (leaf- like) bracts of the involucre are about long, and are rough and finely needled in the same way as the basal leaves. The spikelets are lanceolate, rather loose, long, showing on all sides of the umbel their sharp apices; they contain sixteen, twenty, and thirty flowers. Each flower has three stamens and a trifid style. The scales are ovoid, truncated at their base, briefly acuminate at the top, membranous, a slightly undulating and torn at the edges. Cyperus dives grows in the wet fields of the Delta: it is grown for cutting, to make mats from the stems split into strips. Cyperus dives and Cyperus alopecuroides L., grow together in Egypt, and serve the same purpose. They also grow in India. Sometimes, in herbaria, I have seen these two plants confounded. Cyperus alopecuroides does not have smooth spikelets; they are not lanceolate, but ovoid; their scales are not very tight, and fold inwards by the edges when drying; the styles are bifid.

Tournament summary The tournament started as the 1996 World Championship, but due to delays in the scheduling of the later rounds, it became the 1997 Championship. It was promoted by Barry Hearn who had been promoting the Women's world championship since 1990. The defending champion was Karen Corr. There were 52 players who entered the tournament. Allison Fisher who had won the title seven times, most recently in 1994, did not enter as she has moved to the United States where she had embarked on a successful pool career. 1984 amateur champion and five-times runner-up Stacey Hillyard had retired from competition and so was another non-participant. The original schedule was for the quarter-finals onwards to be held in India, as they had been in 1994 and 1995, from 16 to 19 September 1996, but eventually the final rounds took place in Llanelli, with the semi-finals and final not happening until well into 1997. This was the last women's world snooker championship to be held before the World Ladies Billiards and Snooker Association amalgamated with the WPBSA later in 1997. Rounds 1 to 4 The tournament started as the 1996 World Championship. The first four rounds took place at Raunds Cue Sports Club, Northamptonshire, to decide the eight players that would go on to contest the quarter-finals onwards, which were expected to be played in Bombay in mid-September 1996. Defending champion Karen Corr won her first match without losing a but won only on the final black in the deciding frame of her match against Lynette Horsburgh. Second seed Kelly Fisher and 1995 runner-up Kim Shaw both won both of their matches 4–0. Mary Talbot, ranked 26th, was a surprising quarter-finalist, beating 7th seed Sarah Smith and 12th ranked player Helen Audus. The highest break in the main qualifying was a 77 by Ann- Marie Farren. A plate competition was held for players who did not qualify to the quarter finals and was won by Horsburgh, who made a break of 100 in the first round of the plate competition. Quarter-finals Following postponements of the final stages and a lack of response from promoter Barry Hearn's partner in India, it was decided to hold the quarter-finals at the Terry Griffiths Matchroom, Llanelli, and they took place in November 1996. Corr whitewashed 1984 professional champion Mandy Fisher 4–0. Banks saw off 1987 champion Farren 4–2, and Lisa Quick beat Shaw 4–1. Fisher's match with Talbot was delayed due to Talbot's illness, with Fisher winning 4–1. Meanwhile, Hearn requested the termination of his contract with the WLBSA to promote the event in future. Semi-finals and Final The semi-finals and final were eventually scheduled to be held in Llanelli in mid-1997, following a continued lack of communication from Hearn's partner in India. Corr made the highest break of the competition, 87, and three other breaks over 30 in overcoming Banks 5–0. Quick won the first frame against Fisher, but no more, losing 1–5. The final between Corr and Fisher was closely contested until 3–3 but then Corr won three frames in a row to take her third world title. The tournament finished some eleven months after the start of the qualifying matches, and was the end of promoter Hearn's relationship with women's snooker that stretched back to 1990. This was the last world championship to be held before the amalgamation of the World Ladies Billiards and Snooker Association with the WPBSA a few months later. The intention was that major finals for women should be played at the same venues as the men's events, for example the women's world championship final being held at the Crucible Theatre during the World Snooker Championship.

On June 20, 1934, the People's Commissariat for Military and Naval Affairs of the Soviet Union was transformed into the All-Union People's Commissariat for Defense of the Soviet Union. On December 30, 1937, the People's Commissariat of the Navy of the Soviet Union was allocated from it. On February 1, 1944, in connection with the adoption of the Law of the Soviet Union on the creation of military formations of the Union republics, the People's Commissariat of Defense of the Soviet Union was transformed from the All–Union People's Commissariat into the Union–Republican. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic has created its own People's Commissariat of Defense. On February 25, 1946, by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union, the People's Commissariat of Defense of the Soviet Union merged with the People's Commissariat of the Navy of the Soviet Union into a single Union–Republican People's Commissariat of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union. Under this name, the central authority was designated in documents for less than a month, since in accordance with the Law of the Soviet Union of March 15, 1946 on the transformation of the Councils of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union and Union Republics into Councils of Ministers, it was renamed the Ministry of Armed Forces of the Soviet Union. On February 25, 1947, in accordance with the aforementioned decisions, amendments were made to the Constitution of the Soviet Union. The printing organ of the People's Commissariat for Military and Naval Affairs in the part of the General Staff was the Military Affairs magazine. The central organ of the People's Commissariat of Defense of the Soviet Union to educate the commanding and rank-and-file staff of the Red Army, to promote combat training tasks and to develop advanced military thought was the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper.

He enrolled in the Royal Military Academy in 1895 and in 1905 became second lieutenant in an artillery regiment.Emile Wanty, \\"Denis (Henri-Jean-Charles-Eugène)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 39 (Brussels, 1976), 258-261. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1906, adjutant to the General Staff in 1907, junior captain in 1912, full captain in May 1914. On 1 August 1914 he was assigned to the staff of the 18th Mixed Brigade. On 22 October 1914 he was removed from active duty after an accident and attached to the Ministry of War in the Belgian government in exile at Le Havre. In May 1915, at his own request, he returned to active duty on the Yser Front. In February 1917 he was appointed commissioner of the military railways, becoming a logistics specialist, and he was promoted to major on 26 September the same year. From 1920 he served on the logistics division of the General Staff. He became a lieutenant colonel in 1922, full colonel in 1927, major general in 1931 and lieutenant general in 1934. Denis was appointed Minister of National Defence in the government that took office under Paul-Emile Janson on 23 November 1937, and retained the position in the administrations headed by Paul-Henri Spaak and Hubert Pierlot in the run-up to the Second World War. He was among the four members of the government who met with King Leopold III at Wijnendale Castle on 25 May 1940 and failed to convince the monarch to follow the government into exile in France. He himself, aged 68, resigned from the Belgian government in exile when it relocated to London in October 1940, opting to remain in retirement in Vichy France. In 1943 he moved to Switzerland. He died in Saint-Gilles (Brussels) on 19 January 1957.

The crime scene was described as \\"very complicated\\" by the FBI special agent in charge. The president of Miami-Dade's police union claimed that at least eleven officers opened fire on the UPS truck in response to the robbers' firing first. Robbery At approximately 4:14 p.m., Lamar Alexander and Ronnie Jerome Hill robbed the jewelry store, Regent Jeweler at Miracle Mile in Coral Gables, Florida. They held the store's cashier at gunpoint and stole diamonds. The two suspects exchanged gunfire with the store owner during the robbery, injuring one jewelry shop worker and hitting nearby Coral Gables City Hall with a stray bullet, causing that building to be placed on lock down. Police were alerted when the store's silent alarm system went off. Ninety seconds later, when officers arrived, the gunmen opened fire on the officers, who then returned fire on the gunmen. The gunmen left in a U-Haul van, which they later ditched in a suburban neighborhood one mile away. The suspects then carjacked a UPS delivery truck at gunpoint and took the driver hostage. The two continued their escape in the UPS truck, heading on Interstate 75 into Broward County. Shootout Several police cars pursued the suspects until the UPS truck became boxed in by slow- moving rush hour traffic in Miramar, about north of the jewelry store. Police then took cover behind the cars of bystanders and opened fire on the suspects. A total of nineteen officers engaged the suspects, including thirteen members of the Miami-Dade Police Department. The other six officers were from the Miramar Police Department and the Pembroke Pines Police Department. The pursuit and shootout were broadcast live on television by news helicopters. Victims Four people were killed in the shootout. The two suspects from the robbery, both aged forty-one, were killed by police. The hijacked UPS driver, aged twenty-seven, and a bystander, aged seventy, in another car, were also killed. A female store employee was shot and wounded in the initial robbery. Response The sister of the deceased UPS driver who was killed, while a hostage during the shootout, used Twitter to express her anger about how the police handled the situation. She was angered that the police responded quickly with gunfire, and did not attempt to negotiate the hostage situation, which she believed caused her brother's death.

The fungus can also be found on the feathers of birds, manure, seeds, and even paper. It is able to thrive in higher temperatures of 35° and 42° C. The fungus is an invasive opportunist to humans that can cause diseases such as onychomycosis (fungus on nails), otolaryngologic (head and neck) or respiratory inflammations (like sinusitis, pneumonia, and empyema), and brain necrosis.  History  It was first formally recorded in 1956 in Ukraine by K. S. Sergeeva.  Morphology  C. perlucidum is pigmented and dark in colour, appearing hairy and wooly, with a growth rate of 4-5 mm/day.  Perithecia (fruiting body)  C. perlucidum's fruiting bodies become fully mature in 13-16 days. The fruiting body's structural width is 90-200 μm, with an ostiolar pore (open pore) width of 30-50 μm.  Setae (bristle / \\"hair\\" structures)  Setae width is 2-3 μm and can have lengths of up to 700 μm. The setae are unbranched and appear to undulate.  Mature ascospores  Fully mature ascospores are 12.5-14 μm x 6-7.5 μm in size. They are smooth, oval-shaped, and brown in colour.  Lipid / fatty acid composition  C. perlucidum is composed of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. {  +C. perlucidum fatty acid content !Fatty acid !Amount (%) - Pentadecylic acid / pentadecanoic acid (15:0, CH3(CH2)13COOH) 0.42 ± 0.33 - Palmitic acid / hexadecanoic acid (16:0, C16H32O2) 18.95 ± 0.92 - Palmitoleic acid (16:1, C16H30O2) trace amounts - Stearic acid / octadecanoic acid (18:0, C18H36O2) 6.76 ± 0.45 - Oleic acid (18:1, CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7COOH) 7.38 ± 5.79 - Linoleic acid (18:2, C18H32O2) 63.48 ± 3.71 }  Pathogenicity  The fungus can cause chronic fungal infections in humans. An infection can spread throughout the body from a single point of infection into various other systems, e.g., the central nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, and immune systems, with especially a low prognosis for cerebral infections.  Mode of transmission and infection  Infections take hold in the brain and progress to spread throughout the body. Pathways of entry into the host's body include via cutaneous lesions, oral intake, or intravenously.  Susceptibility  There have been at least two reported cases of cerebral phaeohyphomycosis in humans with one case resulting in death, reported in 2003. Both cases occurred in immunosuppressed individuals already suffering from complications of other unrelated diseases. Recreational drug users, or patients who have undergone intravenous or transplant procedures at even hospitals are also susceptible to being infected by C. perlucidum.  Treatment and prognosis  Most Chaetomium fungal diseases are without known cure and in one case of death from 1996, antifungal therapy through administering Amphotericin B (AMB) proved ineffective. AMB is a common and leading antibiotic treatment prescribed for fungal infections. In one case, C. perlucidum infection in the brain caused death from hemorrhaging throughout the body (especially in the brain) and complications that arose from acute inflammation. However, the physical removal of a C. perlucidum growth through a lobectomy (surgically removing the fungal growth from an area of affected organ/s) was successful in curing another patient from infection.  Culturing techniques  C. perlucidum ascospores can be cultured and grown in the lab through incubation on potato flake agar at 25° C for 6-10 days. Optimal growth temperature however is at 37° C. Mature perithecia can be obtained if the fungus has access to a sterile plant source.  Occurrence in farming soil  C. perlucidum was found more frequently in tilled than in untilled farmland.

It was part of George H. W. Bush's Space Exploration Initiative. The main purpose of the proposal was to offer a much cheaper alternative to NASA's 90-day study from 1989 by a factor of $30 billion. Although it did not gather much mainstream attention, NASA dedicated much time to assembling a very detailed and thorough proposal. However, the entire Space Exploration Initiative was cancelled soon after the proposal's completion, and NASA had to close the Office of Space Exploration in March of 1993.  Overview  The First Lunar Outpost (FLO) was the most comprehensive moon base study under the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI). It was intended to be the flagship of the program from which other proposals such as ILREC would have to compete against. The FLO concept incorporated many recommendations from the 1991 Stafford Synthesis report, mainly the use of a Nova class super heavy launch vehicle to minimize assembly and operations in LEO and on the surface of the Moon. FLO was a major change from previous SEI proposals as the vehicle was standalone and expendable rather than reusable and being staged off of Space Station Freedom. The design was based on of massive yet simple launchers to carry massive amounts of payloads at once rather than many small and complicated launches. This was to reduce cost and development time. The program would have almost completely consisted of existing technology such as the Saturn and Space Station with only the landing vehicle needing to be developed. leftalt=  Launch vehicle  Based on of the recommendations of the Stafford Synthesis report, FLO would have relied on a massive Saturn-derived launch vehicle known as the Comet. The Comet would have been capable of injecting 254.4 tons into low earth orbit and 97.6 tons on a TLI making it one of the most capable vehicles ever designed. NASA's Marshall Spaceflight Center looked into the Comet rocket or a possible configuration of the then-in-development National Launch System with four F-1A boosters added to the basic 2-stage NLS vehicle. The Saturn V derived design consisted of a standard Saturn V but with a new third stage, stretched first and second stages, and new F-1 side boosters. The engines would be updated to the newer F-1A and J-2S variants. Development costs were expected to be low since most of it would just be resurrecting manufacturing hardware from Apollo. Chemical lunar injection stage A nuclear powered variant of the third stage was also considered. It would use two 222.5 KN-thrust engines and would have reduced the size and weight of the lunar injection stage and significantly reduced the size of the vehicle in general. The baseline study used the chemical engines instead due to the fact that they would cost $2 billion less to develop. The nuclear option would be developed later on to support manned mars missions. Both Boeing's SEI contractor studies and the Stafford Synthesis report recommended that NASA invest in nuclear propulsion technology. NASA's Lewis Research Center established a Nuclear Systems Office to develop and test a fully functional engine by 2005. This along with the military's Timberwind project revived the U'S nuclear propulsion program for the first time since NERVA's cancellation in the 70s.  Lander  The landing vehicle was designed to be as simple and easy to operate as possible. It would weigh 93,526 kg (103 tons) and be powered by four RL-10 engines. When fully deployed its landing legs would stretch to a massive 18.8 meters wide and would stand 14.1 meters tall. Each FLO manned flight would only require one launch and one vehicle. The Comet would send the lander on a trajectory to the lunar surface where it would then use its engines to brake and land. From the surface, the ascent vehicle would carry the crew capsule directly back to Earth. This was similar to the early Apollo direct ascent. The lunar lander during final descent  Descent stage  It weighted 12,992 kg dry and 44,151 kg wet and would be able to carry 5,000 kg of equipment and cargo along with its 18,077 kg earth return stage. The descent stage would be used to break into lunar orbit and later deorbit the vehicle for landing. It would be self guided and not require manned piloting. The earth return stage taking off  Ascent stage  Astronauts would ride in a scaled up Apollo capsule, it would be about 5% bigger. This would allow it to comfortably carry a crew of four on their four day transit to the surface. The vehicle would land automatically because the astronauts had no view of the surface to pilot it. The earth return would use three engines and would utilize hypergolic fuels for safety reasons. Astronauts would have to descend from the crew capsule down a ladder to a platform before going down a stair ladder to the surface.  Unmanned cargo variant  The unmanned cargo lander was just as important as the manned. It would be used to transport massive amounts of material to the lunar surface in order to construct a surface outpost. It would carry the initial habitat module before the first manned mission and would later be used to carry rovers and other habitats to the surface. The unmanned version could deliver a 35,894 kg payload to the lunar surface. This would be helpful when delivering the station derived habitat module. Later missions would bring ISRU equipment to test it on the lunar surface before sending the technology to Mars. Sketch of the surface habitat  Station derived habitat  The habitat module would weigh 35.9 tons and cost $470 million dollars to develop. It was a modified version of the standard Space Station Freedom habitat and laboratory design. It wouldn't need any additional setup after landing and would be able to self deploy it's 20 KW solar array and perform its own system check. It would serve as a life science and soil analysis lab. It could be visited by crews for up to 45 days at intervals of every six months. Later expeditions could expand the base to accommodate more crew and eventually be permanently manned or use the site as a proving ground for deep space technology.  Surface operations  The landing site for FLO was to be Mare Smythii, near the equator on the eastern limb. This initial landing site was used as a design reference to demonstrate what an optimal mission would looks like. The team evaluated other landing sites to see how flexible the design was. They concluded that: \\"except for some specialized sites, such as the lunar poles, the bottoms of craters or other unusual terrain, the mission science payload and the EVA activities would not change much from site to site. The actual landing site would be decided by a scientific committee over the course of many months.\\"An earlier lunar base design from FLO's precursor in the 90-day study One on the surface, the crew would perform nine traverses using a 4 man unpressurized rover. Each traverse would drive out to a maximum range of 25 km and they would visit major geographical features and gathering data about the area. Each traverse was divided into segments suitable for one eight-hour EVA on the rover. Mission planners hoped five or six traverses could be completed each mission. The remaining uncompleted traverses would be left to a future mission. Mission designers decided on four major disciplines that surface teams would focus on during the mission: astronomy, geophysics, life sciences, and space and solar systems physics. The astronauts would also deploy several \\"set and forget\\" standalone science payloads. These payloads were: * Geophysical Monitoring Package * Solar System Physics Experiment Package * Traverse Geophysical Package * Lunar Geologic Tool Set * Lunar Transit Telescope * Small Solar Telescope * Robotic Package for Rover * Life Science Package The heaviest of these payloads would be the In-Situ Resources Utilization (ISRU) Demonstration Package. It consisted of several experiments for the astronauts to demonstrate the use of resources on the Moon such as heating lunar regolith to extract oxygen, which would also be the main objective of the next proposed lunar mission ILREC. The main focus of this was to test the technology which would be vital for manned mars missions. Future EVA suits would match the requirements of the FLO space suitsThe second mission would focus less on exploration and more on setting up additional research equipment as well as tending to the outpost. The main focus of the crew would be drilling on the surface using a 10 meter drill to extract resources and samples. They would also begin deploying a radio telescope array and revisit the optical telescope site and switch detectors as an operational test. The mission would require newer updated EVA suits that were more comfortable, had better mobility, and were easier to manage. The at the time existing Shuttle EVA Suits required much maintenance and astronauts needed to pre-breathe oxygen in order to avoid the bends as a result of nitrogen bubbling in the bloodstream. This pre-breathing technique would be too time consuming and would make things like emergency EVAs impossible.  Early Lunar Access pathfinder program  A precursor program called Early Lunar Access would have run during the early 2000s and used Ariane rockets and Space Shuttles to operate a low cost lunar exploration infrastructure. It would be a joint NASA and ESA mission and serve as a testing ground for FLO. It would use the same crew capsule but a smaller landing vehicle capable of supporting a crew of 2. The Space Shuttle would carry the Lunar Exploration Vehicle while the Ariane 5 (or Titan IV) would carry a wide bodied Centaur G rocket stage. Both payloads would rendezvous and dock in low Earth orbit. The Centaur would fire its engine to accelerate the craft on a trajectory to the lunar surface. To save fuel, the LEV would make a direct landing rather than entering a parking orbit. Once the surface mission is complete, the vehicle would separate two large spherical drop tanks and ascend directly to Earth, once again skipping low lunar orbit. In order to achieve the payload capacity required for this mission, the Ariane 5 would need an additional two SRBs and the Space Shuttle would need the lightweight Al-Li External Tank or Advanced Solid Rocket Motors to carry 25,720kg payloads to a 300km orbit. The new ET was eventually manufactured but the ASRMs were cancelled in 1994. The Centaur G would be modified to last 10 days in orbit rather than a few hours. The crew capsule would be the same upscaled Apollo capsule used on FLO but would only need to support a crew of two which meant it could carry extra supplies and payload. Alternate design for the surface habitat  Cancellation of SEI  On April 1, 1992 Dan Goldin became NASA Administrator, and during his tenure near-term human exploration beyond Earth orbit was abandoned, and the \\"faster, better, cheaper\\" strategy was applied to space science robotic exploration. When the White House National Science and Technology Council released their revision of the National Space Policy in September 1996, it specifically lacked any mention of human space exploration beyond Earth's orbit. The next day, President Clinton stated on a campaigning trip through the Pacific Northwest that a human mission to Mars was too expensive and instead affirmed America's commitment to a series of less expensive probes, thus removing human exploration from the national agenda.

Rabitt has produced and written songs for Andy Grammer, Kiiara, Charlotte Lawrence, VÉRITÉ, Álvaro Soler, Eric Nam, Ingrid Andress, and others.https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rabitt- mn0003812064https://owldb.net/music/lyrics/howm-i-doing-eric-nam/  Early life and education  Wu was born and raised in Hong Kong. He started playing piano at the age of 5 and soon developed a passion for the drums. He then attended Berklee College of Music in 2011 and moved to Los Angeles, California shortly after graduation. It was at Berklee where he would meet the woman who would eventually sign him to her label, Kara DioGuardi, CEO of Arthouse Entertainment. DioGuardi is a visiting scholar with expertise in songwriting at Berklee. Wu credits his parents' moral and financial support with allowing him to succeed in the music industry. In 2014, Wu signed his first publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing and Arthouse Entertainment. The deal helped him obtain the visa necessary to stay in the United States after finishing school.  Professional career  After connecting with DioGuardi, Wu collaborated with another of Arthouse Entertainment's artists, Claire Rachel Wilkinson, then going by the name Clairity. Wu's production was featured on her 2015 debut EP \\"Alienation\\". Wu co-wrote and produced Andy Grammer's 2017 track \\"Freeze,\\" off his album \\"The Good Parts\\". It was the last song Grammer wrote for the album and he considered it a \\"little ode\\" to his days as a street performer singing \\"Sunday Morning\\" by Maroon 5. In 2019, Wu said hearing the song play in Italian underwear store Calzedonia was the \\"proudest moment of his career\\".

The hotel was originally designed by the Cornish architect Silvanus Trevail and first opened in April 1879. The hotel is built in a prominent position overlooking Great Western Beach. The hotel has 66 rooms, some with sea-views.  History  It was decided in 1878 that a hotel would be built because of the ever increasing Great Western Railway passenger service to Newquay. In September 1878, Mr. Whitefield, solicitor, applied for a licence for it to be called Great Western. The Great Western Railway gave £2,000 towards the building of the hotel. The architecture of the hotel was by Silvanus Trevail, who later designed the Headland Hotel. In January 1879 the hotel was completed and it officially opened on 7 April 1879. The original 1879 building resembled a large country house with pitched roofs, gable ends and attic windows.left\\"The Great Western Hotel, at Newquay, opened for business on Monday, the 7th instant. The situation is all that can be desired, commanding magnificent views of the headland, harbour, and the coast up to Trevose Head. It is said there are fifty rooms. The architect was Mr. Silvanus Trevail. Doubtless the establishment will be appreciated by visitors to this delightful coast.\\" Trevail's Great Western Hotel was the first in a string of hotels designed to appeal to renewed interest in Cornwall as a winter resort for the middle classes. The hotel was described in a Newquay holiday guide as having \\"Spacious Billiard & Coffee Rooms\\". The Hotel was the first to have en- suite rooms. The first owners of the hotel were basket makers and bathing machine proprietors. In 1909, the first generation of the Hooper family took over the hotel. In 1931 the original modest two storey gabled building was altered beyond recognition to its art-deco style. left St Austell Brewery purchased the property in 1985 and in 2007 a £1.1 million refurbishment project commenced. This included extensive ground floor alterations, complete external painting, replacement of windows, bedroom refurbishment and landscape gardening of outside areas to create an extensive “al fresco dining” terrace. The hotel and the owning family is mentioned in Emma Smith's 2008 memoir, The Great Western Beach, describing her childhood in Cornwall between the two World Wars.

However, the video was pulled down by YouTube, citing reasons such as cyberbullying and usage of abusive languages.  Early life  Nagar was born on 12 June 1999 in Faridabad, a city near India's national capital New Delhi, where he is based. He attended school till 2016, when he dropped out to pursue his YouTube career; skipping his Class-XII Board examination because of his nervousness about passing the economics exam. He later completed his schooling through long-distance learning.

During the occupation both, the British and the Soviets, tried to strengthen their influence in their respective zones. The allies took control over the Iranian rail network and contracted one half of Iran's publicly and privately owned trucks, thus occupying 75 percent of the country's food distribution capacity in the midst of the 1941 harvest. The remaining transportation capacities were quickly rendered unusable, due to a restriction of the import of spare parts.Ashley Jackson: Persian Gulf Command: A History of the Second World War in Iran and Iraq; Yale University Press, 2018. (pp. 245) As a consequence internal trade and social services were disrupted, costs of living increased more than 700 percentPatrick Clawson & Michael Rubin: Eternal Iran: Continuity and Chaos; Palgrave Macmillan, 2005.

(p. 119) The British promised to supply the needed amount of grain, but failed to do so, and when the Iranian government turned to the United States for help, the promised aid never substantiated even after months-long negotiations. Hooshang Guilak: Fire Beneath the Ashes: The United States and Iran: a Historic Perspective 1829–1947 (p. 225) The American diplomat Louis G. Dreyfus initially reported to the US government that the food situation was serious, however, shortly thereafter he uttered doubts about any wheat shortage and recommended that America should support \\"the British stand and insist on Iran helping itself before relying on Allied imports.\\" The British blamed the situation on hoarding, inefficient distribution and an inadequate transport system, however, Washington suspected that the British had deliberately manipulated the food supply to further their own political objectives.C. O'Sullivan: FDR and the End of Empire: The Origins of American Power in the Middle East; Palgrave Macmillan, 2012. Meanwhile the Soviets banned food shipments from the north, claiming they needed the resources for the people and soldiers fighting the Germans, and blamed British mismanagement for the famine, as no similar conditions existed in the Soviet-held areas. The Iranian public accused the Allies of pillaging the country and pushing Iran into inflation and starvation.Ashley Jackson: Persian Gulf Command: A History of the Second World War in Iran and Iraq; Yale University Press, 2018. (pp. 247) In December 1942, demonstrations against the scarcity of food became a daily occurrence in Tehran and eventually led to riots. After nearly two weeks Prime Minister Ahmad Qavam ordered the police to quell the protests with deadly force, resulting in a number of deaths and injuries on both sides.Tomas B. Phillips: Queer Sinister Things - the Hidden History of Iran (p. 76) During the final months of 1942 and in 1943 the streets of Kermanshah were full of semi-naked and hungry people with fifteen deaths attributed to hunger and poverty occurring every day. In February 1943 Typhus broke out in the city and the hospital was closed down due to widespread infection among doctors and staff.Iran Press Digest, 1985.

Death toll  According to Cormac Ó Gráda, the number of people who died during the famine is unknown, however it is believed that it was \\"probably modest\\".

It is a traditional state which joins with its bordering sections to form something of a high kingship. The Agura of Gbagura is the traditional ruler of this subsection of the Egba, and under his jurisdiction are the rulers of the 72 townships that each bear the title Baale. Though the Agura is technically in equal power to the Alake, ever since the colonial era the Alake has been considered to be the supreme leader of all of Egbaland, not just the Ake section. History The Egba people's original homeland in the Egba forest was established by Yoruba migrants from elsewhere. According to The History of the Yorubas by Samuel Johnson, Eso Ikoyi chiefs in the retinue of the first Alake of the Egbas joined him in founding a new community - the confederacy of towns that became known as Orile Egba - in the forest after they left the nascent Oyo empire in around the 13th century AD. Orile Egba continued to exist until its destruction during the Yoruba civil war of the 19th century. The Egba people originally lived in the Oyo Empire until an Egba, Lisabi, organized a revolt against the Alaafin of the Oyo Empire. Lisabi is therefore considered the father of the Egba people.https://kwekudee- tripdownmemorylane.blogspot.com/2014/08/egba-people-yoruba-sub-tribe-of- freedom.html Abeokuta was founded as a replacement for Orile Egba in around 1830 by the Egbas after the collapse of the Oyo empire during the civil war. The city was founded because of its strong defensive physical position by refugees trying to protect themselves against slave raiders from Dahomey, who were trying to benefit from the war. The Gbagura people were specifically lead to Abeokuta by Balogun Ojo of Gbagura.https://kwekudee- tripdownmemorylane.blogspot.com/2014/08/egba-people-yoruba-sub-tribe-of- freedom.html The Egba Gbagura, along with the other 4 groups who founded Abeokuta, avoided crowning kings until 1870. This was when the Gbagura appointed Jamolu as the first Agura of Gbagura. The Gbagura section of Nigeria originally included 144 townships scattered all over Yorubaland stretching all the way to modern day Ibadan. 72 of these towns rebelled against the allegiance of the Agura and later joined the Oke-Ona section of Egba.http://www.lisabieliteassociationhouston.org/index.php/history-of-egba- land/egba-agura Towns under the jurisdiction of the Gbagura include Wasinmi, Iddo, Ilugun, Ilawo, and others. Each township brings a chief which serves alongside the Agura and the rest of the kings of Egbaland, and in the Ogboni of Egbaland, the supreme legislative council of chiefs. The township of Iddo is the only township that can produce an Agura. The village of Wasinmi produces the Odafin of Gbagura Egbaland, a member of the Ogboni. https://thegatewaypeople.com/why-five-kingmakers-selected-new-agura-mustapha The history of all the Egba also include many wars fought with neighboring people and kingdoms. In 1832, Abeokuta was involved in war with the people of Ijebu Remo, and in 1834 with the Ibadan people. Sporadic fighting continued with the people of Ota (1842), Ado (1844), Ibarapa (1849), Dahomey (1851), Ijebu-Ere (1851), Ijaye (1860–1862) and the Makun War of 1862–1864. The Dahomeans were long time enemies of the Egba and Dahomey attempted to conquer Egbaland up to 4 times but they were unsuccessful.https://kwekudee- tripdownmemorylane.blogspot.com/2014/08/egba-people-yoruba-sub-tribe-of- freedom.html The Egba success is attributed to the legendary Olumo rock, which towers Abeokuta. In fact, the name Abẹokuta literally means \\"under the rock,\\" abẹ meaning under and okuta meaning rock or stone. It is said the Egba hid under the rock and use it as an advantage point when fighting. https://kwekudee-tripdownmemorylane.blogspot.com/2014/08/egba-people-yoruba- sub-tribe-of-freedom.html On 18 January 1893, a treaty was signed with the governor and commander-in-chief of the British Lagos Colony for the purpose of trade; the British recognized Egbaland as an independent state. In 1898, the Egba United Government was formed. In 1904, an agreement was made where the British assumed jurisdiction in certain legal cases, and in the same year, the Alake Gbadebo paid a state visit to England. Over the following years, the British steadily assumed more responsibility for administration while continuing to formally recognize the Egba state. In 1914, the kingdom was incorporated into the newly amalgamated British Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. Rulers Rulers of the Egba Gbagura in Abeokuta, who took the title \\"Agura\\" in 1870 There are 2 ruling houses in Gbagura, Ajiboso and Egiri.

Only one flew. Design and development The Pelikan's structure and general layout was based on that of the PW-3 Bakcyl trainer glider. Both had fibreglass-epoxy structures, with a high wing, a tailboom with a conventional tail and a forward fuselage with two seats in tandem under a long canopy. Their differences stemmed from the pusher engine and its propeller, together with new landing gear to enable self- powered take-offs. Both aircraft had two-part wings built around a single spar with a glassfibre-covered D-box ahead of it and fabric covering behind. Unlike the Bakcyl, no forward sweep was necessary because the weight of the engine moved the centre of gravity rearwards to the passenger's seat, allowing the Pelikan to be flown with that seat occupied or empty, so the central section of the wing was rectangular in plan and the long tips straight-tapered on both leading and trailing edges. As on the Bakcyl, ailerons were on the outer sections and spoilers inboard, just behind the spars. The wings were braced from the lower fuselage with a single, faired strut to the spar on each side. Forward of the wing the two aircraft were similar but the pod of the Pelikan ended ahead of the trailing edge of the wing. Its flat four, air-cooled, Limbach L2000 engine was mounted on the wing and drove a pusher propeller, requiring the slender, rounded tailboom to be lowered from the wing, on the Bakcyl, to the bottom of the pod. The tail was similar to that of the Bakcyl, with a tall, broad fin and smaller, fabric covered rudder, together trapezoidal in profile, and a smaller, low set, fin-mounted, rectangular plan horizontal tail at the extreme end of the tailboom, its one-piece elevator aft of the rudder. The Pelikan had fixed tricycle gear with mainwheels, equipped with brakes, on arched, cantilever, fibreglass-epoxy/spring legs from the lower fuselage (though one photograph shows an additional drag strut) and a smaller, steerable nosewheel. Two airframes were built but only one flew, with the other used for stress-testing. The first flight was on 23 December 1990. Operational history A very long series of testing followed, only concluding on 29 July 1995. It was decided that the Pelikan would not sell well, so no more were built. The prototype was operated by the Institute of Aeronautics and Applied Mechanics of Warsaw University of Technology. It displayed at the 16th Meeting of Amateur Aviation Structures in Oleśnica in June 1997 and remained active until seriously damaged in an accident on 11 November 2012. In that period it logged 800 hours of flight. It never flew again but was restored to display condition by 2015 and can be seen in the Polish Aviation Museum, Kraków.

Early life Umemoto was born and raised in Kyoto, Japan (Osaka, 2003). Umemoto’s father was a professor in psychology and a practicing Buddhist monk at Higashi-Honganji temple. He valued music and pressed Umemoto to dedicate his youth to music and playing piano. This would later influence his career, inspiring the topics of his research and lectures. He would continue to play piano till his death (Osaka, 2003). Education Umemoto graduated from Kyoto University in 1948, continued through graduate school, and graduated in 1952. Umemoto earned his Ph.D. in 1966 from Kyoto University (Koyasu, 2002). The beginning of his career and his early experiments aligned with the direct growth and attention on perception and cognition, present in Japan, after he earned his Ph.D.(Imada & et. al., 2016). Career Umemoto was a lecturer in the department of educational psychology at Kyoto University in Japan before becoming Associate Professor at the Faculty of education at Kyoto University (Osaka, 2003). Umemoto became a professor at Konan Women's University in the 1980s after retiring from Kyoto University, he lectured on music psychology (Osaka, 2003). The boom in women entering universities and fields of science made Umemoto’s lecturers at Konan influential. Konan Women's University took part in supporting the 20% increase in Japanese Psychological Association along with other progressive (for the 1980s) universities (Imada, et. al., 2016). Umemoto worked on creating valid tests and measures in music psychology. He is known for his research on absolute pitch and the creation of schema used in cognitive music research (Osaka, 2002). Much like early psychologists attempting to measure and explore their ideologies and theories, Takao did the same in his research. He published one of his most famous books, ‘Music Psychology’ in 1966 (Osaka, 2003). Umemoto wrote more than 160 articles and published 4 books over his career (Osaka, 2003). Umemoto served as Dean of Kyoto University from 1976 to 1977 (Koyasu, 2002). He initiated the creation of the Association of Music Perception and Cognition in Japan (Osaka,2003). Due to the positive response to the association, characterized by increase in members and public interest, he organized the first international conference on the subject (Koyasu, 2002).

This river flowing mainly in forest area has a difference in elevation of . It flows south between the “ruisseau des Américains” (American Creek) (west side) and the Jacob River (east side). After several rounds of rapids, waterfalls and falls in the forest area, the Snigole River flows into the Malbaie River facing the “montagne de la Croix” (mountain of the cross). The east bank of this small forest valley is mostly accessible by the “chemin des Marais” (path of the Marshes) which goes to the North. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector; recreational tourism activities, second. The surface of this stream is generally frozen from mid-December to late- March. Nevertheless, safe ice traffic is generally from late December to mid- March.  Geography  The Snigole River originates at “Deuxième lac des Marais” (Second Marsh Lake) (length: , elevation: ) located on the southeastern side of Mont-Élie in the zec du Lac-au-Sable. This wild lake is located in a small forest and recessed valley. It is enclosed between mountains with a peak reaching in the east, in the south and another one of at West. This lake is aptly named because of marshes on the northwestern shore of the lake. Four streams from the north-west drain the east flank of Mont-Élie via the valley connecting the “Troisième lac des Marais” (third Marsh Lake) (flowing in the “Petit Saguenay River” watershed) with the north, which is located at north of the Second Marsh Lake. From the mouth of the Second Marsh Lake, the current flows over according to the following segments: * southeasterly, crossing the First Lake of the Marshes on the to the dam at its mouth; * south through several series of rapids and waterfalls, and branch westward at the end of the segment to get around a mountain, up to a bend in the river, where a stream (coming from the west) flows there; * southeasterly, then southerly, in a well-formed valley through three sets of rapids, to the confluence of the marsh stream (coming from the west); * southeasterly under the “chemin des Marais” (Marsh Road) bridge, then easterly to its confluence with the Malbaie River. The confluence of the Snigole River is at upstream of the dam that results in an enlargement of the Malbaie River and at upstream of the railway bridge spanning the Malbaie River in downtown Clermont.  Toponymy  The origin of the term \\"Snigole\\" is uncertain. The first hypothesis would be the deformation of the English word \\"sea gull\\", meaning \\"gull\\"; these domineering birds are usually very present here, except in winter. A second hypothesis is that \\"Snigole\\" is similar to the term \\"Snieguole\\" meaning \\"snowman\\" in the Latvian language. A third hypothesis is that \\"Snigole\\" is similar to the term \\"Smigole\\" which is a rare name. The name \\"Snigole River\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968, at the Bank of Place Names of the Commission de toponymie du Québec.Commission de toponymie du Québec - Bank of Place Names - Toponym: Snigole River  Notes et references   Annexes   Related Articles  * Zec du Lac-au-Sable, a controlled harvested zone * Mount-Élie, an unorganized territory * Clermont, a municipality * Malbaie River, a watercourse * List of rivers of Quebec  External links  Category:Rivers of Capitale-Nationale Category:Tributaries of the Saint Lawrence River ","title":"Snigole River"},{"id":"62520336","text":"Piechocki is a Polish-language surname derived from the placename Piechoty.

Also, he has a doctorate from Brown University (2013). His theoretical influences include Carlos Daniel Heymann and Joseph Stiglitz. Academics At the Columbia Business School, Guzmán is an Associate Research Scholar at the Economics Division, director of Columbia University Initiative for Policy Dialogue's Debt Restructuring Program and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Globalization and Development, specializing on the fields of public debt, international macroeconomics and monetary economics. Minister of Economy Martín Guzmán with Joseph Stiglitz, February 2020. His first legislative initiative, the Social Solidarity and Productive Recovery Bill, was passed by Congress on 23 December. The bill includes tax hikes on foreign currency purchases, agricultural exports, wealth, and car sales - as well as tax incentives for production. Amid the worst recession in nearly two decades, it provides a 180-day freeze on utility rates, bonuses for the nation's retirees and Universal Allocation per Child beneficiaries, and food cards to two million of Argentina’s poorest families. It also gave the president additional powers to renegotiate debt terms – with Argentina seeking to restructure its US$100 billion debt with private bondholders and US$45 billion borrowed by Macri from the International Monetary Fund. Argentina defaulted again on May 22, 2020 by failing to pay $500 million on its due date to its creditors. Negotiations for the restructuring of $66 billion of its debt continue. The International Monetary Fund reported that the COVID-19 crisis would plunge Argentina's GDP by 9.9 percent, after the country's economy contracted by 5.4 percent in first quarter of 2020, with unemployment rising over 10.4 percent in the first three months of the year, before the lockdown started. On August 4, Guzmán reached an accord with the biggest creditors on terms for a restructuring of $65bn in foreign bonds, after a breakthrough in talks that had at times looked close to collapse since the country’s ninth debt default in May.

She was an elected fellow of the Society of American Archivists, whose two-volume work Women's History Sources: A Guide to Archives and Manuscript Collections in the United States (1979) shaped the study of women's history and archival practices relating to sources about women over the following two decades.  Early life and education  Hinding grew up in the American Midwest, as the eldest child of a Danish father and Slovenian mother. She began studying journalism at Marquette University, Wisconsin, before moving to the University of Minnesota in the early 1960s. In 1966, she graduated in history magna cum laude, and earned a master's degree in history in 1973.  Career  Hinding was the first staff person and later curator of the University of Minnesota Elmer L. Anderson Library. She also wrote and edited books about archives and history, particularly women's history and feminism, sports and the YMCA. She also published articles through the Society of American Archivists' journal, The American Archivist, and is listed as an editor on many books, journals and directories. Hinding's two-volume work Women's History Sources: A Guide to Archives and Manuscript Collections in the United States was described by Nan Robertson in the New York Times as \\"the bible of reference books in women's history\\". It \\"shaped scholarship in women's history through-out the 1980s and early 1990s\\", and \\"caused many archivists to rethink the way they organized and described their holdings, eventually bringing to light countless women's materials hidden in the papers of husbands, fathers, and sons. It could no longer be asserted accurately that there were few resources for the study of women's history.\\" Hinding was elected a Fellow of the Society of American Archivists in 1977, and served on the executive council from 1975-1979 and as president from 1984-1985. She was a longtime member of the Organization of American Historians and the Midwest Archives Conference, and served on the executive council of the former from 1977-1980. She also served as University of Minnesota representative for women's issues on the Big Ten Conference in the mid 1970s. In 1986, when several University of Minnesota basketball players were charged with sexual assault, she disagreed with university president Kenneth Keller's decision to set up a task force to study the issue, and stated that more decisive action, such as canceling the season or firing the athletic director Paul Giel, should have been taken.

Bilott is known for the lawsuits against DuPont on behalf of plaintiffs from West Virginia. Bilott has spent more than twenty years litigating hazardous dumping of the chemicals perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS).  Early life  Bilott was born on August 2, 1965. Bilott's father served in the United States Air Force, and Bilott spent his childhood on several air force bases. Because the family moved frequently, Bilott attended eight different schools before graduating from Fairborn High School in Fairborn, Ohio. He then earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and urban studies from the New College of Florida. He then earned a Juris Doctor from the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law in 1990.  Career  Bilott was admitted to the Bar in 1990 and began his law practice at Taft Stettinius & Hollister LLP in Cincinnati, Ohio For eight years he worked almost exclusively for large corporate clients and his specialty was defending chemical companies.The Lawyer Who became Dupont's worst nightmare, New York Times, 6 January 2016 He became a partner at the firm in 1998. Bilott represented Wilbur Tennant of Parkersburg, West Virginia whose cattle were dying. The farm was downstream from a landfill where DuPont had been dumping hundreds of tons of Perfluorooctanoic acid. In the summer of 1999, Bilott filed a federal suit against DuPont in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In response, DuPont advised that DuPont and the United States Environmental Protection Agency would commission a study of the farmer's property, conducted by three veterinarians chosen by DuPont and three chosen by the Environmental Protection Agency. When the report was released, it blamed the Tennants for the dying cattle claiming that poor husbandry was responsible: ‘‘poor nutrition, inadequate veterinary care and lack of fly control.’’ After Bilott discovered that thousands of tons of DuPont's PFOA had been dumped into the landfill next to the Tennants' property and that DuPont's PFOA was contaminating the surrounding community's water supply, DuPont settled the Tennants' case. In August 2001, Bilott filed a class action lawsuit against DuPont on behalf of the approximately 70,000 people in West Virginia and Ohio with PFOA-contaminated drinking water, which was settled in September 2004, with class benefits valued at over $300 million, including DuPont agreeing to install filtration plants in the six affected water districts and dozens of impacted private wells, a cash award of $70 million, and provisions for future medical monitoring to be paid by DuPont up to $235 million, if an independent science panel confirmed \\"probable links\\" between PFOA in the drinking water and human disease. After the independent scientific panel jointly selected by the parties (but required under the settlement to be paid for by DuPont) found that there was a probable link between drinking PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia, and ulcerative colitis, Bilott began opening individual personal-injury lawsuits against DuPont on behalf of affected users of the Ohio and West Virginia water supplies, which by 2015 numbered over 3,500. After winning the first three for $19.7 million, in 2017 DuPont agreed to settle the remainder of the then-pending cases for $671.7 million. Dozens more cases have been filed since the 2017 settlement. In 2018, Bilott filed a new case seeking new studies and testing of the larger group of PFAS chemicals on behalf of a proposed nationwide class of everyone in the United States who has PFAS chemicals in their blood, against several PFAS manufacturers, including 3M, DuPont, and Chemours. This new litigation is ongoing . In 2016, Bilott's story was the focus of a featured cover story by Nathaniel Rich in the New York Times Magazine, entitled, \\"The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare.\\" Bilott's work was also featured in extensive articles in The Huffington Post (Welcome to Beautiful Parkersburg) and The Intercept (multi- part The Teflon Toxin series). Robert Bilott is the author of the acclaimed memoir Exposure: Poisoned Water, Corporate Greed, and One Lawyer's Twenty-Year Battle Against DuPont, published in 2019 by Atria Books. The audio book version (also available through Atria Books) is narrated by Jeremy Bobb with the first chapter narrated by Mark Ruffalo. Bilott's story also became the basis for Dark Waters, a 2019 film starring Mark Ruffalo as Bilott, and Anne Hathaway as Bilott's wife, Sarah Barlage. The story is also featured in the feature-length documentary The Devil We Know; was the subject of the poem, Watershed by U.S. Poet Laureate Tracy K. Smith; is the subject of the \\"Toxic Waters\\" episode of the multi-part feature documentary, Parched, which aired on the National Geographic TV channel in 2017; and is the subject for the song and video Deep in the Water by The Gary Douglas Band. In 2017, Bilott received the international Right Livelihood Award, also known as the \\"Alternative Nobel Prize,\\" for his decades of work on PFAS chemical contamination issues, and was featured on a stamp issued in Austria, commemorating the award.

The company was founded in 2003 by a group led by Markku Jalkanen, who now acts as the company's Chief Executive Officer. It specialises in the development of treatments for acute organ traumas, vascular damage and cancer immunotherapy. Its lead product Traumakine has been developed to treat Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). It is currently (2020) undergoing international phase III clinical trials after an open-label, early-phase trial showed promising results in the treatment patients with ARDS. The drug is known to function by enhancing lung CD73 expression and increasing production of anti-inflammatory adenosine, such that vascular leaking and escalation of inflammation are reduced. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA has accepted the proposed protocol design for the next Traumakine study in March 2020. The phase III study is a comparison of efficacy in the treatment of patients with ARDS. In 2020 Traumakine was selected to take part in the WHO Solidarity trial and Remap-Cap trials to find drugs for the symptoms of Covid_19. In June 2020, Faron received a €2,100,000 low interest rate loan from Business Finland for Traumakine manufacturing. Faron’s other products include the anti-Clever-1 antibody Clevegen. Clevegen is focused on converting the immune environment around a tumour from being immune suppressive to immune stimulating and represents a novel immuno-oncology approach. Current encouraging phase I/II clinical trials in Europe are soon to be extended to America. In 2020, the trials continue with bowel cancer and other types of cancer. According to the Faron CEO Markku Jalkanen, the first marketing authorisations could potentially be applied for in 2022–2023. In April 2020, the placing of Faron's shares raised €14 million, and with these resources, Faron will expand the Clevegen study to include several difficult types of cancer, e.g. bowel cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatic cancer and pancreatic cancer. Faron Pharmaceuticals is listed in London on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market (AIM). The company is listed secondarily in Helsinki on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market Finland since December 2019. According to the Faron CEO Markku Jalkanen, a secondary listing will enhance the company’s visibility and facilitate the trading of the stock for Scandinavian shareholders.

Built in 1923, this Classical Revival building house support services for the main exchange of the local telephone company until about 1950, and has seen other commercial uses since then. It was listed on National Register of Historic Places in 2019 for its architecture, and the role the telephone company played in Brockton's 20th-century growth. It has more recently been converted to residential use. Description and history The former New England Telephone and Telegraph Engineering Office is located a short way west of North Main Street in downtown Brockton, on the north side of Pleasant Street. Compared to adjacent buildings, it is set comparatively far back from the street, with a parking lot in front. It is a brick building with two sections, a two-story section on the left and a single-story section on the right. The left section is divided into three bays, articulated by projecting brick piers. Each bay has two windows on the ground floor and a band of three windows on the second, except the leftmost bay, where the main building entrance is located. The right section is a tall single story, also with three bays, although these are of irregular size. The left bay has two pedestrian entrances, the center bay has a large two-panel garage door, and the right bay has a band of two sash windows. The building was designed by Brockton architect Charles Olson, and was built in 1923 for the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company. It housed offices and other service facilities ancillary to the company's main exchange building, located a few blocks to the south. The right side housed offices, while the right side housed the company garage, and its cable yard was just to the north. By 1950, portions of the building were occupied by offices of the United Shoe Machine Company, and by 1958 it was occupied by a printer.

History MCS Aerocarga emerged in 2015 through the joint participation between MCS Holding Cargo Services and Grupo TUM, based on operations at Mexico City International Airport, in order to generate a regular air cargo service taking advantage of the logistics network of both companies. Previously, MCS Holding Cargo Services operated air cargo through other airlines such as Volaris carga and Lufthansa. However, excess baggage and the delay or cancellation of commercial flights with passengers made it difficult to transport express cargo, so in association With Grupo TUM and its close relationship with FedEx, it began the creation of a cargo airline, which entered service with a Bombardier CRJ-100 in July 2015. The airline acquired two more Bombardier CRJ-100 aircraft during 2015, and a CRJ-200 aircraft in 2017. By January 2018 the airline changed its name to TUM AeroCarga and in July of that same year it acquired a Boeing 737-300 converted to freighter, which was previously in service with Air Costa Rica. Due to the difficulties with the allocation of Slots at Mexico City International Airport, the airline moved its operations to Toluca Airport in May 2017, allowing for greater punctuality in the itineraries and greater efficiency in cargo operations.

Before the 1800s * Ötzi, also called the Iceman, is the well-preserved natural mummy of a man who lived between 3400 and 3100 BCE. The mummy was found in September 1991 in the Ötztal Alps. The cause of death remained uncertain until 10 years after the discovery of the body. It was initially believed that Ötzi died from exposure during a winter storm. Later it was speculated that Ötzi might have been a victim of a ritual sacrifice, perhaps for being a chieftain. This explanation was inspired by theories previously advanced for the first millennium BCE bodies recovered from peat bogs such as the Tollund Man and the Lindow Man. In 2001, X-rays and a CT scan revealed that Ötzi had an arrowhead lodged in his left shoulder when he died and a matching small tear on his coat. The discovery of the arrowhead prompted researchers to theorize Ötzi died of blood loss from the wound, which would probably have been fatal even if modern medical techniques had been available. Further research found that the arrow's shaft had been removed before death, and close examination of the body found bruises and cuts to the hands, wrists and chest, and cerebral trauma indicative of a blow to the head.

The killings are widely believed to have been a revenge attack by members of The Purple Gang; two members were arrested the next day, but were never charged and the case remains unsolved. * Morduch Halsman, a Latvian Jewish dentist, was hiking with his son Philippe in Austria's Tyrol on September 10, 1928, when he slipped and fell down a ravine. He survived the fall, but when Philippe returned with assistance, he had been beaten to death and robbed. Philippe was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to four years in prison in a trial marked by the antisemitism prevalent in Austria at the time. After prominent Jews of the time, including Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud drew attention to the case, Halsmann was pardoned and emigrated to France to begin his career as a photographer.Unknown Halsman, 2008. No other suspect in his father's murder has ever been identified. * Jewish gangster Arnold Rothstein (46), an avid gambler best remembered for his alleged role fixing the 1919 World Series, died on November 6, 1928, of gunshot wounds, inflicted the day before during a New York City business meeting. He refused to identify his killer to the police. A fellow gambler who was believed to have ordered the hit as retaliation for Rothstein's failure to pay a large debt from a recent poker game (Rothstein in turn claimed it had been fixed) was tried and acquitted. No other suspects have ever emerged. *Seider Meyer, the head of the protection of the Peregonovsky sugar factory in 1922–1925, was known for shooting Soviet military figure Grigory Kotovsky on August 6, 1925. In 1930 it became known that Meyer Seider was killed in Kharkov, not far from the local railway station. His corpse was found on the canvas of the railway. It is likely that, strangling him, the murderers threw Zayder on the rails in the hope of imitating the accident, but the train was late, and their plan failed.Belyaev Alexander. Who killed Robin Hood revolution? Interview with GG Kotovsky, 2000 His killers are unknown. *Morduch Halsman was a male Latvian Jewish dentist while on a hiking tour with his son in the Zillertal valley in the Austrian Tyrol was murdered on September 10, 1928.Marin Pollack: Anklage Vatermord. Der Fall Philipp Halsmann. Fischer, Frankfurt, 2004 (german) The murder remains unsolved. * The Saint Valentine's Day Massacre occurred on February 14, 1929, when seven members and associates of the North Side Gang were lined up against a wall and shot by four men in police uniform. No-one was ever charged, although notorious gangster Al Capone is believed by many to have ordered the killing. * The Wallace case was the unsolved murder of Liverpool housewife Julia Wallace on January 20, 1931.Murder in the 1930s p. 42 Her husband, William Herbert Wallace, was convicted and sentenced to be hanged, but the verdict was overturned on appealMurder in the 1930s p. 51—the first such instance in British legal history. The chess-like quality of the puzzle has attracted a host of crime writers. Raymond Chandler said, 'The Wallace case is the nonpareil of all murder mysteries ... I call it the impossible murder because Wallace couldn't have done it, and neither could anyone else. ... The Wallace case is unbeatable; it will always be unbeatable.' In 2018, author Antony Matthew Brown surveyed all the published theories, both evidentially and logically, in his book Move to Murder,Antony M Brown, Move to Murder, Mirror Books, before rejecting them all, and concluding that a previously- unpublished theory \\"is the best explanation for one of the most puzzling murder cases in British criminal history.\\" * Harry C. Beasley (42), a Medal of Honor recipient who later became a Newark, Ohio police officer, died after being shot while confronting robbers on July 2, 1931.Leeke, Jim: \\"Who Killed Harry Beasley?\\" \\"Timeline Magazine Ohio Historical Society Publication OCt/Dec 2004 Vol 21 Numbers 5–6. No one was ever identified as a suspect. * On September 12, 1931, Arthur Brennan (50), a World War I veteran and early Australian rules football player, was shot and killed while struggling with a burglar he was trying to apprehend on a neighbour's property. After investigating for three months, police announced they could not find a suspect. No arrests were ever made. * The murder of Vera Page (10), occurred on December 14, 1931. Page was a schoolgirl from Notting Hill, London, who was last seen walking towards her home, having visited her aunt to show her new swimming certificates she had been awarded.Murder in the 1930s p.56 Her raped and strangled body was found two days later.Murder in the 1930s p. 57 Despite strong circumstantial evidence linking a local man named Percy Rush to the crime, a jury recorded an open verdict of \\"Murder by person or persons unknown.\\" * Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond (34), an American gangster, was found shot dead in the Albany, New York apartment of his mistress on the morning of December 18, 1931. While he had many enemies among the underworld who wanted him dead, Daniel P. O'Connell, boss of the city's political machine, claimed in an interview with author William Kennedy four decades later that he had ordered the killing after Diamond ignored police warnings to stay out of the city's rackets. The case remains officially unsolved. Vampire murder case. On display at Stockholm's Police Museum * The Vampire murder case is an unsolved murder relating to an unknown assailant who committed the murder of a sex worker named Lilly Lindeström in Stockholm, Sweden. Lindeström was found dead with a crushed skull in her apartment on May 4, 1932. Police noted that someone had drunk her blood. * The body of Erik Jan Hanussen (43), an Austrian Jewish publicist who claimed to have psychic powers and was a confidant of Hitler, was found in a field in Zossen, Germany, outside Berlin in late April 1933,Gordon, Mel: Hanussen: Hitler's Jewish Clairvoyant Feral House, 2001, p. 249. . a month after he had last been seen on March 25 in the city. He had been shot execution style, twice, in the back of the head at close range. No one was ever charged with the crime, although it is believed that it may have been carried out by stormtroopers. Possible motives range from resentment of Hanussen's relationship with Hitler to a desire to keep secret inside information on the Reichstag fire, which Hanussen claimed to have foreseen. * Left-wing Zionist leader Haim Arlosoroff was shot and killed late on the night of June 16, 1933, while walking with his wife on the beach of Tel Aviv in what is now Israel but was at the time British Mandate Palestine. Three men belonging to a rival political faction were arrested and tried; all were ultimately acquitted. Theories as to who was really responsible have ranged from the Soviets or Nazis to a failed attempt to rape Arlosoroff's wife. *Joan Winters (23) was a Broadway dancer who was murdered in the Garden of Gethsemane, outside Jerusalem, in October 1933. According to a UPI wire report from November 4, 1933, Winters' corpse was discovered together with the body of Mohammed Karamini. Her killer is unknown. * Sergei Kirov (48) was a prominent Russian revolutionary and a Soviet politician. He was a close, personal friend to Joseph Stalin, and his death in 1934 was used as a pretext to launch the Great Purge. On December 1, 1934, Kirov was shot and killed by a gunman at his offices in the Smolny Institute. There is a widespread belief that Joseph Stalin and elements of the NKVD were behind Kirov's assassination, but evidence for this claim remains lacking,The Whisperers, Orlando Figes, Allen Lane 2007, note, p. 236 so the murder remains unsolved. * A man who died of beating injuries and stab wounds on January 5, 1935, after a brief stay in room 1046 at the Hotel President in Kansas City, Missouri, which he had checked into under an assumed name, was not identified as Artemus Ogletree (20) until his mother in Alabama saw a magazine article about the case late the following year. His stay at the hotel was marked by unusual behavior and occurrences and the motive for the killing was unknown; some later anonymous callers to a newspaper and funeral home suggested it had been a revenge killing for cheating on his fiancée. The case remains open. * Welsh journalist Gareth Jones (29) was killed by bandits who had been holding him for ransom near what is now Zhangjiakou, China, on April 12, 1935. A fellow journalist with him had been released two weeks earlier, ostensibly to collect the money demanded. Since Jones had two years before been banned from the Soviet Union for life after being the first journalist to report on the 1932–33 Ukrainian famine, it has been believed that the Soviet NKVD had him killed in retaliation, as some of those connected to the kidnapping were its agents. No suspects have ever been identified. *The Shark Arm case refers to a series of incidents that began in Sydney, on April 25, 1935, when a human arm was regurgitated by a captive 3.5-metre tiger shark. The tiger shark had been caught from the beach suburb of Coogee in mid-April and transferred to the Coogee Aquarium Baths, where it was put on public display. Within a week the fish became ill and vomited in front of a small crowd, leaving the left forearm of a man bearing a distinctive tattoo floating in the pool. Before it was captured, the tiger shark had devoured a smaller shark. It was this smaller shark that had originally swallowed the human arm that belonged to a man named James Smith who was last seen drinking and playing cards with a man named Patrick Brady at the Cecil Hotel in the southern Sydney suburb of Cronulla on April 7, 1935, after telling his wife he was going fishing.Whiticker, Alan Twelve Crimes That Shocked the Nation 2005 On June 12, 1935, a man Reginald Holmes who was investigating Smith's murder thinking that he was fed to the shark by Brady was found dead in his car in Dawes Point after being shot.Sydney Morning Herald. \\"MURDERED IN CAR – Principal Witness in Aquarium Mystery Inquest\\". June 12, 1935. (page 13) The police charged Brady with his murder although he was later found not guilty and acquitted.Sydney Morning Herald. \\"MURDER CHARGE in Crown Case. Trial of PATRICK BRADY.\\" September 11, 1935. (page 10) Whether or not Smith was killed and fed to the shark also remains unknown. * Louis Amberg (27–28) was an American mobster was who was murdered on September 30, 1935. Less than a month later, Amberg's body was found the back seat of a flaming car early in the morning of October 23, 1935, across from 131 North Elliot Place, Brooklyn. He had been stripped of his clothes, a sack placed over his head with his hands tied with wire. A witness who first spotted the flames saw several men running away from the scene. His murder remains unsolved. * American journalist Walter Liggett (49) was shot in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on December 9, 1935, while investigating connections between that state's governor and organized crime. Kid Cann was a suspect, but was acquitted after he provided an alibi. No suspects were ever identified. *Federico García Lorca (38) was a Spanish poet, playwright, and theatre director. On August 19, 1936, he was executed by Rebel faction forces at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.Ian Gibson, The Assassination of Federico García Lorca. Penguin (1983) Michael Wood, \\"The Lorca Murder Case\\", The New York Review of Books, Vol. 24, No. 19 (24 November 1977) His body or bones have never been found, and his killers are unknown. * The body of Pamela Werner (19), the only daughter of British China scholar E. T. C. Werner, was found near the Fox Tower in Beijing on the morning of January 8, 1937; she had last been seen alive leaving an ice skating rink nearby the night before. After being killed by several blows to the head, her body had been severely mutilated, with several internal organs removed, among them her heart, by someone with professional skills, and sexually violated. An unusual joint British-Chinese investigation found some possible suspects among the city's foreign community, where she was socially prominent, but was unable to develop any evidence to the point of arrest before the coroner officially concluded that the killers were probably Chinese and closed the case; after the Japanese occupied the city a few months later there would be no further official investigations. E. T. C. Werner funded an unofficial investigation which identified an American dentist as the killer; his conclusion was endorsed by Midnight in Peking, Paul French's 2011 book about the case. However. some of the dentists' descendants have strongly disputed that finding. Other theories of the case suggest Japanese revenge for the death of two army officers allegedly at British hands the summer before, mistaken identity by Blue Shirts intending to kill Helen Foster Snow, or a local serial killer. * Russian banker and politician Dimitri Navachine (47) was stabbed to death while walking his dog in Paris' Bois de Boulogne on the morning of January 25, 1937. No suspects have ever been identified, although theories as to who might be responsible suggest the Soviet NKVD, as while he had initially worked with the communists despite not sharing their ideology he had broken with them under Stalin and was reportedly about to reveal evidence which would have shown that some prominent political prisoners were in fact innocent of the crimes with which they had been charged. Another theory implicates the French fascist organization La Cagoule, which did not like a Jew closely advising the French government on economic matters and supposedly hoped that his death would be blamed on communist operatives, appearing to strengthen La Cagoule's claims of foreign Communists operating in France. * On May 16, 1937, Laetitia Toureaux (29), was found fatally stabbed in an empty first-class car on the Paris Métro when it stopped at Porte Dorée. The crime received considerable media attention as not only was it the first homicide on the Métro, Toureaux had boarded the train at the previous station, meaning the crime had to have been committed in just minutes. Further investigation found that she was leading a double life, working a factory job during the day under her own name but then at a dance hall at night under another name, and making frequent if discreet visits to the Italian embassy. Eventually it was revealed that she was a spy, infiltrating La Cagoule, who it is believed may have discovered this and killed her. The onset of World War II two years later put a stop to the investigation before any suspects were identified; it has not been reopened. *King D. Gray (52), American cinematographer who was active in Hollywood, California for over two decades was shot and killed in front of a post office in Hollywood on June 30, 1938, and his killer remains unknown. * Margaret Martin (19), of Kingston, Pennsylvania went missing on December 17, 1938, and was found dead in Wyoming County, Pennsylvania, several days later on December 21, 1938. Many suspects were investigated, but nobody was ever convicted. * Pete Panto (28), a labor leader who had fought Mafia control of the International Longshoremen's Association local on the Brooklyn docks who had not been seen since leaving his house on July 14, 1939, was found in a Lyndhurst, New Jersey lime pit in January 1941. No one was ever arrested in the case; one suspect who was questioned was found dead a month later. * Zinaida Reich (45) was a Russian actress and became one of the main stars of the Meyerhold Theatre until it was closed under Joseph Stalin. Reich married poet Sergey Yesenin and had two children with him. After their divorce, she married the director Vsevolod Meyerhold. On July 15, 1939, Meyerhold was arrested by the NKVD, and she was brutally stabbed in her apartment by NKVD agents who staged a robbery Her killers are unknown. * Louis B. Allyn (65–66) was an American chemistry professor and influential figure in the pure food movement who was murdered by persons unknown on May 7, 1940.Westfield State College Fun Facts , 29. The only unsolved murder in the history of the city of Westfield: The mysterious 1940 shooting of Louis B. Allyn, Westfield Teachers College chemistry professor and pure food expert for McClure's magazines. His is the only unsolved murder in the history of Westfield, Massachusetts. *Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz (57) was a notable general, military commander and veteran of World War I, the Russian Civil War, the Estonian War of Independence, the Polish-Bolshevik War and the Invasion of Poland at the start of World War II. On November 28, 1940, he was surrounded with a group of young conspirators in a house in Warsaw's borough of Saska Kępa and arrested by the Germans. According to the most common version, Bułak-Bałachowicz, was shot by Gestapo agents on May 10, 1940, in the Warsaw centre, on the intersection between Francuska and Trzeciego Maja streets. His killers are unknown and the case remains unsolved. * On March 24, 1941, Josslyn Hay, 22nd Earl of Erroll (39) was found shot dead behind the wheel of his car at a crossroads in Kenya.Cokayne et al., The Complete Peerage, volume I, p.1337 Reporting on the murder investigation outraged the British public with its accounts of carousing and partying by Lord Erroll and fellow members of the Happy Valley set while the homefront endured the hardships of World War II. Sir Jock Delves Broughton, another peer in Happy Valley whom Hay might have cuckolded, was acquitted after being tried with a weak case later that year; he committed suicide the following year. No other suspects have ever been named. The crime has inspired several dramatisations, most notably the 1987 film White Mischief, which have attempted to offer solutions. * Carlo Tresca (63), an Italian American labor leader who led opposition to Fascism, Stalinism and Mafia control of unions, was shot dead at a Manhattan intersection on the night of January 11, 1943. Given the enemies he had made and their propensity for violence, the list of potential suspects was long; however, the investigation was incomplete and no one was ever officially named. Historians believe the most likely suspect was mobster Carmine Galante, later acting boss of the Bonanno family, seen fleeing the scene, who had likely acted on the orders of a Bonanno underboss and Fascist sympathizer Tresca had threatened to expose. * The beaten and partially burnt body of Sir Harry Oakes (68), an American-born British gold-mine owner and philanthropist, was found in his mansion in Nassau, Bahamas on July 8, 1943. His son-in-law, Count Alfred de Marigny, was arrested shortly afterwards based on evidence allegedly uncovered by two Miami police detectives brought in to work the case, who had upset their Bahamanian counterparts by completely taking over the investigation. However, weaknesses in the case led to de Marigny's acquittal; no one else has ever been tried. The murder became the subject of worldwide press coverage at the time as well as several books, films, and documentaries. * Actor David Bacon (29), best known for playing Bob Barton in the Masked Marvel serials of the 1930s, died shortly after crashing his car in Santa Monica, California on September 12, 1943. Afterwards, he was found to have been suffering from a stab wound to the chest; no suspect has ever been identified. * Georgette Bauerdorf (20), an heiress who was found face down in a bathtub in her home at West Hollywood, California, on October 12, 1944. She had been strangled with a piece of towel stuffed down her throat, and although there was a large roll of $2 bills and thousands of dollars' worth of sterling silver lying in an open trunk, Bauerdorf's jewelry and other valuables were not stolen. The police believe her murderer had unscrewed an automatic night light over the outside entrance of the apartment so it would not come on and lain in wait for her. * Tamil film critic C.N. Lakshmikanthan was stabbed while riding back to his Madras, India, home on November 8, 1944; he died in hospital the next day having been able to describe the attack to police but not identify the assailants. Six men, all film actors whom he had feuded with, were arrested; three were tried and two convicted. Their convictions were overturned on appeal three years later but their film careers were ruined. No other suspects have ever been identified. * Charles Walton (74–75) was found dead at a farm at Meon Hill, Warwickshire, on February 14, 1945. He had been beaten over the head with his own stick, his neck had been cut open with a slash hook and he had been pinned to the ground by his neck with a pitchfork. His employer, Alfred John Potter, was suspected of the murder but never charged. The case attracted notoriety because of suspicions the murder had been related to witchcraft, and because of its similarities to the murder of a local woman, Ann Tennant, in 1875, who was also killed with a pitchfork by a man accusing her of witchcraft. * Nevio Skull (42) was a Fiuman Italian businessman and politician from Rijeka (now Croatia). From his father, Skull inherited the property of the \\"Foundry and factory machines of Matthew Skull\\", founded in Rijeka in 1878 and quickly became the largest private industry in the city before being taken over in 1935. On the night of May 3–4, 1945, following the Yugoslav occupation of Rijeka, Skull was arrested by agents of OZNA and disappeared. His body was found on the riverbed of the Rječina 25 days later with a gunshot wound to the neck.* His killer is unknown. * Ernst Dehmel (30), a decorated officer in the German Waffen-SS, was allegedly beaten to death by French soldiers who had him in their custody at Remscheid-Lüttringhausen on August 7, 1945. No charges have ever been brought. *Oto Iskandar di Nata (48) was a fighter for Indonesia's liberation from Dutch rule, and an Indonesian State Minister and was also a National Hero of Indonesia. Based on witness information, Oto was murdered on December 19, 1945, on a beach in Mauk District, Tangerang Regency in Banten (formerly West Java). He was abducted by a group called \\"The Black Troop\\" (), who killed him and dumped his body into the sea; the body was never found. His kidnappers and killers were never identified and were not charged with his murder. * Oak Grove Jane Doe, an unidentified murder victim found dismembered in the Willamette River south of Portland, Oregon near Oak Grove over a period of several months in 1946. The first discovery consisted of a woman's torso which was found wrapped in burlap, floating near the Wisdom Light moorage on April 12, 1946; this led the media to dub the case the Wisdom Light Murder. * The Texarkana Moonlight murders were a series of murders committed by the unidentified \\"Phantom Killer\\" between February 22 and May 3, 1946. Eight people were attacked by the Phantom Killer, five of whom died. A profile was released for the killer, but his identity remains unknown. * The Carterons, a French family of three and a foster child who lived with them, as well as their family dog, were all found shot execution-style face down on the floor of their Bommiers farmhouse on July 25, 1946, several days after signs of their apparent inattention to their farming duties had been noted by a neighbor. Robbery was seen as an unlikely motive since the family was very poor, and there were no signs of a struggle. The investigation was hampered by the still chaotic nature of French society barely a year after the end of the war; not until two years later was it established that the weapon used to kill the four was a Sten, a submachine gun commonly used by the French Resistance, giving rise to theories that the killings had something to do with it. A friend of Kléber Carteron said he had been claiming he was being followed the previous winter. No suspects have ever been named, although most residents of the area believe the killer was someone local who had a dispute with the family. Elizabeth Short, known posthumously as the \\"Black Dahlia,\\" is one of the most famous victims of an unsolved murder in American history. * The Black Dahlia (Elizabeth Short) (22), a woman who was found severely mutilated and her body cut in half in Leimert Park, Los Angeles, California on January 15, 1947. Her unsolved murder has been the source of several books, films, and widespread speculation. * On June 20, 1947, gangster Bugsy Siegel (41), known for making Las Vegas into a gambling destination, was shot several times with an M-1 carbine from outside as he read the newspaper at a friend's house in Beverly Hills, California. There are many suspects. Police believe he was killed by his own associates, but have never put together enough evidence against any one of them to declare the case solved. *Osterby Man, also known as \\"The Osterby Head\\" is a bog body that was found with only the skull and hair survived. It was discovered by peat cutters to the southeast of Osterby, Germany. The hair is tied in a Suebian knot. The head is at the State Archaeological Museum at Gottorf Castle in Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein. The head was discovered on May 26, 1948, by Otto and Max Müller of Osterby, who were cutting peat on their father's land.Karl Kersten, \\"Ein Moorleichenfund von Osterby bei Eckernförde\\", Offa. Berichte und Mitteilungen zur Urgeschichte, Frühgeschichte und Mittelalterarchäologie 8 (1949) 1–2, p. 1, Fig. 1 The skull of the body of Dätgen Man, who also had a Suebian knot, was found several metres from his head. The murders remain unsolved. * In the Tamam Shud case, an unidentified man was found dead on Somerton beach in Adelaide, South Australia on the morning of December 1, 1948, at 6:30 am. Also known as the Mystery of the Somerton Man, this case is considered \\"one of Australia's most profound mysteries\\", and no suspects have been named nor has the man ever been identified despite the best efforts of many world agencies. He was killed by an unknown poison with a piece of paper in his pocket that reads \\"Tamám Shud\\", meaning \\"The End\\". * Emily Armstrong (69), found in a dry cleaner's shop in London, England on April 14, 1949, about an hour after she had been murdered. An autopsy showed she was beaten to death and her skull shattered by at least 22 blows from a blunt object, believed to be a claw hammer. The case remains unsolved. * Three people died when a train derailed near Matsukawa, Japan on August 17, 1949. Investigators found that the track had been sabotaged going into a curve and arrested 20 people; all of whom were initially convicted and, in several cases, sentenced to death. However, during the appeals process, it eventually emerged that prosecutors had suppressed exculpatory evidence, and after all the defendants were released in 1970 the case was closed. No other suspects have ever been identified. 1950s *Philip Mangano (53) was an Italian-born caporegime and second consigliere in the Gambino crime family in New York City and reigned consigliere for 20 years between 1931 and 1951 when his brother, Vincent, was boss. On April 19, 1951, a woman in a fishing boat discovered Philip Mangano's body in a marshland area of Jamaica Bay in Brooklyn while she had been walking through the tall grass. Mangano had been shot three times; once in the neck and twice in the face. No one was ever charged with his murder, so it remains unsolved. * Liaquat Ali Khan (56), who was one of the leading founding fathers of Pakistan, died on October 16, 1951, after he was shot twice in the chest while he was addressing a gathering of 100,000 at Company Bagh (Company Gardens), Rawalpindi. The police immediately shot the presumed murderer who was later identified as professional assassin Said Akbar, but the real killer remains unknown. * Harry and Harriette Moore (45 and 49) were severely injured by a bomb that exploded underneath the bedroom of their Mims, Florida, home on December 25, 1951. Harry died in the ambulance on the way to the nearest hospital that would treat African Americans; his wife succumbed to her injuries nine days later, after his funeral. They had both been active in the local civil rights movement, and investigations have concluded that was the motive for the bombing, making them not only one of the earliest martyrs to that cause but the only married couple killed for their activism in it. By the time four suspects, all senior members of the central Florida Ku Klux Klan, were identified, they had all died, and the case was closed in 1991 with no arrests. * Arnold Schuster (24), a clothing salesman who had provided the tip that led to the capture of legendary bank robber Willie Sutton, was shot dead outside his Brooklyn home a month afterwards, on March 8, 1952. Police interviewed 300 people but never identified any as a suspect, although they came to believe the killing was carried out by either the Mafia or Sutton's associates. A lawsuit against the city by his family led to a landmark state- court ruling that the state has a duty to protect anyone who cooperates with the police to the extent that they seek. * Jack Burris (35), Mayes County, Oklahoma, county attorney, was killed with a shotgun blast just outside his house in June 1952.Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation – 1950 Timeline has been the basis for several books and screenplays for over 50 years.The Mammoth Book of Unsolved Crime: The Biggest and Best Collection of Unsolved Murder and Mystery Cases Investigators were unable to obtain a tape that purported to be the killer's confession later in the decade; there have been no suspects since then. * John Acropolis (43), a New York labor leader with organized crime connections, was shot by an unknown assailant in Yonkers on August 26, 1952. * The severely beaten body of Betty Shanks (22) was found in a Grange, Queensland, garden on the morning of September 19, 1952. The largest criminal investigation in the state's history yielded no solid suspects or leads; the case remains open. * Babes in the Wood murders (Stanley Park) were two unidentified boys located on January 14, 1953, in Stanley Park, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. They were likely murdered in 1947. * On April 9, 1953, the body of Wilma Montesi (21) washed up on a beach at Torvaianica, Italy, near Rome. The investigation delved into accounts of orgies and drug use in Roman society, but no one was ever charged. Kyllikki Saari (back right) was murdered in Isojoki, 1953. Her case remains one of Finland's major unsolved murder cases. * The body of Kyllikki Saari (17), of Isojoki, Finland, was found on October 11, 1953, almost five months after she was last seen. Several suspects have been considered, but no one has ever been prosecuted. The case remains one of the country's best-known mysteries. * Alma Preinkert (58), registrar of the University of Maryland, was stabbed by an intruder in her Washington home on February 28, 1954, and died shortly afterwards. No suspect has ever been named.A University of Maryland:Culture – 50 Year-Old Mystery – University of Maryland Registrar Alma Preinkert's Murderer Was Never Found (Accessed May 2012) * Marilyn Reese Sheppard, pregnant wife of Sam Sheppard, attacked and killed in their home in Bay Village, Ohio, United States, on July 4, 1954. Sam Sheppard was convicted of killing her, but this was overturned in 1966, and he was acquitted in a new trial. He claimed his wife was killed by a bushy-haired man who also attacked him and knocked him unconscious twice. Their son slept through the night, just down the hall from the bedroom in which his mother was murdered. The trial of Sam Sheppard received extensive publicity and was called \\"carnival atmosphere\\" by the U.S. Supreme Court.Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 358 (1964) (U.S. Supreme Court) The Sheppard case was a large part of the inspiration for the 1960s television series The Fugitive and the 1993 movie of the same name. * Carolyn Wasilewski (14) was found dead in a rail yard near her Baltimore, Maryland home on November 9, 1954. The case generated nationwide media attention, and police still get calls about the case. However, no suspects have ever been named. Filmmaker John Waters says the case and the media frenzy over some aspects of Baltimore's youth culture of the time inspired his film Cry-Baby, later adapted into a Broadway musical. * Serge Rubinstein (46), a stock swindler and international playboy was found strangled in his Manhattan mansion on January 27, 1955.

She had been strangled and beaten; the investigation established that this had happened three days beforehand. Police arrested Heinz Pohlmann, a businessman and friend of Nitribitt's who had visited her that day.

The bartender and one patron died at the scene; a female customer died of her wounds a month later. Former professional boxer Rubin Carter and a friend, John Artis, were charged with the crime and convicted the following year, despite their own alibi, weak evidence and alleged racial bias by police and prosecutors. They always protested their innocence, and their case became a cause celebre, inspiring Bob Dylan's \\"Hurricane\\".

While public outrage over the killing led the government to finally suppress the protests and riots, no arrests have ever been made. * All six members of the Robison family were found shot in the head in their Good Hart, Michigan, vacation cabin on July 22, 1968; investigators established that the killings had taken place on June 25. A lengthy investigation led police to Joseph Scolaro, an employee of Richard Robison's who may also have been embezzling from him. There was much circumstantial evidence linking him to the crime, but it was not enough to charge him. Four years later the case was reopened in the Robisons' county of residence, and when Scolaro learned that he was about to be charged this time he killed himself, leaving behind a typed suicide note in which he confessed to previous thefts and swindles but protested his innocence of the Robison killings.

Red ochre powder was found sprinkled around her body, which along with the killer's lack of interest in her valuables suggested to police and the media at the time that it might have been someone familiar with her academically, since the powder was used in ancient Iranian burial rites; a possible second Boston Strangler or copycat was also suggested. No suspects were ever identified, until DNA analysis in 2018 matched that at the crime scene with Michael Sumpter, who had an arrest record that included several rape convictions; his DNA was also matched to that found at some additional unsolved rapes and murders in the 1970s. However, Sumpter had died in 2001, and although police closed the investigation there could be no prosecution, so the case will remain officially unsolved. * Edwin T. Pratt (38), then-director of the Seattle Urban League, was shot and killed outside his Shoreline, Washington, home on January 26, 1969. Despite an extensive investigation, no arrests were ever made.

Police suspected a former owner of the house who had also run a dye company that used the drum. He had reportedly been having an affair with Marroquin. The day after police interviewed him in Florida and told him they would get a court order to produce a DNA sample, he killed himself. DNA tests later showed he had fathered the fetus.

They had been reported missing on June 22 of that year, five days after last being seen. Both had been shot with a rifle. After a short investigation, police arrested Arthur Thomas, another farmer, later that year. He was tried and convicted twice, but there was evidence that police had fabricated key evidence against him. This led to an inquiring commission that severely criticized two of the lead investigators without holding them accountable otherwise, and Prime Minister Robert Muldoon pardoned Thomas in 1979. Authorities have never identified any other suspects, although two journalists have written books proposing alternative theories of the case. * Investigations have strongly suggested that Italian journalist Mauro De Mauro (49), who disappeared on September 16, 1970, was killed by the Mafia to prevent him from completing his own inquiry into the death of Enrico Mattei after he was kidnapped while returning from work in Palermo.Autopsy may solve deadly mystery of the Mattei Affair, The Independent, August 29, 1997 However, it has never been clear which of several possible motives led to his death, and his body has never been found.

In early 1972, skeletal remains of both girls were discovered in and around Clear Lake near Galveston Bay. A local man, Michael Lloyd Self, was charged with their murders in 1972 and convicted of Shaw's murder in 1975. Controversy arose in 1998 when serial killer Edward Harold Bell confessed to the murders. Bell's confession—and corroborating statements from both law enforcement and prosecutors that Self had been coerced into a false confession—led many to believe that Self had been wrongfully convicted. Self died in prison of cancer in 2000.

Another officer involved said he had seen one of the mosque's congregants, Louis 17X Dupree, standing over Cardillo with a gun pointed at his chest. Due to political complications resulting from the incident, suspects who had been in custody were not identified before being released and evidence was not collected at the scene. The detective in charge of investigating the shooting later claimed interference from senior officers impeded his efforts and procedures were ignored. Two years later, Dupree's first trial, based largely on the testimony of an informant, resulted in a hung jury and his second in an acquittal. He later served a prison sentence in North Carolina on drug charges and is currently in a Georgia prison on another charge. A later police informant in another case identified another suspect; he was never tried. Detectives who continue to investigate the case have complained that the FBI, which also had informants within the mosque, lied about what it knew in the past and is still withholding relevant information. * George Duncan (41), was an Australian law lecturer at the University of Adelaide who drowned on May 10, 1972, after being thrown into the River Torrens by a group of men believed to be police officers.

Simon and Schuster. . * Athalia Ponsell Lindsley (56), a former model and Broadway dancer, was fatally assaulted with a machete on the porch of her St. Augustine, Florida, home on January 23, 1974. The investigation centered on a neighbor she was having a dispute with at the time; he was tried and acquitted due to mishandling of the evidence. No other suspects have been named. Later that same year, on November 3 Frances Bemis, a socialite friend of Lindsley's who had reportedly been conducting her own investigation of the murder, was found with her skull crushed in the neighborhood. That case also remains unsolved. Facial reconstructions of the Lady of the Dunes. Found murdered on July 26, 1974, in Provincetown, Massachusetts * Lady of the Dunes, who remains unidentified, was found in Provincetown, Massachusetts on July 26, 1974.

She had been beaten and sexually assaulted before her death but not raped; an ice pick found lodged into the base of her skull during the autopsy turned out to be the murder weapon. David Berkowitz, the \\"Son of Sam\\" serial killer, told investigators he had heard details about the killing from another inmate purportedly linked to the Manson family, but they ultimately discounted his information. In 2018, DNA tests led police to Stephen Blake Crawford, the security guard who had found Perry's body, but he shot himself when officers arrived at his house to arrest him. * Writer Donald Goines (37), and his wife Shirley Sailor, were found shot dead in their Detroit apartment on October 21, 1974.

One of the original searchers said the bodies had not been where they were found; police find his story credible. Dwain Lee Little, of nearby Ruch, who was on parole from a previous rape and murder conviction at the time and is currently serving consecutive life sentences for an attempted murder of a mother and her infant child, is considered a suspect due to circumstantial evidence but it has not been enough to support charging him with the crime. True-crime writer Ann Rule's 2009 book about Little, But I Trusted You, goes into the case. * Sam Giancana (67), a longtime leader of the Chicago Outfit, was shot and killed in his kitchen on June 19, 1975, shortly before he was to testify before a Senate subcommittee investigating possible CIA and Mafia collaboration in plots to assassinate John F. Kennedy over a decade earlier. This has led to much speculation as to who wanted him dead, with the actual shooter believed to be someone Giancana knew well. However, no charges have ever been brought in the case. * On June 23, 1975, the body of brothel keeper Shirley Finn was found shot dead in a parked car in South Perth, Australia. No suspects have ever been identified; the investigation is continuing. *Barbara Colby (36) and James Kiernan (35), both American actors, were shot to death while walking to his car in Venice, California, on July 24, 1975. Colby died instantly, but Kiernan was able to describe the shooting to the police before he also died from his wounds. He said the shooting occurred without reason or provocation and said that there were two gunmen whom he did not recognize. There was no attempt at robbery, and the killers and their motivation are still unknown. * Claude Snelling (45), a journalism professor at College of the Sequoias in Visalia, California, was shot and killed by an intruder in his home on the night of September 11, 1975, after discovering the man trying to kidnap his teenage daughter.

On October 25, 1975, Herzog, then editor in chief of TV Cultura, was tortured to death by the political police of the military dictatorship, which later forged his suicide. Over 37 years later, his death certificate was revised to say that Herzog had in fact died as a result of torture by the army at DOI-CODI. His death cause remains unknown and had a great impact on the Brazilian society, marking the beginning of the redemocratization process of the country. *Pier Paolo Pasolini (53) was an Italian film director, poet, writer, and intellectual, who also distinguished himself as an actor, journalist, novelist, playwright, and political figure. He remains a controversial personality in Italy due to his blunt style and the focus of some of his works on taboo sexual matters. On November 2, 1975, he was murdered on the beach at Ostia. He had been run over several times by his own car. Multiple bones were broken and certain body parts were crushed by what appeared to be a metal bar. An autopsy revealed that his body had been partially burned with gasoline after death. The case remains unsolved. *When Harlem businessman Wesley Diggs returned to his Teaneck, New Jersey, home on the afternoon of December 6, 1975, he found the bodies of his wife and four children, shot sometime after he had left for work that morning.

It is the largest mass killing in the history of Bergen County. *The 1975 LaGuardia Airport bombing occurred on the evening of December 29, 1975, at the TWA baggage claim at New York's LaGuardia Airport, killing 11. It has been suspected that Croatian nationalists were behind it, due to a similar bomb found at Grand Central Terminal a year later, but the group responsible for that event has denied responsibility for the earlier attack. Officially it remains unsolved. *All 81 aboard died on January 1, 1976, when a bomb exploded on Middle East Airlines Flight 438. No suspects were ever identified. *Joseph Barboza (43), a former operative with Boston's Patriarca crime family, was killed by four shotgun blasts at close range on February 11, 1976, while walking back to his car after visiting a friend's San Francisco apartment.

The investigation is continuing now that his identity is known. * Jim Leslie (38), a publicist and lobbyist for the government of Shreveport, Louisiana, was shot fatally in the parking lot of a Baton Rouge hotel July 9, 1976, on his way to celebrate a legislative victory. Shreveport's public safety commissioner, George W. D'Artois, was charged with ordering the murder but died before he could face trial. No one has ever been identified as the actual gunman. * World War II German colonel Joachim Peiper (61), who led the troops responsible for the Malmédy massacre as a member of the Waffen-SS, was defending his home in Traves, Haute-Saône, in eastern France, from unidentified vigilante attackers on the night of July 14, 1976, when he died of what is believed to have been smoke inhalation. His badly- burned body was identified by a fellow veteran of the Wehrmacht who lived nearby; the circumstances of his death and autopsy have led to allegations that he faked it. * Seewen murder case: 5 people were shot with a Winchester rifle during Pentecost weekend 1976 in a weekend house near the Swiss village Seewen. The main suspect, owner of a Winchester, was Carl Doser, who disappeared without a trace in 1977. The Winchester used for the crime was found in 1996 in Carl Doser's mother's former appartement.

Cullen Davis, entered her house disguised with a wig on August 2, 1976, and fatally shot her 12-year-old daughter Andrea Wilborn, then ambushed her and her boyfriend Stan Farr as they returned home, also killing Farr. A judge had just granted her an increase in the support payments Davis owed her. He was indicted only in Wilborn's death, making him the wealthiest person to ever be tried for murder in the United States; at trial he was acquitted although Farr's children settled a wrongful death suit they brought against him. A few years later Davis was also tried and acquitted on charges he had conspired to have Childers and the judge murdered. Both cases have been the subject of books. * Susanne Lindholm (25) was found raped and strangled in the basement of her Käpylä, Helsinki apartment building on August 8, 1976.

Her identity, and that of her killers, remain unknown. *Dallas police officer Robert W. Wood, 27, was fatally shot during a traffic stop in the early hours of November 28, 1976. Randall Dale Adams was initially convicted of the murder and almost executed. Errol Morris's 1988 documentary film The Thin Blue Line re-examined the case and suggested that another Texas inmate, David Harris, who had testified against Adams, was the more likely suspect after a taped statement from Harris at the end of the film that implicated him. Harris recanted his trial testimony at Adams' habeas corpus hearing, which resulted in the charges against Adams being dropped, freeing him. But Harris never explicitly confessed to the crime before his own execution for another murder in 2004, leaving the killing officially unsolved. *Beth Doe is the name given to an unidentified young European-American woman who was found murdered on December 20, 1976, in White Haven, Pennsylvania. The brutality of the crime, the fact that she was pregnant when she was killed and the length of time that she has remained unidentified created national attention. Beth Doe is believed to have been an immigrant from a Central European country. In September 2019, a potential identity was announced as runaway Madelyn Cruz, last seen between 1974 and 1976, who may have been pregnant around the time of Beth Doe's murder. * The stabbing deaths of Suzanne Armstrong and Susan Bartlett occurred on January 10, 1977, in Collingwood, Victoria, Australia. These murders have been linked to the disappearance of a North Melbourne woman two years earlier. However, no suspect has ever been named. * Frank Bompensiero (71), a longtime Mafia contract killer, was himself shot and killed on February 1, 1977, while making a phone call in the Pacific Beach neighborhood of San Diego, California.

While it is certain that the German left-wing terrorist group RAF was responsible, the identity of the killer has not been established. Even though four RAF members (Christian Klar, Knut Folkerts, Günter Sonnenberg, and Brigitte Mohnhaupt) were formally charged and prosecuted, important details of their involvement have not been solved. German authorities have so far been unable to find out who was driving the motorcycle and who was firing the weapon. *Septic Tank Sam is the nickname given to an unidentified murder victim who was found in a septic tank thirteen kilometers west of Tofield, Alberta on April 13, 1977. Authorities suspect he wasn't from Alberta, but most likely worked as a migrant worker. His case remains unsolved. * On May 13, 1977, Mickey Spillane (42), head of the Westies, the last major Irish-American criminal organization in New York City, was killed outside his Queens apartment. It is believed one of his underlings ordered the crime to take control of the organization from him, but police have never formally suspected anyone. * Javier Ybarra Bergé (63) was a Basque industrialist, writer, and politician from Bilbao. On May 20, 1977, Javier Ybarra was kidnapped by renegade members of the Basque separatist group ETA, who entered his home in disguise, bound and gagged members of his family, and took him away in an ambulance.

Her father, the letterbomb's intended target, had been one of the few doctors at his hospital not on strike; another nonstriking doctor received that day a similarly rigged package that did not detonate. A connection to that was investigated but no suspects were identified. Later investigations have suggested some of Dr. Grech's students may have been responsible, and provided clues about the bombers. In 2010 a court ordered the Maltese government to compensate the Grech family for the loss of their daughter. * On January 8, 1978, a shot through the window of his home in a suburb of the South African city of Durban killed anti-apartheid South African philosopher Rick Turner (35).Thinking More Than The State Allows: Radical Politics In These Troublingly Quiet Times, Taylor Sparrow, Institute for Anarchist Studies, 2011 An extensive investigation at the time turned up no suspects, and none have been named since, although it is widely believed that he was murdered by the security forces due to his activism. * Denise McGregor (12) was abducted on her way back from doing errands in the Melbourne suburb of Pascoe Vale on the evening of March 20, 1978. Her body was found the next day, raped and with injuries so brutal the pathologist likened them to those suffered by victims of plane crashes. Robert Arthur Selby Lowe, convicted of the 1991 murder of Sheree Beasley, was suspected until DNA evidence eliminated him. The case remains open. * The Pemiscot County Does were found murdered on June 17, 1978. Although both were found in different states, they are believed to have been killed by the same person, as they were both seen together before their murders.

Crane had allegedly called his friend John Henry Carpenter the night before to tell him their friendship was over. Crane was involved in the underground sexual scene and filmed his numerous escapades with the help of Carpenter, who was an audio-visual expert. Police reportedly found blood smears in Carpenter's car that matched Crane's blood type, but no charges were filed against Carpenter for more than a decade. When he was charged in 1994, he was acquitted. Carpenter maintained his innocence until his death in 1998, and the case is now officially cold. *Nancy Spungen (20) was the American girlfriend of English Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and a figure of the 1970s punk rock scene. On October 12, 1978, Spungen was found dead in the bathroom of the couple's room, of a single stab wound to the abdomen.

An autopsy revealed there were no drugs in her system. She is believed to have been murdered by a man who is thought to have killed other females in the same area. * The Burger Chef murders of four employees of that restaurant outside Speedway, Indiana, on November 17, 1978, have never been solved despite extensive investigation. * Ten guests, mostly visiting Canadians, died in a November 26, 1978 fire at a Holiday Inn in Greece, New York, outside Rochester.

They remained unidentified for 36 years and no suspects have been named in the case. * Shortly after a private meeting with Cambodian dictator Pol Pot on December 22, 1978, British Marxist academic Malcolm Caldwell (47) was shot and killed by unknown assailants at the Phnom Penh guest house where he was staying\\"Lost in Cambodia\\", The Guardian, January 10, 2010 with two Western journalists, the first allowed to visit the country since Pot's Khmer Rouge had taken power three years before. Three days later, Vietnam invaded Cambodia, forcing the Khmer Rouge from power and exposing their genocide, reports of which Caldwell had been one of the most forceful deniers of in the West. His killing is believed to have been an inside job since he and his companions were under heavy guard the whole time they were in the country. It is believed that either Pot had him killed over a disagreement (although he reportedly returned from the meeting in very high spirits) or that anti-regime subversives did it in preparation for the Vietnamese invasion, to eliminate one of the Khmer Rouge's most passionate defenders abroad. * On January 6, 1979, the bodies of the four Tan children were found in their family's apartment in the Singapore neighborhood of Geylang Bahru, stacked on top of each other after they had been extensively stabbed and slashed with a knife and chopper. Police believe the killer or killers had planned the crime for some time and knew the family, as a Chinese New Year card sent a month after the crime used personal nicknames and seemed aware that the couple could not have more children. However, no suspects have ever been identified. * Adolph Dubs (58), then U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, who had been kidnapped by militants, was found to have been shot in the head at close range on February 14, 1979, after an abortive rescue attempt by Afghan police. The investigation of the crime was perfunctory; who the kidnappers were, and which of them killed Dubs, has never been determined. U.S. authorities came to believe that the Soviet KGB was behind the murder, and documents released from the Mitrokhin archive in the 1990s, after the Soviet Union collapsed, have lent some support to these allegations; the Soviets in turn accused the CIA of having done it to discredit them. In the wake of the killing the U.S. began disengaging from Afghanistan and more openly supporting opponents of the government, setting the stage for the Soviet invasion of the country later that year. * Actor Victor Kilian (88) was beaten to death during a burglary of his Los Angeles home on March 11, 1979. No arrests have ever been made. * Carlos Muñiz Varela (25), a Cuban refugee in Puerto Rico who supported independence movements on the island, was shot dead while driving to his mother's house in Guaynabo on April 28, 1979.

Documents released in 2012 by the FBI suggest the Cuban exile Julio Labatud may have been involved. * Perry County Jane Doe was found on June 20, 1979, in Perry County, Pennsylvania. Her body has never been identified. Isotope tests indicate she may have originated in the Midwestern part of the country, or perhaps Southern Canada. In the months preceding her death, she may have spent time in the Southwest and later died in Pennsylvania. * Raymond Washington, original founder of the South Central Los Angeles street gang that came to be known as the Crips, was murdered on August 9, 1979. Washington was shot dead at the age of 25 when he walked up to a car on the corner of 64th and San Pedro streets in Los Angeles. At the time of his death, Washington no longer had any real control over the gang he founded. He wanted to unite warring gangs in peace and had always opposed guns. Different theories exist on why he was killed and who did it but no one was ever arrested for his murder. * Ronald McPherson and Don Rose were found shot to death on August10, 1979 in Tuolumne County, California. No arrests have been made. * Sahara Sue's body was found on August 14, 1979. She was never identified although she wore dentures at a very young age.

Antonio Caponigro, one of Bruno's underlings, is believed to have ordered the killing over a drug dispute; since the murder had not been sanctioned by the Commission, Caponigro himself was reputedly killed on its orders within a month. However, no suspects have ever been identified as having actually shot Bruno. *Óscar Romero, the fourth Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Salvador, El Salvador, was killed by a shot to the heart on March 24, 1980, while celebrating Mass at a small chapel located in a hospital.

Niall Molloy (52), a Catholic priest, was found beaten to death in the master bedroom of Kilcoursey House in Clara, County Offaly, Ireland on July 8, 1985.

Richard Flynn, the owner and a longtime friend of Molloy's, confessed the killing to the garda but, at trial, the judge granted the defense a directed verdict of not guilty after merely four hours, believing the medical evidence insufficient to support a manslaughter charge. A coroner's jury later found that Molloy died of head injuries, which led to calls to reopen the case. In subsequent years, it emerged that the investigation had been perfunctory, leaving much evidence unexamined and witness uninterviewed; a 2011 review of the surviving medical evidence found it highly likely that Molloy had survived his injuries for several hours, which raised the question of why emergency services were not called until after he was dead. In 2015 the Irish government declined to open a review, since many of the original witnesses had since died and it did not think any new information would be obtained; Molloy's relatives felt otherwise. *Tscherim Soobzokov (61), was a Circassian man accused of collaborating with the Third Reich during the invasion of the Soviet Union and serving as a Waffen-SS officer.Name on SS Officers listing Soobzokov denied these charges and sued CBS and The New York Times.

It has been speculated that the Israeli Mossad was behind his death, as they may have believed his work for Saddam Hussein's Iraq might allow that country to develop weapons that could be used against their country, after he had refused to work with Israel. Other theories have implicated Iraq itself, Iran, the U.S. or other countries he was known to have dealt with.

Despite a massive search of the mountain and surroundings, their bodies were not found until 2002, after an anonymous phone call led police to an area that had already been searched near the boys' village. At first, it was theorized that they had died of exposure, a conclusion disputed by their families since the boys knew that area well and their clothes had been tied in knots. An autopsy showed that four had died of blows to the head and the other had been killed with a shotgun. Although the statute of limitations on the case expired in 2006, police continue to investigate for historical reasons. * On Monday, April 1, 1991, at 23:30, Detlev Rohwedder, president of the German organization Treuhandanstalt, was shot and killed, through a window on the first floor of his house in the suburb of Düsseldorf-Niederkassel by the first of three rifle shots.

Her body was discovered on April 9, 1992, in Thomastown; she had been shot in the head.

The case is still open, with a second police operation, Taskforce Apollo, formed in 2010 to examine new evidence and material from the original Operation Spectrum. If the perpetrator is still alive, he would be between approximately 60 and 75 years old in 2014. The murder of Karmein Chan is still one of the most extensive and expensive investigations in Victorian history, with a combination of investigative errors and the perpetrator's precautions preventing his identification and arrest. * Ioan P.

While Valeriy Schlyafman, Talkov's one time manager, was found guilty of the murder by a Russian court, he fled via Ukraine to Israel before he could be arrested. He remains in Israel to this day, insisting he is not guilty of the crime while Israel refuses to extradite him. Schlyafman and his supporters have claimed that the KGB orchestrated the murder. Since no one has been charged and it is unclear for sure who the true killer is, the case remains unsolved. * Wilson dos Santos had served as the representative of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), a rebel group in Angola, to Portugal.Summary of World Broadcasts.

Prior to his murder, Farrokzhad had been involved in producing an opposition radio program and reportedly received death threats. In his show at the Royal Albert Hall in London, he had criticized Ruhollah Khomeini and made fun of Khomeini's obsession with sex in his Ressaleh book. He had consequently received death threats and there were concerns for his safety. * Piotr Jaroszewicz (82), a former Prime Minister of Communist Poland, was found murdered along with his wife Alicja Solska at their home in the Warsaw suburb of Anin on September 3, 1992. He had been strangled with a belt, which was still around his neck, after being beaten; his wife had been shot several times with one of the couple's hunting rifles after her hands were tied behind her back.

The case gained renewed attention a year later when O.J. Simpson's defense team successfully petitioned the court trying him for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson, his ex-wife, and Ronald Goldman, for access to the case file, on the grounds that the way in which all three were stabbed suggested the same killer. Since Goldman had worked for Cantor as a waiter, and Nicole Simpson was a regular at Dragonfly, some books about the case have raised the possibility that the three killings may also have resulted from involvement in drug trafficking. * The body of Holly Piirainen (10), was found on October 23, 1993, in the woods of Brimfield, Massachusetts.

Simpson, was arrested and charged with the crime two days later; after an eight-month trial covered heavily by the media, in which the defense argued that there had been extensive mishandling of the evidence and that some investigators were racially biased, he was acquitted.

The investigation became a political issue with opponents of the Suharto regime claiming the dictator himself or other government officials were behind it as retaliation for his reporting on their misdeeds, while the government and police suggested it had been the work of a jealous husband. A suspect arrested on the latter theory was later acquitted, protesting his innocence as his trial revealed some investigation shortcomings, among them that he had been pressured to confess. The police have declined to investigate the case further, saying their responsibility was fulfilled when they arrested the original suspect. *Nigerian businesswoman Bisoye Tejuoso (80), daughter of a former Egba tribal chief, was assassinated on September 19, 1996, during a dispute over the tribe's obaship. The killers have never been identified. *Sophie Toscan du Plantier (39), who was the wife of French filmmaker Daniel Toscan du Plantier, was found beaten to death outside her home in Toormore near Schull in County Cork, Ireland, on the morning of December 23, 1996. Former French President Jacques Chirac was a friend of the couple and gave the case national attention. The main suspect, Ian Bailey, has been questioned twice by the Irish authorities in relation to the murder, but the DPP (Director of Public Prosecutions) decided not to prosecute. In early April 2010, the French authorities issued an arrest warrant for Bailey. Later that month, the Gardaí in Ireland arrested Bailey and brought him in front of the High Court in Dublin to appeal his extradition. The court sided with Bailey in his appeal in 2012; Bailey then brought a civil suit against the Garda, alleging improprieties in the investigation, which he subsequently lost. Bailey is now expected to be tried in France for the murder during the first half of 2019. * JonBenét Ramsey (6), American girl who had competed in child beauty pageants, was found dead in the basement of her parents' home in Boulder, Colorado, on December 26, 1996, nearly eight hours after a ransom note was apparently found and she was reported missing. The coroner listed cause of death as \\"asphyxia due to strangulation, associated with\\" a broken skull and concussion. Police suspected the parents of staging the ransom note and strangulation to cover up an accidental killing by either the mother or nine-year-old brother. A 1999 grand jury recommended charging the parents with obstruction and endangerment, but the district attorney declined to prosecute. Discovery of trace DNA from an unknown male in 2003 led a new district attorney in 2008 to write an apology to the Ramseys, declaring them \\"cleared of any involvement\\". Contradictory evidence seems to support both the family and outside intruder theories, and after several independent investigations, the case is still unsolved . *Ahmad Tafazzoli (59), was a prominent Iranian Iranist and professor of ancient Iranian languages and culture at Tehran University,Philippe Gignoux, \\"TAFAŻŻOLI, AḤMAD\\", Encyclopaedia Iranica Online who was found in January 1997 in Punak, a suburb northwest of Tehran.

He was able to describe the assailant and his vehicle before dying at the scene. A sketch has been circulated, but no suspect has ever been identified. *Ali Forney (22), an advocate for homeless LGBT youth in the New York neighborhood of Harlem, was found shot dead on a street there on February 5, 1997. The case remains unsolved. *The Notorious B.I.G., an American rapper killed by an unknown assailant in a drive-by shooting on March 9, 1997, in Los Angeles, California, United States.

She fell victim to murder by strangulation by an unknown assailant; after being reported missing from home by her mother, with whom she lived, her body was discovered on March 19, 1997 in a vacant apartment in the Maruyamachō neighborhood of Shibuya, Tokyo. *On April 8, 1997, a Turkish German male Adem Bozkurt (45) was found dead in his car that apparently had crashed into a tree by a road near Bad Nauheim. The case was ruled an accident, any involvement of other parties was ruled out and Bozkurt was buried without an autopsy. However, 21 years later, after doing some tests, questioning some witnesses and finally exhuming the body and doing an autopsy on it, the police found out that Bozkurt had been shot in the neck. Investigations were resumed, but so far no definite suspect has been identified. *Jaidyn Leskie (1) was an Australian child who kidnapped and murdered on June 15, 1997. On January 1, 1998, his body was found in a lake far from his home. Despite leads, and the arrest and trial of a prime suspect, his murder remains unsolved. *Bones found on a hillside by hunters in Pisgah National Forest near Asheville, North Carolina, on September 7, 1997, were later identified as those of Judy Smith (50), a nurse from Newton, Massachusetts, who had last been seen five months earlier at a Philadelphia hotel where she was accompanying her husband at a legal conference. Cutting marks on the bones, along with slash and puncture marks on a bra found near the body, led investigators to conclude she had been stabbed to death. The case remains open. *Jane Thurgood-Dove (34), was shot outside her car, in full view of her young children, as she pulled into the driveway of her home in the Melbourne suburb of Niddrie on November 6, 1997; the killer escaped into a waiting getaway car which was found burnt shortly afterwards not too far away. Her husband and a police official believed to have been infatuated with her have been eliminated as suspects. More recently a theory has been floated that the killers were members of a local biker gang who had mistaken her for their real target, another local woman of similar appearance married to a fellow criminal. Police believe that the shooter and getaway car driver have since died of a heart attack and boating accident, respectively; they have offered the remaining participant immunity if he testifies against the man who they believe ordered the killing. * Australian organized-crime boss Alphonse Gangitano (40), the \\"Black Prince of Lygon Street\\", was found in his home dead from gunshot wounds shortly before midnight on January 16, 1998, the first of the Melbourne gangland killings. Graham Kinniburgh and Jason Moran, both of whom were believed to have been in Gangitano's home that night, were suspected. They were both murdered later themselves. No arrests have been made. The majority of Melbourne gangland killings murders are still unsolved as well, although police from the Purana Taskforce believe that Carl Williams was responsible for ten of them. * Stephanie Crowe (12) was found stabbed to death in her Escondido, California, bedroom on the morning of January 21, 1998. Since there were no signs of forced entry, police focused on and eventually arrested her older brother Michael and two friends; however, charges against them were abruptly dismissed when later lab tests found several drops of Crowe's blood on a local transient. He was tried and convicted, but the conviction was overturned on appeal and a 2013 retrial acquitted him. The Crowe family reached a legal settlement with San Diego County over the wrongful prosecution of their son. No other suspects have been named. * Vjekoslav Ćurić (40), a Bosnian Franciscan friar and humanitarian known for his work in aiding the victims of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, was murdered under unclear circumstances in Kigali on January 31, 1998.\\"Sedma obljetnica smrti fra Vjeke Ćurića , svjetlorijeci.ba; accessed March 18, 2016.

(available at Google news) * In the predawn hours of March 15, 1998, the body of Hans Plüschke (59) was found in the countryside from his car near Wiesenfeld in central Germany. He had been shot through the right eye. Since no money or valuables were taken, this led to theories that the killer or killers had intended to avenge the death of Rudi Arnstadt, an East German border guard Plüschke had killed with a similar shot during a August 14, 1962, shootout during Plüschke's service as a West German border guard, which got him sentenced to 25 years in prison in absentia by an East German court; West Germany insisted the shooting had been justified as return fire and never extradited him. Plüschke had publicly identified himself as the shooter two years earlier and reportedly received regular death threats afterwards. A Special Commission formed by the German police to investigate was dissolved a year later when it exhausted all its leads; the case remains open. * On March 25, 1998, NASCAR driver Chris Trickle (24), died of injuries sustained in a Las Vegas drive-by shooting on February 9, 1997. A quirk in Nevada law at the time meant that the gunmen could not be prosecuted for his murder, since his death had occurred more than a year and a day after the attack; it was subsequently changed. No suspects have ever been identified, and the case is considered cold. *Tristan Brübach (13) was last seen alive at Frankfurt Höchst railway station on March 26, 1998, at 3:20 pm.

In 2012, a former car thief turned state witness given immunity of prosecution came forward with the revelation that he had killed Papała. He also testified that some Polish mafia bosses had encouraged the crime. However, in 2013 the indictment against the mafia bosses was dropped due to numerous factual and logical inconsistencies. The murder of Papała remains unsolved. *Nicky Verstappen (11), was a Dutch boy who disappeared on the morning of August 10, 1998, from a summer camp he was attending in Brunssum, Limburg.

Its colorful appearance, which contrasted with native waterfowl, combined with its presence far outside of the species' native range of East Asia, led to media attention from late 2018 through 2019. Though it has a band around its leg, its origin is undetermined. Its last sighting was in March 2019. Sighting and public attention The mandarin duck was first spotted at Central Park's Pond by birder Gus Keri in early October 2018. Its appearance was disseminated by another birder, David Barrett, who operates the Twitter account Manhattan Bird Alert and was described as the duck's \\"kingmaker\\" and \\"de-facto PR spokesman\\". It quickly became a local celebrity, with the duck and the public's enthusiasm for it receiving national and international coverage, covered by the BBC, The New York Times, The Guardian, CNN, the People's Daily in China, and making front-page news as far away as the Los Angeles Times. Several vendors began producing and selling merchandise referencing or depicting the duck, turning it into a tourist attraction. The New York Times noted that it \\"[had] become an international celebrity. A living, breathing, quacking meme.\\" The Associated Press dubbed the crowd following the duck \\"the quackarazzi\\". It has also been credited with sparking broader interest in birding in New York. New York Magazine The Cut initially covered it as \\"New York's Most Eligible Bachelor\\" in its Dating section and subsequently called it \\"Hot Duck\\", while the website Gothamist named it Mandarin Patinkin, after Broadway actor Mandy Patinkin. A crowd of people gathered to watch the duck in November 2018 Not long after its initial sighting, it disappeared for almost two weeks before returning to the Pond. Whenever the duck was not seen for a period of days or when it was seen somewhere other than Central Park, it received media coverage, such as when it showed up in Brooklyn or Edgewater, New Jersey. Multiple accounts describe \\"panic\\" among birdwatchers during these times. The website Quartz set up a website dedicated to tracking whether or not it had been spotted in Central Park that day. Paul Sweet, Collection Manager in the Department of Ornithology at the American Museum of Natural History, criticized the enthusiasm for the duck. Though he credited the phenomenon with raising interest in birding, he pointed out the dangers that exotic species pose to native species in general and compared the experience of seeing an escaped duck in Central Park to seeing a bird in a zoo: \\"In British birder parlance, this is a 'plastic' duck, an escaped pet, one that can be bought online. It is not a rare bird or a first record or anything of that nature, so to me, of zero ornithological interest.\\" Even within city limits, there are several other mandarin ducks at zoos, according to AMNY. Both Sweet and WNYC News urged redirecting public interest to the many attractive native species found in New York, like the wood ducks which also frequent Central Park. Audubon editor Andrew Del-Colle echoed similar sentiments in an \\"open letter\\" to the duck, telling it that it was not \\"that special\\". Others criticized the behavior of people watching the bird for violating birding ethics by feeding it bread or trying to get it to move to where it could be seen more easily. Gothamist Jen Carlson likened its public attention to a cult, with its crowd of onlookers by the Central Park Pond \\"[taking] on an apocalyptic circus vibe on weekends. Part Audubon field trip, part Burning Man.\\" In other articles, she wrote about some of the reasons it may have become so popular, making a comparison to the role of ducks in The Catcher in the Rye, symbolizing \\"all we have that is good anymore.\\" Origin Sitting on a rock with a mallard in the Central Park Pond, with leg band visible There are small populations of mandarin ducks in the United States formed by escaped or released domestic ducks, but none near New York. Its native range is East Asia. The Central Park duck's origin is unknown, but New York is too far from its natural territories to have simply gotten lost during migration, which accounts for some other rare sightings. Observers quickly noted a band around its leg suggesting it had been captive. Zoos denied ownership, and the type of band used indicated a private owner from whom it had likely escaped. Nobody stepped forward to claim ownership, perhaps because ducks are illegal to have as pets in the city. Tom Moorman of Ducks Unlimited told the L.A. Times that it likely settled in Central Park because it was already a hotspot for other ducks. The New York City Parks Department announced that it would monitor the duck through the 2018–19 winter, and would not try to capture it unless it needed help.  Disappearance  The duck was last seen in Central Park in March 2019, leaving before the species' mating season. Despite false positive sightings and speculation that it would likely return in September, after molting season, it has not been seen . According to Barrett, \\"Before, even when he ventured to the rivers, our spies found him and posted footage. My best guess was that he flew far enough north to a small pond remote from people.\\" References External links * Category:2018 in New York City Category:2019 in New York City Category:Central Park Category:Individual waterfowl ","title":"Central Park mandarin duck"},{"id":"62520741","text":"This list of unsolved murders includes notable cases where victims have been murdered under unknown circumstances. 2000s *Gaffar Okkan (49), was a Turkish police chief who was assassinated on 24 January 2001 in an ambush in Diyarbakır, southeastern Turkey. *Jill-Lyn Euto (18), a student, was found stabbed to death in her sixth-floor apartment at 600 James St, Syracuse, NY, on 28 January 2001.

It was founded by the Rev. Dr. Pedro Bravo-Guzmán, the Rev. Peter Paul Brennan, and the Rev. Francis C. Spataro. The church is a 501c)(3) organization. On November 10, 2019, the AIELC was reorganized following the death of Bravo-Guzmán, and all existing bishops were removed from office. The current supervising bishop is the Most Rev. Rogério Sidaoui, elected on May 4, 2020. The current primary headquarters is in São Paulo, Brazil.  Theology  As a church of the Augsburg Confession, the association looks to the Bible, the Book of Concord, and the writings of Martin Luther for inspiration. The church allows its clergy and members to interpret the Scriptures as each feels led by the power and inspiration of the Holy Spirit. The church takes a quaternus position regarding the Book of Concord, holding to it only insofar as it agrees with the Holy Scriptures. The church is part of the worldwide Evangelical Catholic Community. The church endorses the Evangelical Heritage Bible and the Holy Bible from Ancient Eastern Manuscripts. Polity The polity of the association is semi-episcopal.Linder, Eileen W., editor, Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches, Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2012, p. 75. The presiding and synodical bishops oversee clergy and congregations ensuring there is no deviation from the doctrine and theology of the church and also monitor the conduct of its clergy members. While each congregation governs its own affairs, the bishops have the authority to step in to maintain the integrity of the church.  Culture  The church does not make political statements and does not participate in the so-called \\"culture war\\" which is divisive. Instead, the church takes positions on biblical issues; therefore, it is opposed to same-sex marriage, the ordination of practicing gays and lesbians, and abortions not medically necessary. The church advocates compassion towards those who engage in activities and behaviors with which it does not agree. The church supports the ordination of women.

Reed House is a historic house at 46 Water Street in Marion, Massachusetts. Built in 1886, it is a good example of a Shingle style summer cottage. In 1890 and 1891, it was rented for the summer season by former United States President Grover Cleveland. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Description and history The H.R. Reed House is located south of Marion's town center, on the west side Water Street just north of Holmes Street. It is separated from the street by a broad lawn and a low hedge. It is a two story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof and shingled exterior. A single-story shed-roof porch extends across the front, supported by clusters of round columns. The roof is pierced by three gambrel-roof dormers, the center one larger than the other two. The outer dormers have sash windows flanked by vertical stone columns, while the center one has a three-part bay window, also with flanking stone columns. The interior retains many original and elegant features, including a large Queen Anne fireplace in its great hall, a double staircase, and an elliptical dining room. The house was designed by James Kelley and built in 1886. In 1890 and 1891 it was rented by Grover Cleveland, then in between his two terms as President of the United States. It was purchased about 1892 by Henry R. Reed, an agent for the Revere Sugar Company of Boston. Reed is credited with transforming the interior to its present Colonial Revival elegance, and for the two-story turret at the rear of the house. The house remained in the Reed family through the 1940s. It is considered one of the finest examples of summer cottage architecture in Marion, and is the only one known to retain a period carriage barn.

Early life  Jason Simon was born in 1961, in Boston, Massachusetts, to parents who had emigrated from South Africa via London. His father, Morris Simon, was a radiologist and inventor, and his mother, Josephine Simon, worked in community theater and arts education, eventually creating the first Masters in Women's Studies program, at the Goddard Cambridge Program for Social Change. He is the nephew of South African writer, playwright, and director Barney Simon. He pursued undergraduate studies in literature and film at Sarah Lawrence College and Columbia University's School of General Studies, from 1979–1984. he is a 1984–85 alumnus of the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program, and earned a Masters of Fine Arts from the University of California, San Diego, in 1988.  Early career and education  Simon left his undergraduate studies in 1981 to work in Cambridge, MA, for Stuart Cody, an audio engineer associated with the ethnographic film and American Direct Cinema community there. Returning to school a year later, he finished his studies at Columbia and the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program while working as a sound recordist in independent film production, and advertising. This period resulted in his film and video projects Production Notes: Fast Food for Thought (1987), and Artful History: A Restoration Comedy (1987). He left New York City to study at UC San Diego from 1986–1988.  Exhibitions and curating  Production Notes: Fast Food for Thought was selected for the 1989 Whitney Biennial, at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. The work is a roughly 30-minute tape addressing the first-hand intentions and semiotics of high-budget television commercials that Simon had worked on. That same year, Simon premiered at the Collective for Living Cinema in New York City, together with the artist Mark Dion, their film Artful History: A Restoration Comedy, which explores the business of fine art restoration—its mercantilism and the narratives of the skilled artisans entwined in it. Later in 1989, Simon joined the staff of the newly opened Wexner Center for the Arts, at Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, working alongside curator and art historian Bill Horrigan. At the museum, he served as an Assistant Curator of film and video through 1991, while also establishing the museum's unique technological laboratory for artists to produce professional films, which was originally called the Art & Tech Residency. Following his role at the Wexner Center for the Arts, Simon began to organize video programming across institutions in Europe and New York. Programs such as \\"Downsizing the Image Factory\\" were screened at venues including Kunstverein München (1994), L'Unité d'Habitation, Firminy, France (1993), and Philadelphia Museum of Art (1995). In New York, Simon organized video programs including \\"Man Trouble,\\" at Exit Art (1994), and \\"The Talking Cure,\\" at Artists Space (1992), both New York. Much of these events consisted of video works by artists practicing at the time and capturing contemporary concerns of media, spectatorship, and activism. By the mid-90s, Simon was beginning to exhibit his own multimedia work in one-person exhibitions. In 1994, he presented \\"The Mayfair Show,\\" at the Mayfair Club and at American Fine Arts, Co., both in New York. The exhibition focused on connections between artmaking and gambling through the lens of psychoanalysis, and would travel years later to Yale Union, Portland, OR, in 2016. As part of his representation with the Pat Hearn Gallery, Simon presented three solo exhibitions, one in 1994 titled \\"Album,\\" an arrangement of large-scale polaroid photographs. His 1996 exhibition at the gallery, entitled \\"Spirits,\\" included a selection of hand-toned silver gelatin prints that depicted various sinewy, curvilinear representations of cigarette smoke. In 1998, he presented his exhibition \\"Public Address: Collapsed\\" at Pat Hearn Gallery, a tableau with stadium-scale speaker horns resting on the gallery floor. Writing in the pages of Artforum, art historian George Baker likened the exhibition to \\"a scene of catastrophe,\\" that \\"opened up a surprising number of reflections on contemporary sculptural production.\\" In the spring of 2005, Simon, along with a number of other collaborators, began to operate Orchard, a cooperatively run gallery in New York City's Lower East Side. Orchard's format was primarily to organize exhibitions of various artists by thematically connected groups, while also drawing links between different artistic generations and reintroducing lesser known historical artists or art projects. The project- space was intended to last for three years, and concluded in May of 2008. In April 2006, Jason Simon exhibited his film Vera at Orchard, which he shot in 2003. The 25-minute video work is an interview with a woman named Vera that discusses her addiction to purchasing designer clothes and accessories, and the psychology of consumerism, debt and desire. From 2003–2012, with the artist Moyra Davey, Simon organized the \\"One-Minute Film Festival,\\" an annual summer gathering in a barn in upstate New York. Each year, dozens of artists would present new films lasting sixty seconds in length. By the time of the project's conclusion, over 350 filmmakers had participated to show over 700 films. The project would spawn exhibitions and festivals celebrating the screened films, presented by institutions including the Art Institute of Chicago in 2010, and MASS MoCA in 2013. In the 2010's, Jason Simon's art would be more regularly exhibited in New York City with his representation at the gallery Callicoon Fine Arts. In 2012, he presented the exhibition Festschrift for an Archive, which focused on the now-defunct MoMA Film Still Archive headed by Mary Corliss. In a review published by The New Yorker, critic Nana Asfour categorized the exhibition as part the genre known as \\"institutional critique,\\" a \\"mode of probing the workings and assumed functions of art institutions.\\" Simon continues to exhibit at Callicoon Fine Arts, with exhibitions in 2013, 2015, and 2018. His 2015 presentation Request Lines are Open, focused on the weekly audience of DJ Liberty Green's radio show Soul Spectrum, on WJFF radio, a non-profit station with a listening area that includes the large state and federal prison population of upstate New York. Alongside his artistic practice, Simon has maintained a connection to teaching and pedagogy. Apart from his foundational efforts for the Wexner Center's Art and Technology Lab, Simon also participated in the formation of the College of Staten Island's Department of Media Culture in 2002, having worked in the university's Performing and Creative Arts department for three years prior. Since this time, he has continued teaching at the institution's Media Culture department, and has also taught courses at locales including Sarah Lawrence College, William Patterson University, and School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

The exodus was referred to as the \\"Golden exile\\" because of the mainly upper and middle class character of the emigrants. After the success of the revolution various Cubans who had allied themselves or worked with the overthrown Batista regime fled the country. Later as the Fidel Castro government began nationalizing industries many Cuban professionals would flee the island. This period of the Cuban exile is also referred to as the Historical exile, mainly by those who emigrated during this period. History 1959 - 1960 The first to emigrate after the revolution were those who were associated or worked for the old Batista regime. The U.S. embassy in Havana and consulate in Santiago would regularly grant visas to Cubans wishing to leave. By the middle of 1959 various new policies had affected Cuban life such as the redistribution of property, nationalization of religious and private schools, and the banning of racially exclusive social clubs. Those that began to leave the island were driven by them being negatively affected by new economic policies, their distaste with new national public schools, or anxiety over government supported racial integration. The government would quickly label exiles who left as \\"racists\\", discouraging Afro-Cubans to also emigrate. These conditions caused the majority of those who emigrated to be either upper or middle class, white, and catholic. Many middle class emigrants were often professionals that were tied to American companies that were nationalized. Many of the emigrants that would leave believed they would be returning soon to Cuba, believing the U.S. would soon intervene and overthrow the Fidel Castro government. Some of those exiled in the United States would organize a militant resistance to the Fidel Castro government. The 1960 United States census stated that there were over 124,000 Cubans in the United States. In response to the exodus of Cubans the U.S. government established programs to provide social services and resources to arriving Cubans. The flight of many skilled workers after the revolution caused a “brain drain.” This loss of trained professionals sparked a renovation of the Cuban education system to accommodate the education of new professionals to replace those that had emigrated.Klein, Deborah. \\"Education as Social Revolution.\\" Independent School 63.3 (2004): 38-47.EBSCO. Web. 20 February 2010. 1961 On January 3, 1961 the United States broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba and afterwards emigrants gained visas for humanitarian reasons, and after arriving in the United States they could apply for parole and gain refugee status. In April of 1961 the Bay of Pigs Invasion consisting of many militant and anti-fidelista Cuban exiles would fail to take over Cuba. Afterwards those who would choose to emigrate would view their decision as a permanent one. Fidel Castro would then term those leaving \\"gusanos\\" (worms). Growing controversy in Cuba with the nationalization of Catholic schools spurred the development of Operation Peter Pan to relocate children to the United States. 1962 During the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962, travel between the United States and Cuba became restricted. Afterwards Cuban emigration would occur using makeshift vessels illegally leaving Cuba. From 1959 to the end of open travel in 1962 around 250,000 Cubans left the island. Characteristics Demographics Researcher Jorge Duany claims the majority of exiles were urban, middle-aged, well- educated, light-skinned, and white-collar workers, who emigrated primarily did so for religious, or political reasons. He also claims that while the first emigrants left because they were old Bastianos, those after left because of disillusionment with the new government and because economic reforms and nationalizations of American companies had harmed their professions. Researchers Irving Louis Horowitz and Jaime Suchlick have claimed about half of those who emigrated were blue collar workers and many of those were agricultural workers and fishermen. They also proposed many left because of Cuba's new rationing system and mandatory military service. Horowitz and Suchlick claim that while most emigrants were not involved in militant movements a majority did financial support them until later becoming disillusioned after the failures of such movements. Emigration process and settling Cubans who requested exit permits would be fired from their job if they worked for a government enterprise. Officials from Committees for the Defense of the Revolution would take inventory of all property of the applicant emigrant, once inventoried the applicant could not sell or give away any of their property. All property and money would be confiscated from them when finally leaving the country, and most exiles left with only a suitcase of clothing in their possession. By 1960 the United States had established the Cuban Refugee Emergency Center which supplied exiles with food, money, clothing, medical aid, adult education, and plane tickets to locations that had humanitarian organizations that were caring for new arrivals. Once in the United States many exiles adopted blue-collar jobs. The notably affluent majority of exiles had now become mostly middle or lower class. In Miami discrimination was still commonplace towards Cuban immigrants and many were barred from renting certain properties or membership in trade unions. This discrimination helped foster the Cuban community of Little Havana, where Cubans could remain close to Catholic churches and school's offering charitable aid. Many exiles' were able to use already attained professional skills to eventually better their occupations, and contribute to building Miami's Cuban business enclave. \\"Golden exile\\" identity The identity of \\"golden exile\\" has been used in Cuban-American circles as an identity to distinguish Cuban Americans who are seen as racially white and exuding conservative values as compared to Cuban Americans who came later in the Cuban exile who may have darker skin. The term \\"golden exile\\" has also been used in discussions involving immigration as a term to glorify Cuban immigrants as anti-communist political refugees and productive members of the middle class. This term has spurred controversy due to statistics countering this image.

Life and career  Born Geoffry Frank Laundon on 7 May 1938 in Kettering, England to parents Frank and Marjorie, Laundon was educated at the University of Sheffield, receiving a B.Sc. honours degree (second class, 1st division) in Botany in 1959. Later in 1959 he became an assistant mycologist (later mycologist) at the Commonwealth Mycological Institute and specialised on rust fungi. In 1963 he married Margaret Keay Cox, and over the next several years had three children with her. In 1965 he emigrated to New Zealand and became mycologist at the Plant Health & Diagnostic Station at Levin, New Zealand and continued to research the taxonomy and nomenclature of rusts.  Gender transition  In 1977, in a highly unusual step at the time, Laundon publicly announced her gender transition in a scientific journal, taking the name Gillian Fiona Laundon, while still continuing with her research. Throughout this transition she had the support of her wife and their children and colleagues. In later years now known informally as Gillian Cox she (with her wife) set up an information and support service for transsexuals called \\"Transformation\\".  Scientific contribution  Laundon specialised on rust fungi (Urediniomycetes), first publishing new species in 1963. Among his most important contributions was a new system of spore terminology published in 1967, which was controversial at the time but was generally accepted by the time of her death. Laundon was an active member of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy and was on the Special Committee for Fungi and Lichens for a number of years, served on four international committees dealing with fungus nomenclature, and was invited to investigate the nomenclature of rust genera and write a chapter for Index Nominum Genericorum. Laundon was the first to realise there were two species involved when the poplar rusts were first found in New Zealand in 1972, a claim not verified until samples of the spores were examined with an electron microscope. She made significant contributions to the known plant pathogens in New Zealand, publishing many first reports of fungal diseases. Laundon's interests were broader than just mycology. She designed and built a light meter that could be used for taking photographs through a microscope, and light incubators for a mycology laboratory, as well as learning to programme computers. Over her career she collected at least 211 specimens and identified 539 that are in formal herbaria or culture collections. She also had the species Phoma laundoniae named in her honour.

Burnham (1855–1941) was an American educational psychologist, who was a major advocate for promoting good mental hygiene in the education system. He defined this as taking measures to prevent mental problems or disorders to help students learn more effectively. Biography William H. Burnham was born in Dunbarton, New Hampshire in 1855. He received his bachelors’ degree from Harvard in 1882 ,and his doctorate from Johns Hopkins in 1888. He was then recruited by Stanley G. Hall to teach at Clark University, where he stayed until he retired in 1926. Burnham and Hall worked closely with each other at both Johns Hopkins and Clark \\\\,, studying the education system and development of children. America was recovering from the Civil War and was in the core of the second industrial revolution while Burnham was in school. During this time there was an increased demand for better education. People were upset and dissatisfied with how secondary schools and colleges were only focusing on producing diplomas and not ‘capable men’. As a result, there was a shift in education to focus on the individual development of the student and not just the information they were learning. Since this was Burnham’s area of expertise, he was inspired to study and observe this situation to help improve the education system. He wrote numerous books about how to improve the education system, and how the student as a whole should be the primary concern of teachers and the school. Contributions William H. Burnham observed how secondary schools and colleges were primarily concerned about the scholarship product of an individual, and not on how the individual was personally growing. He created guidelines and principles to create a new path of education. He wrote his notes, results, and conclusions into published books and articles. Some of these books are: The History of Education as a Professional Subject, Bibliographies on Educational Psychology, The Normal Mind, and The Group as a Stimulus of Mental Activity. Throughout these books, it is easy to understand that Burnham saw hygiene as a basic and necessary component of education. In these books explained how mental hygiene could be improved and how to achieve it so that all students are successful. Burnham said that the first step to improvement in mental hygiene is to educate the teachers on the principles of mental health and how to teach it to children. He was determined to teach educators that their main goal should be to promote good mental hygiene in their students and not only focus on their education. Through a questionnaire he gave to students, teachers, and school administrators, Burnham found that teachers also suffered from poor mental health. He identified that the cause was a lack of knowledge and the fact that they had too many students in their classes. He concluded that a reduction in class size, proper training on mental hygiene, and additional time to give their attention to the subject would result in better mental health for both teachers and students. Once the teachers were better equipped to teach and promote good mental hygiene in students, schools could then emphasize mental hygiene and implement actions to make it happen. In one of his books, The Hygiene of Home Study, Burnham states that giving children work to do at home hinders the child’s individual growth. He explains how home is a place where a child is supposed to explore and develop their individual personality, sending home assignments will result in poorer mental hygiene since they have inadequate time to develop and focus on themselves outside of school. He also highlighted how homework negatively effects performance of the work being done, which he mentions in The Hygiene of Home Study but goes into more detail in The Group as a Mental Stimulus. Burnham explains how studies have shown that individuals perform better when working in a group setting, compared to alone. This suggests that a student’s results from home study are inferior to the results achieved if completed in a classroom with peers. Another issue Burnham addressed in his most cited book, The Normal Mind, was that to have good mental hygiene, one must have maximum freedom. He explains that everyone is born with good mental health and it is the environment they grow up in, along with their parent’s behavior, that can cause it to deteriorate. He recommends that society, and more specifically parents, should actually take a step back from their kids and let their children make decisions for themselves because control hinders development and good mental health. Leave children alone and stop trying to ‘ruin’ childhood with adult problems and issues, instead allow them to develop naturally. Lasting effects Burnham was a major advocate and publicist for mental hygiene. He was a pioneer and huge supporter of mental hygiene, so his death was a major loss.

River; * east side: Belle Truite Lake, Cran Rouge Creek, Malbaie River, Porc-Épic River, Moreau Lake, Martres River; * south side: La Cruche Lake, Chenard Lake, Cows Creek, Ha! Ha! River; * west side: Ha! Ha! River, Myel Lake, Cinto Lake, Goéland Creek, Rivière à Mars Nord. La Cruche River rises at the mouth of Pimpant Lake (length: ; altitude: ) in the southwest corner of the township of Lalemant. The mouth of this lake is located at: * northeast of the Ha! Ha! River; * southwest of Michta Lake; * west of Belle Truite Lake; * south of Little Ha! Ha! Lake; * northwest of \\"La Cruche Lake\\"; * northwest of the confluence of the \\"rivière à la Cruche\\" and the Malbaie River. From its source (Pimpant Lake), the Cruche river descends on in forested and mountainous areas, with a difference of according to the following segments: * easterly curving southeast to the outlet (coming from the west) of Lake Myel; * southeasterly by collecting a stream (from the northwest) to the outlet (coming from the northeast) of the Petit lac à la Cruche; * southeasterly to a creek (coming from the northwest); * southeasterly to the outlet (coming from the south) of La Cruche Lake; * easterly forming a curve to the south, to its mouth. The \\"rivière à la Cruche\\" flows into a swirl zone on the west bank of the Malbaie River. This confluence is located at: * downstream of the mouth of the Porc-Epic River; * northeast of the mouth of La Cruche Lake; * northeast of the Ha! Ha! River; * west of lac des Martres; * southeast of Little Ha! Ha! Lake; * west of downtown Clermont; * west of the confluence of the Malbaie River and the St. Lawrence River. From the confluence of the La Cruche River, the current flows down the Malbaie River over to the northeast, south, and south-east, which flows on the northwestern shore of the St. Lawrence River.  Toponymy  The toponym \\"Rivière à la Cruche\\" is indicated on the draft \\"Lac des Martres\\", 1961-09-25, item 84. This name was approved on 1963-07-03 by the Quebec Geography Commission. The toponym \\"Cruche River\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Bank of Place Names of the Commission de toponymie du Quebec.Commission de toponymie du Québec - Bank of Place Names - Toponym: Cruche River  See also  * Charlevoix, a MRC * Lac-Pikauba, Quebec, an unorganized territory * La Malbaie, a municipality * Laurentides Wildlife Reserve * Grands-Jardins National Park * Hautes-Gorges-de-la-Rivière-Malbaie National Park * Malbaie River * St. Lawrence River * List of rivers of Quebec  Notes and references  Category:Rivers of Capitale-Nationale Category:Charlevoix Regional County Municipality Category:Laurentides Wildlife Reserve ","title":"Rivière à la Cruche (Malbaie River tributary)"},{"id":"62521267","text":"Israil Madrimov (born 16 February 1995) is an Uzbek professional boxer.

Madrimov dropped his opponent in round three en route to a sixth-round technical knockout (TKO) victory. At the time of the stoppage, Madrimov was ahead on all three judges' scorecards (50–44, 50–43, 49–45). The fight was part of the undercard for Dmitry Bivol's successful world title defence against Jean Pascal. Madrimov made the first defence of his title, again on the undercard of a Dmitry Bivol world title fight – this time against Joe Smith Jr. – on 9 March 2019 against Frank Rojas at the Turning Stone Resort & Casino in Verona, New York. Madrimov dropped his opponent in round two with a left hook. Rojas rose to his feet before the referee's count of ten, only to be knocked unconscious moments later with another powerful left hook, giving Madrimov the win via second-round knockout (KO). Two days before the fight it was announced Madrimov's promoters, World of Boxing, had signed a co-promotional deal with Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing USA. Following a sixth-round TKO win over Norberto Gonzalez in June, Madrimov defended his title for a second time against Alejandro Barrera on 5 October 2019 at Madison Square Garden, New York City, on the undercard of the Gennady Golovkin vs. Sergiy Derevyanchenko world title fight. Madrimov retained his title with a fifth-round TKO. On 15 August 2020, Madrimov fought Eric Walker in the co-main event on a DAZN-televised card in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Madrimov won the fight by unanimous decision, however there was controversy because it appeared that Madrimov had knocked Walker down and out with a legal punch in the 9th round of the fight, but referee Gary Ritter ruled that it was not a knockdown or a knockout, but rather that Madrimov had illegally knocked Walker down with his shoulder. As Walker remained down on the canvas for a minute, telling Ritter that he was dizzy, Ritter implored the fighter to get back up. After a minute, Walker stood up, stumbled into the ropes and then collapsed into the corner. Ritter gave Walker 5 minutes to recover and then restarted the fight, allowing Walker to take further punishment for 2+ rounds. Hall of Fame referee Steve Smoger admonished Ritter after the fight for not ruling a knockdown and subsequent knockout and allowing Walker to take unnecessary punishment afterward.

The work, created in an edition of three, consists of a fresh banana taped to a wall with a piece of duct tape. Two editions of the piece sold for $120,000 USD at Art Basel Miami Beach to significant media attention. Background and description Cattelan in 2012 Cattelan is known for his tongue-in-cheek art, once having created America, a fully functional golden toilet. He previously used duct-tape suspension for A Perfect Day in 1999, fastening the art dealer Massimo De Carlo to a gallery wall. For Comedian, he purchased the bananas at a Miami grocery store for an estimated 30 cents. Emmanuel Perrotin, the gallerist exhibiting the work, stated Comedian is \\"a symbol of global trade, a double entendre, as well as a classic device for humor.\\" Cattelan stated, \\"The banana is supposed to be a banana.\\" It was Cattelan's first piece of artwork for a fair in over 15 years. Reception Overall Comedian created controversy, with some writers, such as Robin Pogrebin, questioning if it was even art. The Guardian called Comedian a \\"questionably genius work ... It calls to mind the old Lucile Bluth Arrested Development gag about rich people not knowing the price of a banana\\". ArtNet wrote the piece was one of the worst of the week, and that Cattelan \\"somehow duped a group of collectors into buying bananas duct-taped to walls for $120,000 a pop. Seriously.\\" USA Today deadpanned \\"This piece of art is bananas – literally\\". Newsweek called it \\"humorous minimalist artwork\\", while ARTnews asked whether the piece was cynical or thrilling. The piece was compared to Andy Warhol's 1967 pop art fruit. CBS News reported \\"It may be the most talked-about artwork at this year's event.\\" On December 13, the New York Post featured Comedian on their cover. Purchases The piece was released in an edition of three; two were purchased for $120,000 USD at Art Basel. The selling price garnered significant media attention. One edition was purchased by Sarah Andelman, a founder of Colette. Another edition was sold to Billy and Beatrice Cox, who stated \\"We are acutely aware of the blatant absurdity of the fact that Comedian is an otherwise inexpensive and perishable piece of produce and a couple of inches of duct tape. When we saw the public debate sparked about art and our society, we decided to purchase it. We knew we were taking a risk, but ultimately we sense that Cattelan’s banana will become an iconic historical object\\". The purchased editions come with a certificate of authenticity. The banana can be replaced as needed. In August 2020 artist Damien Hirst complained to the media he was unable to purchase the piece and had offered to swap it with Cattelan for any of his own pieces; Cattelan replied with a no as the piece was sold out. Intervention After its sale, while still on exhibit at Art Basel, Georgian performance artist David Datuna ate the piece, calling the intervention Hungry Artist. The banana was replaced later that day. No legal action was taken against him, though he was asked to leave the fair. Datuna has stated \\"What we perceive as materialism is nothing but social conditioning. Any meaningful interaction with an object could turn it to art. I am a hungry artist, and I am hungry for new interactions.\\"https://www.observer.com/2020/02/david-datuna-hungry-artist- exhibition-banana/amp/ Interpretations Following the publicity the Comedian received, a number of commentators satirized or interpreted the work. Designer Sebastian ErraZuriz taped a dildo to a wall with duct tape and listed it for sale for $12,000. Cryptocurrency artist CryptoGraffiti created The Commodity, \\"which instructed collectors to find and claim a banana with a bitcoin key address carved into it\\". Actress Brooke Shields taped a banana to her forehead with blue tape and posted it to Instagram with the caption \\"An expensive selfie\\". Designer Simon Porte Jacquemus \\"created a merch opportunity when posting a duct-taped yellow version of [his] micro Le Chiquito bag.\\" Popeyes Chicken joined with the San Paul Gallery Urban Art located in Miami to create The Sandwich, a chicken sandwich taped to a white wall with duct tape; it was listed at $120,003.99 and \\"became a viral sensation in its own right\\". Multiple other brands followed suit, including the New York Mets, Burger King, Hostess, Perrier, Carrefour, Sweetgreen, Absolut, and Bobbi Brown. Removal In the morning on Sunday December 8, 2019, Comedian was removed from the fair because crowds queuing to see the piece caused enough commotion curators were afraid other art would be damaged. After the removal, the gallery released the following statement: \\"Comedian, with its simple composition, ultimately offered a complex reflection of ourselves. We would like to warmly thank all those who participated in this memorable adventure, as well as to our colleagues. We sincerely apologize to all the visitors of the fair who today will not be able to participate in Comedian\\". After the removal, Perrotin created a social media account dedicated to the piece. One of the walls featuring the piece was later vandalized with the meme \\"Epstein didn't kill himself\\", spelled \\"Epstien didn't kill himself\\", in lipstick, which was soon covered by the artfair.

Revista del Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales, 21(2), 217-293.  Discovery and naming  In 1980, geologist Francisco E. Nullo noticed the presence of sauropod bones on a hillside of the Estancia Alta Vista, south of the Centinela River in the Santa Cruz province of Argentina. He reported these finds to then-prominent paleontologist José Bonaparte. Bonaparte dug up a large sauropod cervical vertebra in 1981.

Brito, Ezequiel Iganacio Vera, Valeria Susana Perez Loinaze, Mariela Soledad Fernández and Leonardo Salgado. The large number of authors is a consequence of the fact that the article described the entire fauna in which every expert contributed his part. The genus name honors Isasi and connects its name with a Latin cursor, \\"runner\\". The species designation refers to its provenance from Santa Cruz province. The holotype, MPM 21525, was found in a layer of the upper Chorillo Formation that dates from the Maastrichtian. It consists of the upper side of a left shin. Different bones from the same location were designated as paratypes. These were MPM 21526, a piece of a cervical vertebra; MPM 21527: two middle vertebrae; MPM 21528: a sacrum minus the third sacral vertebra; MPM 21529: thirty anterior, middle and posterior vertebrae of different individuals; MPM 21530: the bottom of a right shoulder blade; MPM 21531: the lower end of a left humerus; MPM 21532: the main body of a left pubic bone; MPM 21533: a set of young animals of which the upper side of a right thigh bone, three upper sides of a left thigh bone, three lower sides of a left thigh bone and two shafts of a thigh bone; MPM 21534: the lower end of a tibia; MPM 21535: the ends of a second metatarsal; MPM 21536: the lower end of a third left metatarsal leg; MPM 21537: the ends of a fourth metatarsal; MPM 21538: the fourth metatarsal bone of a young animal; MPM 21539L: the first foot of the first toe, first foot of the second toe and the second and third foot of the fourth toe; MPM 21540: six foot claws; and MPM 21541: the second and third toes of a young animal. The finds represent at least four individuals. They are found in a layer of long and thick. The fossils are part of the collection of the Museo Regional Provincial Padre Molina.  Description   Size and distinctive features  The describers were able to identify five distinctive features. They are autapomorphies, unique derived properties. The sacrum is curved downwards. The first and second sacral vertebra are connected to each other via a pin-and-hole connection. The crista cnemialis of the tibia is thickened and highly upward excellent. On the upper surface of the tibia, the outer rear lobe has an additional protrusion that faces forward and faces. The second metatarsal has a well on the outside for the joint capsule that is higher than normal.  Skeleton  The cervical vertebra is keeled and flattened on the side. The amphicoelous vertebrae show no special details. The sacrum has six sacral vertebrae and is fairly robust. It is exceptional that the sphere curves downwards. The keeled first sacral vertebra is greatly widened sideways. The second sacral vertebra has a keel that extends into a protrusion that fits into a hole in the oval back facet of the first vertebra; their contact is normally flat. The fourth vertebra has a longitudinal trough on the underside with only a low ledge at the front. The front facet is square, the back facet hexagonal. The fifth vertebra has the same morphology from the bottom. It is again oval on the front but rectangular on the back. The sixth vertebra also sticks with a pin in the fifth. The tail vertebrae are slightly amphicoel and have length trough. Lateral ridges increase towards the rear, so that eventually a hexagonal cross-section is created. With the shoulder blade, the cavity above the shoulder joint is round and shallow, as with Gasparinisaura and Trinisaura . The front leg is relatively long but shorter than the rear leg. The corridor was probably optional two-legged: at high speed the animal walked on only the hind legs. The fact that the front leg was not used for a powerful sale is clear from the delta-detectoral comb of the humerus that is reduced to a low ledge. The outside thereof is intersected by numerous roughenings for tendons. The humerus bends outwards. Both of these characteristics are typically elasmaric. The pubis apparently did not touch the process obturatorius of the Ischium which means that the foramen obturatum is not closed but open downwards. For the femur, the trochanter major at the top is convex and on the inside separated by a groove from the front narrow trochanter minor. The front groove is not well developed between the lower joint nodules. The inner nodule is not widened outwards. With the tibia, the upward widening of the crista cnemialis, above the joint surface, gives it a triangular profile. This comb is also thickened across, with a round top. The crista lateralisis also thick, with a straight front edge. The triangular outer lobe of the upper surface has a special obliquely forward projection. The lower outer leg style has an elongated comb that forms an elevation in the middle. The inner post is not bent forward. In the young animals, all these characteristics are less pronounced on the lower part of the tibia. The second metatarsal is flattened at the top and thickened from front to back, a synapomorphy of the Elasmaria. However, the thickening remains limited. With the third metatarsal, the innermost lower joint bump is the largest. With the remarkably robust fourth metatarsal leg, the upper outer edge forms a sharp ledge; at Talenkauen, Morrosaurus and the Styracosterna this piece is completed. The bottom surface forms a parallelogram whose rear edge protrudes more inwards but is curled outwards. The toe legs are sturdy and short, also from front to back, a distracted feature. The foot claws are not hoof-shaped but sharp, albeit with a flat bottom. Phylogeny Isasicursor was placed in the Elasmaria , although without a precise cladistic analysis, so its exact relationships remain unclear. If this placement is correct, the animal is the youngest known iguanodont, and by extension, ornithopod, known from the Southern Hemisphere. Palaeobiology Isasicursor was a herbivore. The describers consider it likely that the Elasmaria lived together with the relatively larger Hadrosauroidea, with the two groups belonging in different niches, though hadrosauroids were not found at the site. The presence of Nullotitan suggests niche partitioning with giant sauropods. Isasicursor was probably hunted by an as yet unnamed member of the Megaraptoridae whose bones were found on the site. The describers saw the remains of young and old individuals being found together as evidence that Isasicursor lived in herds.

It contains a single species, Mosineia macnaughtoni. Associated trace fossil evidence suggests that this genus spent some of its time subaerially, possibly to mate and to feed on the microbial mats that blanketed the beaches. The genus is named after Mosinee---the city in Marathon County, Wisconsin, near which the fossils were found. The collecting site is known as Blackberry Hill, which is a well known Konservat-Lagerstätte that produces abundant exceptionally preserved fossils.  History of discovery The discovery of Mosineia was a milestone in geologic history. Since the mid-1800s, trackways named Protichnites (Greek for \\"first footprints\\") had been found on Cambrian beach strata in North America.

The new fossils, found in the late 1900s and early 2000s, including body fossils of the animal itself (Mosineia) and fossils linking that animal to the trackways, thus solved a mystery that had lasted over 150 years.

The holotype,MACN-PV 18644; MPM 21542, is found in a layer of the lower Chorillo Formation that dates from the Campanian-Maastrichtian. It consists of a partial skeleton without a skull. The following are preserved: a third cervical vertebra (the MACN-PV 18644 specimen found by Bonaparte in 1981), tail vertebrae, a neck rib, ribs, a left shoulder blade, the ends of a right thigh bone, a right shin, a right calf bone, and a right ankle bone. These bones were found scattered but were believed to represent one individual. In addition, various specimens were allocated. MPM 21545 is a patchy skeleton of which only a humerus, a rib and a vertebra are found. It was a hundred meters from the holotype and higher on the slope so that it is probably another individual that is also clearly smaller than the type specimen. MPM 21546 consists of separate rear tail vertebrae. MPM 21547 consists of a series of five middle tail vertebrae found in a different position. These have not yet been excavated. MPM 21548 has been found in a different position and consists of a left shin. A few meters away lay specimen MPM 21549, a front central vertebra. Eggshells and teeth of sauropods are also stored in this position. No osteoderms have been found anywhere. The fossils are part of the collection Museo Regional Provincial \\"Padre Molina\\", with the exception of the original cervical vertebra that is kept in the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales \\"Bernardino Rivadavia\\".  Description   Size and distinctive features  Nullotitan is a huge sauropod. The found remains of the holotype point to an animal of more than in length. The descriptors were able to identify some distinguishing features. Two of them are autapomorphies, unique derived properties. The anterior and middle tail vertebrae have sides and undersides that are eroded by numerous large depressions that do not pierce the bone wall. From the front or rear, the fibula has a striking, wavy bend. In addition, there is a unique combination of characteristics that are not unique in themselves. The vertebral bodies of the anterior tail vertebrae are remarkably short, twice as wide across as horizontally long. At the middle tail vertebrae there is a large trough on the side that is covered from above by the side protrusion. The tail vertebrae are not pneumatized. The middle tail vertebrae have a deep longitudinal trough on the underside bounded by two thick ridges. The lower end of the tibia is flattened from the front to the rear and widened more across than with other titanosaurs.  Skeleton  The cervical vertebra of the holotype is elongated with a length of and rather low with a height of , apart from the broken vertebral arch. The side is pierced by a large oval pleurocoel. The bottom is flat. The bone has many small air chambers internally, known as camellae. The anterior tail vertebrae have an oval anterior facet. The sides slope down steeply. The side projections are high and flattened from front to back. The first tail vertebra is approximately twenty-five centimeters long and forty wide. The hollows on the sides are randomly distributed, separated by ridges. They are elongated and run lengthwise. Perhaps there were epaxial tendons anchored in it, holding the tail up. The middle tail whirls are square in side view, have a convex cotyle at the back, a deep longitudinal trough on the underside, numerous but shallower recesses, and short conical side protrusions placed at the middle height. The Musculus caudofemoralis, the large retractor muscle that pulled the femur backwards, continued to the sixteenth vertebra. The procoal posterior tail vertebrae are elongated, flattened and with a conical cotyle. The shoulder blade shows few details. There is a bump on the inside, above the level of the acromial process, close to the front and top edges. On the inside there is also a protrusion on the bottom edge. The humerus of MPM 21545 is long. It is relatively slim, with a robustness index (RI) of 2.8. The delta-detectoral comb is relatively short with the lower edge at a quarter of the shaft length measured from above, a basic characteristic. The femur has lower joint nodules that are about the same size. The lower shaft is strongly flattened from front to back, up to . The tibia of the holotype has a length of . It is robust and extremely wide at the bottom. The fibula is . It is robust with an RI of 0.4 but not extreme. The shaft bolt outwards. The ends are strongly widened from front to back. The upper surface runs horizontally. The leg has a low rising branch and a strong widening inside.  Phylogeny  Nullotitan was placed within the Titanosauria in the Colossosauria in 2019, although its precise relationships remain unclear.

OntoLex-Lemon vocabulary  The OntoLex-Lemon vocabulary represents a vocabulary for publishing lexical data as a knowledge graph, in a RDF format and/or as Linguistic Linked Open Data. Since its publication as a W3C Community report in 2016, it serves as \`\`a de facto standard to represent ontology-lexica on the Web´´. OntoLex-Lemon is a revision of the Lemon vocabulary originally proposed by McCrae et al. (2011). Fig. 1. OntoLex-Lemon core model The core elements of OntoLex-Lemon, shown in Fig. 1, are: * lexical entry: unit of analysis of the lexicon, groups together one or more forms and one or more senses, resp. concepts. Can provide additional morphosyntactic information, e.g., one part of speech. Note that every lexical entry can have at most one part of speech, for representing groups of lexical entries with identical forms but different parts of speech, see the lexicography module. * lexical form: surface form of a particular lexical entry, e.g., its written representation * lexical sense: word sense of a particular lexical entry. Note that a OntoLex-Lemon senses are _lexicalized_ , i.e., they belong to exactly one lexical entry. For elements of meaning that can be expressed by different lexemes, use lexical concept. * lexical concept: elements of meaning with different lexicalizations. A typical example are WordNet synsets, where multiple synonymous words are grouped together in a single set. Aside from the core module (namespace http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#), other modules specify designated vocabulary for representing lexicon metadata (namespace http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/lime#), lexical-semantic relations (e.g., translation and variation, namespace http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/vartrans#), multi-word expressions (decomposition, namespace http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/decomp#) and syntactic frames (namespace http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/synsem#). The data structures of OntoLex-Lemon are comparable with those of other dictionary formats (see related vocabularies below). The innovative element about OntoLex-Lemon is that it provides such a data model as an RDF vocabulary, as this enables novel use cases that are based on web technologies rather than stand-alone dictionaries (e.g., translation inference, see applications below). For the foreseeable future, OntoLex-Lemon will also remain _unique_ in this role, as the (Linguistic) Linked Open Data community strongly encourages to reuse existing vocabularies and as of Dec 2019, OntoLex-Lemon is the only established (i.e., published by W3C or another standardization initiative) vocabulary for its purpose. This is also reflected in recent extensions to the original OntoLex-Lemon specification, where novel modules have been developed to extend the use of OntoLex-Lemon to novel areas of application: * OntoLex-Lemon Lexicography Module, published as a W3C Community Group Report, extends OntoLex-Lemon with respect to requirements from digital lexicography. * OntoLex-Lemon Morphology Module, as of Dec 2019 under development, aims to facilitate multilinguality in OntoLex-Lemon, esp., for morphologically rich languages * OntoLex-Lemon Module for Frequency, Attestation and Corpus Information, as of Dec 2019 under development,, aims to facilitate uses of OntoLex-Lemon in computational lexicography and natural language processing * Updates to LexInfo: LexInfo provides data categories for OntoLex-Lemon data. At the moment (Jan 2020), LexInfo is being updated, version 3.0 will no longer depend on the older Monnet-Lemon vocabulary.  Applications  OntoLex-Lemon is widely used for lexical resources in the context of Linguistic Linked Open Data. Selected applications include * OASIS Lexicographic Infrastructure Data Model and API (LEXIDMA), a framework for internationally interoperable lexicographic work * European public multilingual knowledge infrastructure * Lex0, a collaborative web editor used for the creation and management of (multilingual) lexical and terminological resources as linked data resources *VocBench, a web-based, multilingual, collaborative development platform for managing ontologies, thesauri, lexicons and RDF data * The Lexicala API by K Dictionaries that provides access to cross-lingual lexical data of 50 languages and 150 language pairs. * DiTMAO, a lexicographic editor developed for creating the Dictionary of Old Occitan medico-botanical terminology * a series of Shared Tasks on Translation Inference Across Dictionaries (TIAD-2017, TIAD-2019, TIAD-2020) * DBnary, RDF edition of 16 language editions of Wiktionary * PanLex, a large- scale lexical network of about 2,500 dictionaries and more than 500 languages * Princeton WordNet 3.1, a large-scale, hierarchically and relationally structured lexical resource for English * Global WordNet Association, a community effort to produce, maintain and interlink multilingual WordNets * BabelNet, a large-scale multilingual lexical network * LiLa, a knowledge base of linguistic resources for Latin based on a large lexicon consisting of a collection of citation forms OntoLex development is regularly addressed in scientific events dedicated to ontologies, linked data or lexicography. Since 2017, a designated workshop series on the OntoLex module is conducted biannually.  Related vocabularies  Related vocabularies that focus on standardizing and publishing lexical resources include DICT (text-based format), the XML Dictionary eXchange Format, TEI-Dict (XML) and the Lexical Markup Framework (abstract model usually serialized in XML; the Lemon vocabulary originally evolved from an RDF serialization of LMF). OntoLex-Lemon differs from these earlier models in being a native Linked Open Data vocabulary that does not (just) formalize structure and semantics of machine- readable dictionaries, but is designed to facilitate information integration between them.

The league name reflected the number of teams situated along the Missouri River Basin. The league roster structure evolved from having some professional players to totally being amateur. The Basin League was a pioneer of what is known today as collegiate summer baseball. Over 100 future major league players played in the Basin League, among them Baseball Hall of Fame members Bob Gibson, Jim Palmer and Don Sutton. History The league was established in 1953 with a roster of South Dakota franchises and one nearby Nebraska team. Teams in Chamberlain (Chamberlain Chiefs), Mitchell (Mitchell Kernels), Pierre (Pierre Cowboys), Winner (Winner Pheasants), as well as Valentine, Nebraska (Valentine Hearts) were the charter franchises. The league's moniker reflected the number of franchise cities situated along the Missouri River Basin. The Pierre Cowboys played in all 21 seasons of the league's existence. The Basin League began play in 1953. Rosters in 1953 were a mix of professional players and amateurs (upper high school and collegiate players). The Basin League later became exclusively amateur, evolving into what is known today as collegiate summer baseball. In 1954, the league expanded, as Huron (Huron Elks), Watertown (Watertown Lake Sox) and Yankton (Yankton Terrys) entered the league as expansion franchised. In 1955, the League ran an advertisement in The Sporting News seeking players. In the April 6, 1955 edition of \\"The Sporting News\\": \\"Class A Players Wanted - For fast semipro Basin League. Capable of playing Class A ball. Write 712 Capital, Yankton, S.D.\\" In 1958, the league split the season into two halves, with each half winner meeting for the league championship. The Basin League reverted back to full season play in 1959. As the league grew the late 1950s, a few Basin League teams were assigned a \\"'parent\\" major league club and received equipment and support. The Rapid City Chiefs were assigned to the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Sturgis Titans were assigned to the Boston Red Sox and the Pierre Cowboys were assigned to the Cleveland Indians. While a positive for those franchises, it created an imbalance in support for the other league teams without a sponsoring parent club. The Basin League roster structure changed in 1960. Teams were limited to three professional players per team. In 1961, the number of professionals per team was reduced from three to two. Then, in 1962, none were allowed. Professionals were allowed to manage. But by 1964, professional managers were also excluded. Amateur umpires were used by the league from 1953-1960. From 1962 through 1967, the Basin League received regular national coverage in the weekly publication \\"The Sporting News.\\" The Sporting News covered the Basin League, as they did with lower minor professional leagues. In 1966, the Basin League amateur talent pool was damaged when the NCAA ruled that NCAA college seniors could no longer play in the league. To keep their amateur status, most Basin League players received approximately $200-$500 for the summer season, with the pay received for working 'odd jobs' in the local communities. Players often worked for the city recreation departments maintaining public facilities and baseball fields. The Basin League ceased operations after the 1973 season. The growth of youth baseball had created conflicts for fans. The NCAA had put restrictions on the league, while at the same time, major league teams were reexamining player development resources. The four league teams remaining in the final season of 1973: Chamberlain Mallards, Pierre Cowboys, Rapid City Chiefs and the Sturgis Titans. For a time, the Basin League was touted as the best summer college league in the country. Comparable leagues included the Cape Cod League and the Alaska Baseball League.

The Chemin des Canots River crosses the eastern part of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve; it flows into a river bend on the southwestern bank of the Malbaie River facing the zec des Martres. The lower and middle parts of the Chemin des Canots River valley are served primarily by R0360 forest road and some other secondary forest roads, for forestry and recreational tourism purposes.of the Canoe Trail Open Street Map - Accessed January 19, 2019 Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector; recreational tourism activities, second. The surface of the Chemin des Canots River is usually frozen from early December to late March, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-December to mid-March.

The band is composed of Dave Gibson (vocals, drums), Daniel Gibson (lead vocals, acoustic guitar) Sarahjane Gibson (vocals, melodica, percussion), Sean McMahon (bass and backing vocals), Cameron Deyell (electric guitar and backing vocals) and Andrew McGovern (trumpet, percussion, and synth). The band has released two albums: Volume I & II (2014) and Wild (2016).  Founding and early career  Dave Gibson and his younger brother Daniel already had experience as musicians. Dave used to be the vocalist in the New Zealand band Elemeno P while Daniel was the vocalist of a pop-punk band called Kingston. Dave ran a T-shirt business and hired Daniel soon after he left the music scene to work in his company. However, both brothers routinely began to write and work on demo songs frequently. Dave, his spouse Sarahjane, and his brother Daniel, formed the band around the time they moved to New York in 2012. However, before the trio relocated to New York they played one show in their hometown. The group named their band based on the classic ballad Streets of Laredo. The band soon after also consisted of Si Moore, Cameron Deyell, and Thom Darlow. Their first single \\"Girlfriend\\" was first imagined by Daniel between the time they left New Zealand and relocated to New York. He continued working on the song once he moved to New York. The single was self-released on December 10, 2012 to positive acclaim. A music video for the track was released soon after.  Vol. I & II: from EP to debut album  In early 2013, the band traveled back to New Zealand to work and record nine new tracks which would be split into two EPs. In August 2013, the band won first prize in the adult album alternative category of Nashville's Unsigned Only Awards. On October 2013, the band won the AAA category for unsigned artists at the CMJ Music Marathon. In late 2013, they released the two EPs Vol. I and Vol. II which received positive reviews. Many changes occurred during this period like the addition of other members like Sean McMahon and Andrew McGovern. After the self-release of the two EPs, Streets of Laredo got signed on to Dine Alone Records. The band released their first EP Lonsdale Line for the label on June 10, 2014. A single track \\"Slow Train\\" released in August 2014. A single from their forthcoming debut album titled \\"Laredo\\" dropped in September 2014. The band released their first official album Volume I & II (by putting together the two EPs) on October 7, 2014 via Dine Alone Records. The reviews for the album were generally favorable.  Wild and onwards  From early to mid-2015, the band toured in America and Europe for their debut album. During these tours and concerts, Streets or Laredo began to work on new tracks for their future album Wild. They began recording demos in early 2015. A single called \\"Diamonds\\" was released on 2 June 2015. A single from the forthcoming LP titled \\"99.9%\\" was released on 24 June 2016. A unrelated single titled \\"Devil and the Sea\\" dropped on 9 July 2016. Wild was released on October 21, 2016 and was notably produced by John Agnello. The album had political, experimental, and cultural undertones which were topics that influenced the band. Wild received some positive reviews. After finishing playing and touring for Wild by early 2017, it was reported that the band would begin working on new material for a third LP.

It is a widespread and abundant understory species found on the margins of wet eucalypt forests and logged areas. Description Monotoca glauca is an evergreen, densely branched shrub or small tree with slender branches, often 2–3 m tall. Leaves are similar to Cyathodes glauca, however are not in whorls. Venation tends to be spreading or palmate, characteristic of the genus. Leaves are elliptic with a point, and are usually 1.5 cm long, with a yellowish- green, glabrous adaxial surface, and glaucous abaxial surface. Flowers are pentamerous, white and solitary in auxiliary spikes. M. glauca is usually hermaphroditic or sometimes unisexual by abortion of pollen or ovules. The corolla tube is short with spreading lobes. Flowering occurs in January and February. Fruit is an ovoid drupe, green when mature and 3mm in diameter. Monotoca elliptica is superficially very similar, but can be distinguished by its terminal spikes, and its leaves tend to be wider and less linear. Distribution and ecology Monotoca glauca is a common understory shrub at the edges of wet eucalypt forests, mixed forest, buttongrass moorlands and in logged areas, found more commonly west of Tyler's Line. Monotoca glauca is hardy to most frosts and light snowfalls, and tolerates moist, shady sites, and is susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi. It is phosphorus intolerant, but may be found on fertile, loam, poor and well drained soils. Etymology Monotoca glauca was first formally described in 1805 by Jacques Labillardière who gave it the name Styphelia glauca. It was renamed by English botanist George Claridge Druce who gave it its current binomial name in 1917. \\"Glauca\\" comes from the Greek word glaukos meaning “gleaming, silvery”. In botanical terms, glaucous refers to the greyish, bluish or whitish waxy coating or bloom that is easily rubbed off. Cultivation Monotoca glauca is an ideal hedging plant, and may be grown from cuttings or seed but requires good drainage and part to full sun.

She is the daughter of manga artist Keisuke Itagaki. Biography Itagaki began painting in kindergarten, and started drawing manga in the second grade. As a teenager she developed the character Legoshi, an anthropomorphic wolf who would later appear in her manga series Beastars. She cites Disney movies and the artists Nicolas de Crécy and Egon Schiele as among her early influences. She later attended Musashino Art University, where she studied filmmaking. She continued to pursue manga as a hobby while in university, creating dōjinshi that she would sell at dōjinshi conventions. After being unable to find a job in the film industry, Itagaki submitted her dōjinshi to editors at the publishing company Akita Shoten, which began publishing her short story collection Beast Complex in Weekly Shōnen Champion in 2016. That same year, Weekly Shōnen Champion began serializing Itagaki's critically and commercially acclaimed series Beastars. In September 2019, Itagaki's autobiographical manga series Paruno Graffiti began serialization in Kiss. Personal life Itagaki is highly private about her personal life and wears a chicken mask to obscure her face at all public appearances. Japanese tabloids reported in 2018 that Itagaki is the daughter of Keisuke Itagaki, the creator of the manga series Baki the Grappler; the claim was repeated in April 2019 by Le Monde. Itagaki confirmed these reports in a joint interview with her father in the September 2019 issue of Weekly Shonen Champion, stating that she did not wish to disclose her parentage until she was established in the manga industry in order to avoid accusations of nepotism.

Skateboarding career  Sunset Carwash kickflip In April 2015, Milton broke his leg after attempting to ollie into the Sunset Carwash bank on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California. He returned to the spot in 2019 and landed a kickflip into the bank. A photo of the kickflip was used as the December 2019 cover of Thrasher Magazine, and video of the kickflip was used as the last clip in his ¡DEMOLICIÓN! video part. Martinez was the first person to land a flip trick into the bank. Prior to his kickflip, the only other recorded tricks landed at that spot were an early-grab by John Cardiel, an ollie by Daniel Monkress for the Kre-Per Show video, and one by Jim Greco for Baker 3 in the same year. Other skateboarders had tried and failed to do tricks into the carwash bank, including Mark Gonzales who attempted an early- grab, and Dustin Dollin who attempted a kickflip.

His work has focused on insects in houses and stored foods, and especially the wintering and cold tolerance of certain arthropods. Sømme has been on several expeditions to the Antarctic, participated in field trips to Svalbard, and visited various other extreme places on Earth in his research on arthropods and cold tolerance. Sømme was the editor of the Norwegian Journal of Entomology from 1966 to 1978 and he has published several books. He is an honorary member of the Norwegian Entomological Society. Since 2011, Sømme has been responsible for invertebrates in the Great Norwegian Encyclopedia. Sømme taught entomology at University of Oslo, from introductory courses upwards. Part of his teaching took place at the field station at Finse and in Ny- Ålesund. Sømme retired in 1998. He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. He was formerly married to the biochemist Randi Sømme. Research Sømme received his candidatus realium degree from the University of Oslo in 1958 with a thesis on insecticide resistance (DDT) in houseflies (Musca domestica). Sømme found that there were not many houseflies in Norwegian barns. However, there were many other species of flies, such as cluster flies (Pollenia sp.) and blood-sucking parasitic stable flies (Stomoxys calcitrans), a biting fly related to the tsetse fly. Both of these and the houseflies were resistant to DDT. After completing his degree, Sømme began working as a fellow at the Norwegian Plant Protection Office (Statens plantevern) in Ås. He remained there for 12 years, working especially with insects in houses and stored food, and insect resistance to insecticide. In 1962, Sømme spent a year in Canada studying cold tolerance in insects at the Canada Agriculture Research Station in Lethbridge, Alberta. Sømme's 1967 dissertation was on cold tolerance in insects. In 1970, Sømme changed his workplace from the Plant Protection Office to the University of Oslo, where he became a lecturer in entomology. Later, in 1985, he was appointed a professor of the subject. He continued his studies on the cold tolerance of beetles, springtails, and mites. Especially useful for him was the recently established research station at Finse. Cold tolerance was studied in mites and springtails on windblown and snowless ridges in the high mountains. It was determined that the leaf beetle Chrysomela collaris has a supercooling point (minimum lethal temperature) at before the body fluid freezes and the animal dies. At Finse, it was also discovered that the ground beetle Pelophila borealis can be completely frozen in ice over an extended period. The beetle's supercooling point is just , but this is probably enough because it winters under snow, which insulates it. The places it overwinters are sometimes damp and wet, and the beetle may risk freezing completely in ice. It was observed that it can survive in an environment without fresh oxygen (anoxia). Since 1977, Sømme has participated in several research expeditions to the Antarctic, where he studied arthropods (mites and springtails) on Bouvet Island and in Queen Maud Land. The fauna there have the same survival mechanisms as Sømme had found earlier in Norway's high mountains at Finse. On Bouvet Island, there are eight to ten species of mites and springtails. The island lies from the nearest continent. It lies east of the South Shetland Islands, and the wind in the area is often from the west. It is therefore natural to assume that both the flora and fauna on the island were brought by birds crossing the sea. In the Antarctic only a few species of flies have been found in addition to springtails and mites. There are some small chironomids that live in favorable locations along the coast. The largest strictly terrestrial animal (if seals and birds are not considered terrestrial animals) is a springtail about long. Sømme also participated in expeditions to South Georgia Island and Signy Island. In the Andes, Sømme found a grasshopper that was able to tolerate the large temperature fluctuation between day and night. During the night, the temperature was and the insect froze. In the morning, it thawed out and lived normally. The daytime temperature could be over . Lauritz Sømme has made shorter trips to several places in the world to study arthropods' cold tolerance, including the Atlas Mountains and Mount Kenya in Africa. He has also spent time on Svalbard since 1988, where he helped determine that some animals can become desiccated in the fall. When the cold weather comes, they have so little water in their bodies that they survive until the spring without frost damage, and then in the spring the body's fluid content increases again. This strategy is used by some potworms and the Arctic springtail Onychiurus arcticus. Author Lauritz Sømme has translated several books and much research literature into Norwegian. He has written several books and many shorter articles about his subject area in Norwegian. As a researcher, he has contributed publications to a number of journals. Somme served as the editor of the journal Norwegian Journal of Entomology for several years and contributed articles to it. His bibliography of research publications includes 143 articles published between 1958 and May 2007. He has written 94 popular science articles.

It highlights a radical shift in information systems that will be needed to address organizational needs for storing, retrieving, moving and processing exponentially growing data sets.  Background  Traditional information system architectures are based on an application-centric mindset. Traditionally, applications were installed, kept relatively static, updated infrequently, and utilized a fixed set of compute, storage, and networking elements to cope with a relatively small set of structured data. This approach functioned well for decades, but over the past decade, data growth, particularly unstructured data growth, put new pressures on organizations, information architectures and data center infrastructure. 90% of new data is unstructured and, according to a 2018 report, 59% of organizations manage over 10 billion files and objects spread over large numbers of servers and storage nodes. Organizations are struggling to cope with exponential data growth while seeking better approaches to extracting insights from that data using services including Big Data analytics and machine learning. However, existing architectures aren't built to address service requirements at petabyte scale and beyond without significant performance limits. Traditional architectures fail to fully store, retrieve, move and utilize that data because due to limitations of hardware infrastructure as well as application-centric systems design, development, and management. Data-centric workloads There are two problems data-centric computing aims to address. * 1. Organizations need to utilize all available data but traditional applications aren't sufficiently agile or flexible. New shifts toward constant service innovation, supported by emerging approaches to service delivery (including microservices and containers) open new possibilities that step away from traditional application-centric mindsets. * 2. Existing limits of data center hardware also restricts complete movement, management and utilization of unstructured data sets. Conventional CPUs are impeding performance because they do not include specialized capabilities needed for storage, networking, and analysis. Slow storage, including hard drives and SAS/SATA solid state drives over the network can reduce performance and limit data accessibility. New hardware capabilities are needed. Data- centric computing Data-centric computing is an approach that merges innovative hardware and software to treat data, not applications, as the permanent source of value. Data-centric computing aims to rethink both hardware and software to extract as much value as possible from existing and new data sources. It increases agility by prioritizing data transfer and data computation over static application performance and resilience. Data-centric hardware and software To meet the goals of data-centric computing, data center hardware infrastructure will evolve to address massive scale, rapid growth, the need for very high performance data movement, and extensive calculation requirements. * Distributed hardware infrastructures become the norm, with data and services spread across many compute and storage nodes, both in public clouds and on-premise. * Due to the flattening of Moore's law, new processors are emerging to boost performance, reducing CPU loads by handling intensive tasks including data movement, data protection, and data security. * New technologies like NVMe drives and networking like NVMeoF will become standard components of data-centric computing architectures. As far as software goes, data-centric computing accelerates the disappearance of traditional static applications. Applications become short-lived, constantly added, updated, or removed as algorithms come and go. Software is redesigned to conduct analysis on all available data instead of subsets. Microservices visit data, conduct calculations and express the results of their process at speeds beyond conventional approaches.

It was an illustrated Catholic publication supported by the Lithuanian clergy and the professors and clerics at the Sejny Priest Seminary. The content focused on news, practical advice, and educational articles. It was the most popular Lithuanian periodical with circulation reaching 15,000 copies in 1914. The weekly supplement, Šaltinėlis, became the first Lithuanian periodical dedicated to children. First published in March 1906, the paper was discontinued in August 1915 due to World War I. It was resurrected twice: in 1926–1940 in Marijampolė and in 1961–1998 in Nottingham (United Kingdom) and Panevėžys. History When the Lithuanian press ban was lifted in 1904, Kazimieras Prapuolenis petitioned the Tsarist government for a permit to publish Šaltinis. He initially wanted to publish the periodical in Vilnius, but eventually settled in Sejny. It was the seat of the Diocese of Sejny and had the Sejny Priest Seminary, a center of Lithuanian culture, but the town did not have a printing press. Priests from the Dioceses of Sejny and Vilnius raised 20,000 rubles to establish the printing press Laukaitis, Dvaranauskas, Narijauskas ir Bendrovė and invite workers from Warsaw. In addition to Šaltinis, the printing press published several other periodicals and 257 books, mostly in Lithuanian but also in Polish, Latin, and Esperanto. The printing press was evacuated to Russia during World War I. Šaltinis was first published in March 1906 and from 1907 became the main periodical of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party. Its name was taken from a title of a popular prayer book. It was published weekly and had 16 pages with its yellow covers being used for announcements and ads. It was aimed at the general public (farmers, villagers) and published news from Lithuania, Russia, and the world, educational articles on agriculture, education, culture, Lithuanian language as well as works of fiction. Initially, it had a one-page section dedicated to religion, but it was discontinued by 1909. The newspaper published several supplements, including Šaltinėlis (little stream) for children, Vainikėlis (little wreath) for youth, Artojas (plowman) for farmers. Šaltinėlis, published from the second issue of Šaltinis, became the first Lithuanian periodical dedicated to children. It was a four-page weekly supplement that published fairy tales, poems, puzzles, tasks and games. It was an independent publication in 1911–1914. Because there were no local Lithuanian-speaking censors, Russian censors received already published newspaper. Therefore, four times (all under editor Juozas Vailokaitis) the newspaper was subject to sanctions. In February 1908, Šaltinis published news about a rumored assassination plot against the Tsar. In August 1909, the newspaper published a complaint that Russian tax officials assessed unfair taxes on cooperatives when compared to regular shops. Both times Vailokaitis was fined (100 and 75 rubles, respectively) or could choose one-month prison sentence. The third case was brought regarding an article criticizing land sales by the government to immigrant Russians which was prepared based on a speech of Andrius Bulota to the Russian State Duma. In court, Bulota personally defended Vailokaitis but he was still sentenced to three months in prison. The fourth case concerned a short story which depicted brutality of Russian policemen and prison wardens. Vailokaitis had to pay a fine of 150 rubles and spend four months in a monastery in Łomża. The newspaper competed with other Lithuanian periodicals, primarily Lietuvos ūkininkas, by lowering prices and organizing a lottery for its readers. In fall 1907, Šaltinis organized a lottery in which every subscriber was eligible to participate. The prizes were books, clocks, and large portraits of Pope Pius X. In December 1907, Šaltinis published 50,000 copies of its issues (up from 2,000 copies in 1906). Such a big jump in circulation was temporary, but the number of subscribers tripled. It became the most popular Lithuanian newspaper of the time with circulation reaching 15,000 copies around 1914. Its authors and contributors included Juozas Balčikonis, , Mykolas Krupavičius, Marija Pečkauskaitė (Šatrijos Ragana), Justinas Bonaventūra Pranaitis, Sofija Pšibiliauskienė (Lazdynų Pelėda), Jonas Totoraitis, Justinas Staugaitis. In total, Šaltinis published texts by 215 authors in 1906, 380 authors in 380, 424 authors in 1908, 533 authors in 1909, 546 authors in 1910. In early 1915, due to World War I, the newspaper relocated to Vilnius where issues 7 to 33 were published.  Later resurrections  The newspaper was resurrected in 1926 in Marijampolė by the Congregation of Marian Fathers of the Immaculate Conception. It also resurrected the historical supplements Šaltinėlis and Artojas. Its circulation was 6,000 copies in 1933. The newspaper was discontinued after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in June 1940. The newspaper was reestablished in Nottingham by priest Steponas Matulis in 1961. After Lithuania regained independence in 1990, the newspaper relocated to Panevėžys in 1993 where it was published until 1998. Its circulation in 1993 was 1,000 copies.

Two synagogues stood on the site, first a wooden one from 1864 and then a stone building from 1881 until its demolition in 1987. First synagogue A meeting of Jewish residents on 10 January 1864 held at the offices of Louis Edward Nathan, and chaired by Nathan, decided to form a congregation and to erect a synagogue. NZ£300 towards the cost of the building were subscribed during the meeting. By mid-year, the site at 78 Gloucester Street had been purchased. The architect, Benjamin Mountfort, called for tenders by 15 June 1864. It took until mid-August for the congregation to take possession of the land. Tenders for the fitout were called by Mountfort a week later. The congregation first used the building on 1 October 1864 to coincide with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, for the year 5265. The building had cost NZ£500 but was not fully furnished; chairs were used for some time but seats had been installed before the end of 1864. By March 1865, the congregation had collected NZ£706 in donations. At the annual general meeting in September 1876, the issue of possibly building a new synagogue was formally discussed. It was decided to task a committee with progressing the issue. By February 1878, fundraising started to be organised. At a general meeting in May 1880, there was disquiet that the building proposal and fundraising effort had been allowed to linger. In November 1880, the architect Thomas Stoddart Lambert called for tenders for a new synagogue. The work was awarded to William Prudhoe. In mid-December, it was announced that an adjoining piece of land had been bought fronting onto Cambridge Terrace. The existing synagogue was to be relocated to this land so that worship won't get interrupted, a new synagogue built on the existing land, and once that was finished, the first synagogue was to be converted to a school. Second synagogue The foundation stone for the new synagogue was laid on 8 February 1881. Six weeks later, The Star reported on good building progress and the reporter remarked that \\"already some idea can be formed of the striking character of its architecture.\\" In early April, the Lyttelton Times reported that the facade was nearly finished. In early April, the masonry was nearly finished. In July, the architect invited tenders for the interior fitout and furniture. By the end of July, The Star reported on the interior fitout progress and that the building would be finished within a few more weeks. The consecration took place on 3 November 1881 in front of a large crowd; the event was by invitation only. The consecration was carried out by Rev Isaac Zachariah with the Wellington rabbi, Herman van Staveren, as assistant, in the presence of the bishops of Wellington and Nelson, Octavius Hadfield and Andrew Suter.

A native of Kansas, she moved to western Oklahoma Territory in 1901. In 1920, she was the first woman elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives. Early life and family Amelia Elizabeth Simison was born in Minneapolis, Kansas, on January 7, 1875, to Edward Harding Simison and his wife, Jane Eliza Moody. Both her parents died when she was three years old, and she was raised by relatives in Earlville, Illinois and educated at the Teachers Normal College and Wesleyan University. She married Grant McColgin (1870-1955) in 1895, and they moved to Oklahoma Territory in 1901. The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture states that her husband bought a relinquishment in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma, in 1903. Bessie McColgin became a school teacher and the postmistress of the Ridgeton Post Office. A few years later, the family moved to Rankin, where she and her husband established the Rankin Telephone Company in their home. She also organized a Women's Christian Temperance Union chapter, and was a school teacher in Rankin's first public school. Her son Sterling S. McColgin also served in the Oklahoma Legislature.State's first female legislator opened door to others Career While pregnant with her 10th child, McColgin became the first woman elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives. She served in the legislature in 1921 and 1922.Oklahoma Legislature-House of Representatives-Historic Members According to legend, men in her family entered her name in the election as a Republican without her knowledge. She was seen as a \\"superior orator.\\" While in office, McColgin was heavily involved in health and safety legislation, and introduced a bill to create a Bureau of Child Hygiene. She attempted to pass legislation from Senator Lamar Looney, but few bills succeeded. She was also involved in a soldiers' relief program and helped establish a Tuberculosis Sanatorium in Oklahoma. Although she was not re-elected for a second term, three new woman members of the Oklahoma House of Representatives were elected in 1923. On the last day of her term, McColgin was presented with a wristwatch from her male colleagues to commemorate her service, which they jokingly stated was because \\"women legislators need to be watched\\". Nearly 40 years after her term ended, McColgin's son Sterling was elected to the same seat she had filled. McColgin died at the age of 97 in Sayre, Oklahoma, on July 9, 1972. She was posthumously inducted into the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame in 2005.

Beecher (October 9, 1877 – November 21, 1959) was an American politician who served as the 25th Mayor of Burlington, Vermont. His eight-vote victory against James E. Burke in 1927 is the smallest margin of victory in any Burlington mayoral race. Early life On October 9, 1877, Beecher was born to David O. Beecher and Mary E. Waring on a farm in Granville, New York. In 1900, he graduated from the University of Vermont medical college with highest honors and continued his education in Vienna, Austria in 1910 with internal medicine. During his time of medical practice he became the first doctor to use insulin in Vermont. Career In 1919, he was given the Republican nomination for Ward Two's alderman election and defeated Robert Cannon with 601 votes to 257 votes. On February 20, 1922, he was renominated by the Republican city committee for alderman and faced no opposition in the election due to the Democratic city committee not selecting a candidate. On February 16, 1924, he declined to seek reelection and the Republican nomination for Ward Two's alderman was given to Ralph H. Robinson. Mayoral On February 2, 1925, he announced that he would seek the Republican nomination for mayor and was given the nomination by unanimity on February 11. Beecher defeated former Mayor James E. Burke of the Citizens Party and President of the Board of Alderman George L. Edwards of the Nonpartisan League and Democratic Party with 2,429 votes to 1,845 votes and 994 votes. During his tenure the Burlington City Hall, Memorial Auditorium, Central Fire Station, and the Winooski Bridge were all constructed and he managed recovery in Burlington following the Great Vermont Flood of 1927. In 1927, he narrowly defeated James E. Burke again by only 89 votes with 3,191 votes to 3,108 votes. Due to the closeness of the election Burke filed a lawsuit attempting to remove Beecher from office, but the Vermont Supreme Court ruled in Beecher's favor on January 2, 1929, although it decreased his vote total to 3,016. He chose not to run for reelection in 1929 and was succeeded by former Mayor John Holmes Jackson. Later life In 1932, he served as a delegate to the Vermont Republican Party's state convention. On March 12, 1934, Beecher was given the Republican nomination for Ward Five alderman with 19 votes against Meader Martin's 3 votes and on March 27, 1934, he narrowly defeated Democratic Oscar H. Heininger by 28 votes for Ward Five's alderman seat with 553 votes to 525 votes in a special election to fill the seat following E. Lloyd Gillett's resignation. He did not seek reelection in 1935, and was succeeded by Frank J. Hendee after he defeated Meader Martin in the general election. On January 13, 1953, the Republican city committee gave him the mayoral nomination, but was defeated in a landslide by incumbent Democratic Mayor J. Edward Moran with 5,091 votes to 3,403 votes and he performed worse than Republican aldermen in every ward except in ward one. During the mayoral race he criticized Moran for his handling of Burlington's new electric generator plant and blamed him for its poor management. From 1941 to 1945, he served as dean of the University of Vermont's medical college and in 1958, the University of Vermont gave him an honorary degree for a doctorate in science. On November 11, 1959, Beecher suffered a heart attack and was taken to Mary Fletcher Hospital (now the University of Vermont Medical Center), where he died on November 21. He was buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Burlington. Family In 1904, Beecher married Florence Jeanette Russell (1882-1957), with whom he was the father of two children, John (1906-1981) and Jeanette (1909-1997). They divorced in May 1931 and on June 8, 1931, he married Reba Mildred Jones (1909-1996).

Mai 2004 in Zwickau Due to the traditions of automotive engineering in the region and because of the skilled workers potential, Volkswagen decided as the first large enterprise of the Federal Republic to build up a completely new work in Saxony and provided for it considerable investments. As a result, other investors settled in the region. Already in the final phase of the GDR the Trabant 1.1 was built in the northern Zwickau suburb of Mosel from 1989 with a four-cylinder four-stroke engine manufactured under VW license. The production was discontinued in 1991, because parallel to this one had already started on 21 May 1990 in the factory Mosel with the mass production of Volkswagen Polo Mk2. On 15 February 1991, the production of the Volkswagen Golf Mk2 began parallel to the Polo production, whose successor is still produced today in the Zwickau plant.Pressemitteilung der Volkswagen AG, abgerufen am 17. Februar 2016 The suburb Mosel was incorporated into Zwickau on 1 January 1999. In 2007, they officially introduced the new factory designation Volkswagen-Fahrzeugwerk Zwickau. Since production began in 1990, around 3.7 million Volkswagen have been delivered. In 2010, 1,350 vehicles of the VW model series Golf and Passat left the production lines of the Volkswagen plant every day. With 250,000 vehicles, 2010 was a record result. In addition, there are the bodies for the luxury class vehicles Phaeton and Bentley Continental GT, which are completely painted with special transporters in the \\"Transparent Factory\\" Dresden or after Crewe in England. Since 2001, around 100,000 bodies have been produced for the Phaeton and Bentley Continental series (50,000 each).

It is situated within Olympic National Park, and is the northernmost peak in The Needles range, which is a subset of the Olympic range. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Clark, to the south, and Gray Wolf Ridge arcs to the northeast. Mount Walkinshaw is set in the eastern portion of the Olympic Mountains within the drainage basin of the Dungeness River. This position puts it in the rain shadow of the Olympic Range, resulting in less precipitation than Mount Olympus and the western Olympics receive. History Originally known as The Citadel, the Mount Walkinshaw name was officially adopted in 1965 to commemorate Robert B. Walkinshaw (1884-1963), author and lawyer whose conservation efforts contributed to the establishment of Olympic National Park.Olympic Mountains: A Climbing Guide, Olympic Mountain Rescue, Fourth Edition, 2006, The Mountaineers Books, page 146 The mountain's name was submitted for consideration by Walter Walkinshaw, the son of Robert, with the location chosen to be next to Mount Clark, named for Irving M. Clark who was also a Seattle conservationist, and an old acquaintance of Robert Walkinshaw. The first ascent of he peak was made in 1961 by Joe Munson and Jim Parolini. Climate Mount Walkinshaw is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Walkinshaw. Geology Walter Walkinshaw on the summit of Mount Walkinshaw The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust.

Its natural habitat is typically on rocky or sandy woodlands and bluffs, in areas of acidic soil. It is generally uncommon throughout most of its range, with exception for the Interior Highlands region. Boechera missouriensis is an erect biennial. It produces racemes of small creamy-white flowers in the spring.

The WNPL consists of the highest level state league in a subset of the state-based federations within Australia, and is overseen by Football Federation Australia (FFA) in partnership with participating member federations. The WNPL is contested by clubs from six member federations; these are ACT, NSW, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. Northern NSW is set to join in 2021. History In October 2010, (FFA) commenced a National Competition Review, its main objective being to review the current structure of soccer competitions in Australia, and to monitor and improve elite player development. NSW were the first federation to commence a competition, after a review on women's football in NSW in 2013, which looked at staying aligned with the FFA's pathway for women's football program. Queensland switched to the NPL format in 2015, followed by South Australia and Victoria in 2016, and the ACT (Capital Football) in 2017. Western Australia became the sixth member federation to restructure women's competitions under the NPL banner, with the introduction of the National Premier Leagues WA Women's competition in 2020. Competition format and teams The WNPL competitions in each state and territory are run independently by the member federations, with a similar format to the equivalent men's competition - the National Premier Leagues. Teams may be relegated from the WNPL to a third-tier league in the same state (and vice versa), but there is currently no mechanism for a team to be promoted to the first tier of Australian Football, the W-League. The number of teams promoted and relegated from third-tier leagues per state has varied over time. The table below details the number of teams relegated automatically from the WNPL at the end of the season and the number of NPL teams which go into a relegation playoff against a lower league team. {  - !rowspan=2 Federation !! colspan=2Number of Clubs !! rowspan=2Current Season - !Automatic Relegation !!

The formation of the army began in the village of Pavlovka (18 km southeast of the city of Yelets) in the Lipetsk Oblast. The 15th Air Army received its baptism of fire in the autumn of 1942, participating in the defensive battles near Voronezh and in the elimination of the enemy's foothold on the left bank of the Don. In the winter of 1943, it supported the front troops in the Voronezh–Kastornoye operation. In May 1943 it participated in an air operation to destroy German aircraft at airfields.

During its restoration efforts by the ABS-CBN Film Restoration Project and Central Digital Lab, the biggest problem during the restoration of the film was the molds and fungus that were embedded in the print from the source negatives. The original print of the film, however, did not have a director's credit but fortunately, with the recent approval by the film's director, the title card \\"Directed by Mike de Leon\\" was recreated, matching the original font of the other credits. The film's restored version was released on November 11, 2014 in Trinoma Cinema as part of the Cinema One Originals film festival.

Central Yakutian Lowland - Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Vol. 28, p. 513 There are hundreds of river valleys all across the lowlands, which, besides the Lena, include the lower reaches of the Lena tributaries Vilyuy, Amga and Aldan. The rivers of the lowland are subject to spring floods during the thaw period and occasional rain floods in the summer. During the winter small rivers and rivulets freeze to the bottom. The Central Yakutian Lowlands are a flat plain, slightly higher in its peripheral parts. Permafrost is continuous throughout the region.

He studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp with Ferdinand de Braekeleer, then travelled to Holland to copy the Old Masters.

His regular contact with painters of the Barbizon school encouraged him to adopt a more contemporary style, and he became more successful. Soon, he was admitted to the major exhibitions and treated like a native Frenchman. His works were compared to those of Charles-François Daubigny by the critic Edmond About. Later in life, he left France to settle in Deurle. He is considered to be one of the precursors of what would come to be called the . His younger brother, , became a well known landscape painter.

The protesters also targeted government corruption and the lack of action on money laundering. The protests consisted of demonstrations, marches, sit-ins, and civil disobedience and are unprecedented in Malta's political history since its independence from the United Kingdom. The Maltese government was accused of using intimidation tactics against protesters and journalists. Caruana Galizia's family accused Muscat of trying to shield members of the inner circle from the investigations. Organisers contested claims that protests were violent in any way, while an official spokesperson said that some protesters did \\"resort to violence, abuse and incitement.\\" Prime Minister Joseph Muscat announced on 1 December that he would resign on 12 January 2020. Constitutional experts, legal bodies, and other representatives stated that Muscat's decision to remain in office until January 2020 and to have a more than six-week Parliamentary recess over Christmas led to the crisis within Maltese institutions. The Caruana Galizia family, political parties, the European Union mission in Malta, academics, NGOs, civil society, the University of Malta students' union, former advisers, industrial organisations, and organised business and labour unions called for his immediate resignation. On 13 January 2020, Joseph Muscat resigned, satisfying one of the protestors' main demands. Businesses were negatively affected by both the crisis and the protests, while major industrial associations and institutions expressed concern at the impact of the turmoil.  Background   Malta's political context  Malta, an island nation of nearly 500,000 citizens, gained its independence from Great Britain in 1964, and its people subsequently declared it a Republic in 1974. It has largely been viewed as a nation of general geopolitical neutrality (since 1979), but also of extraordinarily impressive democratic voter participation. Its modern governmental body - a unicameral chamber known as the House of Representatives - is currently predominated by a two-party system, of which the Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, holds the majority of seats. Despite several markers of socioeconomic success, such as its high life expectancy of 81 and its classification as an advanced society according to the IMF and UN (along with 32 other nations worldwide), public perception of Malta's public servants has been marred by allegations of corruption. This has resulted in a worse Corruption Perceptions Index compared to several other similar small economically-advanced nations like Denmark, Singapore, Luxembourg, New Zealand, and Hong Kong. In recent years, investigative journalists have increasingly reported on allegations of money laundering, tax evasion via offshore havens (including those connected with the Panama Papers), nepotism, and various other indications of bribery and fraud; journalists are protected pursuant to Malta's Constitutional law on free press and free speech. Leaders of both parties, including Muscat and the opposition party's Adrian Delia, were commonly the subjects of critique.  Daphne Caruana Galizia's assassination, and the next two years of civil response  An important figure in this movement, Daphne Caruana Galizia garnered international reputation as a resolute critic of political and business malpractice, despite being targeted by several SLAPP suits. Throughout 2017, she released a series of controversial and sensitive pieces of information that link a number of Maltese politicians to the Panama Papers. She was subsequently assassinated with a bomb installed into her car, on 16 October 2017. At the time of her death, she was fighting 48 libel suits. Thousands of people attended a vigil in Caruana Galizia's hometown of Sliema the night of her murder. A series of monthly protests and vigils in remembrance of Caruana Galizia were held by civil society organisations on every sixteenth day of the month from October 2017 onward, in addition to ongoing anti-corruption protests and marches. These demonstrations, in opposition of secretive Panama accounts being opened by Maltese officials, had been consistently and formally organised for years leading up to Caruana Galizia's death. However, protests in Malta – some of them spontaneous – fundamentally transformed in meaning following her assassination, and evolved and intensified as more information about her murder has surfaced, implicating businessmen and politicians alike. Her death was covered by international media, and the name Caruana Galizia began trending worldwide on Twitter. On 22 October 2017, the Civil Society Network organised a protest demanding justice and calling for the immediate resignation of the Police Commissioner and the Attorney General. Despite her harsh criticism against them, both Muscat and Delia expressed frustration over her death, viewing it as a representation of the \\"collapse of democracy and freedom of expression\\" Pope Francis even sent a letter of condolence to the Maltese people. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange announced that he would pay a €20,000 reward \\"for information leading to the conviction of Caruana Galizia's killers\\", stimulating the creation of additional crowdfunded campaigns and state-sanctioned rewards with similar goals. In April 2018, a consortium of 45 international journalists published The Daphne Project, a collaboration between 18 news organizations (including the locally syndicated newspaper Times of Malta, as well as The New York Times and The Guardian) to complete her investigative work. The GUE/NGL Award for Journalists, Whistleblowers & Defenders of the Right to Information was established in 2018 in honor of Caruana Galizia. As the second anniversary of the assassination approached, Civil Society organised a protest march, with the US Embassy issuing a statement, reiterating its offer to help Maltese investigators. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat insisted that the press misinterpreted this statement by the US embassy. Meanwhile, Dutch experts continued to help with Maltese investigations into the assassination, as the Netherlands Ministry for Foreign Affairs commemorated Caruana Galizia and echoed their commitment to free press and anti-corruption efforts: > \\"Two years ago today the Maltese journalist #DaphneCaruanaGalizia was > murdered in a heinous attack on freedom of expression. There can be no > democracy without a free and independent press. Let justice for journalism > be served and set an example for everyone.\\" ~ Netherlands Ministry for > Foreign Affairs, 16 October 2019  Keith Schembri and 17 Black  On 11 November 2019, Muscat's chief of staff, Keith Schembri, dropped a libel case against Simon Busuttil, in order to avoid testifying about 17 Black, a shell company based in Dubai, which had become implicated with the Panama Papers. This decision was made in defiance of judiciary orders, but Muscat supported Schembri's decision not to testify, stating as justification that: 1) he had already sat down with the Caruana Galizia family to reach an agreement on a public inquiry into the assassination; and 2) such testimony by Schembri could constitute a conflict of interest, or prejudice the investigation into 17 Black. A Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) report had identified the owner of 17 Black to be power station investor and Tumas Group CEO Yorgen Fenech, who has a clear link to Muscat and Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi, through mutual investment into a new gas-fired power station, since 2013 or earlier. Fenech's ownership of 17 Black was corroborated by banking records acquired by Reuters from sources in the United Arab Emirates familiar with 17 Black. This FIAU intelligence report furthermore identified, in a leaked email, that 17 Black was \\"one of two sources of income for the Panama companies Hearnville and Tillgate\\", which were \\"set up by OPM consultants Nexia BT for Dr Mizzi and the Prime Minister's chief of staff Keith Schembri\\". 17 Black allegedly planned to pay $5,000 a day to these two Panama companies owned by Schembri and Mizzi. Fenech denied any connection to Panama companies and even declined to comment about his ownership of 17 Black; Mizzi denied any connection to 17 Black; Muscat and Schembri denied any knowledge of 17 Black's ownership.  Middleman arrest  On 19 November 2019, Muscat announced that he had written to Melvin Theuma, an alleged middleman in the Caruana Galizia murder case, offering him a pardon in exchange for exhaustive information detailing those involved in the assassination plot, following Theuma's arrest during the previous week (on a separate case). Muscat claimed that this was \\"the beginning of the end\\" of the investigation.  Fenech's arrest and Schembri's resignation  Early on 20 November 2019, Fenech was intercepted at sea by an Armed Forces of Malta (AFM) patrol boat, while allegedly attempting to flee the country on his private yacht, one day after Theuma's presidential pardon. Six days later, Schembri resigned from his post as chief of staff, was questioned by police, and was released on police bail. Fenech first attempted to gain immunity in exchange for information; when immunity was denied, and an indictment filed against him on 30 November 2019, he plead not guilty. Fenech's defense primarily revolves around accusing Schembri of being the mastermind behind the Caruana Galizia murder, and of even extorting Fenech to frame Christian Cardona as the responsible party for the assassination. The case remains ongoing.  Protests   21 November  On 20 November, civil society groups led by Repubblika, Occupy Justice, and manueldelia.com, announced a protest in front of the Prime Minister's Office, Auberge de Castille, calling for Muscat's resignation. In their statement, the groups said that Muscat should have demanded Schembri and Mizzi's resignations when their names first appeared in the 2016 Panama Papers release. The groups said they did not invite the Nationalist Party, or any other party, for the demonstration, but they would not oppose anyone wanting to join. At the end of the protest, protestors walked to the makeshift memorial to Caruana Galizia at the foot of the Great Siege Memorial. Those present then gathered outside Parliament, shouting \\"barra, barra\\" (out, out) and \\"Mafia, Mafia'\\" at Government politicians. At the same time, opposition members of parliament (MPs) walked out of Parliament over Muscat's failure to dismiss Schembri and Mizzi. As pressure for their resignations mounted, Muscat insisted he was protecting no-one. Muscat reiterated there was no evidence linking politicians to the Caruana Galizia assassination. Muscat admitted that questions about Schembri's “business plans” with Fenech were legitimate. Protesters also assembled in the streets around the Parliament buildings, heckling and stopping a number of ministers' cars from leaving the area. Justice Minister Owen Bonnici's car was targeted by protesters as it left parliament, with the Minister describing how he stood by the Police Force, two of whom sustained minor injuries in the course of doing their duties. In a statement, Speaker Anġlu Farrugia said steps ought to be taken against those who exceeded limits and manifestly breached the law, including through the use of violence.  22 November  On 21 November, another protest was called for 22 November in front of Auberge de Castille. The organising groups stated that Muscat needed to shoulder political responsibility because had Muscat not failed to have Schembri and Mizzi removed, \\"Daphne Caruana Galizia would still be alive.\\" The groups said that “to protect his friends, Joseph Muscat [...] suffocated the rule of law, allowed impunity to be sown and as a result seen Malta reaping violence.\\" Honest MPs on both sides of Parliament were asked to remove “the corrupt and the accomplices of murderers” while embarking on a “cleansing of public life” in Malta. Thousands of protestors met in front of the Auberge de Castille, renewing calls for Muscat to resign, saying that justice for Caruana Galizia was being stifled. Organisers appealed for calm, after a police officer was injured on Wednesday during a similar protest.  25 November  Another protest was called for 25 November 2019. That day pressure continued to mount for Mizzi and Schembri's resignation, with cabinet members commenting publicly on the need for the country not to protect murderers and money launderers, while Malta's reputation was suffering \\"almost irreparable\\" damage. Faced with the pressure, Mizzi insisted \\"I stand tall... I have nothing to do with this case,\\" while Schembri refused to comment. Fake €5,000 banknotes were thrown at Parliament, while peaceful protesters chanted “barra” [out] and “ħallelin, postkom ġo Kordin” (thieves, you belong in prison). Three rows of steel barricades kept protesters away from Parliament, while Muscat was jeered after exiting parliament at the end of Monday evening's parliamentary session.  26 November  On 26 November, crowds gathered next to Parliament, calling for Muscat's resignation. As the investigation into the Caruana Galizia murder continued, following further pressure, first Schembri and then Mizzi resigned from office. Schembri then faced questioning by police over allegations of his involvement in the Caruana Galizia case. Another minister, Chris Cardona, suspended himself in the wake of other police investigations. Prime Minister Muscat thanked Schembri, saying \\"I thank Keith for his hard work, he played a crucial role.\\" A protest was held next to Parliament, hours after these political resignations. Parliament descended briefly into chaos as opposition MPs shouted \\"mafia\\" at Government benches, foreign affairs minister Carmelo Abela and parliamentary secretary for the elderly Anthony Agius Decelis were restrained by fellow Labour MPs after they crossed the floor. They were riled by opposition Nationalist MPs shouting “thieves, mafia.” Prime Minister Muscat attempted to calm MPs, but the chaotic scenes escalated when he entered parliament. The resignations sparked a governmental crisis. Hundreds of people gathered outside cried \\"shame on you\\" and \\"killers\\", with the angry crowd pelting ministerial cars with eggs and coins as they left. Muscat was shielded by security officers as he exited on his way to a Labour executive meeting in Hamrun. Protesters carried banners, flares, drums, megaphones, and flags to get their message across and shouted: \\"Daphne was right\\". The protest then moved from outside parliament to Castille Place, where protesters were addressed by Manuel Delia, one of the organisers, and other speakers. Protesters vowed they would protest until Muscat's resignation.  27 November  Another demonstration called for Wednesday 27 November began as a protest march, ending in front of Auberge de Castille. This was the fifth protest in less than a week. Following the disturbances of 26 November, steel barricades were placed in front of parliament, Auberge de Castille and on Merchants' Street, as police increased security ahead of the day's planned protest. On the day, both major political parties announced mass meetings for 1 December, with various civil society members and Caruana Galizia family members asking people to stay away from rallies organised by political parties. Both events were eventually cancelled. The Institute of Maltese Journalists appealed the police to begin issuing press conferences to update journalists and media on developments in the Caruana Galizia case. Civil society had repeatedly questioned why news on the investigation filtered through from Muscat, and not from official police spokespersons. After the main demonstration, protesters blocked traffic in Floriana as they demanded further resignations.  28 November  An unannounced protest was held on 28 November, following reports of the release of Schembri from arrest. Fenech had claimed Schembri was responsible for the Caruana Galizia assassination in October 2017.  29 November  In the early hours of the morning on 29 November, after the protest which began in the evening the previous day, unknown security officials clashed with demonstrators and journalists were forcibly kept within the Ambassadors' Hall in Auberge de Castille. Maltese and foreign journalists were kept against their will after attending a press conference organised at 3 a.m. Tensions escalated after the security officials refused to identify themselves to journalists, or tell them why they were not being let out of the building. The decision to keep journalists locked in the Ambassadors' Hall was condemned by the Institute of Maltese Journalists. University lecturers and students blocked parts of the road around the Msida skatepark in protest on Friday, 29 November, in a protest organised by the Kunsill Studenti Universitarji (KSU). Holding placards reading \\"assassins\\", \\"blood is on your hands\\" and \\"Muscat kriminal\\" (Muscat is a criminal), they later moved their sit-in protest to Regional Road. News broke that Muscat was named by Fenech in his first statement to the police. Before the protest, police were briefed and reminded of their duty to protect the protesters. Protesters began a protest march in Valletta at 6:30 p.m., holding posters and Maltese flags while protesting at the government's handling of the criminal investigation. The protest followed news earlier in the day of Muscat's imminent resignation. After the main protest, a smaller crowd gathered beneath the Great Siege Monument in front of the Daphne memorial where flowers and candles were left in tribute.  30 November  Moviment Graffiti organised a protest in the morning, with organisers saying that there was \\"nothing socialist, leftist or progressive about what the government had allowed to happen over the past few years, despite the fact that the Labour Party was supposed to hold true to these values.\\" Protesters reiterated calls for Muscat to resign following the Caruana Galizia probe, and they were joined in their protest by author and activist Immanuel Mifsud, and Arnold Cassola, amongst other politicians, NGOs, academics and activists. On the day, MaltaToday published a photo of Schembri with the alleged middleman in the assassination plot, Melvin Theuma, at the Prime Minister's office in Castille.  1 December  Thousands of people descended on Valletta on Sunday, 1 December, demanding Muscat's resignation. Marching to shouts \\"Daphne was right,\\" \\"Justice,\\" and \\"Assassins,\\" protesters insisted that Muscat was not their prime minister. Close to 20,000 protesters filled Republic Street in Valletta, by far the largest turnout at the time in weeks of protests aimed at Muscat's government. A protest march started in front of Parliament at 4 p.m. and moved to the square in front of the law courts, where protesters were addressed by activists. The protest was the largest one so far, with the pressure mounting on Muscat to step down. The protest came hours after an emergency meeting of the Labour Party parliamentary group gave Muscat free-reign to decide on his exit. The crowd was addressed by anthropologist Ranier Fsadni, Eve Borg Bonello, a 16-year-old student, and former Nationalist Party president Mark Anthony Sammut. Late in the evening on 1 December, Muscat announced his plan to resign on national television. Muscat stated that he would stay in office for a further 42 days. Caruana Galizia family members, the Chamber of Advocates, law experts, Moviment Graffitti, and other critics feared that Muscat's insistence on remaining in office was a conflict of interest with investigations into suspects closely associated with him ongoing. Muscat insisted that \\"the case showed that Malta's institutions work and everyone is equal before the law.\\" Several plainclothes policemen were seen in strategic positions in Valletta taking pictures and footage of the protesters, some were seen walking with the crowd and taking pictures during the anti-corruption protest. Police surveillance was contested by a legal association, who stated it will continue to document such cases and to share its analysis with Amnesty International and European counterparts. Eve Borg Bonello, a 16-year old speaker at the protest, received death threats and insults for her speech during the 1 December protest. Upon reporting these threats to the police, a policeman advised Borg Bonello to \\"keep her opinions to herself.\\" While acknowledging this may have been a well-meaning piece of advice, she returned to the same police station assisted by a lawyer, to file an official police report.  2 December  Protesters sitting-in on Ordnance Street to block Government MPs from leaving Parliament. On Monday, 2 December 2019, access to Valletta's Freedom Square was heavily restricted as activists began to gather in front of parliament for the evening protest. Police also asked businesses located on Republic Street and Ordnance Street to close early in anticipation of the protest. Authorities laid out hundreds of metres of steel barricades in the square in front of parliament in the afternoon, considerably limiting the area in which civil society activists were able to protest. Opposition MPs walked out of Parliament, saying they will not attend any function with Muscat as prime minister. Protesters blocked politicians from leaving the Parliament building during the demonstration and demanded the resignation the Prime Minister. Protesters threw carrots and eggs – an allusion to the murder suspect Fenech – at MPs including Gozo minister Justyne Caruana. While trapped in Parliament, some Government MPs began taking selfies and communicating with their supporters on social media. Protesters also wanted the Prime Minister to take the political responsibility for the death of Caruana Galizia. All three of Caruana Galizia's sons were present at the protest. Protesters blocked all exits from Parliament, trapping MPs for a couple of hours between Ordnance Street and Freedom Square in Valletta. Protesters taunted the Prime Minister to come out, while Muscat was giving his final speech in parliament ahead of resigning in January 2020. Unable to exit from the main streets around Parliament, some MPs were forced to escape via tunnels linking Parliament with the Valletta Ditch. The lights in the ditch were switched off to distract protesters and their aim, with Muscat leaving Parliament from the basement exit. One of the organisers then moved the protest to Castille, with the MPs allowed to leave Parliament by the crowd. A journalist was assaulted by staff members of the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Animal Rights Clint Camilleri, as she attempted to ask whether he believed the Prime Minister ought to resign immediately. In a sign of the increased tension, Nationalist MP Karol Aqulina and Labour MP Clifton Grima started pushing each other, although they were quickly separated by people surrounding the two men. They shook hands afterwards. Later in the day, the Office of the Prime Minister located at Auberge de Castille was also egged. Some kilometres away from the protest, government supporters turned up in Hamrun, in front of the Labour Party's headquarters, in an unofficial rally in support of Muscat. The Institute of Maltese Journalists condemned the violence and intimidation towards journalists at the demonstration in front of the Labour Party headquarters, as well as by government staff during the civil society protests in Valletta.  3 December  Early on Tuesday, 3 December, protesters greeted Prime Minister Muscat as he entered Castille, calling for his immediate resignation. Muscat was meeting with a delegation of the European Parliament dispatched to Malta for an urgent mission following a political crisis sparked by developments in the Caruana Galizia murder investigation. Justice Minister Bonnici and Muscat were egged on their way to meet the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) at Castille. The square next to Auberge de Castille was then locked down by police barricades. Breaking news suggested the Prime Minister had remained in contact with Fenech via regular text messages. Muscat had claimed to have last met Fenech more than a year ago, but the Prime Minister recently admitted to at least one social meeting in February 2019. Fenech sent the messages when he was already the prime suspect under investigation, with Muscat being fully briefed by the security services. Further news revelations indicated how two members of staff from the Office of the Prime Minister were allegedly mentioned in the middleman's testimony, with a former member of Muscat's security detail tried to pass on a message to the men accused of murdering Caruana Galizia. In the evening, protesters assembled outside the police headquarters building in Floriana. They demanded that the police arrest and interrogate Keith Schembri, the prime minister's former chief of staff, for his connection to the murder investigation of Daphne Caruana Galizia. A large copy of a letter written by the alleged middleman in the assassination plot was attached to the closed gates of the headquarters. In it, the middleman named both Schembri and Yorgen Fenech as being part of the plot. Protesters held European Union (EU) and Maltese flags and sometimes shouting \\"mafia\\" and throwing fake €5,000 notes demanding the interrogation of Muscat and the arrest of Schembri. Protesters thanked the police on duty, particularly for not putting six rows of barricades in front of protesters, as had happened in Valletta some days earlier. On 4 December, Parliament adjourned for its traditional Christmas recess amid great political turmoil. Opposition MPs boycotted the last sessions of Parliament as Muscat refused to resign immediately, with Parliament unanimously approving the Budget estimates in a marathon vote session. Muscat took a selfie with Government MPs at the end of the sitting.  7 December  Maltese living or working in London, United Kingdom, organised a protest for 7 December in Parliament Square. Frustrated by a sense of helplessness, organisers aimed to draw international attention to the situation in Malta. Dozens of activists carried placards, and held banners, calling for Muscat's immediate resignation. On the day, Muscat attended a private audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican, with the meeting being shifted from an official visit to a private audience after a number of protests and letters were written asking the Pope not to meet with Muscat. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte cancelled a lunch with Muscat, opting for a private meeting at Palazzo Chigi instead.  8 December  Another protest was called for Sunday, 8 December, demanding the immediate resignation of Muscat, and the investigation of all those named in the unfolding criminal investigations. The protest received the endorsement of leading independent news organisations in Malta, notably Times of Malta, The Malta Independent, Malta Today, Shift News, LovinMalta, as well as civil society organisation such as Aditus, Moviment Graffitti and KSU. Fewer policemen and barriers were prepared by security organisers than in previous demonstrations. Thousands walked on Castille in a protest march led by Caruana Galizia's parents, carrying flags, placards and chanting calls for justice and against corruption. The crowd was then addressed by Andre Callus from Moviment Graffitti, who called for an end to the blind partisanship that led Malta to this situation and that Muscat's unparalleled defence of Schembri left a \\"bad stench\\" in Castille. Christian Pace – an LGBT activist – addressed the crowd, and insisted the LGBT community was not \\"a catchphrase\\", and that he was shocked that Muscat kept promoting the LGBT successes of his government right up to his last weeks. Addressing the crowd, former Partit Nazzjonalista candidate Norman Vella linked the stories coming out of the court proceedings directly with the Office of the Prime Minister. With Theuma's testimony, it was now clear public funds were used to pay for the assassination. Closing the demonstration, Manuel Delia insisted that the two candidates for parliamentary leadership had insulted the country by not apologising to the Caruana Galizia family. Muscat, he said, was an agent of a Mafia who did not want to have anything change after his resignation.  9 December  Early in the morning, Moviment Graffitti staged a sit-in at Castille demanding Muscat's immediate resignation, storming into the Prime Minister's Office building from a side entrance. In a peaceful protest, around 25 activists entered Castille with drums and whistles, chanting \\"shame on you'\\", \\"mafia\\", \\"criminals\\" and \\"barra.\\" Activists made no attempt to enter the administrative office areas, and Muscat was not in the building. The offices were guarded by AFM soldiers, with more arriving when the protest began, without intervening. When journalists arrived to cover the scene, protesters were locked inside the entrance hall, with the photographers and reporters moved out by security officers. Police officers said they were acting on \\"orders\\". The police stopped Caruana Galizia family members from joining the sit-in protest, while protesters blocked the street outside Castille. Government supporting media reported that a soldier was injured in the sit-in after being shoved against a wall, and that an activist had urinated at Castille. These claims were debunked and denied by Moviment Graffitti.  12 December  As the middleman in the murder of Caruana Galizia was testifying in court, the Maltese community in Belgium staged a protest outside the Maltese Permanent Representation to the EU at Dar Malta in Brussels. This coincided with the opening of the European leaders' summit meeting, which was attended by the Prime Minister. Protesters demanded justice for the assassinated journalist, amidst reports that other European heads of state were uncomfortable with Muscat's presence at the European Summit. There were claims staff members of the embassy also joined the protest. A large poster of Daphne Caruana Galizia was placed on the main doorway. Justice Minister Bonnici confirmed that Schembri had always been present at briefings on the murder of Caruana Galizia. He said he would feel \\"betrayed\\" if the allegations that Fenech knew what was going on in those meetings were true.  13 December  On 11 December, a protest was called by NGOs for Friday, 13 December – coinciding with Republic Day, a national holiday in Malta. Insisting that Republic Day belonged to the people, NGOs encouraged people to attend. There were fears that the protest, coinciding with the official ceremonies, would clash with the official events marking the day. Overnight, a group of protesters stood guard on the makeshift memorial to Caruana Galizia, holding a vigil throughout the night, to ensure that the memorial was not removed again by Government employees. During the protest, police presence was heavy to ensure the peace between protesters and Maltese celebrating Republic Day, in particular around Castille. President George Vella, on his way to the Grandmaster's Palace for the official ceremonies, was greeted with both applause and jeers, with the crowd protesting, whistling and chanting throughout a military parade along Republic Street. Protesters lined the streets, from Parliament through to St George's Square. The President was booed and fake money was thrown towards his car. Ahead of the official ceremony, President Vella appealed for unity, describing the current events as \\"very particular circumstances,\\" and that Malta was far bigger than the “gang of people” who have brought shame on the country. In a statement, Moviment Graffitti said that \\"the two main political parties exerting huge control over [Maltese] society and institutions, and which prioritise their party’s lust for power over the interests of the people,\\" asking all Maltese to take the opportunity to bring about a real change, and not a superficial one. Home Affairs Minister Michael Farrugia insisted NGOs and protesters did not apply for a permit for the protests on Republic Day, while a Police statement admitted a meeting was held between the NGOs and police authorities two days before the protests to discuss civil society's role in the official ceremonies. Manuel Delia, one of the 13 December protest organisers, began court proceedings against the Labour Party's television channel and news journalists after claims protesters aimed their heckles and \\"violent protests\\" at Special Olympics athletes. Delia viewed the news coverage to be \\"untrue\\", \\"defamatory and libellous\\" and aimed to \\"put him in danger.\\"  16 December  On 16 December, NGO organiser Repubblika have asked for the President Vella's protection in view of an intimidation campaign, asking Vella's intervention with the authorities, to restrain confrontation, and confirm the non-violent nature of the protests. Organisers have said that protesters received death threats, and asked Vella to call on the Police Commissioner to obey the law, and have stated the NGO's members do not \\"feel protected by the Police Commissioner and the entire force.\\" A vigil marking the 26th month since Caruana Galizia assassination was held in front of the makeshift memorial in Valletta, with the groups restating their commitment to protest until justice was made for Caruana Galizia and corruption removed from Government. Addressing the crowd, Vicki Ann Cremona warned that the same \\"demonisation campaign\\" against Caruana Galizia was now being applied to the NGOs and the organisers of repeated protests calling for the prime minister's resignation. Cremona said activists were being falsely accused of disrespecting the armed forces, the police and a paralympics contingent in 13 December protest. This slander led to \\"hate speech\\" and threats towards activists. Other speakers included Manuel Delia, and members from the Chance Civil Hub Against Organised Crime in Europe. 5 January 2020 On 5 January, a national anti-corruption protest themed \\"New Republic New Malta\\", organised by Repubblika, Occupy Justice and Manuel Delia, took place in Valletta. Rumours spread that at an 11 January meeting of Repubblika, the group might transform into a political party. Vicki Ann Cremona of Repubblika and Manuel Delia denied the rumour, stating that becoming a political party would be contrary to the group's aim of achieving \\"the rule of law\\". Cremona called for Muscat and \\"his criminal gang\\" to resign from parliament.  Reactions   Reactions in Malta  alt= The President of Malta George Vella appealed for calm and unity, and asked to allow time for the institutions to work, saying that \\"Malta deserves better.\\" The President cancelled a number of engagements, both locally and abroad, in light of the national crisis. Constituted bodies and unions issued varied calls, with some asking for Muscat to step down and others prompting a more measured reaction asking for calm and maturity. Michael Falzon, a government MP, accused protests of destabilising the country and the economy, accusing protesters of seeking bloodshed with their boycotts and protests, aiming to have \\"another martyr.\\" The same MP insisted the 2 December protest was not a protest but \\"sedition\\", showing a jacket he wore for that evening's sitting with egg- stains. He said that these items as well as bags of urine were being thrown by a mob which included two Opposition MPs. Journalists attending the protest insisted that they saw protesters throw eggs, coins, carrots and (fake) cash at MPs, but not any urine. The Minister for Education, Evarist Bartolo, in a series of almost daily comments, reiterated that it was \\"not acceptable that people with money use politics, criminals to hijack country.\\" Another government MP, Silvio Schembri, insisted that his loyalties lie with the Labour Party, and not with any other institution. Home Affairs Minister Michael Farrugia insisted that \\"aggressive behaviour\\" and \\"obscene language\\" should not be used during the protests. Farrugia listed a number of violent incidents during the protest, including the injury of a policemen, threats, damages to official cars, the blocking of official cars by protesters, the throwing of urine bags at MPs, a sit-in protest at the Office of the Prime Minister and the injury of a soldier. Claims about throwing of urine bags could not be verified by journalists, while Moviment Graffitti insisted the soldier was not injured in its protest, but had stumbled and slipped on a ledge in the hallway. Candidate for the leadership of the Labour Party Robert Abela claimed that the only purpose of the protests was provocation. Opposition MEP Roberta Metsola replied that \\"Provocation is assassinating your critics, allowing the mafia to take over, protecting criminals for years, looting our nation. Provocation is sending in the army for a dozen activists, barricading public spaces [and] conducting vile disinformation campaigns\\". Opposition MEP David Casa said that the idea that Muscat should hold on to power was \\"insane\\", that Malta was on the precipice and that \\"a government that murders its own citizens has absolutely no place in the European Union.\\" Labour Party MEP Alex Agius Saliba insisted that the activists are “extremists” aiming at “destabilising the country.” Agius Saliba called for measures to “put an end to this madness”, saying the “country cannot be ruled by a few people who set themselves above the law.” Moreover, he also equated “civil disobedience” with “anarchy.” Former Chief Justice and former Judge of the European Court of Human Rights Vincent A. De Gaetano described the situation as an \\"institutional crisis\\" rather than a constitutional one, as the crisis affects other organs and actors which may not necessarily emanate from the Constitution, such as the \\"police force, political parties and the myriad regulatory bodies and public authorities and entities that keep being created.\\" De Gaetano insists that the President has a \\"moral duty\\" to act and denounce whatever is eroding the Constitution. As protests in Malta intensified, the Bishops of Malta and the Bishop of Gozo appealed for national unity, urging people \\"not to fall into trap of hatred, lies and violence.\\" The Malta Chamber of Commerce called on President Vella to be \\"a force that brings about balance and statesmanship during these troubled times,\\" a call echoing that from a constitutional law expert. Government authorities continued to remove a makeshift memorial to Caruana Galizia in front of the Law Courts, even a few hours after protesters leave flowers and photographs. When asked, workers cleaning the monument simply claimed they were receiving \\"orders from above\\". Grassroots Labour Party supporters continued to support Muscat's decisions, with the leading partner of Nexia BT, the company which opened the Panama companies for Schembri and Mizzi, saying Muscat is \\"the best that ever was and that ever will be.\\" On Nationalist Party owned media, Net News, reported that Muscat was isolated in Europe, using a blurred photo of Muscat sitting alone at a conference table in Brussels. General Workers' Union owned newspaper, It-Torċa, then used photos of Muscat with EU leaders from 2018 to imply that Muscat was welcomed during the December summit. = Muscat's farewell tour = On 8 December 2019, Muscat began his \\"farewell tour\\" of Labour voters, visiting supporters in Naxxar, Żebbuġ and Paola. He insisted he did what he believed was right, claiming to have \\"shouldered responsibility, perhaps more than what was needed\\". On 15 December 2019, Muscat visited supporters in Gozo, saying he pledged his \\"unconditional support\\" to the next PL leader, saying that while some protests were \\"just\\" and part of his public life, other protests, like those aimed at the armed forces, were \\"unfair.\\"  International reactions  The EU confirmed that it would send a mission to Malta to investigate the state of the rule of law in the country, referencing Caruana Galizia's case. The President of the EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen said the Commission is following the situation in Malta very closely. A European Parliament (EP) fact finding mission called for Muscat's immediate resignation, with its leading MEP saying she was \\"not reassured\\", claiming trust between the EU and Malta was seriously damaged and that Muscat had not allayed her concerns. EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders cited his \\"big concern\\" about Malta. The EU also pressured Malta to speed up its judicial reforms. The EP piled further pressure on the commission, with a motion having MEPs \\"express their regret that the European Commission in recent years refrained from taking any concrete measures towards the [Maltese] government,\\" with developments in Malta in recent years leading to a \\"serious and persistent threats to the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights.\\" A resolution was passed with a large majority at the EP, which called on Muscat to resign immediately over the Caruana Galizia case, questioning the \\"integrity and credibility\\" of the murder investigation with Muscat in government. MEP Sven Giegold called on the EU to begin suspension procedures against Malta under Article 7 of the treaty on EU, recommending the opening of an investigation into the rule of law and various policy decisions taken by the Muscat government. This step was reportedly seen by the commission as a viable option for the Maltese situation. The President of the European Parliament David Sassoli passed on a letter by the EU mission in Malta to European leaders urging them to take a stance on Malta following \\"alarming\\" findings made by the mission in early December, with the letter calling for Muscat's immediate resignation. The head of the EPP, Manfred Weber, insisted it was a \\"huge scandal\\" that Muscat remained in office, saying that he should have resigned immediately. With Finland holding the EU Council's rotating presidency, Finnish European Affairs Minister Tytti Tupparainen said she was concerned by the rule of law situation in Malta. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters that he had had “a long conversation” with Muscat, emphasising “that, pending his departure as prime minister, it is important that a separation of his office in Malta and the further prosecution [of the murder] is guaranteed, that this is crucial.” Muscat assured Rutte that \\"this was the case,\\" with Rutte saying he \\"will now try to keep an eye on this as much as possible.” Charles Michel, the EU council president, however, said that the Caruana Galizia murder investigation was not discussed during the two day summit in December 2019. Reporters Without Borders UK director Rebecca Vincent underscored the lack of political accountability in Malta around the case, as well as the problems relating to rule of law and freedom of expression. Carlo Bonini, an Italian mafia expert and author of a book on the investigations carried out by Caruana Galizia, described Malta as a \\"mafia- state [...] revealing how democracies can degenerate.\\"  See also  * 2019 Malta political crisis * The Daphne Project * Politics of Malta * European Centre for Press and Media Freedom * Murder of Ján Kuciak  Notes   References  Maltese protests Maltese protests Category:2019 Malta political crisis Category:Political history of Malta Category:November 2019 events in Malta Category:December 2019 events in Malta Category:Protests in Malta Category:2019 controversies ","title":"2019–2020 Maltese protests"},{"id":"62523483","text":"PT AOA Zamrud Aviation Corporation is an airline in Indonesia which was established in 1969 as a merger of PT Zamrud Airlines and PT Aircraft Owners' Association .

Despite confessing to the killings to two daughters-in-law decades apart, he was only arrested in 2002, after DNA evidence connected him to the crimes. He was convicted of one murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Early life Adolph Laudenberg was born in Lexington, Kentucky in 1926, to a German immigrant butcher and his wife, who died a few years after his birth. At some point, he took up whittling unique walking canes, made from salvaged wood and manzanita shrubs, which he would either give away or sell for $10 on the street. While serving in the naval construction battalion in Trinidad, California in 1944, Laudenberg met his future wife, Annelle. He adopted her son, Steve, and the couple then moved to California permanently, after Adolph left the service. He then got a job as a security guard at a steel plant, before turning towards being a cab driver in the San Pedro area in the late 1960s. According to neighbors, the Laudenbergs were an odd fit - Annelle worked at a dance studio, was outgoing and health conscious, while Adolph was a generous, but reclusive man who mostly kept to himself. Despite their differences, their marriage lasted 30 years before the couple separated, as Annelle, who didn't return her husband's feelings of love, outed herself as a stripper. Adolph remarried, but divorced again. At some point, he travelled for a short time to New Orleans, before returning to San Pedro. Murders Using his job as a cabby, Laudenberg's modus operandi consisted of picking up lonely, alcoholic or ill women who reminded him of his ex-wife, whom he would then bind, rape and strangle, either in Los Angeles or San Francisco. He was questioned by police during the initial investigations, but denied everything, and since the perpetrator left barely any clues behind, he was let off. Proven * Lois Petrie (43) - an alcoholic whose husband had recently died from cancer, Petrie was last seen at a San Pedro bar on Christmas, 1972. The following day, she was found strangled in her apartment's bedroom, partially nude and with signs of sexual assault. * Catherine Medina (50) - on August 18, 1974, Medina was discovered in a local San Pedro bar by her husband, who forced her out after an argument. As the couple walked home, the drunk Catherine ran away and jumped into the van of an unidentified man, which sped off. She wasn't found until the following day, when her nude body was found beside some bushes in Harbor Lake Recreational Park. * Anna Felch (54) - about a month after the Medina killing, on September 4th, the killer struck again. Felch, who worked at a hot dog stand on Cabrillo Beach, disappeared after leaving a San Pedro bar in the dead of night, inebriated. A few hours later, a construction worker found her body a few blocks away. Felch had been sexually assaulted and thereafter, strangled to death. * Leah Griffin (60) - a legal secretary and heavy drinker who had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer, Griffin was bound, raped and strangled at a residential hotel in San Francisco in April 1975. Suspected * Irene Hind (55) - owner of a San Francisco bar on Larkin Street, named \\"Irene's Domar Club\\". A generous woman who helped the people who frequented her place, she was found raped and strangled on March 12, 1974. * Maude Burgess (83) - a retiree who helped with the management of her San Francisco apartment building, the elderly Burgess was found raped and strangled in her apartment in November 1974. A partial fingerprint was located at the scene, but it was found to not match Laudenberg. Arrest, trial and imprisonment In 1975, Laudenberg confessed to his future daughter-in-law that he had killed four women, three in San Pedro and one in San Francisco, which he called his 'four sins'. The woman believed his story and told the authorities, and despite their efforts, they couldn't prove the veracity of the claims. In 2002, however, he did the same to his son's ex-wife Darlene, explaining what he did in far greater detail. She notified the San Luis Obispo police, who, now armed with advances in DNA, began re-examining the cold cases. Since Laudenberg had no criminal record, they had to find a way to obtain his DNA through other means. An undercover officer invited Adolph over some coffee in a Torrance restaurant, to which the latter agreed. After discussing various topics, and almost getting caught in the act, Laudenberg walked away without throwing out his coffee cup. The other officer then swept in and got the cup, from which DNA samples were extracted and sent for testing - they matched seminal fluid found on Lois Petrie's corpse. Armed with this evidence, authorities tracked down Laudenberg's camper van and arrested him, holding him on a $1,000,000 bail. He was charged with Petrie's murder, but denied her and the others' murders. Nonetheless, he was found guilty of the Petrie killing, and sentenced to life imprisonment. The circumstances surrounding how the officers obtained the DNA sample raised some privacy issues, with the policemen arguing that discarded items were considered public property and therefore, no legal permission was required to get a sample. The appellate court upheld the conviction, rejecting Laudenberg's argument that the expectation was that a restaurant employee should've thrown the cup out.

History   Origins  Modern humans have already lived on Jeju Island since the early Neolithic period (about 10,000 to 8,000 years ago). According to legend, three demi-gods emerged from Samseong, which is said to have been on the northern slopes of Hallasan and became the progenitors of the Jeju people, who founded the Kingdom of TamnaLee, Peter H.; de Bary, William Theodore: Sources of Korean Tradition, Volume I: From Early Times Through the Sixteenth Century. New York: Columbia University Press, (1997), .. Alexander Vovin (2013)Vovin, Alexander. 2013. ‘From Koguryǒ to T’amna: Slowly Riding South with the Speakers of Proto- Korean.’ Korean Linguistics; 15.2: 222-40. notes that the old name for Jeju Island is tammura, which can be analyzed in Japanese as tani mura たにむら ( 'valley settlement') or tami mura たみむら ( 'people's settlement'). Thus, Vovin concludes that Japonic speakers were present on Jeju Island before being replaced by Koreanic speakers sometime before the 15th century.  Tamna  There is no historical record of the founding or early history of Tamna. After the establishment of Tamna, in the first century AD, Tamna people started active trade with Baekje and Silla on mainland Korea, Han China and Yayoi period Japan, Southeast Asia, and the Chola dynasty of South India. Later, Tamna became a tributary state of Baekje and Silla.  Goryeo's Invasion  Tamna briefly reclaimed its independence after the fall of Silla in 935. However, it was subjugated by Goryeo in 938 and officially annexed in 1105. However, the kingdom maintained local autonomy until 1404, when Taejong of Joseon placed it under firm central control and brought the Tamna kingdom to an end. One interesting event that took place during these later years of Tamna was the Sambyeolcho RebellionTamna timeline, Jeju-gossi, 23 February 2011., which came to a bloody end on Jeju Island in 1274.  Japanese occupation  In 1910, Japan annexed Korea, including Jeju, inaugurating a period of hardship and deprivation for the islanders, many of whom were compelled to travel to the mainland or Japan for work. Residents of Jeju were active in the Korean independence movement during the period of Japanese ruleHilty, Anne (2011). Jeju Island: Reaching to the Core of Beauty. Korea Essentials. Republic of Korea: The Korea Foundation..  After independence in South Korea  =1948 Jeju Uprising= On April 3, 1948, against a background of an ongoing ideological struggle for control of Korea and a variety of grievances held by islanders against the local authorities, the many communist sympathizers on the island attacked police stations and government offices. The brutal and often indiscriminate suppression of the leftist rebellion resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of both villagers and communist radicals and the imprisonment of thousands more in internment camps. The Uprising has become a symbol of Jeju's independence from the Korean Peninsula. In 2006, almost 60 years after the Jeju Uprising, the government of South Korea apologized for its role in the killings and promised reparations. In 2019, the South Korean police and defense ministry apologized for the first time over the massacres.  Culture   Language  Jeju is the indigenous language of the Jejuans. UNESCO lists it as \\"critically endangered\\", with most of its speakers being elderly. The younger generation tends to speak Korean. In South Korea, the Jeju language is usually labeled as a Korean dialect, despite low levels of mutual intelligibility between Standard Korean.  Religion  Korean shamanism is a native religion of Jeju Island, and its teachings are mixed with Confucianism and Buddhism. Jeju Island is also one of the areas in which shamanism is most intact.Choi, Joon- sik . Folk-Religion: The Customs in Korea. Ewha Womans University Press, 2006. Other religions practiced on Jeju Island include Buddhism and Christianity.

It has smooth, silvery bark, glossy dark green, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, creamy white flowers and shortened spherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus purpurata is a mallet that typically grows to a height of but does not form a lignotuber. It has smooth, silvery grey bark that is shed in strips to reveal cream- coloured new bark. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy dark green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, nine or eleven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oblong, long and wide with a conical operculum and shallow ribs on the floral cup. Flowering has been recorded in November and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, shortened spherical capsule that is long, wide with the valves protruding but fragile. Taxonomy Eucalyptus purpurata was first formally described in 2002 by Dean Nicolle in the journal Nuytsia from material collected Bandalup Hill near Ravensthorpe. The specific epithet (purpurata) is from the Latin purpuratus meaning \\"purple\\" referring to the purplish new growth of this mallet. Distribution and habitat The Bandalup silver mallet occurs in more or less pure stands but is only known from the type location where it grows in white powdery soil containing magnesite.

The work was popular and performances continued for several weeks. Albinoni was also the first composer to write an opera on the theme of Zenobia. Action Zenobia (soprano), queen of Palmyra, has been defeated by the Roman emperor Aureliano (alto) because of the treachery of the governor of Palmyra, Ormonte (tenor), who hopes to marry his daughter Filidea (soprano) to the emperor. Zenobia refuses to submit to him, even when he offers to marry her. Infuriated, Aureliano decides to put Zenobia and her son to death, but when he overhears Ormonte offer to kill him and Zenobia refuses, he thinks better of it. Instead, Aureliano restores Zenobia to her throne. Ormonte is exiled and unity and order restored. Style Marchi’s libretto did not give his characters great emotional presence and offered little insight into their motivations. Albinoni was an experienced writer of instrumental music but a newcomer to opera; the sung music he wrote consisted mostly of standard da capo arias which overall lacked great dramatic power. The arias are generally short to keep the action moving and provide interest through contrast. Modern revival The opera’s first modern performance was at the Damascus Opera House in 2008. It was also performed at La Fenice in Venice in 2018.

Reed is the reigning World Middleweight Champion in his first reign. History On the February 16, 2019 episode of Fusion, Ace Austin defeated Rich Swann in a middleweight match. Swann was frustrated at the referee Doug Markham's biased officiating, which led to Swann attacking him and announcer Rich Bocchini in rage. As a result, the MLW management suspended Swann (in storyline). Swann appealed against the suspension but his appeal was rejected. Fellow middleweight Myron Reed protested against Swann's suspension and even wrote \\"Free Swann\\" with a tape on his mouth. On the March 23 episode of Fusion, Reed lost a match to Gringo Loco due to being distracted with his \\"Free Swann\\" movement and attacked the referee in response, which led to management suspending him as well for six weeks. Swann was reinstated a few days later and upon Reed's return, the two began a \\"Justice\\" movement in protest against biased officiating by the referees primarily Markham. Markham would accuse the two of harassment. Shortly after, Swann left MLW while Reed formed an alliance with Jordan Oliver at Kings of Colosseum where Oliver helped Reed in defeating Rey Horus. The duo would soon be joined by Kotto Brazil, who also protested over biased officiating. On July 22, MLW.com announced that the three would be forming a group called \\"Injustice\\". They competed in their first match as a trio on the August 31 episode of Fusion, where they defeated Air Wolf, Gringo Loco and Zenshi in a six-man tag team match. They continued to feud with various middleweights over the next few months and defeated Gringo Loco, Puma King and Septimo Dragon in a trios match at MLW's first-ever pay-per-view event Saturday Night SuperFight. On the November 11 episode of Fusion, Reed defeated Teddy Hart to win the World Middleweight Championship after Contra Unit member Josef Samael threw a fireball into Hart's face. Oliver and Brazil would defeat Gringo Loco and Zenshi in an elimination tag team match on the November 28 episode of Fusion. On the December 14 episode of Fusion, Injustice protested on not being selected into the Opera Cup tournament but were challenged by King Mo and the returning ACH to a tag team match, which Oliver and Brazil lost.

The area of the sanctuary is , and it is located on the eastern and northern hills of Bangladesh. The nearest town is Rangamati ( which is from the sanctuary. The western boundary of the sanctuary is formed by the Kassalong River. Description The climatic conditions are typically sub-tropical with a dry period from November to May. The mean annual rainfall is with heavy rainfall in the monsoon season of July and August. The sanctuary area is bounded on the southern side by steep rugged hills. The soil is clay in the valley and pale brown to yellow-red (acidic) loam on the hills. A dam at Kaptai () was constructed as a part of Karnaphuli hydroelectric project resulting in submergence of a large portion of the sanctuary. Humidity is high throughout the year. The IUCN protected area category is II. History Two forest villages of 112 inhabitants were setup in 1950. More recently, a large population of Rohingya have settled inside the sanctuary. Biodiversity The sanctuary has a tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen type of forest. It is covered with dense shrubby vegetation with patches of dense forest and bamboos. Flora The forest type is mainly tropical evergreen in the valleys and areas adjoining the rivers and lakes. The tree species growing are mainly Civit (Swintonia floribunda), Garjan (Dipterocarpus turbinatus)., Tula tree (Pterygota alata), Quercus spp. and Castanopsis. The other forest type is tropical moist deciduous. The trees found in this forest type are mainly Dipterocarpus sps; Mangifera indica; Amoora lawii; Cinnamomum sps.; Syzygium cumini; Tetrameles nudiflora; Salmalia malabaricum and Albizia sps. Albizia. The trees are scattered and interspersed with extensive tracts of grassland. Fauna The Indian elephant (Elephas Maximus) is the major threatened species found in the sanctuary. They are mainly restricted to the southern part, where savannas and perennial water bodies support their populations. The other threatened species is Hoolock gibbon (Hylobates hoolock). More common species include Wild boar (Sus scrofa); Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta); Capped langur (Presbytis pileata); Dhole (Cuon alpinus); small cats; otters; Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) and Sambar (Cervus unicolor). About 123 species of birds have been reported from the sanctuary. Records describe the presence of Tiger, two species of Rhinoceros, Banteng and Gaur in the sanctuary area which have since disappeared. Threats Part of the sanctuary is allotted to the settlers from the plains. The major threats are encroachment for cultivation land, removal of forest produce, and tree cutting by local people. The construction of Kaptai dam has also resulted in loss of wildlife in the area.

Heinrich was a descendant of the noble family of the Wartenbergs from the area of Baar on the upper Danube. Initially, he was a priest on Reichenau island. He moved to Saint Gall before Abbot Berchtold, his relative, died. On 14 June 1272, he was elected abbot by the convent of the abbey. However, the ministeriales concurrently elected Ulrich von Güttingen instead. Ulrich found stronger support, which led to Heinrich fleeing the abbey. Bishop Eberhard of Constance gave him refuge in Arbon and pope Gregory X sent Ludwig of Dillingen as an arbitrator to settle the emerging dispute. While the feud of the two abbots was already reaching destructive proportions, Heinrich died unexpectedly on 26 April 1274. He is buried in the Galluskapelle in Arbon, where Gallus, founder of Saint Gall, had last been active.

The film ran in theaters from 12 August 1993 until 1 September 1993. The film is separated into 3 different stories, a male prostitute falling in love with a violent police officer; a kind social worker falling in love with a gangster; a naive virgin falling in love with a doctor.  Plot  Ching Sing (Richard Ng) is a hardworking father, his wife died when their children was young so he spent most of his life taking care of his children. He has 3 daughters, Ching Siu Tung (Brigitte Lin), Ching Siu Nam (Maggie Cheung), Ching Siu Sze (Chingmy Yau) and 1 son, Ching Siu Pei (Jimmy Lin). Ching Sing wants his daughters to get married, so he fakes a terminal illness and forces them get married. Siu Tung, who is a police officer, meets a male prostitute called Simon Tse Sai (Tony Leung Ka-fai) because of a case. She offers him money to be her boyfriend for 1 day to lie to her father. Simon accidentally falls in love with Siu Tung and tries everything to let Siu Tung fall in love with him, after failing and embarrassing himself multiple times, Siu Tung finally falls in love with Simon. Siu Nam on the other hand is a social worker, she meets a poor gangster called Wu Ying (Jacky Cheung) and decides to help his family. Siu Nam accidentally falls in love with Wu Ying and tries to join the underworld to be with him. Because of this, Wu Ying decides to leave the underworld and start a brand new life with Siu Nam. Siu Sze, who is a doctor, meets a 27 year old virgin called Lee Chi Ko (Ekin Cheng) through his mom. Chi Ko's mom tells her that he is afraid of sex and she has been trying to find Chi Ko a girlfriend for ages. Siu Sze doesn't believe he's afraid of sex so she pranks him by tempting him to have sex, but it fails. Siu Sze realizes that he cares about her a lot and they fall in love with each other. After they tell their father Ching Sing that they are getting married, Ching Sing reveals that his long time pen pal Chi Sum Chan (Sandra Ng) is coming to Hong Kong.

It lies above sea level.OS Survey Meigle, North Ayrshire Skelmorlie Castle and glen lie nearby. The Meigle Burn has its confluence with the Skelmorlie Burns to the east of Skelmorlie Bridge. The modern spelling 'Meigle' will be used for consistency. A Meigle village exists in the Perth & Kinross. History In the 1750s a mill stood close to the Meigle Burn and Skelmorlie Water, the mills presence surviving as the place-name 'Millburn'. The first OS maps gives the spelling as 'Meagle'.Rothesay (29), Revised: 1895, Published: 1897 In 1855-57 Meagle (sic) consisted of a cottage house and buildings leased by the late A.H.Campbell Esq from the Earl of Glasgow.Ayrshire OS Name Book.

It was converted and extended to become a private dwelling.Love, Dane (2003). Ayrshire : Discovering a County. Ayr : Fort Publishing. . p.9 A mission hall is shown on the OS map of 1909. In 1855 a new road had been built close to the coast and Bridgend House and its grounds stand on the old toll road route. A bathing house is shown on the north side of the Skelmorlie Burn with a footpath leading to it. A school is also shown on the outskirts of the hamlet that served Meigle and the surrounding farms.Ayrshire, Sheet I, Surveyed: 1855, Published: 1857 In 1909 the post office is no longer shown on OS maps, but a letter box is present as it still is. The school is also not indicated, however the boat house is marked. A mission hall is however still present.Ayrshire I.11 (Largs) Publication date:1910 Revised:1909 Transport The old road in the 1750s from Largs to Greenock via Inverkip used to run mainly inland, close to Skelmorlie Castle on its eastern side, crossing a rather narrow Bridge over Skelmorlie Water and then running further inland via Knock Castle to Largs, Irvine, etc.Roy Lowlands With the establishment of the coast road a new bridge was built over the Skelmorlie Water and the old bridge and that section of the old road became an entrance to Bridgend House. The 1832 Thomson's map shows the new coastal toll road with a new bridge at Meagle (sic) named Haining Bridge End.John Thomson's Atlas of Scotland, 1832 The Serpent Mound Above the hamlet lies the 'Serpent Mound', named after the curved shape of the earthwork. It is said to have been had connections with the cult of sun worship. Smith records that despite the serpentine shape it is a natural stratified structure formed from stratified deposits on the old raised beach eroded by streams that run on either side.Smith, John (1895). Prehistoric Man in Ayrshire. London : Elliot Stock. p.1. A Dr Phenè discovered this structure and excavations revealed a paved platform shaped like a segment of a circle, together with many bones and charcoal.Harvey, Page 95 As stated, the mound itself may well be entirely natural; however, the paved platform is a genuine artifact; it is not listed by the relevant authorities.Smart, Page 6 Ashcraig House The Victorian letterbox Ashcraig House on the Forth of Clyde had a boat house and a bathing house. Spacious formal gardens are overlooked by a circa 1840 pink stone marine villa.Close, Rob and Riches, Anne (2012). The Buildings of Scotland : Ayrshire and Arran. London : Yale University Press. p. 539. Etymology The place-name Meigle in Perth and Kinross may be from the Old English for 'midge gill'. The Meigle hamlet in North Ayrshire that has links with the Scandinavian influences that are common on the west coast of Scotland, is thought to be derived from the Norse ' mjo gil' meaning 'narrow gill' or 'narrow opening'.Johnston, James B. (1934). Place-Names of Scotland. London:John Murray. p.250 Meigle Bay One of the markers for the 'Arran Measured Mile' is located on the beach at Meigle.

Career Kenneth Mackenzie of Suddie served as a Captain in Dumbarton's Regiment in France in 1666, and later as a Royalist in Scotland. He was made commander of an Independent Highland Company raised to help keep order in the Highlands on behalf of the Scottish Government, and in 1685, had received instructions from the Privy Council of Scotland to step-up more aggressive and punitive action against the caterans and broken men. They had been so successful in this task that it was recommended that another Independent Highland Company should be set up to help keep the peace in the south. In 1688, the Privy Council ordered Mackenzie of Suddie and his company to support Mackintosh of Mackintosh in his feud against MacDonald of Keppoch. He was killed fighting against the MacDonalds in the subsequent Battle of Mulroy in August 1688,Simpson (1996). p. 79. and his Independent Highland Company suffered very heavy losses.Simpson (1996). pp. 154-155.

The event aired live on television as a special episode of Fusion on beIN Sports. Fourteen matches were contested at the event, with two matches airing live. The main event of the live broadcast was a steel cage match, in which Tom Lawlor retained the MLW World Heavyweight Championship against Low Ki. The undercard featured a lucha libre tag team match between The Lucha Brothers (Pentagon Jr. and Rey Fenix) and Team AAA (Laredo Kid and Taurus). The event also featured the television debut of Contra Unit and marked the beginning of the lengthy rivalry between Tom Lawlor and Contra Unit. Production Background On November 7, 2018, MLW.com announced that MLW would hold an event in Chicago on March 2, 2019 titled Intimidation Games, which was first held as a television taping for Fusion on May 3, 2018. After the SuperFight event in February 2019, MLW announced that it would produce Intimidation Games as a live televised special episode of Fusion on beIN Sports on March 2. Storylines Tom Lawlor was the defending MLW World Heavyweight Champion heading into the event. The card consisted of matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by MLW's writers. Storylines were played out on MLW's television program Fusion. At SuperFight, Tom Lawlor cashed in his Battle Riot opportunity to defeat Low Ki to win the MLW World Heavyweight Championship. On February 13, MLW.com reported that Low Ki's manager Salina de la Renta had invoked a rematch clause for Low Ki at Intimidation Games, where Lawlor would defend the title against Low Ki in a steel cage match. At SuperFight, Lucha Brothers lost the MLW World Tag Team Championship to The Hart Foundation. On February 11, MLW.com announced that Lucha Brothers would be facing Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide representatives Laredo Kid and Taurus in a lucha libre tag team match at Intimidation Games. Event The first match was a lucha libre tag team match between The Lucha Brothers (Pentagon Jr. and Rey Fenix) and Team AAA (Laredo Kid and Taurus). Pentagon and Fenix superkicked Taurus and then nailed a springboard package piledriver on Laredo for the win. Next was the main event steel cage match, in which Tom Lawlor defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Low Ki. Near the climax of the match, both men fought on the cage top and tried to escape the cage and traded punches and kicks until both of them fell to the floor but Lawlor's feet touched first and he was declared as the winner. After the match, Lawlor's former teammate Simon Gotch attacked him and the debuting Jacob Fatu and Josef Samael joined Gotch in attacking Lawlor and the three declared themselves Contra Unit and covered Lawlor in a customized Contra flag. Aftermath Contra Unit began a lengthy feud with Tom Lawlor, which resulted in the group attacking him on many occasions over the next few months. This set up a title match between Lawlor and Contra Unit member Jacob Fatu at Kings of Colosseum.

Considered the last direct lineage princess Fon, her African names given by the voduns were Ronçoiama and Rotopameraçulem (name given after the barco, or initiation ceremony). Mother (or Mãe, in Portuguese) Andresa coordinated the Casas das Minas, the most important temple of Tambor de Mina in Maranhão, between 1914 and 1954. Died at 100 years of age.  Biography  Cajazeira, centenary fruit tree in the Casa das Minas A descendant of slaves, Mother Andresa was born in Caxias. She came still young to São Luís, seeking health treatment. She went into a trance with the vodum Tói Poliboji (a deity of the Tambor de Mina) the age of seven or eight. She completed her initiation on a barco of 12 vodunsis hunjaís (the \\"complete daughters\\", priestesses who receive in addition to a vodum, a tobossi), probably before 1900, when the temple was headed by Mother Luisa, the second head of the Casa das Minas. In 1914, he succeeded Mãe Hosana (who had succeeded Mãe Luisa), when he was about 60 years old, and devoted himself entirely to the house. She never married, and she would have worked selling food in her youth to support herself. She was friends with several ancient priestess of São Luís, having had respectful relations with other ancient terreiros. Known for its generosity, she was much sought after by people from various cities of Maranhão, even in case of illness, as there was a garden with medicinal plants in the temple. Several friends sent groceries to the Casa das Minas, and Mother Andressa ordered to distribute the leftover food so that they did not spoil. She had about a hundred godchildren, and she loves children very much. She raised Maneco, chief player of the House; Dona Amância, head of the House between 1972 and 1976; and Dona Deni, chief between 1997 and 2015. She did not prepare other barcos (initiation ceremonies) for vodunsis hunjaís. Casa das Minas While heading the temple, she had to sell jewelry to pay taxes during World War II. In the Estado Novo, there were persecutions of the terreiros in São Luís and attempts to transfer them to the outskirts of the city. However, Governor Paulo Ramos authorized the Casa das Minas and the Casa de Nagô to remain because they are very old. For the last 20 years of her life, she was visited by several Brazilian and foreign journalists and researchers, who interviewed her and she provided information about the worship and the history of the temple. At the end of her life she could no longer walk, although she was still lucid. In 1953, President Café Filho was in São Luís and visited Casa das Minas. She died on April 20, 1954, on a Holy Thursday, after directing the House for four decades, and there was a year's mourning in the temple.

It is part of the Mapoch (Southern Ndebele people) land seized by poor settlers in 1883 after the Mapoch War against King Nyabêla. Each veteran was granted 8 morgens of the land, the rest reserved for communal pasture. The surveyor who measured the land the following year was named G.R. von Wielligh, and he was said to have named the city after the tinderbox (called “tonteldoos” in Afrikaans) he lost there. However, Samuel Smit had already named his plot that in October 1883, more likely after the local weed Haplocarpa scaposa (one of several plants popularly known as “tontelbossie”). The velvety back leaf, easily flammable when dry, was used to make tinderboxes at the time, and several species’ leaves continue to be known as “tontel.” Flint could also be found in the area. Geography White settlers began farming on the eastern side of the Tonteldoos Valley in the 1850s, including the Steenkamp brothers. Their three farms were Houtenbek, Klipbankspruit, and Draaikral. In 1879, the Irishman Michael O’Grady purchased Houtenbek, where his descendants still farm. These farms are located above the Transvaal Supergroup, 2.5-billion-year-old rocks, while the western side of the valley is part of the Bushveld Igneous Complex, which is around 2 billion years old. The veld types differ as well. On the eastern slopes, there is nothing but pure grassveld since it is too cold for trees save for a few stray, stunted shrubs. On the western side, there is instead Bankenveld, largely grassy but featuring twenty different species of trees. History of Houtenbek In 1847, Houtenbek Farm was awarded to Willem Steenkamp. The local field cornet, C.M. du Plooy, visited on March 15, 1851 to survey the property. At the time, the standard method was to mark a central point, usually the homestead itself, and time horse rides to various points at the edge of the property. Willem called it “Houtenbek” (“forest stream”) because there were several streams on the property, some of them tree-lined. During the First Mapoch War (1860-1865), all the family abandoned the farm. Michael O’Grady was born in County Clare, Ireland in 1839, but immigrated to South Africa in the 1860s. He purchased Houtenbek in 1879 for £500. He bought it sight unseen and therefore was unaware that he was buying Mapoch land, which King Nyabêla reported to the magistrate in Lydenburg. Henrique Shepstone, the British Secretary of Native Affairs, visited with Nyabêla in July 1880 to resolve the situation, and with the failure of these negotiations a Mapoch Commission was appointed. The First Boer War and the Mapoch War rendered the points moot, and O’Grady would settle the farm in July 1883, albeit elbow to elbow with poor whites both beyond and within Houtenbek’s western fringe. A few lawsuits secured his borders by 1891. In 1887, O’Grady began a diary, still in the family’s possession, which primarily concentrated on his farming. A clay house was finished in 1894, and the first year recorded him moving 158 cattle, 1,400 sheep, three horses, and 513 goats from the sweetveld to the laeveld in the winter, as was the custom at the time. He also appointed a Mr. Berkshire to teach his children to read and write, and he hired several black servants. Some earned ten shillings or £1 a month, while others worked a year for a calf. At the outbreak of the Second Boer War, O’Grady was too old to fight, but his son Thomas Frederick enlisted in the Boer Commandos. On April 20, 1901, the last entry in his diary read: “English troops at Korff’s farm Windhoek.” Soon after, they reached Houtenbek, burning down the entire farmhouse and imprisoning the entire family in the concentration camp near Balmoral. One of Michael’s granddaughters was buried there. On September 11, 1901, Roland Schikkerling wrote: “O’Grady’s farm is now a blackened desert. All that could be burned is lost, even the walls of the house. This place, once so busy and hospitable, is now a desolate wilderness. The fat cattle, the beautiful sheep, the proud horses that once teemed in herds are all gone. The gifted and cordial people were carried away—the fruit of their life’s work ruined. The rows of pear and apple trees’ white blossoms and the pink ones of the peach trees make a mockery of the scene.” Coat of arms Tonteldoos has its own coat of arms. It was designed by the late Francois Viljoen and patterned off that of the old Tonteldoos school, with the addition of trout and Mapoch lilies. The school was meant to be built on a plot known as “the Nile,” but a surveying error missed that this was pasture, so a different location needed to be procured. This was renamed thus “the Youth.” After the war, the British built a proper stone building under the name “Tondeldoos School.” The building can be found at 25°19'04\\"S 29°58'36\\"O (WGS84). After educating generations, the school closed in 1955. Plants Flowers The Tonteldoos Valley is home to several rare and endangered species, such as the aloe Aloe reitzii var. reitzii. Another endangered species is Eucomis montana, also commonly called the pineapple flower. There are at least three species of arum lily, including the endangered Mapoch lily (Zantedeschia pentlandii). Another threatened plant found here is Haemanthus humilis ssp. hirsitus. They usually hide in stone cracks. Brunsvigia radulosa, however, blossoms in the open veld. Experts have found more than twenty species of orchids in the valley, including Eulophia ovalis and Satyrium hallackii. Aloe pretoriensis, Aloe castanea, Aloe longibracteata, Aloe cooperii, and Aloe verdoorniae all bloom at certain times of year here. Trees Common Blankenveld (Highveld) trees found here include the shiny-leaf buckthorn (Rhamnus prinoides), mountain hard pear (Olinia emarginata), flame thorn (Senegalia ataxacantha), wild olive (Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata), kiepersol (Cussonia paniculata), and woolly bottlebrush (Greyia radlkoferi). At the highest points, just before the transition to the pure grassveld, there are also Protea roupelliae. Mixed bushveld trees predominate around the Mapoch Caves near Roossenekal. Plants endemic to Sekhukhuneland Geology, weather, altitude, and fire contribute to the endemism of many plant species in South Africa. Sekhukhuneland, for instance, is home to more than fifty species endemic plant species, and includes the northern side of the Tonteldoos Valley. The grey cabbage tree, or Cussonia transvaalensis, is a case in point, as are the white karee’s cousin Rhus wimsii, Tetraselago nelsonii, and the aforementioned Mapoch lily. Common names Canthium suberosum, another tonteldoos plant, goes by the name “kurkbokdrol” (Afrikaans for “cork goat dropping”) due to its resemblance to a wine cork. The spiny buds of the small knobwood (Zanthoxylum capense), akin to teats on udders, likewise earned it the common name “kleinperdekram” (“small horse breast”). False horsewood (Hippobromus pauciflorus) is named “basterperdepis” (“hybrid horse urine”) and Acalypha angustata var. glabra is termed “katpisbossie” (“cat urine bush”) based on the smell of their leaves. Dombeya rotundifolia, the dikbas or South African wild pear whose blossoms emerge at the start of spring, is labeled “drolpeer” (“excrement pear”). Agricultural history There are several peach farms in the area. In the old days, each farm would have several peach trees on it, usually clingstone peaches that ripened with the New Year, prompting a rush to dry and sell them. In the fall, smoke from the poplar bushes signaled the fire times. Schikkerling’s January 30, 1901 entry states that during the war, “many of our younger men attend catechism, while many of the elders distill brandy on the nearby fruit farms.” By the 1930s, “Uncle” Joe and “Aunt” Hessie Kidson of Boomkraal were the most prominent citizens of Tonteldoos. Since the road through Tonteldoos from Boomkraal to Pospaal was often muddy in the rainy season, they could easily keep watch for slow-moving customs officials through a system where small boys with mirrors would carry night traffic after the police had gone to bed. By the time the police reached Boomkraal, the kettle was hidden and Aunt Hessie could distill in peace. In the 1950s, Rev. Dednam of Laersdrif set out to end the moonshine industry in the Mapoch area by buying out all the boilers at a high price only to destroy them. The distillers gave him the money hoping to buy better boilers, but there would only be two quality ones in town by 2000 in Tonteldoos: Coen Swart of Ebenhaezer, Welgelukt, & Zwartdam, who made orange brandy; and Johann Dietlof Kunneke of Kristalwater, who distilled many fruits until the excise team caught him.

Even before the Soviet Union developed its first atomic bomb, the US made preparations to detect and analyze nuclear testing, and when the first Soviet bomb was detonated in 1949 there was a concerted effort to determine its yield, location, and the subsequent transport of radioactive materials. Under Machta’s direction, the Special Projects Section assisted in weapons testing at the Nevada and Bikini test sites by providing predictions of near-term downwind nuclear fallout from the explosions. Machta also studied the long-term fallout resulting from radioactive materials injected into the stratosphere by nuclear testing. He realized that radioactive materials in the atmosphere could also serve as useful tracers to understand atmospheric circulation. The Atomic Energy Commission initially minimized the risk from long-term fallout using a simple model developed by Willard Libby that presumed fallout would be well-mixed in the stratosphere, would reach the ground over a period of 10 years, and be uniformly distributed over the surface of the Earth. Machta used the more realistic Brewer-Dobson model of atmospheric circulation, showing that radioactive fallout would reach the ground sooner and be concentrated in the populated mid-latitudes, and thus produce much greater health risks. He presented these conclusions in Congressional testimony, contributing significantly to the scientific rationale for ending above-ground nuclear testing. Machta participated in the 1958 Experts’ Conference in Geneva that lead to the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Machta's concerns extended to other pollutants in the atmosphere including acid rain, ozone, and most significantly, greenhouse gases. He played a central role in establishing and, from 1971 to 1989, supervising the Geophysical Monitoring for Climatic Change program (now in the NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory). The GMCC program incorporated the already existing Mauna Loa and South Pole Observatories operated by Charles David Keeling, whose long-term measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide would eventually be recognized as essential for the study of global warming Machta meanwhile became an expert on stratospheric ozone, publishing numerous scientific papers on the subject while overseeing the United States network of Dobson ozone spectrophotometers. He served as a member of the International Ozone Commission from 1964–1971. At a conference in 1972, Machta alerted F. Sherwood Rowland to James Lovelock’s measurements showing that chloroflourocarbons (CFCs) are present in the stratosphere, sparking the research that led to the discovery that CFCs deplete the ozone layer. Machta also worked on the transport of acid rain and other pollution through the atmosphere. He was the U.S. co-chair of the International Air Quality Advisory Board of the International Joint Commission which studies air pollution that affects both the United States and Canada. Later life After his official retirement as its director in 1989, Machta continued to do research at the Air Resources Laboratory until shortly before his death from leukemia on August 31, 2001 at the Georgetown University Hospital.

As a result, Foxtel planned to replace it with another general entertainment channel once TV1's carriage deal had expired. In October 2013 it was announced TVHits, a channel owned and operated by Foxtel Networks, would replace TV1 on 1 January 2014. The branding used an exclamation point in place of the \\"I\\" character. On 1 January 2014, the channel launched on pay television provider Foxtel (which included its streaming service Foxtel Go as well as its IPTV service Foxtel Play) as well as on Australian IPTV provider Fetch TV. On 1 January 2019 TVHits ceased broadcasting on Fetch TV as the provider, and TVHits parent company Foxtel were unable to renew their supply agreement. =TVHits programming= At launch, TVHits' programming primarily consisted of hit American shows from Warner Bros., Carsey-Werner, Sony Pictures Television, CBS Studios International and NBCUniversal. However, following the rebrand of 111 on 1 November 2015, the channel's sitcoms moved to 111 and as a result, the channel became solely focused on dramas. Fox Crime (2019–present) In late 2019 Foxtel announced they would launch four new entertainment channels on 7 November 2019, one of which was Fox Crime. Fox Crime was described as offering crime and mystery series such as the CSI and NCIS franchises. This new channel would replace the existing TVHits which offered similar content.

It had been stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia who hoped to sell it on and got in touch with Poggi, who in turn contacted the Florentine art dealer Alfredo Geri to verify the work's authenticity. Poggi also put in place a plan to protect and safeguard Florence's artworks after Italy's entry into the Second World War in 1940, identifying several safe locations to host the objects and thus ensuring they remained undamaged by bombing and out of reach of Nazi looting. He retired in 1949 after reaching the age limit for his roles but the Comune di Firenze decided it wished him to continue overseeing the institutes and monuments relating to his own subject areas.

She specialized on three- dimensional works, made mostly with found objects. She exhibited at several galleries in New York City including the Bertha Schaefer Gallery and Rosenberg Gallery, as well as in Europe, namely in Switzerland, Germany, France and United Kingdom.  Life  Ilse Bechhold was born in Nuremberg, Germany, on 24 October 1917 in a family of Abraham Bechhold and Pauline Mann.

Life  Born in , Luther studied musicology, philosophy and theology in Göttingen and Berlin. In 1936 he received his doctorate with a thesis on Gallus Dreßler in Göttingen. He completed his studies with a doctorate and state examination. He entered the academic library service in 1939; after his subject examination in 1941 at the Berlin State Library he worked at the Göttingen University Library. Under he was promoted to deputy director, and in 1958 he succeeded him in his office. Luther was particularly committed to the re-establishment of the German [interlibrary loan] after the end of the Second World War and to (central) cataloguing. Thus the \\"Central Catalogue of Foreign Literature\\" was maintained in Göttingen, which formed an important basis for interlibrary loan. He also founded the Niedersächsische Zentralkatalog, set up the Göttingen journal reference and pushed for a reworking of the Göttingen . In addition to his work in the library, he was also active in teaching and published several articles on library science and librarianship. In 1959 he was appointed honorary professor in Göttingen, where he taught general bibliography and documentation, library science and history of science. For the second edition of the \\"Handbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaften\\" he revised the chapter on the use of libraries, together with Wilhelm Krabbe he wrote the \\"Lehrbuch der Bibliotheksverwaltung\\". With Willi Kahl he published the Repertorium der Musikwissenschaft (Repertory of Musicology), an important location reference for music literature in German libraries. On the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach he prepared the exhibition \\"Documenta\\", which was shown in Göttingen, Schaffhausen, Florence and Milan and attracted more than 20,000 visitors. Since 1961, Luther also served as director of the Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Institut in Göttingen. Until shortly before his death, Luther was active in various professional associations: He was part of the (VDB), the Library Committee of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) as well as that of the Association Internationale des Bibliothèques Musicales (Chairman from 1951 to 1953) and was Chairman of the \\"University Libraries\\" Section of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions.

The earliest surviving frescoes in the villa such as the lunette Vertumnus and Pomono by Pontormo, elegiacally evoke rural like, but the building's main theme instead became the glorification of the Medici family after it acquired the titles of Giuliano de' Medici, Duke of Nemours and Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino in 1520. Andrea del Sarto's work shows a laurel-wreathed Julius Caesar receiving ambassadors, with Caesar as a symbol or 'stand-in' for Lorenzo de' Medici.

History  The battalion was raised on 1 November 1886 by renaming Alpini Battalion \\"Valtellina\\" of the 5th Alpini Regiment. The battalion's name, like the names of all Alpini battalions raised before World War I, was the name of the location where the battalion was based; in the Tirano battalion's case the village of Tirano in the Valtellina valley. As with all Alpini battalions the recruits for the battalions were drafted exclusively from the area surrounding the battalions base. The battalion consisted of the 46th, 48th and 49th Alpini companies. The Italian Army in Russia's retreat to Nikolayevka The Tirano battalion's history is intertwined with the history of the 5th Alpini Regiment, with which it served in World War I and in World War II. During the latter the regiment was part of the 2nd Alpine Division \\"Tridentina\\" and served in the Greco-Italian War and as part of the Italian Army in Russia on the Eastern Front, where regiment and battalion barely escaped annihilation during the Battle of Nikolayevka in January 1943. For its conduct during the two campaigns the 5th Alpini Regiment was awarded two Gold Medals of Military Valour. The 150 survivors of the Tirano battalion were repatriated in spring 1943 and garrisoned in the village of Mühlbach in South Tyrol. After Italy changed sides with the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943, regiment and battalion were disbanded by the Germans.  Cold War  After World War II the 5th Alpini Regiment was reformed on 1 January 1953, in the city of Meran with the battalions \\"Tirano\\" and \\"Edolo\\", and was the infantry component of the Alpine Brigade \\"Orobica\\". During the 1975 army reform the 5th Alpini was disbanded on 30 November 1975 and its battalions came under the direct command of the Orobica brigade. As the traditions and war flag of the 5th Alpini Regiment were assigned to the \\"Morbegno\\" battalion, the Tirano battalion was granted a new war flag on 12 November 1976 by decree 846 of the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Leone. The two Gold Medals of Military Valour and the Messina earthquake Medal of Merit awarded to the 5th Alpini Regiment, were duplicated for the new flag of the Tirano battalion, and the Bronze Medal of Civil Valour awarded to the Tirano battalion for its work after the Gleno Dam disaster was transferred from the flag of the 5th Alpini to the Tirano's flag. The battalion's structure on 1 December 1975 was as follows: * 30px Alpini Battalion \\"Tirano\\", in Mals ** 15px 46th Alpini Company, in Glurns ** 15px 48th Alpini Company, in Mals ** 15px 49th Alpini Company, in Glurns ** 15px 109th Mortar Company, in Mals The battalion's task in case of war with the Warsaw Pact was to defend the Reschen Pass. With the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to downsize its forces and on 27 March 1991 the Tirano was disbanded and its flag transferred to the shrine of the flags at the Vittoriano in Rome.

According to a 2007 New York Post article on the establishment of a “cooperative venture” with FBI agents stationed in Rome and Italian National Police working at the FBI Headquarters in Washington, Mannino once tried to get Frank Sinatra to help crooner Al Martino find work in Las Vegas, and was a \\"rising crime-family star\\". In March 2019, Gambino soldier Paul Semplice, 55, was given a 28-month prison term for running a loan- sharking operation, after pleading guilty in October 2018 to loaning money to a stressed-out business owner and a gambling addict who wound up dying from a stroke. Semplice described beating one victim in a wire-tapped call, and told a cooperating witness during a wiretapped call that Mannino was his supervisor.

Matches are much shorter, usually played for ten minutes, without any half- time break. The game was invented by Ben Ryan as variant of rugby sevens with more speed and action, and was first launched on 29 October 2019 as a six teams international tournament in The O2 Arena, London. The rules (law variations) are similar to rugby sevens and are approved by World Rugby. Rules  The game is intended as fast-paced version of sevens rugby, but contrary to this seven-a-side version, its rules vastly diverge from the rugby union classic rules : * The pitch is half-sized compared to rugby sevens, with 55m x 32m dimensions plus 5m run offs. * There are five players per side plus seven rolling substitutes that are allowed to come in at breaks in play following tries. * There is a single scoring unit : 5 points per try without conversions, drop goals or penalties. * Kick-offs are replaced by tap starts on the 5m line, with opposing team standing 10m back. * Chip kicks allowed but not box kicks, up and unders or any kick over 10m in height (referee is supposed to receive real time notification using ball tracking technology) * Line outs are replaced by quick throws made by a substitute. * There are only three person per scrums with no pushing and hooking is allowed. * Drawn matches are settled by a ‘one on one’ involving one defender on 5m line and one attacker 30m from goal with a ball. The attacker has 10 seconds to score. It is played as per a sudden death penalty shoot out – if Team A scores, Team B must then score or Team A wins the match. History The project was initially launched by Ben Ryan, former Olympic gold medalist Fiji's coach, with the cooperation of both World Rugby and RFU; the first tournament being held in London, England.  Tournaments * Rugby X London tournament at The O2 Arena. **Sides included France, Ireland, United States and England national sevens teams for the women's tournament and France, Ireland, United States, England and Argentina national sevens teams plus a Barbarian F.C. invitational team for the men's tournament. ** women's tournament was won by England and the men's tournament by Argentina.

It was first published in the United States as a paperback original in April 2018 by Ace Books, and in the United Kingdom by Gollancz. An audio edition of the book was published in April 2018 in the United States by Tantor Audio, and in the United Kingdom by Orion Publishing. Before Mars is the third book in Newman's four-book Planetfall series, and takes place on Mars during the same period as the events on Earth in the previous book, After Atlas. Before Mars concerns Dr. Anna Kubrin, a geologist and artist, who has been sent to the planet to paint Martian landscapes. The novel was a finalist for the 2018 BSFA Award for Best Novel. Plot summary Background In an interview with Space.com, Newman said she wanted Before Mars to be a \\"psychological thriller\\". She wanted to address the subject of memory, how people process it, and how it affects their perceptions of reality and mental illness. Newman said she also wanted to investigate how people in the future would react to being able to record and playback in memory everything they see, hear and feel via a \\"cam lens\\" and neural implants. She asked, \\"does that affect how much you process reality [and how] you process memory?\\" In an interview with Syfy Wire, Newman described the groundwork she had done for the book: \\"I did a lot of research on Mars itself, on traveling to it, and on geology and the survival challenges posed by living on [the planet]\\". She added that because the story takes place some 80 years into the future, \\"I had a little leeway in terms of the spacecraft technology.\\" On the subject of gov-corps that feature in her Planetfall books, Newman said she envisages a future where huge corporations control governments and monitor their citizens via neural implants. She added that the prospect of gov-corps becoming a reality is not quite so far-fetched. \\"This is the future I foresee if we continue as we are, with no change in political structures and no change in the ideologies of the most powerful political factions.\\" Reception Writing at Den of Geek, Megan Crouse called Before Mars \\"a thrilling science fiction mystery, a societal critique, and a character study\\". She said Newman treats Anna with \\"careful attention\\". Her flashbacks \\"work well\\" in revealing just enough to create suspense, and the story's first-person point-of-view fills it with \\"claustrophobia and anxiety\\". Anna's difficult marriage is sensitively handled, and reminded Crouse of the marriage of convenience in Sheri Tepper's 1989 science fiction novel, Grass. Newman's other characters are all seen through Anna's limited perspective, and while none are \\"poorly drawn\\", they are not as well developed as the protagonist. Crouse concluded that while Before Mars \\"works on many levels\\", she felt that not all the issues raised are full addressed and the \\"ending slumps\\". In a review in Locus magazine, Adrienne Martini wrote that in Before Mars Newman builds on her Planetfall universe with its corporation-controlled governments and their citizen- monitoring via implanted chips. She remarked that Newman's narrative can be unsettling, leaving the reader \\"a little removed from the action\\", which gives the impression that her characters are wrapped in \\"a thin layer of gauze\\". Yet, Martini added, \\"it still works somehow\\". What she did feel \\"doesn't work as well\\" are the reams of backstory, which tend to \\"bog the story down\\". She said some of Anna's musings \\"read like therapy sessions\\". But overall, Martini concluded that \\"there's more enjoyable and intriguing moments in Before Mars than not\\". Liz Bourke described Before Mars as \\"a tight and claustrophobic psychological thriller of a novel\\". In a review of the book at Tor.com she wrote that as in the two previous Planetfall novels, the protagonist is an outsider who does not fit in and feels alienated. Anna feels \\"trapped by society\\", \\"trapped in her marriage\\" and \\"trapped ... on Mars\\", leaving her \\"isolated either by madness or conspiracy\\". Bourke felt that readers of After Atlas may not experience the full tension of the novel as the timelines of Before Mars and its predecessor coincide and key outcomes have already been revealed. Bourke added that despite its \\"compelling prose\\" and interesting puzzles, Before Mars \\"didn’t really speak to me\\". She said she found herself \\"lacking in a real sense of emotional investment, either in Anna as a character or in the novel's outcome\\". In a review of the book in the Los Angeles Times, Swapna Krishna described the ending as \\"stunning\\", although \\"a bit abrupt\\". But she added that the novel \\"is [more] about the journey rather than the destination\\", and it is \\"an excellent ... page-turn[er]\\". Krishna called Anna \\"a well-rounded character\\" who is open about her fears and failures. A reviewer in the Financial Times called Before Mars \\"a slow-burn psychological thriller\\" that has a \\"dark twist\\" at the end reminiscent of Paula Hawkins's 2015 novel, The Girl on the Train. Jeremy Brett wrote in Foundation: The International Review of Science Fiction that Anna's \\"self- doubt and increasing paranoia\\" adds \\"a layer of emotional complexity\\" to Before Mars that lifts it above many other similar science fiction stories. He praised the \\"flair and accuracy\\" with which Newman describes human behavior, and said her Planetfall series shows how \\"the most treacherous place in the known universe is the human heart and its capacity for doing wrong.\\" References Works cited * External links *Before Mars at Penguin Random House *Before Mars at Gollancz *Before Mars at Fantastic Fiction * Category:2018 American novels Category:2018 science fiction novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Mars in fiction Category:Ace Books books Category:Victor Gollancz Ltd books ","title":"Before Mars (novel)"},{"id":"62525091","text":"Deng Jun (born 28 November 1956) is a Chinese water polo player.

Most of the Porc-Épic River flows into the territory of the Zec des Martres, except for the last before reaching its mouth. The hydrographic slope of the Porc-Épic River is served mainly by a secondary forest road that goes up this valley for forestry and recreational tourism purposes.Open Street Map - Accessed January 18, 2019 Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector; recreational tourism activities, second. The surface of the Porc-Épic River is usually frozen from early December to late March, however, safe ice movement is generally from mid-December to mid-March.  Geography  The mouth of the Porc-Épic River is located between the territories of the Grands-Jardins National Park and Hautes-Gorges-de-la- Rivière-Malbaie National Park; between Ha! Ha! Lake and the Lac des Martres. The main hydrographic slopes near the Porc-Épic River are: * north side: Malbaie River, Cran Rouge Creek, Moreau Lake, Des Martres River; * east side: Beaulieu Lake, Lac des Martres, Barley Lake, Rivière du Gouffre; * south side: Cold Creek, Hache Lake, Coq Lake, Barley River, Malbaie River; * west side: Malbaie River, La Cruche Lake, La Cruche River, Ha! Ha! River. The Porc-Épic River originates at the mouth of Lac de la Hache (length: ; altitude: ). The mouth of this lake is located at: * west of a bay of Lac des Martres; * east of a curve of the Malbaie River; * northeast of the Barley [river]; * south- west of Beaulieu Lake; * northwest of Little Malbaie Lake, head lake of the Little Malbaie River; * south-west of a curve of the upper course of the Rivière du Gouffre; * south-east of the confluence of the Porc-Épic River and the Malbaie River. From its source (Pimpant Lake), the Porc-Épic River descends on entirely in forested and mountainous zones, with a difference of according to the following segments: * northerly crossing an unidentified lake (length: ; altitude: ) surrounded by marshes, up to the discharge (coming from the east) of Beaulieu Lake; * in a steep valley, first to the north, curving east, then north again, collecting a stream (from the northwest), a stream (coming from the northeast); * to the northwest forming two small hooks, to the discharge (from the east) of the lake of the titmouse; * northwesterly to the outlet (from the north) of an unidentified lake enclosed by mountains; * westerly in a steep valley to its mouth. The Porc-Épic River flows into a swirl zone on the west bank of the Malbaie River. This confluence is located at: * upstream of the mouth of the La Cruche River; * northeast of the mouth of La Cruche Lake; * east of the Ha! Ha! River; * north-west of lac des Martres; * southeast of Little Ha! Ha! Lake; * west of the confluence of the Malbaie River and the St. Lawrence River. From the confluence of the Porc-Épic River, the current flows down the Malbaie River to east, then south-east, which flows over the northwest shore of the St. Lawrence River.

London Airport On 15 July 1919, the world's first commercial flight occurred, when Henry Shaw (1892-1977) piloted a de Havilland DH.9 for Aircraft Transport and Travel from Hendon to Le Bourget airfield in Paris.Forging Empires and Oceans: Pioneers, Aviators and Adventurers - Forging the International Air Routes (1919-39), page 100, Robert Bluffield, 2014 The pilot did not have a passport. Jimmy Jeffs was the world's first air traffic controller at London Airport on 22 February 1922. The Mayday callsign originated at London Airport in 1921. From 1928, radio signals from Croydon, Pulham in Norfolk and Lymm in Kent triangulated the position of aircraft; a similar system was set up by Germany in 1940, known as the Battle of the Beams. Development of radar On the evening of 25 February 1935 at Stowe Nine Churches (Upper Stowe) in Northamptonshire, the so-called Daventry experiment took place with Robert Watson-Watt to prove that radar detection of aircraft was possible. Integration On Wednesday 18 June 1958, a £5m plan for coordinating air traffic control was announced. Four new radar centres would be built; previous to this, ATC personnel received aircraft positional information over the radio from pilots, not from any radar. The UK Air Traffic Service began in September 1959; it controlled air movements above 25,000 ft. Upper airspace routes, known as air ways, were created in the late 1950s. The USA had created its Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also in 1958. Coordinating organisation On Monday 10 December 1962, Julian Amery, the Minister for Aviation, announced the new National Air Traffic Control Services, with a central controller. Military air traffic control was controlled by the Military Air Traffic Organisation. By the early 1970s, the coordinating organisation was known as NATS. Controllers ATC personnel were represented by the Institution of Professional Civil Servants, which became Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists in 1989. Training In the early 1960s, both military and civil radar operators were trained at a joint school at RAF Sopley. Around sixty countries would send ATC trainees to the College of Air Traffic Control (CATC) in Dorset, including Eastern Europe. The Central Air Traffic Control School trained military ATC personnel from 1963; the first women ATC trainees began later in 1963. Aircraft movements There were 372,000 aircraft movements in the UK in 1960, 480,000 in 1962, and 610,000 by 1969.Birmingham Daily Post, 26 November 1969, page 1 In 2017, NATS handled around 2.5 million flights. The UK has the third-largest aviation network after the US and China. Up to 80% of North Atlantic air traffic passes through UK airspace. The Shanwick OCA (Shanwick Oceanic Control) was formed in 1966, and controlled from Prestwick, with two communication towers in southern Ireland and Gloucestershire. The Concorde route from Heathrow Airport to Bahrain was the world's first supersonic air transport route. Radar stations Civilian In August 1970, a new £150,000 Plessey DASR-1 radar for Titterstone Clee Hill, in Shropshire, was built.American Radio History Military In the early 1960s, the RAF had four main military radar units. European central air traffic control On Friday 20 December 1968, an agreement was signed to build Europe's first international control centre at Maastricht, to open in 1972, called the Maastricht Automatic Data Processing system or MADAP, which is now called the Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre; for the site, Plessey would built two computers, the controllers' consoles and a radar distribution unit. Much of European air traffic control is ran on the CIMACT software package. The Single European Sky was created in the late 1990s, being official from 2001.

History   World War I  The battalion was raised on 15 February 1915 with reservists of the Alpini Battalion \\"Vestone\\" of the 5th Alpini Regiment. The battalion's name, like the names of all Alpini battalions raised during World War I with first line reservists, was the name of a valley near the active battalion's base; in the Val Chiese battalion's case the Chiese valley, which extends to the north from Vestone. As with all Alpini battalions the recruits for the battalions were drafted exclusively from the area surrounding the battalions base. Initially the battalion fielded the 253rd and 254th Alpini companies, and received the 255th Alpini Company on 8 July 1915 after Italy's full mobilization after the country's entry into the war. The Val Chiese battalion's history is intertwined with the history of the 5th Alpini Regiment, with which it served during World War I. After the war the battalion was disbanded.  World War II  The battalion was reformed on 1 September 1939 and participated in the Italian invasion of France in June and July 1940. Afterwards the battalion was once more disbanded on 31 October 1940 and the battalion's reservists dismissed. However as the Greco-Italian War has grind to a halt in the Pindus mountains the battalion was already raised again in December 1940 and sent on 14 January 1941 to Albania, where it joined the 11th Alpini Regiment. After the German invasion of Greece and the Greek surrender the battalion returned to Italy and was assigned to the 2nd Alpine Division \\"Tridentina\\"'s 6th Alpini Regiment. In July 1942 the Tridentina was assigned to the Italian Army in Russia and sent to the Eastern Front, where regiment and battalion barely escaped annihilation during the Battle of Nikolayevka in January 1943. For its conduct during the campaign in Russia 6th Alpini Regiment was awarded a Gold Medal of Military Valour. The survivors of the Val Chiese battalion were repatriated in spring 1943 and garrisoned in the city of Sterzing in South Tyrol. After Italy changed sides with the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943, regiment and battalion were disbanded by the Germans.  Cold War  Alpine wall bunker in Mals Reschen On 1 July 1963 the XXIX Alpini Fortification Battalion in Sterzing was renamed Alpini Battalion \\"Val Chiese\\". The battalion was part of the Alpine Brigade \\"Orobica\\" and tasked with tasked to man fortifications in the Wipptal, Passeier and Vinschgau valleys. The \\"Val Chiese\\" fielded three active and three reserve companies with a wartime strength of more than 1,000 men; two of these companies had come from the Alpini Battalion \\"Val Camonica\\". * 30px Alpini Battalion \\"Val Chiese\\", in Sterzing ** 15px Headquarters and Services Company, in Sterzing ** 15px 250th Alpini Company, in Saltaus (Type C*, ex \\"Val Camonica\\") ** 15px 251st Alpini Company, in Reschen (Type A*, ex \\"Val Camonica\\") ** 15px 253rd Alpini Company, in Brenner (Type A) ** 15px 254th Alpini Company, in Gossensaß (Type A) ** 15px 255th Alpini Company, in Pfitsch (Type C) ** 15px 364th Alpini Company, in Franzensfeste (Type C) * Type A = fortification fully equipped, provisioned and manned; close support platoon onsite * Type B = fortification fully equipped, provisioned and manned; close support platoon off site * Type C = fortification fully equipped; provisions, crew and close support platoon off site The fortifications the Val Chiese would man in case of war with the Warsaw Pact had been built as the Alpine Wall in the early stages of World War II.

The course of this river flows into the Saint Lawrence River in the village of Port au Persil, northeast of the city of La Malbaie. The upper part of the valley of this watercourse is served by Route 138 along the northwest shore of the St. Lawrence River. However, this road spans the river from Port aux Persil to land in order to get around the coast near the river. The riparian zone is served by the Port-au-Persil road which spans the Port-au-Persil River, near its confluence with the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector; recreational and tourism activities (including resort and tourist activities), second. The surface of this stream is usually frozen from mid-December to the end of March. Nevertheless, safe ice circulation is generally from late December to mid-March.  Geography  The main hydrographic slopes near the \\"Salmon Port River\\" are: * North side: Noire River, Port aux Quilles River, Rivière de la Baie des Rochers, Saguenay River; * East side: Port aux Persil Cove, St. Lawrence River; * South side: Marguerite Creek, Port au Saumon River, Rivière à la Loutre, Malbaie River; * West side: Salmon Port River.

Interest in these types of high precision neutrino beams has grown significantly in the last ten years, especially after the start of the construction of the DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande detectors. DUNE and Hyper- Kamiokande are aimed at discovering CP violation in neutrinos observing a small difference between the probability of a muon-neutrino to oscillate into an electron-neutrino and the probability of a muon-antineutrino to oscillate into an electron-antineutrino. This effect points toward a difference in the behavior of matter and antimatter. In quantum field theory, this effect is described by a violation of the CP symmetry in particle physics. The experiments that will measure CP violation need a very precise knowledge of the neutrino cross-sections, i.e. the probability for a neutrino to interact in the detector. This probability is measured counting the number of interacting neutrinos divided by the flux of incoming neutrinos. Current neutrino cross-section experiments are limited by large uncertainties in the neutrino flux. A new generation of cross-section experiment is therefore needed to overcome these limitations with new techniques or high precision beams, as ENUBET. In ENUBET, neutrinos are produced by focusing mesons in a narrow band beam towards an instrumented decay tunnel, where charged leptons produced in association with neutrinos by mesons' decay can be monitored at single particle level. Mesons (essentially pions and kaons) are produced in the interactions of accelerated protons with a Beryllium or Graphite target. The proposed facility is being studied taking into account the energies of currently available proton drivers: 400 GeV (CERN SPS), 120 GeV (FNAL Main Injector), 30 GeV (J-PARC Main Ring). Kaons and pions are momentum and charge selected in a short transfer line by means of dipole and quadrupole magnets and are focused in a collimated beam into an instrumented decay tube. Large angle muons and positrons from kaon decays (K^{+} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mu^+ u_{\\\\mu}, K^{+} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mu^+ \\\\pi^0 u_{\\\\mu}, K^{+} \\\\rightarrow e^+ \\\\pi^0 u_{e}) are measured by detectors on the tunnel walls, while muons from pion decays (\\\\pi^+ \\\\rightarrow \\\\mu^+ u_{\\\\mu}) are monitored after the hadron dump at the end of the tunnel. The decay region is kept short (40 m) in order to reduce the neutrino contamination from muon decays (\\\\mu^+ \\\\rightarrow e^+ u_{e} \\\\bar{ u}_{\\\\mu}). In this way the neutrino flux is assessed in a direct way with a precision of 1%, without relying on complex simulations of the transfer line and on hadro-production data extrapolation that currently limit the knowledge of the flux to 5-10%. The ENUBET facility can be used to perform precision studies of the neutrino cross section and of sterile neutrinos or Non-Standard Interaction models. This method can also be extended to detect other leptons in order to have a complete monitored neutrino beam . The ENUBET project started in 2016. It involves 12 European institutions in 5 European countries, and brings together 60 scientists. ENUBET studies all technical and physics challenges to demonstrate the feasibility of a monitored neutrino beam: it will build a full-scale demonstrator of the instrumented decay tunnel (3 m length and partial azimuthal coverage) and will assess costs and physics reach of the proposed facility. Since March 2019, ENUBET is part of the CERN Neutrino Platform (NP06/ENUBET) for the development of a new generation of neutrino detector and facilities.

He was a member of the gens Memmia. His father was probably Gaius Memmius Mordax, the tribune of 111.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, pp. 1026, 1027 (\\"Memmius\\"); Cicero, Pro Balbo, 5; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 11, Life of Sertorius, 21; Orosius, v. 23. He was married to Pompeia, the older sister of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, making him Pompey's brother-in-law. They likely had a son by the same name whom became a moneyer. He is recorded to have served Pompey during his Sicilian command in 81 BC at the end of Sulla's Second Civil War.John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp 28-29. When Pompey sailed to Africa, to fight the remnants of the Cinna-Marian faction under Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, he put his brother-in-law in command of Sicily.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.30. During the Sertorian War he first served the proconsul Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius who was given the command against the Roman rebel Quintus Sertorius on the Iberian Peninsula. He probably went with Metellus's army when Metellus marched to Iberia in 79 BC. When Pompey was sent to support Metellus against Sertorius in 76 BC, Memmius was transferred to Pompey's army and served his brother-in-law as a quaestor.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.45. Pompey sent Memmius, accompanied by the able Spaniard Balbus, with a fleet to try and take New Carthage, secure it as a base, and from there move up the coast. Memmius was immediately blockaded in the city, probably by Sertorius's pirate allies, and was unable to play his part in the campaign. In 75 BC at the Battle of Saguntum he was killed during the early stages of the battle when Sertorius launched an ad hominem attack at Pompey trying to decapitate the Pompeian army; Pompey survived the attack, Memmius died defending his brother-in- law.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.50; Appian, Civil Wars, I. xiii. p.110; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 19.

He is a specialist on the Ellora caves on which he has written several influential research papers, delivered numerous lectures and has authored a book titled Ellora-An Enigma in Sculptural Styles (1996).  Life and work  Kannal studied sculpture at Faculty of Fine Arts, Baroda (1975) and established himself as a sculptor early in his career. After this he pursued Art History in which he received his second post-graduate degree (1983). He completed his doctoral thesis in 1993 in which he worked on the sculpture of Ellora caves. Kannal worked as the Head of the department, UGC/DSA coordinator and the Dean of the Faculty. He has several notable publications that includes a book “Ellora-An Enigma in Sculptural Styles’’, a monograph, four co-edited volumes - one of them on Ellora Sculpture and Architecture, three edited journals, these are to be re-released soon as a single book, three full length plays, three dance dramas and more than seventy papers and articles on Art and Aesthetics to his credit . His dance drama named ‘Dipta Kailasa’ narrating the history of Kailasanatha monolith of Ellora and the myths associated with it was performed at Ellora, in the vicinity of the caves. His most significant contribution in Art History is his teaching methodology and interpretation of Indian sculpture and Indian Aesthetics. He is an authority on Ellora cave sculpture. and has dedicated his entire life in studying the subject. His book on Ellora was reprinted in 2018 by Aprant Publishers, Pune. One of his most significant contribution is his interpretation of the ignored inscription \\"Utpattipidugu\\". He has written about it in one of the volumes of the journal Nirukta which was also edited by him and has delivered several lectures on the subject. He has created the syllabus for two subjects for UGC e-pathshala Post Graduate course in Fine Arts and Aesthetics - Indian Sculpture and Indian Aesthetics Ellora - An Enigma in Sculptural Styles by Deepak Kannal  Ellora - an Enigma in Sculptural Styles  Deepak Kannal worked on the Brahmanical sculptures of Ellora for his PhD, which was published as the book titled \\"Ellora - an Enigma in Sculptural Styles\\" in 1996. In the book he uses formalism as a tool to study the images and also devises his own unique methods of tracing sculptural guilds throughout the Indian subcontinent. In this work he traces several sculptor guilds which traveled to Ellora and worked there, while also examining patterns of classicism and romanticism at the site. In the chapter 'Introduction to Theatricality', he traces the quality of performance in sculpture which also becomes flamboyant in few images. The methods he devises in this work come from his own experience as a practicing sculptor and his familiarity in working with the medium of stone and metal. Kharavela and Sri Satakarni, Bhaja cave sculpture, different interpretation proposed by professor Kannal.  History as Allegory: The Bhaja Narratives  In his research paper titled \\"History as Allegory: The Bhaja Narratives\\", published in the volume 'Towards a New Art History: Studies in Indian Art', 2003, Deepak Kannal has proposed a fresh identification of the famous sculpture of Bhaja caves, generally identified as Surya and Indra. He proposes that the depiction is a political allegory and it shows the conflict between Ceta Kharavela of eastern India and Simuka Satavahana of Deccan. In his own words - \\"I propose that the inadequately though not erroneously identified sculptural panel from Bhaja is a visual record of Sri Satakarni's conquest over Kharavela\\" He interprets the many other figures in this sculpture allegorically, for instance, the 'mouse headed woman', he says, is the personification of the city which is being routed by Kharavela on the other site, the Bodhi tree and the rejoicing around it shows Satakarni's victory. Utpattipidugu - Inscription, Insignia and the Indite, A special volume of Nirukta, Journal of Art History & Aesthetics, 2005.  Sri Utpattipidugu: Inscription, Insignia and the Indite  Sri Utpattipidugu is a special volume of Nirukta journal, which was published by Art History and Aesthetics department, Faculty of Fine Arts, Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Vadodara in 2005. It is a detailed study of the inscription 'Utpatti pidugu' which has been traced at several archaeological sites, sometimes with an insignia and sometimes without it. Deepak Kannal, in this volume has suggested the possibility that Utpatti pidugu could be the name of a religious leader who created a new movement within Brahmanism and was able to gain political influence.Lupadakhe - Unknown Master Sculptors of Ancient India by Deepak Kannal and Kanika Gupta.  Lupadakhe - Unknown Master Sculptors of Ancient India  The book commemorates the legacy of the forgotten and therefore unknown sculptors of ancient India. Co-authored along with Kanika Gupta, this work takes the methodology adopted by Deepak Kannal in his previous work on Ellora forward and identifies a few Master Sculptors from ancient India. It discusses some of the best of sculptures from the Indian tradition and talks about Indian sculptural aesthetics using the ancient Indian lexicon along with citing instances from the European tradition. \\"The book stands as proof to the fact that to a trained eye the sculpture speaks differently. It transforms into a visual map of craftsmanship, stylistic overture and is a marker of lineage. Every nuance has its place and every deliberation by the sculptor is embedded as their singular vision within the rock. Offering a loving permanence, Lupadakhe is a tribute to beauty and the heritage of the subcontinent’s unsung artistic genius.\\"  Plays  He wrote a play titled 'Jogidas Khuman', which was performed by Fine Art Natak Kampani, Tathagat, Faculty of Fine Arts, Baroda.

Toponymy  The river Gouffre was named by Samuel de Champlain in 1608.Website of the Commission of toponymy of Quebec Its name refers to the whirlpool that forms at the foot of Cap aux Corbeaux, downstream from the confluence of the river Gouffre, and which was a source of terror for sailors. The toponme \\"Rivière du Gouffre\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Québec.Commission de toponymie du Québec - Bank of Place Names - Toponym: \\"Rivière du Gouffre\\".  Recreational tourism activities  The Rivière du Gouffre is an Atlantic salmon fishing river and a trout. At the beginning of the twentieth century, sport fishermen in the Quebec region frequented these waters, which had and still have the reputation of offering large salmon. The population of this species can vary in number significantly from one year to the next. Since 1979, the Association of Conservation of the Valley of the Gouffre (ACVG) manages the salmon fishery. This non-profit organization was formed on March 20, 1979, thanks to the grouping of some forty members. In spring 1979, 100 salmon pits are inventoried in the Rivière du Gouffre. Since then, the ACVG has built 65 of these pits. Pedestrian paths run along the river; picnic tables and shelters have been set up. Two bridges span the river allowing fishermen access to all salmon pits.

The First Circuit comprises Dorchester, Calhoun, and Orangeburg counties. In 2016, Pascoe won a Supreme Court case against the South Carolina Attorney General where the Attorney General attempted to remove Pascoe as the special prosecutor in a corruption probe involving the General Assembly. Pascoe oversaw the investigation and secured convictions on five powerful South Carolina General Assembly members that included the House speaker, President Pro Tem of the Senate, Chairman of the House Judiciary, and two former House Majority Leaders.  Education, early career, and endorsements  Pascoe is a Magna Cum Laude graduate of The Citadel and the University of South Carolina School of Law. He served as assistant state prosecutor from 1993 to 2005 successfully trying over 200 violent crimes. Included in those prosecutions is a \\"no body\\" case in which the Defendant was convicted of murder even though the victim's body was never found. He earned a reputation as being a hard line prosecutor on violent crimes but progressive in dealing with juvenile offenders and non-violent offenders. Pascoe is a Democrat who rarely gets involved in other candidate's elections, believing prosecutors should stay out of politics. Joe Biden is the only candidate Pascoe has ever endorsed. He endorsed Vice President Joe Biden for President on January 23, 2020. In his endorsement, Pascoe stated that he had personally known the Vice President for over a decade and \\"that he is the most decent man I have ever met in American politics\\". David Pascoe with Dick Harpootlian and Joe Biden  First Circuit Solicitor  After taking office in 2005, Pascoe immediately put a plan together to aggressively combat violent crime in the circuit while at the same time establishing a progressive agenda to curb juvenile crime. He implemented a number of new programs. He recruited churches and organizations to start a Youth Mentor Program. The First Circuit Solicitor's Youth Mentor Program was recognized by the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice as the 2011 Diversion Program of the Year. Pascoe also implemented the Circuit's first youth and adult drug court programs. Pascoe continues to garner his reputation as being tough on violent offenders and successfully convicted and received death sentences on two murderers, Mikal Mahdi and Kenneth Justus. Pascoe served as President of the South Carolina Solicitor's Association from 2011 to 2013.  Corruption probe  On December 5, 2013, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) submitted an investigative report to the Office of the Attorney General regarding the conduct of South Carolina Speaker of the House of Representatives Robert \\"Bobby\\" Harrell. A State Grand Jury case was initiated on the basis of the SLED report. Counsel for Speaker Harrell moved to have Attorney General Alan Wilson recused from the case. Pascoe accepted Attorney General Alan Wilson's designation as special prosecutor in the matter prior to a judge ruling on the recusal motion. On September 10, 2014, Pascoe indicted Speaker Harrell for multiple violations of state ethics laws. Speaker Harrell was removed from office on October 22, 2014 and received a sentence of three years probation after pleading guilty to six counts of misuse of campaign funds. On October 1, 2014, Pascoe sent an email to Attorney General Wilson referencing the December SLED report and stating that he believed legislators named in the report should be investigated as part of a corruption probe. _Pascoe v. Wilson_ , 416 S.C. 628, 631, 788 S.E.2d 686, 688 (2016) Approximately nine months later on July 17, 2015, the Attorney General's Office requested SLED forward the report to Pascoe for a prosecutive decision. In March 2016, Pascoe and SLED Chief Mark Keel referred the case to the State Grand Jury by signing a case initiation form. Shortly thereafter, a dispute arose in which the Attorney General's Office claimed that Pascoe did not have the authority to initiate a State Grand Jury investigation, and that only the elected Attorney General could legally sign the initiation form. The Attorney General then sent an e-mail to Pascoe purporting to fire him from the case. In an unprecedented move, Pascoe filed a petition for declaratory judgement with the South Carolina Supreme Court seeking a declaration that the Attorney General recused himself from the case and vested authority in Pascoe to conduct the investigation. Pascoe argued the case himself while the Attorney General's Office retained the law firm of Nelson Mullins to argue on its behalf. The case was heard by the South Carolina Supreme Court on June 16, 2016 and the Court ruled in favor of Pascoe, holding that a strict interpretation requiring the personal signature of the elected office holder \\"would lead to an absurd result.\\" _Pascoe v. Wilson_ , 416 S.C. 628, 645, 788 S.E.2d 686, 695 (2016) The Court also gave Pascoe the \\"full authority to act as the Attorney General for purposes of the investigation.\\" _Pascoe v. Wilson_ , 416 S.C. 628, 644, 788 S.E.2d 686, 695 (2016) Pascoe and SLED proceeded to thoroughly investigate two legislators who had served previously as House Majority Leaders, Representatives James \\"Jimmy\\" Merrill and Richard \\"Rick\\" Quinn Jr. Throughout the course of the grand jury investigation, Pascoe and his team discovered criminal conduct by other legislators as well as a political consulting firm associated with these legislators. Pascoe faced numerous challenges by targets of the investigation who sought to remove him, however, Pascoe prevailed in each courtroom battle. These discoveries, as well as other findings and conclusions, were summarized in a comprehensive grand jury report issued by the State Grand Jury on June 21, 2018. The investigation is often referred to as \\"Pascoe's corruption probe,\\" though Pascoe has only referred to it as the \\"State Grand Jury's investigation\\". The investigation resulted in conviction and removal from office of some of South Carolina's most powerful legislators. It also held corporate entities accountable. The business at the center of the investigation is Richard Quinn and Associates and was at one time arguably the most powerful consulting company in the state. Many of the state's most powerful figures were once clients of RQA including Attorney General Alan Wilson. Due to its deep roots in South Carolina politics, the business became known as the \\"Quinndom.\\" The corporation pleaded guilty to unlawful lobbying on December 13, 2017 and is believed to be the only conviction recorded for the offense in the state. In September 2018 Pascoe negotiated agreements with five of the state's most powerful corporations to settle potential criminal liability stemming from their dealings with Richard Quinn and Associates. The agreements, which were referred to as \\"corporate integrity agreements\\", were unprecedented in the state, however Pascoe argued that the agreements are a permissible use of his prosecutive authority. On June 21, 2018, the State Grand Jury issued a comprehensive report that detailed its findings and conclusions after two years of investigation. The issuance of reports discussing the investigative work of a grand jury is not common in South Carolina and subjects of the report attempted to block its public release. Pascoe sought, and ultimately won the approval of the presiding judge of the state grand jury to publicly release the document without redactions. The report detailed the manner in which the Quinndom profited from its significant political connections by receiving lucrative retainers from corporations interested in expanding their political influence. The report also discussed the prevalence of undisclosed \\"dark money\\" spent by large corporations to influence elections and the problematic relationship between the Attorney General and the targets of the investigation.  Indictments  * James \\"Jimmy\\" Merrill pleaded guilty on September 1, 2017 to statutory misconduct in office, was forced to resign from office, and was sentenced to probation. * Richard \\"Rick\\" Quinn, Jr. was indicted by the State Grand Jury on May 16, 2017 for statutory and common law misconduct in office. On December 13, 2017 he resigned from office and pleaded guilty to statutory misconduct in office. The trial court took two months before sentencing Mr. Quinn Jr. to probation. Interpretation of the plea agreement was subject to significant disagreement between Pascoe and the trial court. Pascoe appealed the guilty plea and sentence issued by the court, but the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that the State was prohibited from appealing a guilty plea under the circumstances. _State v. Quinn_ , 843 S.E.2d 355 (S.C. 2020) The plea agreement was the subject of controversy, resulting in both criticism and praise of Pascoe's decision to permit the plea. * John Courson pleaded guilty to common law misconduct in office on March 16, 2017 for laundering $160,000 of campaign money through his political consultant, Richard Quinn and Associates. At the time of his guilty plea, Mr. Courson served as the President Pro Tempore of the South Carolina Senate. Mr. Courson maintained his innocence until the eve of trial, calling the investigation a \\"witch hunt\\". However, on the morning that his case was scheduled for a jury trial he agreed to plead guilty, resign his position, and cooperate with the investigation. Although he has entered a guilty plea, Mr. Courson awaits sentencing. * Jim Harrison is currently the only target of the investigation to face a trial by jury and is believed to be the first member of the General Assembly to be tried and convicted of misconduct in office in South Carolina. On October 26, 2018, a Richland County jury returned guilty verdicts against Mr. Harrison for statutory misconduct in office, common law misconduct in office, and perjury. The Court sentenced Mr. Harrison to 18 months in prison, making him the first state lawmaker to receive a prison sentence in the investigation. * The state grand jury also issued indictments against former House Representative Tracy Edge for statutory misconduct in office, common law misconduct in office, and perjury on October 18, 2017 and a single 12 count indictment against Richard Quinn, Sr. for perjury and obstruction of justice on April 18, 2019. Those cases are still pending.

Several genera, including Nyctitherium, Paradoxonycteris, and Wyonycteris, have initially been described as bats, although the family is more frequently placed in the order Eulipotyphla.  Origins and discovery  O.C. Marsh originally described Nyctitherium, from the Eocene of Wyoming, as an early bat based on similarities of its teeth. Since 1872 more than two dozen other genera of nyctitheriids have been named, and several of these have also initially been considered bats. G.G. Simpson recognized that Nyctitherium did not represent a bat, and in 1928 named the family Nyctitheriidae for Nyctitherium and several other small insectivores. Many additional species of Nyctitheriidae from Asia, Europe, and North America have been recognized in the subsequent decades. Most species are known only from isolated teeth and jaw fragments, however species of Cryptotopos, Euronyctia, Plagioctenodon, and Scraeva are known from some postcranial bones.  Evolutionary relationships  A recent phylogenetic analysis placed Nyctitheriidae within Eulipotyphla, although Hooker (2001, 2014) has argued based on similarities in the limb bones for a relationship with Euarchonta, instead. Lopatin (2006) recognized five subfamilies of Nyctitheriidae: Amphidozotheriinae, Asionyctiinae, Eosoricodontinae, Nyctitheriinae, and Praolestinae. Beard and Dawson (2009) considered Placentidentinae, previously thought to be related to Dermoptera, to also represent a subfamily within Nyctitheriidae. A phylogenetic analysis of many nyctitheriid species determined that although Nyctitheriidae was mostly monophyletic several subfamilies and genera were not. Notably, the subfamilies Amphidozotheriinae, Asionyctiinae, and Nyctitheriinae, as well as the genera Leptacodon and Saturninia, were found to be paraphyletic.

Biography  Born into a musical and artistic Italian family, at the age of eight she was already performing in clubs on weekends. At 17 she did her first TV show. In 1978, Angie Gold released a single in Germany on Polydor. The title song, \\"Der schönste Tag\\" (English translation: \\"The most beautiful day\\"), was a previously unreleased adaptation of \\"If I Had Words\\". At the age of 22, she was a contestant on a Saturday night TV show called Search for a Star, where she was spotted by the CBS / Epic Sony record label. After signing a contract with them, she released a Gus Dudgeon-produced single titled \\"Every Home Should Have One\\". After another single, she recorded her debut album, which was released in 1982. Gold's second album, produced by Ben Findon, appeared later in the year. In 1982 from that album she competed at the 11th Tokyo Music Festival (held at the Budokan), winning a \\"silver\\" award. In 1985, she released a song titled \\"Eat You Up\\", which reached number 30 on the US Billboard disco chart. A Japanese-language cover of the song, titled \\"Dancing Hero\\", was released by Yōko Oginome as her seventh single. The original (published in Japan under the title \\"Suteki na High Energy Boy\\") was also popular there, spending four consecutive weeks at the very top of Oricon's International Singles Chart in early 1986. In 1988, Gold became the new voice of the South-African Hi-NRG band People Like Us and recorded songs including \\"Resurrection\\" and \\"Two to Tango\\". She also recorded the ballad \\"Prayer for You\\", which was originally co-written by Cindy Dickenson. In late 2007, she reunited with Ian Levine (with whom she worked in the 1980s and 1990s, starting with the 1986 single \\"Applause\\" on Passion Records) to record a new song titled \\"No Pain No Gain\\" for the various artists album Disco 2008.

Later, it would also support printing of Korean and Traditional Chinese text. Functions At the Osaka Expo 1970, a prototype of the IBM Kanji System was exhibited . Although the computers in Japan, up to that time, used only the alphanumeric characters like in other countries, this prototype allowed processing of more than ten thousand Kanji and other characters that are used in the Japanese language. In 1971, IBM officially announced the IBM Kanji System that consisted of the following:IBM History of Far Eastern Languages in Computing: National ... *IBM 5924 Kanji keypunch *IBM 2245 Kanji Printer *IBM System/360-System/370 OS/VS & DOS/VSE programming support The IBM 5924 Kanji Keypunch was an IBM 029 Keypunch (Model T00 with Katakana feature), attached with a specially designed 12-shift Kanji input keyboard. It allowed punching out IBM cards for more than ten thousand kinds of Japanese characters, using two columns (two punch positions) for each Japanese character, to be fed in the regular IBM card reader for being stored in the computer in two bytes for each Japanese character. This new technical approach gave the so-called Double-Byte Character Set languages of Japanese, Korean and Chinese languages the ability to be processed by the computer. The IBM 2245 Kanji Printer was a line printer on the system side that connected to System/360 or System/370 via the multiplexer channel, block multiplexer channel or selector channel. The printer basically used the dot matrix impact printing mechanism, already employed in the IBM 2560 Multi-Function Card Machine that attached to IBM System/360 Model 20 and later to IBM System/3. Each Japanese double-byte character was printed on continuous paper with 18x22 dots for horizontal writing or with 18x18 for vertical writing. The paper feed mechanism was not a conventional paper tape, but new program control from the computer system was developed. Development, manufacturing and marketing The IBM 2245 was developed at IBM Endicott with participation of two or three engineers from IBM Fujisawa, and manufactured in Endicott. It was marketed as a standard product, whereas the IBM 5924 Kanji punch, developed and manufactured in Fujisawa was a special RPQ product. This printer would later support Korean and Traditional Chinese languages, with the effort of IBM Korea's and IBM Taiwan's laboratories, in coordination from IBM Fujisawa. Application Although the IBM 2245 Kanji Print could be used in a wide range of applications, it was mainly used to print the names and addresses in corporate correspondence, because the printing span (horizontal width) was relatively narrow. Until that time, the English alphabet and half-width Katakana had been used for computer processing of corporate correspondence, which was quite awkward. Critique The information of which wire dot to be hit at which point was prepared on the computer side and transmitted to the printer, which made other jobs in the multitasking OS/360-370 to slow down extensively. Successor printer The IBM 3800 Model 2 laser printing subsystem, developed by IBM Rochester, in the second batch announcement of IBM Kanji System in 1979, was the successor machine. Later, it would support not only Korean and Traditional Chinese, but also Simplified Chinese that is used in mainland China.

He is best known as one of the first infiltrators within the mafia and narcos families and as close collaborator of the judge Giovanni Falcone. He acted undercover in Colombian drug traffickers organizations linked to Camorristi and 'ndrine. His infiltration allowed seizure of cocaine and the arrest of over 40 people between Naples, Milan, Rome, Amsterdam and Venezuela. After his military career he subsequently joined the Telecom Italia Group as a manager. There, he fell under investigation for illegal counter-intelligence activities in the 2004 Telecom trial. He was accused by one of the people already under investigation, this accuser was subsequently convicted. During the trial he resigned from his position as manager in order to defend himself in the trial in which he was subsequently acquitted.  Career  He attended the Nunziatella Military School and the Military Academy of Modena.  Service in the Carabinieri  Angelo Jannone was the commander of the Carabinieri's company in Corleone from 1989 to 1991 and author, with Giovanni Falcone, of the investigations on the patrimony of Totò Riina and on the accountant Pino Mandalari. From Corleone he was transferred for security reasons, since he entered the aims of the Corleonesi mafia group after having started the investigations for the arrest of the boss Salvatore Rina with a surveillance plan on the houses of the Bagarella. The indications given to Sergio De Caprio, better known as Captain Ultimo, gave impulse to the arrest of the Chief of the Chiefs. After Corleone, in Catania, he commanded the Investigative Unit and was at the center of a bloody shooting 18 June 1992, where he captured an entire group of fire of the Cursoti clan. After Catania, in Calabria, he commanded the company of Roccella Ionica, and was the protagonist of several important operations against the mafia families of Locride and the Piromalli. Also, in Calabria, he signed the report about Galassia case, which led to the arrest of 187 members of Cosa Nostra and many mafia families of Calabria and their branches in Europe and other Italian Regions. From Calabria he was transferred after a criminal had revealed a plan to attack him since he was wanted by the Ndrine della Locride. Later he commanded for three years the Investigation Departement in Venice, where he was in the limelight for investigations against corruption. He was then transferred to the Special Team in Rome, better known as ROS, in the summer of 2000 and left the Corp in December 2003, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. During the period this occurred he had been under cover for two years infiltrating a Colombian narco-trafficking organization linked to Italian Mafia, allowing the seizure and destruction of 280 kilograms of cocaine and the arrest of more than 43 people in Naples, Milan, Rome, Amsterdam, and Venezuela.

History   World War I  The battalion was raised on 15 February 1915 with reservists of the Alpini Battalion \\"Bassano\\" of the 6th Alpini Regiment. The battalion's name, like the names of all Alpini battalions raised during World War I with first line reservists, was the name of a valley near the active battalion's base; in the Val Brenta battalion's case the Brenta valley, which extends to the north from Bassano. As with all Alpini battalions the recruits for the battalions were drafted exclusively from the area surrounding the battalions base. Initially the battalion fielded the 262nd and 263rd Alpini companies, and received the 274th Alpini Company on 15 December 1916. The Val Brenta battalion's history is intertwined with the history of the 6th Alpini Regiment, with which it served during World War I. During the war the battalion was awarded a Silver Medal of Military Valour for the defense of Monte Cauriol on 1-5 September 1916 against repeated Austro-Hungarian, during which the battalion lost seven officers and more than 250 soldiers. After the war the battalion was disbanded on 30 April 1920.  World War II  The battalion was reformed on 27 August 1939 and participated in the Italian invasion of France in June and July 1940. Afterwards the battalion was once more disbanded on 31 October 1940 and the battalion's reservists dismissed.  Cold War  Vierschach Landro On 1 July 1963 the XXIII Alpini Fortification Battalion in Innichen was renamed Alpini Battalion \\"Val Brenta\\". The battalion was part of the Alpine Brigade \\"Tridentina\\" and tasked with tasked to man fortifications in the upper Puster valley, which the Italian Army (correctly) assumed to be one of two main directions of a possible Warsaw Pact advance. Initially the Val Brenta fielded three active and five reserve companies, the latter of which had arrived 30 June 1964 from the disbanded Alpini Battalion \\"Val Leogra\\". On 1 November 1976 the Alpini Battalion \\"Val Cismon\\" of the Alpine Brigade \\"Cadore\\" was disbanded and its four companies transferred to the Val Brenta, which now fielded three active and nine reserve companies with a wartime strength of more than 2,200 men. On 1 July 1979 the Val Brenta received the 253rd Alpini Company from the disbanded Alpini Battalion \\"Val Chiese\\" of the Alpine Brigade \\"Orobica\\". The structure of the battalion was now: * 30px Alpini Battalion \\"Val Brenta\\", in Bruneck ** 15px Headquarters and Service Company, in Bruneck ** 15px 253rd Alpini Company, in Brenner (Type A*) (transferred on 1 July 1979 from the disbanded Alpini Battalion \\"Val Chiese\\") ** 15px 262nd Alpini Company, in Winnebach (Type A) ** 15px 263rd Alpini Company, in Vierschach (Type A) ** 15px 264th Alpini Company, in Santo Stefano di Cadore (Type A, transferred on 1 November 1976 from the disbanded Alpini Battalion \\"Val Cismon\\"; downgraded to Type C on 30 June 1979 and duties taken over by the 262nd Company) ** 15px 265th Alpini Companynote 1, in Santo Stefano di Cadore (Type C*, transferred on 1 November 1976 from the disbanded Alpini Battalion \\"Val Cismon\\") ** 15px 274th Alpini Companynote 1, in Toblach (Type C) ** 15px 277th Alpini Companynote 1, in Höhlenstein (Type C, transferred on 1 November 1976 from the disbanded Alpini Battalion \\"Val Cismon\\") ** 15px 347th Alpini Companynote 2, in Prags (Type C, transferred on 1 November 1976 from the disbanded Alpini Battalion \\"Val Cismon\\") ** 15px 351st Alpini Companynote 2, in Bruneck (Type C, ex \\"Val Leogra\\") ** 15px 352nd Alpini Companynote 2, in Bruneck (Type C, ex \\"Val Leogra\\") ** 15px 353rd Alpini Companynote 1, in Percha (Type C, ex \\"Val Leogra\\") ** 15px 354th Alpini Companynote 2, in Bruneck (Type C, ex \\"Val Leogra\\") ** 15px 355th Alpini Companynote 2, in Bruneck (Type C, ex \\"Val Leogra\\") * Type A = fortification fully equipped, provisioned and manned; close support platoon onsite * Type B = fortification fully equipped, provisioned and manned; close support platoon off site * Type C = fortification fully equipped; provisions, crew and close support platoon off site The fortifications the Val Brenta would man in case of war with the Warsaw Pact had been built as the Alpine Wall in the early stages of World War II.

Main characters Jason Hayes Master Chief Special Warfare Operator Jason Hayes a.k.a Bravo 1/1B, leader of a Navy SEAL team (Bravo Team), portrayed by David Boreanaz. In the series pilot, Jason is referred to as a Senior Chief Petty Officer, but in \\"Collapse\\", he calls himself an \\"E-9\\" Master Chief. In the pilot, Jason is still dealing with the loss of one of his best friends and teammates, Nate Massey, who was killed the previous December; he has also separated from his wife, Alana, in the intervening months, with whom he has two children, Emma (then age 15/16) and Michael \\"Mikey\\" (then age 11). Although he and Alana attempt to reconcile, she ultimately asks him for a divorce just before his deployment to Jalalabad, Afghanistan in early 2018. Later that year, Alana dies following a car accident in season 2's \\"The Worst of Conditions\\". Jason takes a leave of absence from the Teams and even considers resigning in order to ensure that his children at least have one parent left (it was mentioned that Jason and Alana had frequently made plans should he be killed in action, but never even considered that she might be the parent who died first), but Emma convinces him to stay on Bravo Team. During Season 3, Jason mentions that he enlisted in the Navy and completed BUD/s in 2001, just a few months before 9/11, and has spent his entire career fighting in the War on Terror.

His attitude changes after he loses his friend and fellow trainee Brian Armstrong during a parachuting training accident in the episode \\"Borderlines\\". He becomes a member of Bravo Team at the end of \\"The Exchange\\". In season 2, he briefly served as the team's second-in-command following Senior Chief Ray Perry's assignment to Green Team; he again serves as Bravo-2 during Ray's temporary promotion while Jason is on medical leave. After being injured in \\"Paradise Lost\\", Clay returns home to the United States to recover, during which time he makes it his mission to ensure that a fellow Navy SEAL, now retired and suffering from traumatic brain injury, could receive a Purple Heart. In \\"The Strength of the Wolf\\", Master Chief Hayes and Senior Chief Perry speculate that in 10 years, Clay will be leading Bravo Team. During the events of Season 3 – particularly after meeting Ambassador Marsden – Clay begins to wonder how he can \\"point the spear, not just be the tip\\" (i.e. have some say in what missions the SEALs, especially Bravo, are deployed). In \\"Rules of Engagement\\", CAPT Lindell volunteers to nominate Clay for STA-21, one of the Navy's officer-commissioning programs; after spending a few weeks thinking about it (and although the nomination doesn't go over well with Jason or especially Sonny), Clay decides to explore the option of possibly becoming an officer. =Awards and decorations= Here is a list of awards and decorations worn by then-SO2 Spenser, as seen in \\"Never Out of the Fight\\": { style=\\"width=100%;\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  {  - ccf; text-align:center;\\"  colspan=2 Personal decorations -  Silver Star -  Bronze Star, w/3 gold award stars (4th award) and “V” device -  Purple Heart -  Joint Service Commendation Medal, w/“V” device -  Navy & Marine Corps Commendation Medal, w/2 gold award stars (3rd award) and “V” device -  Army Commendation Medal, w/“V” device -  Joint Service Achievement Medal -  Navy & Marine Corps Achievement Medal, w/1 gold award star (6th award) and “V” device -  Combat Action Ribbon, w/4 gold award stars (5th award) - ccf; text-align:center;\\"  colspan=2 Unit awards -  Navy Unit Commendation, w/1 bronze service star (2nd award) -  Meritorious Unit Commendation, w/1 bronze service star (2nd award) - ccf; text-align:center;\\"  colspan=2 Service awards -  Navy Good Conduct Medal, w/1 bronze service star (2nd award) - ccf; text-align:center;\\"  colspan=2 Campaign and service medals -  National Defense Service Medal, w/1 bronze service star (2nd award) -  Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal -  Southwest Asia Service Medal -  Afghanistan Campaign Medal, w/1 bronze service star (2nd award) -  Iraq Campaign Medal, w/1 bronze service star (2nd award) -  Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, w/2 bronze service stars (3rd award) -  Global War on Terrorism Service Medal - ccf; text- align:center;\\"  colspan=2 Marksmanship awards - 60px Navy Expert Rifleman Medal - 60px Navy Expert Pistol Shot Medal } valign=\\"top\\"  {  - ccf; text-align:center;\\"  colspan=2 Other accoutrements -  align=center  100px Special Warfare insignia -  align=center  100px Naval Parachutist insignia -  align=center  1 service stripe (reflecting 4 years of service) } } In \\"Danger Crossing\\" Clay is nominated by Senior Chief Perry for a new Bronze Star with a Valor for his actions in Yemen during combat in \\"All Along the Watchtower: Part 2\\".

He has written a number of books on India, starting with Thuggee: Banditry and the British in early nineteenth- century India in 2007. He followed that up with a source book on Thuggee and has also written on the uprising of 1857 and the Amritsar massacre. A British citizen, Wagner feels an affinity for India. Early life Wagner is of Danish origin, but has lived in the United Kingdom for over twenty years. He is named after the leading character from Rudyard Kipling's novel Kim, set in British India, and was taken to India by his parents when he was a baby. Wagner says he has visited Amritsar many times and feels that India is \\"in [his] blood.\\" Career In 2003, under the supervision of Christopher Bayly, he gained a PhD in South Asian history from the University of Cambridge. He subsequently completed a four-year research fellowship at King’s College there, followed by a two-year research associate post at the University of Edinburgh. Wagner then became a lecturer in imperial and World history at the University of Birmingham, before being employed at Queen Mary's in 2012.

Skull of Alum Bheg In 2014, he was approached by the owners of the Lord Clyde pub in Kent, who wished to dispose of a skull in their possession. An accompanying note revealed the skull to be that of sepoy Alum Bheg of the Bengal Regiment, who, following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, was executed in 1858 by being blown from a cannon in Sialkot. Wagner had the skull examined at the Natural History Museum in London, who confirmed its likely authenticity. Subsequently, with no known descendants of Bheg and with no official documents mentioning him, Wagner pieced together the story of the skull using letters written by the relatives and friends of Bheg's victims, in addition to other primary material in England and India. The Skull of Alum Bheg: The Life and Death of a Rebel of 1857 was completed and published in 2017.Lord Clyde, Dover Kent Archives, 25 July 2019. Retrieved 13 December 2019. Wagner later expressed a wish for the skull to be repatriated back to India to be \\"buried in a respectful manner\\". Amritsar 1919 His book, Amritsar 1919: An Empire of Fear and the Making of a Massacre (2019), describes how the Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre was a result of a British fear of another Indian rebellion of 1857. With the book, Wagner aimed to dispel what he saw as myths about the massacre. The book was highly commended by the journalists Sathnam Sanghera and Trevor Grundy. Both Grundy and Ferdinand Mount compared Wagner's book on the massacre with The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day (2011) by Nick Lloyd and with Nigel Collett's The Butcher of Amritsar (2005). While Wagner emphasised that it was \\"brutality\\" in general that was the \\"driving principle of the Raj\\" rather than the personality of individuals, Mount argued that Wagner had underplayed the personality of General Dyer.

It was first performed in the Salle des Machines in Paris on 15 April 1766. Action The action takes place in India, where queen Aline recognises the newly-arrived ambassador Saint Phar as her long lost lover from a time when she was a mere peasant girl. She disguises herself as a shepherdess and meets Saint Phar before leaving him again to test his love. Resuming her role as queen, she offers herself in marriage to Saint Phar, who declines because he loves the shepherdess. The true identity of the shepherdess is then revealed, and the lovers reunited. Reception Although Monsigny had previously written light operas, Aline was his first and only grand opera. The Journal historique gave the work a damning review, saying that Sédaine’s libretto lacked the gaiety of the original work and turned it into a dreary and trivial pastoral, while Montigny’s music destroyed the prosody of the verse and merely enhanced its dullness. Nevertheless the work was popular and a revised version was staged in Paris in 1779. L'esprit des journaux, francais et etrangers commented that the first version had been updated in the light of changes to public taste and the styles made popular by Christoph Willibald Gluck. The music was full of pleasant tunes, but the recitatives, now all accompanied rather than “secco” as before, were too heavy for a pastoral and the public felt that the dances were too long. Monsigny’s later work Le déserteur (1769) was enormously popular and rapidly eclipsed Aline, which did not remain in the repertoire of the Opéra-Comique. The opera was translated and performed in many European cities: Brussels (1774); Liège (1783); Berlin (German translation by FLW Meyer (de) 1782); London (Italian translation by A. Andrei, 1784); and Moscow (Russian translation, 1793). A parody appeared in 1768 under the title Nanine, Sœur de lait de la reine de Golconde. Later works In 1787, Johann Abraham Peter Schulz composed new music to a translated version of the French libretto. In 1803 a different work with the same name premiered at the Opéra-Comique in Paris, with a libretto by Jean-Baptiste-Charles Vial and Etienne Guillaume François de Favières and music by Henri-Montan Berton. Gaetano Donizetti wrote his opera Alina, regina di Golconda on the same theme, using an Italian translation of the same libretto.

WWI left thousands of soldiers with unprecedented levels of facial damage, creating a massive need for reconstruction of facial features, as such Harold Gillies of New Zealand developed and tested methods to restore function and structure to the faces of soldiers and these processes rapidly gained popularity. Throughout the 1940s and 50s fashion and personal appearance was emphasized more strongly in the United States. As ideas about what was considered beautiful changed, services, products, and techniques were developed to help consumers meet those standards if they so chose. People may undertake plastic surgery in the modern era due to their mental state and lack of confidence in their own bodies. Individuals may turn to getting something changed about themselves via surgery because it requires less mental/emotional work and reduces body dysmorphia.  Origins/ History   World War I as Birth of Reconstructive Surgery  World War I left thousands of soldiers with unprecedented levels of facial damage; trench warfare and progressive weapons lead to massive amounts of death and destruction. Explosions and rapid gunfire left those who survived with horribly disfigured faces, creating a dire demand for medical intervention. Dr. Harold Gillies of New Zealand developed and tested methods to restore function and structure to the faces of soldiers, such as taking cartilage or skin from an easily concealed part of the patient's body and using it to reform the injured area. Due to the thousands of soldiers in need of immediate medical attention, there were no shortage of willing trial subjects. Gillies based his work on methods that had been developed previously, but were never intended for such drastic application. He improved upon these efforts and, when combined with anaesthesia and sedating medication, found his techniques rapidly gaining in popularity. The call for doctors able to perform facial reconstruction grew rapidly and received national attention. Dr. Varaztad Kazanjian became the first recognized post- war plastic surgery specialist at Harvard Medical School. Years after the war ended, the supply of patients in need of life-saving facial reconstruction was steadily reducing. As such, surgeons were able to take on less dire cases, such as industrial accidents or other injuries. Techniques and procedures became more advanced and public knowledge of them grew.  Changing Beauty Standards and Evolution of Technology  Throughout the 1940s and 50s fashion and personal appearance was emphasized more strongly in the United States; both world wars were over and years in the past, and normalcy was returning to the average American household. As ideas about what was considered beautiful changed, services, products, and techniques were developed to help consumers meet those standards if they so chose. Women felt pressure to be symmetrical, have smooth skin, and by slim yet curvy in all the right places. Being too thin was equated with being fragile and sickly, but being too large suggested poor self-care. The emphasize on bust-waist-hip measurements grew, with Miss America's proclaimed ideal in the 1950s being 36-24-36. Despite the physical risks they carry, corsets and waist-trainers returned to popularity during this time to help women achieve the \\"hourglass figure\\" that was so sought after. While fitted dresses and push-up bras were readily available, some women chose to undergo surgery to enhance their bodies. The rate of breast augmentation operations soared in the 1960s, and a decade later rates of anorexia-nervosa hit record highs. In the 1970s breast reduction surgery became more prevalent, as well as reduction of the thighs and buttocks. These surgeries were newly developed and experimental; some common unintended outcomes were numbness, loss of range of motion, and infection.  Psychological Relationships to Cosmetic Surgery  Many people who have plastic surgery in today’s era choose to do so because of their mental state and lack of confidence in their own bodies. Instead of working to accept and love what they look like as they are, millions of people turn to getting something changed about themselves instead because it requires less mental/ emotional work and is readily available. One example of this is people with eating disorders; a person who has body dysmorphia may try and get surgery in order to feel that they are skinnier than they already are. The major problem with this is that many eating disorder patients are not overweight, so this surgery will not be helpful to their physical health or appearance. These patients expect to come out of the operation room looking like a new person, and they believe that they will be able to feel confident in this new body. This can happen to certain people, but for the majority of people with these diagnoses, the surgery will not be able to change their mindset. These patients need therapy and mental treatments, so a physical surgery will be a waste of time and money. Besides eating disorder patients, a large number of people who choose to undergo plastic surgery are victims of anxiety, depression, or other mental illnesses. These people, just like an eating disorder patient, falsely believe the surgery will fix their mental state. These patients deserve to get mental health treatments because the surgery will most likely not be able to change their mindsets. However, cosmetic surgery can have profoundly wonderful affects for the transgender community and those who have significant facial damage. Trans folk who choose to have surgery so their physical form aligns more closely with their gender identity often feel more comfortable in their own skin and are able to see their external figure the way they want to see it, giving a marginalized and under- recognized group a significant amount of power back over their own lives. Burn victims and other patients who have experienced significant facial deformation also benefit psychologically from plastic surgery; victims of an accident or attack commonly feel much of their power has been taken away, and having a plethora of surgical procedures available to them may make the healing process easier. These procedures are intended to restore normalcy to people who have had traumatic experiences, and help them lead as normal of a life as possible.  Evolution of Contemporary Trends  Plastic surgery started to become commonly used during the world wars in order to help soldiers and veterans who were injured. Surgeons used skin grafts to reshape faces that had been impacted by bombs and bullets. After, plastic surgery became mainstream in the 1950s for American women to change themselves as beauty standards were changing. Most popular were, and is the third most popular today, rhinoplasties, which is a reconstruction of the nose. Over the course of the 1900s American beauty standards became more narrow and created a rigid definition of beauty, which made these procedures more common in order to be seen as fitting into the definition of beauty. Today, many procedure can be done to meet society's definition of beauty and media and research has found the most common procedures sought out each year. The most popular procedure performed in 2018 were breast augmentations, followed by liposuction, nose reshaping, eyelid surgery, and tummy tucks. These procedures have become less invasive and more available as plastic surgeons expand their services and accessibility. These procedures are still expensive, but there are recently more ways to gets parts covered by health insurances. The criteria for medical intervention in contemporary society can be as simple as disliking the appearance of that part of the body; cosmetic surgery is the only medical specialty where the patient decides what is wrong with her and what the course of treatment will be. The prevalence of cosmetic surgery in the United States can make it feel less like a choice and more like a medical need; advertisements in everyday media, worship of celebrities who transform their bodies, and constant critique of the natural female form can suggest that there is something innately wrong or flawed about the way one looks, and surgical intervention is required to \\"fix\\" these issues.

She was shortlisted for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015 and is the first Mauritanian woman to be considered for the award.  Early Life  El-Moctar was born in Nouakchott on 13 December 1956 and grew up in an upper-class family of eight children. At the age of eleven, her father arranged marriage for her, which she strongly objected to, however the marriage went ahead and her first child was born when she was 14. As a teenager she was involved with Marxist protests and was arrested several times by police. At this point, she also stood up for the rights of her family's slaves, encouraging them to take their own freedom and to leave. After leaving her husband, and unable to attend school, she worked in a variety of low-paid jobs, including: cigarette seller, switchboard operator, and as a social worker.  Activism & Feminism  El-Moctar's activism was formed early - standing up for the rights of others from a young age. Activism, speaking out against the government, especially by women, is unpopular with the authorities in Mauritania. IN 1974 she set up the Association of Mauritanian Women Democrats. Between 1989 and 1991 she was a member of The International Democratic Movement to Defend the Oppressed. In 1991 El-Moctar was arrested and tortured because she spoke out against the massacre of black minority Mauritanians in Nouadhibou. Her involvement led to the creation of the Committee on Solidarity with the Victims of Repression in Mauritania. She has lobbied for a quota in government for the involvement of women in political decision-making - it stands at 20% in 2019. In 2009 she spearheaded protests against the sex trafficking of young women to the Arabian Peninsula. She has spoken out against the early marriage of girls and especially the cultural practice of force-feeding young women to become fat ready for marriage, leading to obesity and diabetes. In order to further the cause of human rights she states that: “We need to continue to raise taboo issues in order to break them, to make people aware of their rights and duties and, above all, to denounce all inhuman, degrading and discriminatory practices towards people, especially women and children”. El-Moctar considers herself a feminist and wants to encourage women from across Africa to come together in the fights against male domination.  Fatwa  In 2014, a fatwa was launched against her by the imam of a Mauritanian radical Islamist movement, who call themselves Ahbab Errassoul (The Prophet's Friends). The order was issued against El- Moctar because she publicly defending a blogger who was accused by Ahbab Errassoul of apostasy. The fatwa called for the killing and gouging out of El- Moctar's eye, simply because she demanded a fair trial for the blogger.  The Association of Women Heads of Households  .UNESCO's Soft Power Today Manifesto, featuring El-Moctar (pdf) On 17 April 1999, El-Moctar founded The Association of Women Heads of Households (AFCF, ), which she chairs. From its outset, the AFCF has been designed to reflect the diversity of Mauritania, including Arab, Berber, Haratin, Pulaar, Soninke and Wolof women. The AFCF has 12,000 members, six rescue centres for victims, 168 social workers, four lawyers and a contact person in every city in Mauritania. In 2019, the AFCF proposed new legislation to the Mauritanian government to defend women rights, in particular to introduce harsher sentences for rape. The proposal was rejected by the Mauritanian government as it did not comply with Sharia law.  Awards & Honours  El-Moctar was awarded the Human Rights Prize of the French Republic in 2006. In 2010 she was awarded the Legion d'Honneur for her work in defending human rights in Mauritania. In 2015, El-Moctar was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, along with other anti-slavery campaigners Biram Dah Abeid and .

It was discovered in 1952 by Derek J. Price, and has sometimes been ascribed to Geoffrey Chaucer because of its language and handwriting. It is written in English and contains astronomical tables; its ultimate source is Arabic. Price published an abstract in 1953, and the whole text (facsimile, transcription, and studies of the manuscript) in 1955. He maintained the possibility that Chaucer authored the Equatorie, possibly as the missing part of his A Treatise on the Astrolabe, which describes the astrolabe, and is sometimes cited as the first example of technical writing in the English language; the Equatorie seems to make direct reference to it. Since then, most other scholars of the Equatorie maintain that the evidence for Chaucer's authorship is very weak, and that the case is not proven. Discovery and description Derek J. Price found the text in 1952 when he investigated a manuscript from the library of Peterhouse, Cambridge, MS 75.I. The manuscript featured 78 leaves of astronomical tables and text in English; the library's catalog assigned it to Simon Bredon, the astronomer of Merton College. Throughout the text and in many of the tables the year 1392 occurs, and the text must have been written around this year. How it came to Peterhouse is not known, but it probably happened during the 15th century; around 1540 it is entered in Peterhouse catalog, as Tab. aequ. planetarum autore Simon Bredon. The Equatorie occupies eight pages in the manuscript; the phrase Radix chaucer appears on fol. 5v. That the manuscript is a holograph is confirmed, according to Price, by heavy corrections and interlineations (in the original hand) that appear to be alterations of style rather than copy edits—as if the original author were polishing their work. Price's linguistic analysis also suggests that the manuscript has no evidence of any other scribe or author having worked on it. If it is a holograph, then Bredon, who died in 1372, cannot have been its author. It is possible that the text is a translation of a now-lost Latin original, but either way, the text is based on an Arabic original. Manuscript Peterhouse MS 75 was a composite manuscript; in 1952, after Price discovered the Equatorie in it, the manuscript was split into two parts (and both parts rebound): MS 75.I, containing the Equatorie, and MS 75.II, containing works by Nicholas Trivet and Vegetius.Schmidt 103. MS 75.I has two parts: fol. 1r-71r contains the tables, and 71v-78v the text. The vellum is of varying quality, with ten quires of pages measuring 365x260mm (except for the last quires). The ink is brown; there are signs of dampness on the upper edge, especially in the first quire, with some blurring in the fourth quire on the top of the pages. According to Schmidt, the dampness and the wear and tear on some of the quires is evidence that the quires spent some time unbound.Schmidt 103–105. The manuscript is written by two hands, both writing in court hand.Schmidt 108–109. Chaucer's authorship Price offered five points as indicators of Chaucerian authorship: #Style and scientific treatment of the material are similar to A Treatise on the Astrolabe; #The text mentions that the year 1392 is the \\"Radix\\" (or \\"root\\") of Chaucer; #The main hand (including that of the \\"Radix\\" note) resembles a document likely written in Chaucer's hand; #Linguistic similarities between the Equatorie and Chaucer's work, including \\"verbal echoes of the Astrolabe; #The author is influenced by Merton's school of astronomy but lives in London, and the writing is that of an amateur, not a professional astronomer; in addition, the writer is familiar with \\"the diplomatic cipher methods of his time\\"—all elements that correspond with Chaucer's biography. Following the publication of the facsimile and transcription, G. Herdan published an article in which he concluded, based upon the percentage of words in the Equatorie of \\"Romance vocabulary\\" (which includes words from Old French, Anglo-Norman French, and Latin), that Chaucer was indeed the author: \\"The agreement between observation and expectation, or between fact and theory, is so striking that without going further into the question of statistical significance we may conclude that by the token of Romance vocabulary the Equatorie is to be regarded as a work by Chaucer\\". \\"Radix chaucer\\" On f. 5v, in a note on a page full of tables, the manuscript has the number \\"1392\\", followed by that number in sexagesimal notation, and the text \\"deffea xpi & Rxa chaucer\\". Price, and following him other scholars, expanded this as \\"differentia Christi and radix Chaucer\\"—or \\"the difference (in number of days) between (the year of Christ) and the (year of the) radix of Chaucer\\"—the radix in question then being the year 1392.Schmidt 4–5. Fred Norris Robinson was not at all convinced that this (third-person) reference indicated Chaucer's authorship.Schmidt 8–9. Content Equatorium indicating the orbit of Saturn, 1551. The text describes the construction of an equatorium, an instrument similar to the astrolabe—but where an astrolabe calculates the positions of the stars, an equatorium does that for the planets, according to the Geocentric model of Ptolemy. The instrument is constructed from two discs, six feet in diameter. One of them is solid, and is marked with characteristics of the orbits of the various planets: their apogee, their equants, and other centers. The other disc consists of \\"a ring, a diametral bar, and a rule pivoted at the centre of the bar\\". The two discs are joined and simulate the motions of each of the planets. A divided circle around the rims of the two discs allow for the transferral of information from sets of tables (the Alfonsine tables, from a Parisian document) that contain the data for each planet. Cipher A cipher is used for some comments on the tables, and Price gave the key. He could not, however, discern what the rationale of or the ordering behind the key was—whether it was perhaps based on some medieval version of the Greek alphabet, or whether there was \\"some key-phrase or sentence such as a name or family motto\\" behind it.

The museum features a scale model replica of Noah's Ark, its goal is to promote young earth creationism and disprove evolution. Recorded over a four-year period, the film catalogs the project from conception to completion and beyond. According to its directors, Monica Long-Ross and Clayton Brown, the goal of the film is “to spark an important dialogue about the thorny intersection of belief, religion, and science — crossing into the cultural bubbles where so many Americans seem to exist.\\" Their goal is not to convert creationists. They go on to say, “We hope that the film can shine a light on the important science and religion conflicts that we face today, including the increasing incidents of science denial, and what the erosion of the separation of church and state means for America, as well as across the world.” The title of the film is a reference to the Ark Encounter's attempt to blend religious beliefs with science. The museum argues that dinosaurs existed alongside all modern animals including humans, but perished during the flood narrated in the Bible. The prevalence of dinosaur-based displays also attracts younger attendees, who are the prime target for religious instruction. 1091 Media has acquired North American distribution rights to the film. Synopsis The Ark replica, dubbed Ark Encounter, is a project of the apologetics ministry Answers in Genesis. The movie follows the construction of the replica largely through the eyes of three individuals: Doug Henderson, the head designer, is a biblical literalist and develops lifelike animals to populate the Ark; David MacMillan is a former creationist (and a charter member of the parent Creation Museum) who now tries to convince creationists that modern science is compatible with religion; and geologist Dan Phelps, who fights against the \\"non-science\\" promulgated by the Ark Encounter. Phelps is joined by a local pastor, Chris Caldwell, in protesting tax incentives granted to the Ark Encounter. Opening day attracted protests by Tri-State Freethinkers, led by Jim Helton, and a counter-protest organized by the creationist Eric Hovind. Williamstown residents hoped that the Ark Encounter will stimulate their economy, and over 1 million people visited the Ark Encounter in its first year, but it did little for the town. Indeed, near the end of the film, we see that Megan McCamey's general store, which had been featured earlier, is now closed.

In May 1929, his statement against his comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar and Shivaram Rajguru, in the Lahore Conspiracy Case trial, became \\"crucial\\" in leading to passing of their death sentence as a result of which Singh, Thapar and Rajguru became heroes of the Indian independence movement. After the trial, Vohra pursued a career in journalism, first in London, and then subsequently in Lahore and later in Washington. Before he died, he addressed a letter to Sukhdev's brother, explaining why he testified against his comrades.  Early life and education Hans Raj Vohra was born in 1909. His father was Guranditta Mal, a professor of mathematics at Lahore's Central Training College. Against the wishes of his father, Vohra became a trusted colleague and follower of the leading revolutionaries Sukhdev Thapar and Bhagat Singh. He was subsequently inducted into the Hindustan Socialist Republican Army and became a revolutionary organiser primarily arranging the distribution of leaflets and literature, in Punjab Province in the 1920s. Towards the end of the 1920s, as a student of the Forman Christian College\\"Chapter II. Naujawan Bharat Sabha and HSRA\\". Shodhganga. p. 95. and a member of the Lahore Student's Union, he became active in the student movement, recruiting to the Naujawan Bharat Sabha.Chandra, Ram. Lahore conspiracy case Bhagat Singh's execution as reported in The Tribune of Lahore. Vohra came to be in police custody for 17 days following his arrest on 17 December 1928, the same day as the murder of John Saunders, the assistant superintendent mistaken for James Scott.Nayar, Kuldip, (2000). The Martyr: Bhagat Singh Experiments in Revolution. New Delhi: Har-Anand Publications. pp.111-114. Bhagat Singh was later arrested on 8 April 1929 after he was found bombing the Delhi Legislative Assembly. Although not directly involved with the bombing, Vohra, then working in the offices of Bande Mataram , knew of its details through Sukhdev, and after his second arrest in May 1929, closed his testimony and \\"tendered pardon, the conditions of which I accepted\\". The testimony was subsequently used in the Lahore Conspiracy Case trial which began in July 1929. In May 1930, he gave evidence in the trial which gave its judgement on 7 October 1930, sentencing \\"[Bhagat] Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru to death by hanging\\". It was not until the 1980s that Vohra made an attempt to explain why he did not divulge his colleagues details during the first arrest but disclosed all at the second arrest in 1929 after he had been informed that his mentor Sukhdev had already given away all their secrets. Vohra claimed in the letter that he felt let down and decided \\"I could not risk going down with people I no longer respected\\". Author Kuldip Nayar explained in his book The Martyr: Bhagat Singh - Experiments in Revolution (2000), that in the Lahore Conspiracy Case Trial of 1929-30, Vohra's testimony \\"was crucial in the death sentence handed out to Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru - his ex- comrades\\".Nayar, Kuldip, (2000). The Martyr: Bhagat Singh Experiments in Revolution. New Delhi: Har-Anand Publications. pp.149. Two other significant approvers were Phoindra Nath Ghosh, whose testimony revolved mainly around the establishment of the Hindustan Socialist Party and Jai Gopal who focused on the murder of Saunders, while it was Vohra's testimony which concentrated on Bhagat Singh's activities. Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru subsequently became national heroes of the Indian independence movement.  Later life  Following the trial and the request to the British government by his father and acceptance by the Viceroy, Vohra was sponsored by the Punjab government to study at the London School of Economics. After a Masters in political science, he gained a degree in journalism from London University, returned to Lahore in 1936, was appointed Assistant Information Officer in the Bureau of Public Information in 1942, and was the correspondent of the Civil and Military Gazette of Lahore until 1948. In 1958, he transferred to Washington, corresponded using the name \\"Hans R. Vohra\\" and became the Washington correspondent of The Times of India. He remained a correspondent and never made it to editor. In 1965, as the Washington correspondent for the Times of India, his interview with Dean Rusk, the then United States Secretary of State, was published in the Department of State Bulletin. He retired in 1969, but continued to work freelance. In 1970, he published a paper in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists titled \\"India's Nuclear Policy of Three Negatives\\", where he described India's attitude to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as \\"will not sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty...will not not make nuclear weapons...will not accept any nuclear guarantees\\". Death He spent the last few years of life in social isolation. In 1981, before he died, he addressed a letter to Sukhdev's brother, explaining why he testified and expressed the wish to be forgotten: > Mine has been a most difficult life, full of risks, but so far touch wood, I > have emerged virtually unscathed, at least physically. But the memory of the > twenties accompanies me doggedly, teasingly and hauntingly….I hope by the > time I die, I would have been fully forgotten, This is my only ambition. He died on 13 September 1985 in Maryland. He was married and had three children and by them had six grandchildren.
